a branch (uk /brnt/ or uk /brnt/ us /brnt/) or tree branch (sometimes referred to in botany as a ramus) is a woody structural member connected to but not part of the central trunk of a tree (or sometimes a shrub) large branches are known as boughs and small branches are known as twigs
while branches can be nearly horizontal vertical or diagonal the majority of trees have upwardly diagonal branches
the term twig often refers to a terminus while bough refers only to branches coming directly from the trunk
== words ==
because of the enormous quantity of branches in the world there are a variety of names in english alone for them in general however unspecific words for a branch (such as rise and rame) have been replaced by the word branch itself
=== specific terms ===
a bough can also be called a limb or arm and though these are arguably metaphors both are widely accepted synonyms for bough
a crotch or fork is an area where a trunk splits into two or more boughs
a twig is frequently referred to as a sprig as well especially when it has been plucked other words for twig include branchlet spray and surcle as well as the technical terms surculus and ramulus
branches found under larger branches can be called underbranches
some branches from specific trees have their own names such as osiers and withes or withies which come from willows often trees have certain words which in english are naturally collocated such as holly and mistletoe which usually employ the phrase sprig of (as in a sprig of mistletoe") similarly the branch of a cherry tree is generally referred to as a cherry branch while other such formations (i.e. acacia branch or orange branch") carry no such alliance a good example of this versatility is oak which could be referred to as variously an oak branch an oaken branch a branch of oak or the branch of an oak [tree]
once a branch has been cut or in any other way removed from its source it is most commonly referred to as a stick and a stick employed for some purpose (such as walking spanking or beating) is often called a rod thin flexible sticks are called switches wands shrags or vimina (singular vimen)
