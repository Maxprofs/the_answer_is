== greenwich mean time ==
greenwich mean time (gmt) is a term originally referring to mean solar time at the royal observatory greenwich in greenwich it is commonly used in practice to refer to coordinated universal time (utc) when this is viewed as a time zone especially by bodies connected with the united kingdom such as the bbc world service the royal navy the met office and others although strictly utc is an atomic time scale which only approximates gmt with a tolerance of 0.9 second it is also used to refer to universal time (ut) which is a standard astronomical concept used in many technical fields and is referred to by the phrase zulu time
as the united kingdom grew into an advanced maritime nation british mariners kept at least one chronometer on gmt in order to calculate their longitude from the greenwich meridian which was by convention considered to have longitude zero degrees (this convention was internationally adopted in the international meridian conference of 1884) note that the synchronization of the chronometer on gmt did not affect shipboard time itself which was still solar time but this practice combined with mariners from other nations drawing from nevil maskelyne's method of lunar distances based on observations at greenwich eventually led to gmt being used worldwide as a reference time independent of location most time zones were based upon this reference as a number of hours and half-hours ahead of gmt or behind gmt
