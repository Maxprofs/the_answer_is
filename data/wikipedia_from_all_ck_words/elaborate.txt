== reviews ==
the new york times said the production at the off broadway second stage theatre has the delicious crackle and pop of a galloping honest-to-god all-american satire. the new york daily news called the same production flashy fleshy and ridiculously entertaining the los angeles times said the play leaps out of the proscenium frame at every opportunity exhorting drop-kicking and body-slamming its way into an immediacy that is more familiar to sporting events and rap concerts than to a traditional night of theater.
