the marathon is a long-distance running event with an official distance of 42.195 kilometres (26.21875 miles or 26 miles and 385 yards) usually run as a road race the event was instituted in commemoration of the fabled run of the greek soldier pheidippides a messenger from the battle of marathon to athens
the marathon was one of the original modern olympic events in 1896 though the distance did not become standardized until 1921 more than 500 marathons are held throughout the world each year with the vast majority of competitors being recreational athletes as larger marathons can have tens of thousands of participants
== history ==
=== origin ===
the name marathon comes from the legend of pheidippides a greek messenger the legend states that he was sent from the battlefield of marathon to athens to announce that the persians had been defeated in the battle of marathon (in which he had just fought) which took place in august or september 490 bc it is said that he ran the entire distance without stopping and burst into the assembly exclaiming (nenikekamen we have wn") before collapsing and dying the account of the run from marathon to athens first appears in plutarch's on the glory of athens in the 1st century ad which quotes from heraclides ponticus's lost work giving the runner's name as either thersipus of erchius or eucles lucian of samosata (2nd century ad) also gives the story but names the runner philippides (not pheidippides)
there is debate about the historical accuracy of this legend the greek historian herodotus the main source for the greco-persian wars mentions pheidippides as the messenger who ran from athens to sparta asking for help and then ran back a distance of over 240 kilometres (150 mi) each way in some herodotus manuscripts the name of the runner between athens and sparta is given as philippides herodotus makes no mention of a messenger sent from marathon to athens and relates that the main part of the athenian army having fought and won the grueling battle and fearing a naval raid by the persian fleet against an undefended athens marched quickly back from the battle to athens arriving the same day
in 1879 robert browning wrote the poem pheidippides browning's poem his composite story became part of late 19th century popular culture and was accepted as a historic legend
there are two roads out of the battlefield of marathon towards athens one more mountainous towards the north whose distance is about 34.5 km (21.4 mi) and another flatter but longer towards the south with a distance of 40.8 km (25.4 mi) it has been argued that the ancient runner took the more difficult northern road because at the time of the battle there were still persian soldiers in the south of the plain
mount penteli stands between marathon and athens which means that if pheidippides actually made his famous run after the battle he had to run around the mountain either to the north or to the south the latter and more obvious route matches almost exactly the modern marathon-athens highway which follows the lie of the land southwards from marathon bay and along the coast then takes a gentle but protracted climb westwards towards the eastern approach to athens between the foothills of mounts hymettus and penteli and then gently downhill to athens proper this route as it existed when the olympics were revived in 1896 was approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) long and this was the approximate distance originally used for marathon races however there have been suggestions that pheidippides might have followed another route a westward climb along the eastern and northern slopes of mount penteli to the pass of dionysos and then a straight southward downhill path to athens this route is considerably shorter some 35 kilometres (22 mi) but includes a very steep initial climb of more than 5 kilometres (3.1 mi)
=== modern olympics marathon ===
when the modern olympics began in 1896 the initiators and organizers were looking for a great popularizing event recalling the ancient glory of greece the idea of a marathon race came from michel bral who wanted the event to feature in the first modern olympic games in 1896 in athens this idea was heavily supported by pierre de coubertin the founder of the modern olympics as well as by the greeks the greeks staged a selection race for the olympic marathon on 10 march 1896 that was won by charilaos vasilakos in 3 hours and 18 minutes (with the future winner of the introductory olympic games marathon spyridon spyros louis coming in fifth) the winner of the first olympic marathon on 10 april 1896 (a male-only race) was spyridon louis a greek water-carrier in 2 hours 58 minutes and 50 seconds the marathon of the 2004 summer olympics was run on the traditional route from marathon to athens ending at panathinaiko stadium the venue for the 1896 summer olympics that men's marathon was won by italian stefano baldini in 2 hours 10 minutes and 55 seconds a record time for this route until the non-olympics athens classic marathon of 2014 when felix kandie lowered the course record to 2 hours 10 minutes and 37 seconds
the women's marathon was introduced at the 1984 summer olympics (los angeles usa) and was won by joan benoit of the united states with a time of 2 hours 24 minutes and 52 seconds
since the modern games were founded it has become a tradition for the men's olympic marathon to be the last event of the athletics calendar with a finish inside the olympic stadium often within hours of or even incorporated into the closing ceremonies
the olympic men's record is 2:06:32 set at the 2008 summer olympics by samuel kamau wanjiru of kenya (average speed about 20.01 kilometres per hour or 12.43 miles per hour) the olympic women's record is 2:23:07 set at the 2012 summer olympics by tiki gelana of ethiopia the men's london 2012 summer olympic marathon winner was stephen kiprotich of uganda (2:08:01) per capita the kalenjin ethnic group of rift valley province in kenya has produced a highly disproportionate share of marathon and track-and-field winners
=== marathon mania ===
johnny hayes victory at the 1908 summer olympics contributed to the early growth of long-distance running and marathoning in the united states later that year races around the holiday season including the empire city marathon held on new year's day 1909 in yonkers new york marked the early running craze referred to as marathon mania following the 1908 olympics the first five amateur marathons in new york city were held on days that held special meanings to ethnic communities thanksgiving day the day after christmas new year's day washington's birthday and lincoln's birthday
frank shorter's victory in the marathon at the 1972 summer olympics would spur national enthusiasm for the sport more intense than that which followed hayes win 64 years earlier by 2009 an estimated 467,000 runners completed a marathon within the united states this can be compared to 143,000 in 1980 nowadays various marathons are held all around the world on a nearly weekly basis
=== inclusion of women ===
for a long time after the olympic marathon started there were no long-distance races such as the marathon for women although a few women had run the marathon distance they were not included in any official results marie-louise ledru has been credited as the first woman to race a marathon violet piercy has been credited as the first woman to be officially timed in a marathon arlene pieper became the first woman to officially finish a marathon in the united states when she completed the pikes peak marathon in manitou springs colorado in 1959 katherine switzer was the first woman to run the boston marathon officially (with a number) however switzer's entry which was accepted through an oversight in the screening process was in flagrant violation of the rules and she was treated as an interloper once the error was discovered bobbi gibb had completed the boston race unofficially the previous year (1966) and was later recognized by the race organizers as the women's winner for that year as well as 1967 and 1968 in 2015 afghanistan held its first marathon among those who ran the entire marathon was one woman zainab age 25 who thus became the first afghan woman to run in a marathon within her own country
== distance ==
the length of an olympic marathon was not precisely fixed at first but the marathon races in the first few olympic games were about 40 kilometres (25 mi) roughly the distance from marathon to athens by the longer flatter route the exact length depended on the route established for each venue
=== 1908 olympics ===
the international olympic committee agreed in 1907 that the distance for the 1908 london olympic marathon would be about 25 miles or 40 kilometres the organisers decided on a course of 26 miles from the start at windsor castle to the royal entrance to the white city stadium followed by a lap (586 yards 2 feet 536 m) of the track finishing in front of the royal box the course was later altered to use a different entrance to the stadium followed by a partial lap of 385 yards to the same finish
the modern 42.195 km standard distance for the marathon was set by the international amateur athletic federation (iaaf) in may 1921 directly from the length used at the 1908 summer olympics in london
=== iaaf and world records ===
an official iaaf marathon course is 42.195 km (42 m tolerance only in excess) course officials add a short course prevention factor of up to one metre per kilometre to their measurements to reduce the risk of a measuring error producing a length below the minimum distance
for events governed by iaaf rules it is mandatory that the route be marked so that all competitors can see the distance covered in kilometres the rules make no mention of the use of miles the iaaf will only recognise world records that are established at events that are run under iaaf rules for major events it is customary to publish competitors timings at the midway mark and also at 5 km splits marathon runners can be credited with world records for lesser distances recognised by the iaaf (such as 20 km 30 km and so on) if such records are established while the runner is running a marathon and completes the marathon course
== marathon races ==
annually more than 500 marathons are organized worldwide some of these belong to the association of international marathons and distance races (aims) which has grown since its foundation in 1982 to embrace over 300 member events in 83 countries and territories the marathons of berlin boston chicago london new york city and tokyo form the biennial world marathon majors series awarding $500,000 annually to the best overall male and female performers in the series
in 2006 the editors of runner's world selected a world's top 10 marathons in which the amsterdam honolulu paris rotterdam and stockholm marathons were featured along with the five original world marathon majors events (excluding tokyo) other notable large marathons include united states marine corps marathon los angeles and rome the boston marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon inspired by the success of the 1896 olympic marathon and held every year since 1897 to celebrate patriots day a holiday marking the beginning of the american revolution thereby purposely linking athenian and american struggle for democracy the oldest annual marathon in europe is the koice peace marathon held since 1924 in koice slovakia the historic polytechnic marathon was discontinued in 1996 the athens classic marathon traces the route of the 1896 olympic course starting in marathon on the eastern coast of attica site of the battle of marathon of 490 b.c.e. and ending at the panathenaic stadium in athens
the midnight sun marathon is held in troms norway at 70 degrees north using unofficial and temporary courses measured by gps races of marathon distance are now held at the north pole in antarctica and over desert terrain other unusual marathons include the great wall marathon on the great wall of china the big five marathon among the safari wildlife of south africa the great tibetan marathon a marathon in an atmosphere of tibetan buddhism at an altitude of 3,500 metres (11,500 ft) and the polar circle marathon on the permanent ice cap of greenland
the intercontinental istanbul eurasia marathon is the only marathon where participants run over two continents (europe and asia) during the course of a single event in the detroit free press marathon participants cross the us/canadian border twice the niagara falls international marathon includes one international border crossing via the peace bridge from buffalo new york united states to fort erie ontario canada
=== wheelchair division ===
many marathons feature a wheelchair division typically those in the wheelchair racing division start their races earlier than their running counterparts
the first wheelchair marathon was in 1974 in toledo ohio won by bob hall in 2:54 hall competed in the 1975 boston marathon and finished in 2:58 inaugurating the introduction of wheelchair divisions into the boston marathon from 1977 the race was declared the us national wheelchair championship the boston marathon awards $10,000 to the winning push-rim athlete ernst van dyk has won the boston marathon wheelchair division ten times and holds the world record at 1:18:27 set in boston in 2004 jean driscoll won eight times (seven consecutively) and holds the women's world record at 1:34:22
the new york city marathon banned wheelchair entrants in 1977 citing safety concerns but then voluntarily allowed bob hall to compete after the state division of human rights ordered the marathon to show cause the division ruled in 1979 that the new york city marathon and new york road runners club had to allow wheelchair athletes to compete and confirmed this at appeal in 1980 but the state supreme court ruled in 1981 that a ban on wheelchair racers was not discriminatory as the marathon was historically a foot race however by 1986 14 wheelchair athletes were competing and an official wheelchair division was added to the marathon in 2000
== statistics ==
=== world records and world's best ===
world records were not officially recognized by the iaaf until 1 january 2004 previously the best times for the marathon were referred to as the world best courses must conform to iaaf standards for a record to be recognized however marathon routes still vary greatly in elevation course and surface making exact comparisons impossible typically the fastest times are set over relatively flat courses near sea level during good weather conditions and with the assistance of pacesetters
the current world record time for men over the distance is 2 hours 2 minutes and 57 seconds set in the berlin marathon by dennis kimetto of kenya on 28 september 2014 an improvement of 26 seconds over the previous record also set in the berlin marathon by wilson kipsang also of kenya on 29 september 2013 the world record for women was set by paula radcliffe of great britain in the london marathon on 13 april 2003 in 2 hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds
=== all-time top ten athletes ===
according to the iaaf the following men and women are among the top ten fastest at the marathon distance (updated september 2015)
=== oldest marathoner ===
fauja singh 100 finished the toronto waterfront marathon becoming the first centenarian ever to officially complete that distance singh a british citizen finished the race on 16 october 2011 with a time of 8:11:05.9 making him the oldest marathoner because singh could not produce a birth certificate from rural 1911 colonial india the place of his birth his age could not be verified and his record was not accepted by the official governing body world masters athletics
gladys burrill a 92-year-old british woman and part-time resident of hawaii previously held the guinness world records title of oldest person to complete a marathon with her 9 hours 53 minutes performance at the 2010 honolulu marathon the records of the association of road racing statisticians at that time however suggested that singh was overall the oldest marathoner completing the 2004 london marathon at the age of 93 years and 17 days and that burrill was the oldest female marathoner completing the 2010 honolulu marathon at the age of 92 years and 19 days singh's age was also reported to be 93 by other sources
in 2015 92-yr-old harriette thompson of charlotte north carolina completed the rock n roll san diego marathon in 7 hours 24 minutes 36 seconds thus becoming the oldest woman to complete a marathon while gladys burrill was 92 years and 19 days old when she completed her record-setting marathon harriette thompson was 92 years and 65 days old when she completed hers
=== youngest marathoner ===
budhia singh a boy from odisha india completed his first marathon at age three he trained under the coach biranchi das who saw potential in him in may 2006 budhia was temporarily banned from running by the ministers of child welfare as his life could be at risk his coach was also arrested for exploiting and being cruel to the child budhia is now at a state-run sports academy
=== participation ===
in 2011 running usa reported that there were approximately 518,000 marathon finishers in the united states while other sources reported around 550,000 finishers
=== multiple marathons ===
as marathon running has become more popular some athletes have undertaken challenges involving running a series of marathons
the 100 marathon club is intended to provide a focal point for all runners particularly from the united kingdom or ireland who have completed 100 or more races of marathon distance or longer at least 10 of these events must be united kingdom or ireland road marathons club chairman roger biggs has run more than 700 marathons or ultras brian mills completed his 800th marathon on 17 september 2011
steve edwards a member of the 100 marathon club set the world record for running 500 marathons in the fastest average finish time of 3 hours 15 minutes at the same time becoming the first man to run 500 marathons with an official time below 3 hours 30 minutes on 11 november 2012 at milton keynes england the records took 24 years to achieve edwards was 49 at the time
over 350 individuals have completed a marathon in each state of the united states plus washington d.c and some have done it as many as eight times beverly paquin a 22-year-old nurse from iowa was the youngest woman to run a marathon in all 50 states in 2010 a few weeks later still in 2010 morgan cummings (also 22) became the youngest woman to complete a marathon in all 50 states and dc in 2004 chuck bryant of miami florida who lost his right leg below the knee became the first amputee to finish this circuit bryant has completed a total of 59 marathons on his prosthesis twenty-seven people have run a marathon on each of the seven continents and 31 people have run a marathon in each of the canadian provinces in 1980 in what was termed the marathon of hope terry fox who had lost a leg to cancer and so ran with one artificial leg attained 5,373 kilometres (3,339 mi) of his proposed cross-canada cancer fundraising run maintaining an average of over 37 kilometres (23 mi) close to the planned marathon distance for each of 143 consecutive days
on 25 september 2011 patrick finney of grapevine texas became the first person with multiple sclerosis to finish a marathon in each state of the united states in 2004 the disease had left him unable to walk but unwilling to endure a life of infirmity finney managed to regain his ability to balance on two feet to walk and eventually to run through extensive rehabilitation therapy and new medications.
in 2003 british adventurer sir ranulph fiennes completed seven marathons on seven continents in seven days he completed this feat despite suffering from a heart attack and undergoing a double heart bypass operation just four months before this feat has since been eclipsed by irish ultramarathon runner richard donovan who in 2009 completed seven marathons on seven continents in under 132 hours (five and a half days) starting 1 february 2012 he improved on this by completing the 7 on 7 in under 120 hours or in less than five days
on 30 november 2013 69-year-old larry macon set a guinness world record for most marathons run in a year by man by running 238 marathons larry macon celebrated his 1,000th career marathon at the cowtown marathon in ft worth on 24 february 2013
other goals are to attempt to run marathons on a series of consecutive weekends (richard worley on 159 weekends) or to run the most marathons during a particular year or the most in a lifetime a pioneer in running multiple marathons was sy mah of toledo ohio who ran 524 before he died in 1988 as of 30 june 2007 horst preisler of germany had successfully completed 1214 marathons plus 347 ultramarathons a total of 1561 events at marathon distance or longer sigrid eichner christian hottas and hans-joachim meyer have also all completed over 1000 marathons each norm frank of the united states is credited with 945 marathons
christian hottas is meanwhile the first runner who ever completed 2000 marathons he ran his 2000th at tui marathon hannover on 5 may 2013 together with a group of more than 80 friends from 11 countries including 8 officers from the 100 marathons clubs u.k. north-america germany denmark austria and italy
in 2010 stefaan engels a belgian set out to run the marathon distance every day of the year because of an injury he had to resort to a handbike near the end of january 2010 however on 5 february he was fully recovered and decided to reset the counter back to zero on 30 march he broke the existing record of akinori kusuda from japan who completed 52 marathons in a row in 2009 as of 5 february 2011 engels had run 365 marathon distances in as many days ricardo abad martnez from spain later ran 150 marathons in 150 consecutive days in 2009 and subsequently 500 marathons in a row from october 2010 to february 2012
in 2014 amy hughes from england ran 53 marathons in 53 days thus setting the record for the most marathons run on consecutive days by any person male or female
some runners compete to run the same marathons for the most consecutive years for example johnny kelley completed 61 boston marathons currently the longest consecutive streak of boston marathon finishes45 in a rowis held by bennett beach of bethesda maryland

== running ==
most participants do not run a marathon to win more important for most runners is their personal finish time and their placement within their specific gender and age group though some runners just want to finish strategies for completing a marathon include running the whole distance and a runwalk strategy in 2005 the average marathon time in the u.s was 4 hours 32 minutes 8 seconds for men 5 hours 6 minutes 8 seconds for women
a goal many runners aim for is to break certain time barriers for example recreational first-timers often try to run the marathon under four hours more competitive runners may attempt to finish under three hours other benchmarks are the qualifying times for major marathons the boston marathon the oldest marathon in the united states requires a qualifying time for all non-professional runners the new york city marathon also requires a qualifying time for guaranteed entry at a significantly faster pace than boston's
typically there is a maximum allowed time of about six hours after which the marathon route is closed although some larger marathons keep the course open considerably longer (eight hours or more) many marathons around the world have such time limits by which all runners must have crossed the finish line anyone slower than the limit will be picked up by a sweeper bus in many cases the marathon organizers are required to reopen the roads to the public so that traffic can return to normal
with the growth in popularity of marathoning many marathons across the united states and the world have been filling to capacity faster than ever before when the boston marathon opened up registration for its 2011 running the field capacity was filled within eight hours
=== training ===
the long run is an important element in marathon training recreational runners commonly try to reach a maximum of about 32 km (20 mi) in their longest weekly run and a total of about 64 km (40 mi) a week when training for the marathon but wide variability exists in practice and in recommendations more experienced marathoners may run a longer distance during the week greater weekly training mileages can offer greater results in terms of distance and endurance but also carry a greater risk of training injury most male elite marathon runners will have weekly mileages of over 160 km (100 mi) it is recommended that those new to running should get a checkup from their doctor as there are certain warning signs and risk factors that should be evaluated before undertaking any new workout program especially marathon training
many training programs last a minimum of five or six months with a gradual increase in the distance run and finally for recovery a period of tapering in the weeks preceding the race for beginners wishing to merely finish a marathon a minimum of four months of running four days a week is recommended many trainers recommend a weekly increase in mileage of no more than 10% it is also often advised to maintain a consistent running program for six weeks or so before beginning a marathon training program to allow the body to adapt to the new stresses the marathon training program itself would suppose variation between hard and easy training with a periodization of the general plan
training programs can be found at the websites of runner's world hal higdon jeff galloway and the boston athletic association and in numerous other published sources including the websites of specific marathons
the last long training run might be undertaken up to two weeks prior to the event many marathon runners also carbo-load (increase carbohydrate intake while holding total caloric intake constant) during the week before the marathon to allow their bodies to store more glycogen
=== glycogen and the wall ===
carbohydrates that a person eats are converted by the liver and muscles into glycogen for storage glycogen burns rapidly to provide quick energy runners can store about 8 mj or 2,000 kcal worth of glycogen in their bodies enough for about 30 km/1820 miles of running many runners report that running becomes noticeably more difficult at that point when glycogen runs low the body must then obtain energy by burning stored fat which does not burn as readily when this happens the runner will experience dramatic fatigue and is said to hit the wall the aim of training for the marathon according to many coaches is to maximize the limited glycogen available so that the fatigue of the wall is not as dramatic this is accomplished in part by utilizing a higher percentage of energy from burned fat even during the early phase of the race thus conserving glycogen
carbohydrate-based energy gels are used by runners to avoid or reduce the effect of hitting the wall as they provide easy to digest energy during the run energy gels usually contain varying amounts of sodium and potassium and some also contain caffeine they need to be consumed with a certain amount of water recommendations for how often to take an energy gel during the race range widely
alternatives to gels include various forms of concentrated sugars and foods high in simple carbohydrates that can be digested easily many runners experiment with consuming energy supplements during training runs to determine what works best for them consumption of food while running sometimes makes the runner sick runners are advised not to ingest a new food or medicine just prior to or during a race it is also important to refrain from taking any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory class of pain relievers (nsaids e.g. aspirin ibuprofen naproxen) as these drugs may change the way the kidneys regulate their blood flow and may lead to serious kidney problems especially in cases involving moderate to severe dehydration nsaids block the cox-2 enzyme pathway to prevent the production of prostaglandins these prostaglandins may act as inflammation factors throughout the body but they also play a crucial role in maintenance of water retention in less than 5% of the whole population that take nsaids individuals may be more negatively sensitive to renal prostaglandin synthesis inhibition
=== after a marathon ===
marathon participation may result in various medical musculoskeletal and dermatological complaints delayed onset muscle soreness (doms) is a common condition affecting runners during the first week following a marathon various types of mild exercise or massage have been recommended to alleviate pain secondary to doms dermatological issues frequently include jogger's nipple jogger's toe and blisters
the immune system is reportedly suppressed for a short time changes to the blood chemistry may lead physicians to mistakenly diagnose heart malfunction
after long training runs and the marathon itself consuming carbohydrates to replace glycogen stores and protein to aid muscle recovery is commonly recommended in addition soaking the lower half of the body for approximately 20 minutes in cold or ice water may force blood through the leg muscles to speed recovery
== health risks ==
marathon running has various health risks training and the races themselves put runners under stress while rare even death is a possibility during a race
common health risks include injury such as tendonitis fatigue knee or ankle sprain extreme dehydration (electrolyte imbalance) and other conditions many are categorised as overuse injuries
=== cardiac health ===
a study published in 1996 found that the risk of a fatal heart attack during or up to 24 hours after a marathon was approximately 1 in 50,000 over an athlete's racing careerwhich the authors characterised as an extremely small risk the paper went on to say that since the risk was so small cardiac screening programs for marathons were not warranted however this study was not an attempt to assess the overall benefit or risk to cardiac health of marathon running
in 2006 a study of 60 non-elite marathon participants tested runners for certain proteins (see troponin) which indicate heart damage or dysfunction after they had completed the marathon and gave them ultrasound scans before and after the race the study revealed that in that sample of 60 people runners who had done less than 56 km (35 mi) per week of training before the race were most likely to show some heart damage or dysfunction while runners who had done more than 72 km (45 mi) per week of training beforehand showed few or no heart problems
according to a study presented in 2010 running a marathon can result in decreased function of more than half the segments in the heart's main pumping chamber but other parts of the heart will take over full recovery is reached within three months or less the fitter the runner the less the effect
=== water consumption dangers ===
overconsumption is the most significant concern associated with water consumption during marathons drinking excessive amounts of fluid during a race can lead to dilution of sodium in the blood a condition called exercise-associated hyponatremia which may result in vomiting seizures coma and even death dr lewis g maharam medical director for the new york city marathon has stated there are no reported cases of dehydration causing death in the history of world running but there are plenty of cases of people dying of hyponatremia.
for example dr cynthia lucero died at the age of 28 while participating in the 2002 boston marathon it was lucero's second marathon at mile 22 lucero complained of feeling dehydrated and rubber-legged. she soon wobbled and collapsed to the ground and was unconscious by the time the paramedics reached her lucero was admitted to brigham and women's hospital and died two days later
lucero's cause of death was determined to be hyponatremic encephalopathy a condition that causes swelling of the brain due to an imbalance of sodium in the blood known as exercise-associated hyponatremia (eah) while eah is sometimes referred to as water intoxication, lucero drank large amounts of gatorade during the race demonstrating that runners who consume sodium-containing sports drinks in excess of thirst can still develop eah because hyponatremia is caused by excessive water retention and not just loss of sodium consumption of sports drinks or salty foods may not prevent hyponatremia
women are more prone to hyponatremia than men a study in the new england journal of medicine found that 13% of runners completing the 2002 boston marathon had hyponatremia
fluid intake should be adjusted individually as factors such as body weight sex climate pace fitness (vo2 max) and sweat rate are just a few variables that change fluid requirements between people and races the international marathon medical directors association (immda) advises that runners drink a sports drink that includes carbohydrates and electrolytes instead of plain water and that runners should drink to thirst instead of feeling compelled to drink at every fluid station heat exposure leads to diminished thirst drive and thirst may not be a sufficient incentive to drink in many situations the immda and hsl harpur hill give recommendations to drink fluid in small volumes frequently at an approximate rate falling between 100250 ml (3.48.5 us fl oz) every 15 minutes a patient suffering hyponatremia can be given a small volume of a concentrated salt solution intravenously to raise sodium concentrations in the blood some runners weigh themselves before running and write the results on their bibs if anything goes wrong first aid workers can use the weight information to tell if the patient had consumed too much water
== charity involvement ==
some charities seek to associate with various races some marathon organizers set aside a portion their limited entry slots for charity organizations to sell to members in exchange for donations runners are given the option to sign up to run particular races especially when marathon entries are no longer available to the general public
in some cases charities organize their own marathon as a fund-raiser (gaining funds via entry fees or through sponsorships)
