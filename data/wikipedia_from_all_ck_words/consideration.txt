consideration is the concept of legal value in connection with contracts it is anything of value promised to another when making a contract it can take the form of money physical objects services promised actions abstinence from a future action and much more consideration to create a legally enforceable contract entails a bargained for legal detriment incurred by the promisee or a legal benefit to the promisor under the notion of pre-existing duties if either the promisor or the promisee already had a legal obligation to render such payment it cannot be seen as consideration in the legal sense
in common law it is a prerequisite that both parties offer consideration before a contract can be thought of as binding the doctrine of consideration is irrelevant in many jurisdictions although contemporary commercial litigant relations have held the relationship between a promise and a deed is a reflection of the nature of contractual considerations if there is no element of consideration found there is thus no contract formed
however even if a court decides there is no contract there might be a possible recovery under quantum meruit (sometimes referred to as a quasi-contract) or promissory estoppel
if a signs a contract to buy a car from b for $5,000 a's consideration is the $5,000 and b's consideration is the car
additionally if a signs a contract with b such that a will paint b's house for $500 a's consideration is the service of painting b's house and b's consideration is $500 paid to a
further if a signs a contract with b such that a will not repaint his own house in any other color than white and b will pay a $500 per year to keep this deal up there is also consideration although a did not promise to affirmatively do anything a did promise not to do something that he was allowed to do and so a did pass consideration a's consideration to b is the forbearance in painting his own house in a color other than white and b's consideration to a is $500 per year
conversely if a signs a contract to buy a car from b for $0 b's consideration is still the car but a is giving no consideration and so there is no valid contract however if b still gives the title to the car to a then b cannot take the car back since while it may not be a valid contract it is a valid gift
there are a number of common issues as to whether consideration exists in a contract
== history and comparative law ==
roman law-based systems (including scotland) do not require consideration and some commentators consider it unnecessary and have suggested that consideration be abandoned and estoppel be used to replace it as a basis for contracts however legislation rather than judicial development has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine lord justice denning famously stated that the doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind.
the reason that both exist in common law jurisdictions is thought by leading scholars to be the result of the combining by 19th century judges of two distinct threads first the consideration requirement was at the heart of the action of assumpsit which had grown up in the middle ages and remained the normal action for breach of a simple contract in england & wales until 1884 when the old forms of action were abolished secondly the notion of agreement between two or more parties as being the essential legal and moral foundation of contract in all legal systems promoted by the 18th century french writer pothier in his traite des obligations much read (especially after translation into english in 1805) by english judges and jurists the latter chimed well with the fashionable will theories of the time especially john stuart mill's influential ideas on free will and got grafted on to the traditional common law requirement for consideration to ground an action in assumpsit
civil law systems take the approach that an exchange of promises or a concurrence of wills alone rather than an exchange in valuable rights is the correct basis so if you promised to give me a book and i accepted your offer without giving anything in return i would have a legal right to the book and you could not change your mind about giving me it as a gift however in common law systems the concept of culpa in contrahendo a form of estoppel is increasingly used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations estoppel is an equitable doctrine that provides for the creation of legal obligations if a party has given another an assurance and the other has relied on the assurance to his detriment
== monetary value of consideration ==
generally courts do not inquire whether the deal between two parties was monetarily fairmerely that each party passed some legal obligation or duty to the other party the dispositive issue is presence of consideration not adequacy of the consideration the values between consideration passed by each party to a contract need not be comparable
for instance if a offers b $200 to buy b's mansion luxury sports car and private jet there is still consideration on both sides a's consideration is $200 and b's consideration is the mansion car and jet courts in the united states generally leave parties to their own contracts and do not intervene the old english rule of consideration questioned whether a party gave the value of a peppercorn to the other party as a result contracts in the united states have sometimes have had one party pass nominal amounts of consideration typically citing $1 thus licensing contracts that do not involve any money at all will often cite as consideration for the sum of $1 and other good and valuable consideration
however some courts in the united states may take issue with nominal consideration or consideration with virtually no value some courts have since thought this was a sham since contract disputes are typically resolved in state court some state courts have found that merely providing $1 to another is not a sufficiently legal duty and therefore no legal consideration passes in these kinds of deals and consequently no contract is formed however this is a minority position supreme court of texas (1464-eight ltd & millis management corp v gail ann joppich see section iii)
== pre-existing legal duties ==
a party which already has a legal duty to provide money an object a service or a forbearance does not provide consideration when promising merely to uphold that duty that legal duty can arise from law or obligation under a previous contract
the prime example of this sub-issue is where an uncle gives his seven-year-old nephew (a resident of the us) the following offer if you do not smoke cigarettes or marijuana until your 18th birthday then i will pay you $500 (assuming it is a criminal offense in the us for people under the age of 18 to smoke cigarettes and for people of any age to smoke marijuana) on the nephew's 18th birthday he tells the uncle to pay up and the uncle says no in the subsequent lawsuit the uncle will win because the nephew by u.s law already had a duty to refrain from smoking cigarettes or marijuana
the same applies if the consideration is a performance for which the parties had previously contracted for example a agrees to paint b's house for $500 but halfway through the job a tells b that he will not finish unless b increases the payment to $750 if b agrees and a then finishes the job b still only needs to pay a the $500 originally agreed to because a was already contractually obligated to paint the house for that amount
an exception to this rule holds for settlements such as an accord and satisfaction if a creditor has a credit against a debtor for $10,000 and offers to settle it for $5,000 it is still binding if accepted even though the debtor had a legal duty to repay the entire $10,000
pre-existing duties relating to at-will employment depend largely on state law generally at-will employment allows the employer to terminate the employee for good or even no reason and allows the employee to resign for any reason there are no duties of continued employment in the future therefore when an employee demands a raise there is no issue with consideration because the employee has no legal duty to continue working similarly when an employer demands a pay-cut there is also no contractual issue with consideration because the employer has no legal duty to continue employing the worker however certain states require additional consideration other than the prospect of continued employment to enforce terms demanded later by the employer in particular non-competition clauses
== bundled terms ==
contracts where a legally valueless term is bundled with a term that does have legal value are still generally enforceable
consider the uncle's situation above if the same uncle had instead told his 17-year-old nephew the following offer if you do not smoke cigarettes and do not engage females before your 18th birthday then i will pay you $500 on the nephew's 18th birthday he asks the uncle to pay up and this time in the subsequent lawsuit the nephew may win although the promise of not smoking was not valuable consideration (it was already legally prohibited) virtually all states allow some sort of engagement by minors even though the engagement by minors is legally restricted there are circumstances where it is legal and thus the promise to forbear from it entirely has legal value however the uncle would still be relieved from the liability if his nephew smoked a cigarette even though that consideration is valueless because it was paired with something of legal value therefore adherence to the entire collective agreement is necessary
== past consideration ==
generally past consideration is not a valid consideration and has no legal value past consideration therefore cannot be used as a basis when claiming damages roscorla v thomas two exceptions to this rule include
where it was paid at the request of the offeror
where both parties had earlier on contemplated payment
== option contracts and conditional consideration ==
generally conditional consideration is valid consideration
suppose a is a movie script writer and b runs a movie production company a says to b buy my script. b says how about this i will pay you $5,000 so that you do not let anyone else produce your movie until one year from now if i do produce your movie in that year then i will give you another $50,000 and no one else can produce it if i do not produce your movie in that year then you're free to go. if the two subsequently get into a dispute the issue of whether a contract exists is answered b had an option contracthe could decide to produce the script or not b's consideration passed was the $5,000 down and the possibility of $50,000 a's consideration passed was the exclusive rights to the movie script for at least one year
== in settlements ==
suppose b commits a tort against a causing $5,000 in compensatory damages and $3,000 in punitive damages since there is no guarantee that a would win against b if it went to court a may agree to drop the case if b pays the $5,000 compensatory damages this is sufficient consideration since b's consideration is a guaranteed recovery and a's consideration is that b only has to pay $5,000 instead of $8,000
