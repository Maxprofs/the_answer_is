iterative expectationmaximization algorithms preferred method reconstruction algorithms compute estimate likely distribution annihilation events led measured data based statistical principles advantage better noise profile resistance streak artifacts common fbp disadvantage higher computer resource requirements

attenuationcorrected images generally faithful representations correction process susceptible significant artifacts result corrected uncorrected images always reconstructed read together
dd reconstruction early pet scanners single ring detectors hence acquisition data subsequent reconstruction restricted single transverse plane modern scanners include multiple rings essentially forming cylinder detectors
two approaches reconstructing data scanner treat ring separate entity coincidences within ring detected image ring reconstructed individually d reconstruction allow coincidences detected rings well within rings reconstruct entire volume together d
d techniques better sensitivity coincidences detected used therefore less noise sensitive effects scatter random coincidences well requiring correspondingly greater computer resources advent subnanosecond timing resolution detectors affords better random coincidence rejection thus favoring d image reconstruction
