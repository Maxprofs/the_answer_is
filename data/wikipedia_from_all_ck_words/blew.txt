blew was written in 1988 by nirvana front man kurt cobain the song was recorded in december 1988 and initially appeared as the first track on nirvana's 1989 debut album bleach blew remained one of the only songs from the bleach era that remained on nirvana's live setlist throughout their entire performance history all the way up until the band's final show on march 1st 1994 in munich germany where it was performed during the encore giving it the distinction of being the second to last song ever performed by the band in addition to the song blew the release also includes love buzz this mix of love buzz is the bleach version as opposed to the 7 sub pop singles version mix the version of been a son that was recorded for the ep is hailed as the definitive take of that song as it encompasses nirvana's thrashing signature sound as well as krist novoselic's bass guitar solo being much more pronounced in the mix stain features both dual vocal and dual guitar tracks
== release ==
blew was released in december 1989 on tupelo records on 12 vinyl and compact disc the extended play was originally intended to be released to promote an upcoming european tour but this plan was scrapped and the maxi-single ended up being released exclusively in the uk shortly after its completion
as blew was released only in the uk it was thus difficult to obtain elsewhere only 3,000 copies of the maxi-single were pressed on 12 vinyl and cd both vinyl and cd counterfeit copies exist of which the vinyl copies vary in colour (the official 12 vinyl was only pressed on black vinyl)
