dominance in genetics is a relationship between alleles of one gene in which the effect on phenotype of one allele masks the contribution of a second allele at the same locus the first allele is dominant and the second allele is recessive for genes on an autosome (any chromosome other than a sex chromosome) the alleles and their associated traits are autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive dominance is a key concept in mendelian inheritance and classical genetics often the dominant allele codes for a functional protein whereas the recessive allele does not
a classic example of dominance is the inheritance of seed shape for example a pea shape in peas peas may be round associated with allele r or wrinkled associated with allele r in this case three combinations of alleles (genotypes) are possible rr rr and rr the rr individuals have round peas and the rr individuals have wrinkled peas in rr individuals the r allele masks the presence of the r allele so these individuals also have round peas thus allele r is dominant to allele r and allele r is recessive to allele r this use of upper case letters for dominant alleles and lower case ones for recessive alleles is a widely followed convention
more generally where a gene exists in two allelic versions (designated a and a) three combinations of alleles are possible aa aa and aa if aa and aa individuals (homozygotes) show different forms of some trait (phenotypes) and aa individuals (heterozygotes) show the same phenotype as aa individuals then allele a is said to dominate or be dominant to or show dominance to allele a and a is said to be recessive to a
dominance is not inherent to an allele it is a relationship between alleles one allele can be dominant over a second allele recessive to a third allele and codominant to a fourth also an allele may be dominant for a particular aspect of phenotype but not for other aspects influenced by the same gene dominance differs from epistasis a relationship in which an allele of one gene affects the expression of another allele at a different gene
== background ==
the concept of dominance was introduced by gregor mendel though mendel the father of genetics first used the term in the 1860s it was not widely known until the early twentieth century mendel observed that for a variety of traits of garden peas having to do with the appearance of seeds seed pods and plants there were two discrete phenotypes such as round versus wrinkled seeds yellow versus green seeds red versus white flowers or tall versus short plants when bred separately the plants always produced the same phenotypes generation after generation however when lines with different phenotypes were crossed (interbred) one and only one of the parental phenotypes showed up in the offspring (green or round or red or tall) however when these hybrid plants were crossed the offspring plants showed the two original phenotypes in a characteristic 3:1 ratio the more common phenotype being that of the parental hybrid plants mendel reasoned that each parent in the first cross was a homozygote for different alleles (one parent aa and the other parent aa) that each contributed one allele to the offspring with the result that all of these hybrids were heterozygotes (a) and that one of the two alleles in the hybrid cross dominated expression of the other a masked a the final cross between two heterozygotes (aa x aa) would produce aa aa and aa offspring in a 1:2:1 genotype ratio with the first two classes showing the (a) phenotype and the last showing the (a) phenotype thereby producing the 3:1 phenotype ratio
mendel did not use the terms gene allele phenotype genotype homozygote and heterozygote all of which were introduced later he did introduce the notation of capital and lowercase letters for dominant and recessive alleles respectively still in use today
=== chromosomes genes and alleles ===
most animals and some plants have paired chromosomes and are described as diploid they have two versions of each chromosome one contributed by the mother's ovum and the other by the father's sperm known as gametes described as haploid and created through meiosis these gametes then fuse during fertilization during sexual reproduction into a new single cell zygote which divide twice resulting in a new organism with the same number of pairs of chromosomes in each (non-gamete) cell as its parents
each chromosome of a matching (homologous) pair is structurally similar to the other and has a very similar dna sequence (loci singular locus) the dna in each chromosome functions as a series of discrete genes that influence various traits thus each gene also has a corresponding homologue which may exist in different versions called alleles the alleles at the same locus on the two homologous chromosomes may be identical or different
blood types in humans is determined by a gene that creates either type a b or o and is located in the long arm of chromosome nine there are three different alleles that could be present at this locus but only two can be present in any individual one inherited from their mother and one from their father
if two alleles of a given gene are identical the organism is called a homozygote and is said to be homozygous with respect to that gene if instead the two alleles are different the organism is a heterozygote and is heterozygous the genetic makeup of an organism either at a single locus or over all its genes collectively is called its genotype the genotype of an organism directly and indirectly affects its molecular physical and other traits which individually or collectively are called its phenotype at heterozygous gene loci the two alleles interact to produce the phenotype
== dominance ==
=== complete dominance ===
in complete dominance the effect of one allele in a heterozygous genotype completely masks the effect of the other the allele that masks the other is said to be dominant to the latter and the allele that is masked is said to be recessive to the former complete dominance therefore means that the phenotype of the heterozygote is indistinguishable from that of the dominant homozygote
a classic example of dominance is the inheritance of seed shape (pea shape) in peas peas may be round (associated with allele r) or wrinkled (associated with allele r) in this case three combinations of alleles (genotypes) are possible rr and rr are homozygous and rr is heterozygous the rr individuals have round peas and the rr individuals have wrinkled peas in rr individuals the r allele masks the presence of the r allele so these individuals also have round peas thus allele r is dominant to allele r and allele r is recessive to allele r
=== incomplete dominance ===
incomplete dominance (also called partial dominance) occurs when the phenotype of the heterozygous phenotype is distinct from and often intermediate to the phenotypes of the homozygous phenotypes for example the snapdragon flower color is either homozygous for red or white when the red homozygous flower is paired with the white homozygous flower the result yields a pink snapdragon flower the pink snapdragon is the result of incomplete dominance a similar type of incomplete dominance is found in the four o'clock plant wherein pink color is produced when true-bred parents of white and red flowers are crossed in quantitative genetics where phenotypes are measured and treated numerically if a heterozygote's phenotype is exactly between (numerically) that of the two homozygotes the phenotype is said to exhibit no dominance at all i.e dominance exists only when the heterozygote's phenotype measure lies closer to one homozygote than the other
when plants of the f1 generation are self-pollinated the phenotypic and genotypic ratio of the f2 generation will be 1:2:1 (red:pink:white)
see partial dominance hypothesis theory
=== co-dominance ===
co-dominance occurs when the contributions of both alleles are visible in the phenotype
for example in the abo blood group system chemical modifications to a glycoprotein (the h antigen) on the surfaces of blood cells are controlled by three alleles two of which are co-dominant to each other (ia ib) and dominant over the recessive i at the abo locus the ia and ib alleles produce different modifications the enzyme coded for by ia adds an n-acetylgalactosamine to the membrane-bound h antigen the ib enzyme adds a galactose the i allele produces no modification thus ia and ib alleles are each dominant to i (iaia and iai individuals both have type a blood and ibib and ibi individuals both have type b blood but iaib individuals have both modifications on their blood cells and thus have type ab blood so the ia and ib alleles are said to be co-dominant)
another example occurs at the locus for the beta-globin component of hemoglobin where the three molecular phenotypes of hba/hba hba/hbs and hbs/hbs are all distinguishable by protein electrophoresis (the medical condition produced by the heterozygous genotype is called sickle-cell trait and is a milder condition distinguishable from sickle-cell anemia thus the alleles show incomplete dominance with respect to anemia see above) for most gene loci at the molecular level both alleles are expressed co-dominantly because both are transcribed into rna
co-dominance where allelic products co-exist in the phenotype is different from incomplete dominance where the quantitative interaction of allele products produces an intermediate phenotype for example in co-dominance a red homozygous flower and a white homozygous flower will produce offspring that have red and white spots when plants of the f1 generation are self-pollinated the phenotypic and genotypic ratio of the f2 generation will be 1:2:1 (red:spotted:white) these ratios are the same as those for incomplete dominance again note that this classical terminology is inappropriate in reality such cases should not be said to exhibit dominance at all
=== which trait is dominant ===
by definition the terms dominant and recessive refer to the genotypic interaction of alleles in producing the phenotype of the heterozygote the key concept is genetic which of the two alleles present in the heterozygote is expressed such that the organism is phenotypically identical to one of the two homozygotes it is sometimes convenient to talk about the trait corresponding to the dominant allele as the dominant trait and the trait corresponding to the hidden allele as the recessive trait however this can easily lead to confusion in understanding the concept as phenotypic for example to say that green peas dominate yellow peas confuses inherited genotypes and expressed phenotypes and will subsequently confuse discussion of the molecular basis of the phenotypic difference
=== addressing common misconceptions ===
dominance is not inherent one allele can be dominant to a second allele recessive to a third allele and codominant to a fourth
dominance is unrelated to the nature of the phenotype itself that is whether it is regarded as normal or abnormal, standard or nonstandard, healthy or diseased, stronger or weaker, or more or less extreme a dominant allele may account for any of these trait types
dominance does not determine whether an allele is deleterious neutral or advantageous however selection works through differential reproduction of phenotypes and dominance affects the exposure of alleles in phenotypes and hence the rate of change in allele frequencies under selection deleterious recessive alleles may persist in a population at low frequencies with most copies carried in heterozygotes at no cost to those individuals these rare recessives are the basis for many hereditary genetic disorders
dominance is also unrelated to the distribution of alleles in the population some dominant alleles are extremely common while others are extremely rare the most common allele in a population may be recessive when combined with some rare variants
== nomenclature ==
in genetics symbols began as algebraic placeholders when one allele is dominant to another the oldest convention is to symbolize the dominant allele with a capital letter the recessive allele is assigned the same letter in lower case in the pea example once the dominance relationship between the two alleles is known it is possible to designate the dominant allele that produces a round shape by a capital-letter symbol r and the recessive allele that produces a wrinkled shape by a lower-case symbol r the homozygous dominant heterozygous and homozygous recessive genotypes are then written rr rr and rr respectively it would also be possible to designate the two alleles as w and w and the three genotypes ww ww and ww the first two of which produced round peas and the third wrinkled peas note that the choice of r or w as the symbol for the dominant allele does not pre-judge whether the allele causing the round or wrinkled phenotype when homozygous is the dominant one
in most cases genes have several alleles if multiple dominant alleles exist they may be designated with different superscripts over the upper case letter for example ax if multiple recessive alleles exist they are designated with different superscripts on the lower case a for example ax
to indicate that two alleles are co-dominant (and that neither is dominant over the other) they are both written in upper-case with a superscript to indicate the different alleles
rules of genetic nomenclature have evolved as genetics has become more complex committees have standardized the rules for some species but not for all rules for one species may differ somewhat from the rules for a different species
== relationship to other genetic concepts ==
=== multiple alleles ===
although any individual of a diploid organism has at most two different alleles at any one locus (barring aneuploidies) most genes exist in a large number of allelic versions in the population as a whole if the alleles have different effects on the phenotype sometimes their dominance interactions with each other can be described as a series
for example coat color in domestic cats is affected by a series of alleles of the tyr gene (which encodes the enzyme tyrosinase) the alleles c cb cs and ca (full colour burmese siamese and albino respectively) produce different levels of pigment and hence different levels of colour dilution the c allele (full colour) is completely dominant over the last three and the ca allele (albino) is completely recessive to the first three
=== autosomal versus sex-linked dominance ===
in humans and other mammal species sex is determined by two sex chromosomes called the x chromosome and the y chromosome human females are typically xx males are typically xy the remaining pairs of chromosome are found in both sexes and are called autosomes genetic traits due to loci on these chromosomes are described as autosomal and may be dominant or recessive genetic traits on the x and y chromosomes are called sex-linked because they are linked to sex chromosomes not because they are characteristic of one sex or the other in practice the term almost always refers to x-linked traits and a great many such traits (such as red-green colour vision deficiency) are not affected by sex females have two copies of every gene locus found on the x chromosome just as for the autosomes and the same dominance relationships apply males however have only one copy of each x chromosome gene locus and are described as hemizygous for these genes the y chromosome is much smaller than the x and contains a much smaller set of genes including but not limited to those that influence maleness such as the sry gene for testis determining factor dominance rules for sex-linked gene loci are determined by their behavior in the female because the male has only one allele (except in the case of certain types of y chromosome aneuploidy) that allele is always expressed regardless of whether it is dominant or recessive
=== epistasis ===
epistasis ["epi + stasis = to sit on top"] is an interaction between alleles at two different gene loci that affect a single trait which may sometimes resemble a dominance interaction between two different alleles at the same locus epistasis modifies the characteristic 9:3:3:1 ratio expected for two non-epistatic genes for two loci 14 classes of epistatic interactions are recognized as an example of recessive epistasis one gene locus may determine whether a flower pigment is yellow (aa or aa) or green (aa) while another locus determines whether the pigment is produced (bb or bb) or not (bb) in a bb plant the flowers will be white irrespective of the genotype of the other locus as aa aa or aa the bb combination is not dominant to the a allele rather the b gene shows recessive epistasis to the a gene because the b locus when homozygous for the recessive allele (bb) suppresses phenotypic expression of the a locus in a cross between two aabb plants this produces a characteristic 9:3:4 ratio in this case of yellow  green  white flowers
in dominant epistasis one gene locus may determine yellow or green pigment as in the previous example aa and aa are yellow and aa are green a second locus determines whether a pigment precursor is produced (dd) or not (dd or dd) here in a dd or dd plant the flowers will be colorless irrespective of the genotype at the a locus because of the epistatic effect of the dominant d allele thus in a cross between two aadd plants 3/4 of the plants will be colorless and the yellow and green phenotypes are expressed only in dd plants this produces a characteristic 12:3:1 ratio of white  yellow  green plants
supplementary epistasis occurs when two loci affect the same phenotype for example if pigment color is produced by cc or cc but not cc and by dd or dd but not dd then pigment is not produced in any genotypic combination with either cc or dd that is both loci must have at least one dominant allele to produce the phenotype this produces a characteristic 9:7 ratio of pigmented to unpigmented plants complementary epistasis in contrast produces an unpigmented plant if and only if the genotype is cc and dd and the characteristic ratio is 15:1 between pigmented and unpigmented plants
classical genetics considered epistatic interactions between two genes at a time it is now evident from molecular genetics that all gene loci are involved in complex interactions with many other genes (e.g. metabolic pathways may involve scores of genes) and that this creates epistatic interactions that are much more complex than the classic two-locus models
=== hardy-weinberg principle (estimation of carrier frequency) ===
the frequency of the homozygous state (which is the carrier state for a recessive trait) can be estimated using the hardy-weinberg formula
this formula applies to a gene with exactly two alleles and relates the frequencies of those alleles in a large population to the frequencies of their three genotypes in that population
for example if p is the frequency of allele a and q is the frequency of allele a then the terms p2 2pq and q2 are the frequencies of the genotypes aa aa and aa respectively since the gene has only two alleles all alleles must be either a or a and p + q = 1 now if a is completely dominant to a then the frequency of the carrier genotype aa cannot be directly observed (since it has the same traits as the homozygous genotype aa) however it can be estimated from the frequency of the recessive trait in the population since this is the same as that of the homozygous genotype aa i.e the individual allele frequencies can be estimated q = f(aa) p = 1 q and from those the frequency of the carrier genotype can be derived f(aa) = 2pq
this formula relies on a number of assumptions and an accurate estimate of the frequency of the recessive trait in general any real-world situation will deviate from these assumptions to some degree introducing corresponding inaccuracies into the estimate if the recessive trait is rare then it will be hard to estimate its frequency accurately as a very large sample size will be needed
== molecular mechanisms ==
the molecular basis of dominance was unknown to mendel it is now understood that a gene locus includes a long series (hundreds to thousands) of bases or nucleotides of deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) at a particular point on a chromosome the central dogma of molecular biology states that dna makes rna makes protein that is that dna is transcribed to make an rna copy and rna is translated to make a protein in this process different alleles at a locus may or may not be transcribed and if transcribed may be translated to slightly different versions of the same protein (called isoforms) proteins often function as enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions in the cell which directly or indirectly produce phenotypes in any diploid organism the dna sequences of the two alleles present at any gene locus may be identical (homozygous) or different (heterozygous) even if the gene locus is heterozygous at the level of the dna sequence the proteins made by each allele may be identical in the absence of any difference between the protein products neither allele can be said to be dominant (see co-dominance above) even if the two protein products are slightly different (allozymes) it is likely that they produce the same phenotype with respect to enzyme action and again neither allele can be said to be dominant
=== loss of function and haplosufficiency ===
dominance typically occurs when one of the two alleles is non-functional at the molecular level that is it is not transcribed or else does not produce a functional protein product this can be the result of a mutation that alters the dna sequence of the allele an organism homozygous for the non-functional allele will generally show a distinctive phenotype due to the absence of the protein product for example in humans and other organisms the unpigmented skin of the albino phenotype results when an individual is homozygous for an allele that prevents synthesis of the skin pigment protein melanin it is important to understand that it is not the lack of function that allows the allele to be described as recessive this is the interaction with the alternative allele in the heterozygote three general types of interaction are possible
in the typical case the single functional allele makes sufficient protein to produce a phenotype identical to that of the homozygote this is called haplosufficiency for example suppose the standard amount of enzyme produced in the functional homozygote is 100% with the two functional alleles contributing 50% each the single functional allele in the heterozygote produces 50% of the standard amount of enzyme which is sufficient to produce the standard phenotype if the heterozygote and the functional-allele homozygote have identical phenotypes the functional allele is dominant to the non-functional allele this occurs at the albino gene locus the heterozygote produces sufficient enzyme to convert the pigment precursor to melanin and the individual has standard pigmentation
less commonly the presence of a single functional allele gives a phenotype that is not normal but less severe than that of the non-functional homozygote this occurs when the functional allele is not haplo-sufficient the terms haplo-insufficiency and incomplete dominance are typically applied to these cases the intermediate interaction occurs where the heterozygous genotype produces a phenotype intermediate between the two homozygotes depending on which of the two homozygotes the heterozygote most resembles one allele is said to show incomplete dominance over the other for example in humans the hb gene locus is responsible for the beta-chain protein (hbb) that is one of the two globin proteins that make up the blood pigment hemoglobin many people are homozygous for an allele called hba some persons carry an alternative allele called hbs either as homozygotes or heterozygotes the hemoglobin molecules of hbs/hbs homozygotes undergo a change in shape that distorts the morphology of the red blood cells and causes a severe life-threatening form of anemia called sickle-cell anemia persons heterozygous hba/hbs for this allele have a much less severe form of anemia called sickle-cell trait because the disease phenotype of hba/hbs heterozygotes is more similar to but not identical to the hba/hba homozygote the hba allele is said to be incompletely dominant to the hbs allele
rarely a single functional allele in the heterozygote may produce insufficient gene product for any function of the gene and the phenotype resembles that of the homozygote for the non-functional allele this complete haploinsufficiency is very unusual in these cases the non-functional allele would be said to be dominant to the functional allele this situation may occur when the non-functional allele produces a defective protein that interferes with the proper function of the protein produced by the standard allele the presence of the defective protein dominates the standard protein and the disease phenotype of the heterozygote more closely resembles that of the homozygote for two defective alleles note that the term dominant is often incorrectly applied to defective alleles whose homozygous phenotype has not been examined but which cause a distinct phenotype when heterozygous with the normal allele this phenomenon occurs in a number of trinucleotide repeat diseases for an example and more details see huntington disease
=== dominant-negative mutations ===
many proteins are normally active in the form of a multimer an aggregate of multiple copies of the same protein otherwise known as a homomultimeric protein or homooligomeric protein in fact a majority of the 83,000 different enzymes from 9800 different organisms in the brenda enzyme database represent homooligomers when the wild-type version of the protein is present along with a mutant version a mixed multimer can be formed a mutation that leads to a mutant protein that disrupts the activity of the wild-type protein in the multimer is a dominant-negative mutation
a dominant-negative mutation may arise in a human somatic cell and provide a proliferative advantage to the mutant cell leading to its clonal expansion for instance a dominant-negative mutation in a gene necessary for the normal process of programmed cell death (apoptosis) in response to dna damage can make the cell resistant to apoptosis this will allow proliferation of the clone even when excessive dna damage is present such dominant-negative mutations occur in the tumor suppressor gene p53 the p53 wild-type protein is normally present as a four-protein multimer (oligotetramer) dominant-negative p53 mutations occur in a number of different types of cancer and pre-cancerous lesions (e.g brain tumors breast cancer oral pre-cancerous lesions and oral cancer)
dominant-negative mutations also occur in other tumor suppressor genes for instance two dominant-negative germ line mutations were identified in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (atm) gene which increases susceptibility to breast cancer dominant negative mutations of the transcription factor c/ebp can cause acute myeloid leukemia inherited dominant negative mutations can also increase the risk of diseases other than cancer dominant-negative mutations in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (ppar) are associated with severe insulin resistance diabetes mellitus and hypertension
dominant-negative mutations have also been described in organisms other than humans in fact the first study reporting a mutant protein inhibiting the normal function of a wild-type protein in a mixed multimer was with the bacteriophage t4 tail fiber protein gp37 mutations that produce a truncated protein rather than a full-length mutant protein seem to have the strongest dominant-negative effect in the studies of p53 atm c/ebp and bacteriophage t4 gp37
== dominant and recessive genetic diseases in humans ==
in humans many genetic traits or diseases are classified simply as dominant or recessive especially with so-called recessive diseases which are indeed a factor of recessive genes but can oversimplify the underlying molecular basis and lead to misunderstanding of the nature of dominance for example the recessive genetic disease phenylketonuria (pku) results from any of a large number (>60) of alleles at the gene locus for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) many of these alleles produce little or no pah as a result of which the substrate phenylalanine (phe) and its metabolic byproducts accumulate in the central nervous system and can cause severe intellectual disability if untreated
the genotypes and phenotypic consequences of interactions among three alleles are shown in the following table
in unaffected persons homozygous for a standard functional allele (aa) pah activity is standard (100%) and the concentration of phenylalanine in the blood [phe] is about 60 um in untreated persons homozygous for one of the pku alleles (bb) pah activity is close to zero [phe] ten to forty times standard and the individual manifests pku
in the ab heterozygote pah activity is only 30% (not 50%) of standard blood [phe] is elevated two-fold and the person does not manifest pku thus the a allele is dominant to the b allele with respect to pku but the b allele is incompletely dominant to the a allele with respect to its molecular effect determination of pah activity level (0.3% < 30% << 100%) finally the a allele is an incomplete dominant to b with respect to [phe] as 60 um < 120 um << 600 um note once more that it is irrelevant to the question of dominance that the recessive allele produces a more extreme [phe] phenotype
for a third allele c a cc homozygote produces a very small amount of pah enzyme which results in a somewhat elevated level of [phe] in the blood a condition called hyperphenylalaninemia which does not result in intellectual disability
that is the dominance relationships of any two alleles may vary according to which aspect of the phenotype is under consideration it is typically more useful to talk about the phenotypic consequences of the allelic interactions involved in any genotype rather than to try to force them into dominant and recessive categories
