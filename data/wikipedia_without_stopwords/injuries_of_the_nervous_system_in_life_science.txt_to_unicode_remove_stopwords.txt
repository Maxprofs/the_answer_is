renewable portfolio standard rps regulation requires increased production energy renewable energy sources wind solar biomass geothermal common names concept include renewable electricity standard res united states federal level renewables obligation uk
rps mechanism generally places obligation electricity supply companies produce specified fraction electricity renewable energy sources certified renewable energy generators earn certificates every unit electricity produce sell along electricity supply companies supply companies pass certificates form regulatory body demonstrate compliance regulatory obligations market mandate rps relies almost entirely private market implementation unlike feedin tariffs guarantee purchase renewable energy regardless cost rps programs tend allow price competition different types renewable energy limited competition eligibility multipliers rps programs supporting adoption rps mechanisms claim market implementation result competition efficiency innovation deliver renewable energy lowest possible cost allowing renewable energy compete cheaper fossil fuel energy sources
rpstype mechanisms adopted several countries including britain italy poland sweden belgium chile well us states district columbia
program diversity
statebased rps programs place today two designed taking account statespecific policy objectives eg economic growth diversity energy supply environmental concerns local resource endowment political considerations capacity expand renewable energy production basic level gives rise differing rps targets years eg arizonas colorados looking two values alone however misleading factors program design include resource eligibility instate requirements new build requirements technology favoritism lobbying industry associations nonprofits groups cost caps program coverage ious versus cooperatives municipal utilities cost recovery utilities penalties noncompliance rules regarding rec creation trading additional nonbinding goals since rps programs create mandate purchase renewable energy create lucrative captive market buyers renewable energy producers eligible particular states rps program issue recs wide variety localized regulation us rps programs vulnerable regulatory capture state may choose promote new investment renewable energy generation capacity making eligible existing renewable energy hydroelectric plants geothermal energy qualify rps program
additional nonbinding goals
many states mandatory renewable portfolio standards also additional voluntary targets either total proportion renewable energy particular technology type
program coverage
program coverage refers entities expected obliged meet renewable portfolio targets goals many states municipalities cooperatives exempt rps target lower target required develop targets furthermore states minnesota individual utilities eg xcel energy singled special treatment
renewable energy certificates recs
states rps programs associated renewable energy certificate trading programs recs provide mechanism track amount renewable power sold financially reward eligible power producers unit power eligible producer generates certificate credit issued sold either conjunction underlying power separately energy supply companies market exists recs energy supply companies required redeem certificates equal obligation rps program state specific programs various applications eg wregis mrets nepool gis used track rec issuance ownership credits programs banked use future years borrowed meet current year commitments great deal variety among states handling functioning recs major issue integrating state federal programs
multipliers
states rec trading programs renewable energy certificate issued eligible producers mwh renewable energy production state programs order promote specific renewable technology types apply credit multiplier mwh electricity produced particular technology receives one rec example wind multiplier means one mwh electricity produced wind technology provides producer electricity certificates rps multipliers powerful tools regulators direct revenue investment job creation particular types renewable energy vs free market renewable energy since definition renewable energy isnt clear cut example nuclear power whether rps program consider environmental damage renewable energy source example hydroelectric dams bird strikes wind turbines geothermal earthquakes solar thermal water use affects rps program implementations state use multiplier protectionism local renewable energy generators state renewable generators since recs regulated state level ability traded state lines varies
solar renewable energy certificates srecs
approximately states rps programs also established setaside solar energy results creation trading recs specific solar known solar renewable energy certificates srecs solar setaside establishes separate market srecs encourages inclusion solar technology renewable energy mix differs rec multiplier approach used states rec solar might count times much rec multipliers limited impact promoting solar technology since rec buyers find easier source times rec needs economics scale come wind farms separate market srecs states able ensure portion renewable energy comes solar result states solar carveouts new jersey success promoting solar energy rps states texas generic rec market rec multiplier
tiers set asides
many state programs promote particular technology types establishing subtargets known carve outs setasides addition meeting overall rps targets energy supply companies need show acquired particular percentage power sales designated technology type instances multiple technology types bundled together tiers classes similar effect states setasides tiers preferring promote particular technologies credit multipliers state groups technologies together tier differently
eligible technologies
every state defines renewable technologies differently ohio example state counts advanced nuclear power generation eligible technology states often start assessment whether renewable technology economically feasible absence rps program best personified distinguishing small large hydroelectric facilities many states exclude existing renewable facilities benefiting rps program reason states definition eligible technologies also driven objectives program programs designed promote diversity generation types may include promote technologies different programs designed achieve environmental goals
report published union concerned scientists doug koplow said
nuclear power eligible inclusion renewable portfolio standard nuclear power established mature technology long history government support furthermore nuclear plants unique potential cause catastrophic damage due accidents sabotage terrorism produce longlived radioactive wastes exacerbate nuclear proliferation
united nations classifies particular subset presently operating nuclear fission technologies renewable reactors produce fissile fuel consume breeder reactors eventually nuclear fusion classified within category conventional renewable energy sources solar falling water
penalties
order motivate compliance states enforceable standards penalties utilities fail reach specified targets states may choose set penalty values make arbitrary penalty amounts suppliers fail meet renewable target specific technologies promoted either tiers setaside provisions penalties missing targets typically separate higher states higher penalties repeat violations others escalate penalties yearly basis according price indices
cost caps
states either place caps cost program include form escape clause whereby regulatory authority suspend program exempt utilities meeting requirements need measures arises difficulties estimating advance actual cost rps program realized cost utility ratepayer known supply cost base renewable power along actual demand established however likely costs estimated states appear set cost caps low enough complete rps requirements could fulfilled without significant decrease renewables costs
cost recovery
exceptions utilities allowed recover additional cost procuring renewable power method achieved varies state states opt ratepayer surcharge others require utilities include costs rate base instances utilities even able recover cost penalties associated noncompliance
