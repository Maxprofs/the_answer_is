pollination is a process in which pollen is transferred to the female reproductive organs of seed plants thereby enabling fertilization and reproduction through growth of the pollen tube and eventual release of sperm both gymnosperms and angiosperms undergo pollination although the mechanism for angiosperms is much faster and more complex
in spite of a common perception that pollen grains are gametes like the sperm cells of animals this is incorrect pollination is an event in the alternation of generations each pollen grain is a male haploid gametophyte adapted to being transported to the female gametophyte where it can effect fertilization by producing the male gamete (or gametes) in the process of double fertilization)
a successful angiosperm pollen grain (gametophyte) containing the male gametes is transported to the stigma where it germinates and its pollen tube grows down the style to the ovary its two gametes travel down the tube to where the gametophyte(s) containing the female gametes are held within the carpel one nucleus fuses with the polar bodies to produce the endosperm tissues and the other with the ovule to produce the embryo hence the term double fertilization
in gymnosperms the ovule is not contained in a carpel but exposed on the surface of a dedicated support organ such as the scale of a cone so that the penetration of carpel tissue is unnecessary details of the process vary according to the division of gymnosperms in question
the receptive part of the carpel is called a stigma in the flowers of angiosperms the receptive part of the gymnosperm ovule is called the micropyle pollination is a necessary step in the reproduction of flowering plants resulting in the production of offspring that are genetically diverse
the study of pollination brings together many disciplines such as botany horticulture entomology and ecology the pollination process as an interaction between flower and pollen vector was first addressed in the 18th century by christian konrad sprengel it is important in horticulture and agriculture because fruiting is dependent on fertilization the result of pollination the study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology
== types ==
=== abiotic ===
abiotic pollination refers to situations where pollination is mediated without the involvement of other organisms only 10% of flowering plants are pollinated without animal assistance the most common form of abiotic pollination anemophily is pollination by wind this form of pollination is early dominant in grasses most conifers and many deciduous trees hydrophily is pollination by water and occurs in aquatic plants which release their pollen directly into the surrounding water about 80% of all plant pollination is biotic in gymnosperms biotic pollination is generally incidental when it occurs though some gymnosperms and their pollinators are mutually adapted for pollination the best-known examples probably are members of the order cycadales and associated species of beetles most conifera are anemophilous they depend on wind pollination of the abiotically pollinated species 98% are anemophilous and 2% hydrophilous being pollinated by water
=== biotic ===
more commonly the process of pollination requires pollinators organisms that carry or move the pollen grains from the anther to the receptive part of the carpel or pistil(stigma) this is biotic pollination the various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes roughly 200,000 varieties of animal pollinators are in the wild most of which are insects
entomophily pollination by insects often occurs on plants that have developed colored petals and a strong scent to attract insects such as bees wasps and occasionally ants (hymenoptera) beetles (coleoptera) moths and butterflies (lepidoptera) and flies (diptera) the existence of insect pollination dates back to the dinosaur era
in zoophily pollination is performed by vertebrates such as birds and bats particularly hummingbirds sunbirds spiderhunters honeyeaters and fruit bats plants adapted to using bats or moths as pollinators typically have white petals and a strong scent whereas plants that use birds as pollinators tend to develop red petals and rarely develop a scent (few birds rely on a sense of smell to find plant-based food)
insect pollinators such as honeybees (apis mellifera) bumblebees (bombus terrestris) and butterflies (thymelicus flavus) have been observed to engage in flower constancy which means they are more likely to transfer pollen to other conspecific plants this can be beneficial for the pollinators as flower constancy prevents the loss of pollen during interspecific flights and pollinators from clogging stigmas with pollen of other flower species it also improves the probability that the pollinator will find productive flowers easily accessible and recognisable by familiar clues
== mechanism ==
pollination can be accomplished by cross-pollination or by self-pollination
cross-pollination also called allogamy occurs only when pollen is delivered to a flower from a different plant plants adapted to outcross or cross-pollinate often have taller stamens than carpels or use other mechanisms to better ensure the spread of pollen to other plants flowers
self-pollination occurs when pollen from one flower pollinates the same flower or other flowers of the same individual it is thought to have evolved under conditions when pollinators were not reliable vectors for pollen transport and is most often seen in short-lived annual species and plants that colonize new locations self-pollination may include autogamy where pollen moves to the female part of the same flower or geitonogamy when pollen is transferred to another flower on the same plant plants adapted to self-fertilize often have similar stamen and carpel lengths plants that can pollinate themselves and produce viable offspring are called self-fertile plants that cannot fertilize themselves are called self-sterile a condition which mandates cross pollination for the production of offspring
cleistogamy is self-pollination that occurs before the flower opens the pollen is released from the anther within the flower or the pollen on the anther grows a tube down the style to the ovules it is a type of sexual breeding in contrast to asexual systems such as apomixis some cleistogamous flowers never open in contrast to chasmogamous flowers that open and are then pollinated cleistogamous flowers by necessity are self-compatible or self-fertile plants many plants are self-incompatible and these two conditions are end points on a continuum
an estimated 48.7% of plant species are either dioecious or self-incompatible obligate out-crossers it is also estimated that about 42% of flowering plants exhibit a mixed mating system in nature in the most common kind of mixed mating system individual plants produce a single type of flower and fruits may contain self-pollinated out-crossed or a mixture of progeny types
pollination also requires consideration of pollenizers the terms pollinator and pollenizer are often confused a pollinator is the agent that moves the pollen whether it be bees flies bats moths or birds a pollenizer is the plant that serves as the pollen source for other plants some plants are self-compatible (self-fertile) and can pollinate and fertilize themselves other plants have chemical or physical barriers to self-pollination
in agriculture and horticulture pollination management a good pollenizer is a plant that provides compatible viable and plentiful pollen and blooms at the same time as the plant that is to be pollinated or has pollen that can be stored and used when needed to pollinate the desired flowers hybridization is effective pollination between flowers of different species or between different breeding lines or populations see also heterosis
peaches are considered self-fertile because a commercial crop can be produced without cross-pollination though cross-pollination usually gives a better crop apples are considered self-incompatible because a commercial crop must be cross-pollinated many commercial fruit tree varieties are grafted clones genetically identical an orchard block of apples of one variety is genetically a single plant many growers now consider this a mistake one means of correcting this mistake is to graft a limb of an appropriate pollenizer (generally a variety of crabapple) every six trees or so
=== pollen vectors ===
biotic pollen vectors are animals usually insects but also reptiles birds mammals and sundry others that routinely transport pollen and play a role in pollination this is usually as a result of their activities when visiting plants for feeding breeding or shelter the pollen adheres to the vector's body parts such as face legs mouthparts hair feathers and moist spots depending on the particular vector such transport is vital to the pollination of many plant species
any kind of animal that often visits or encounters flowers is likely to be a pollen vector to some extent for example a crab spider that stops at one flower for a time and then moves on might carry pollen incidentally but most pollen vectors of significant interest are those that routinely visit the flowers for some functional activity they might feed on pollen or plant organs or on plant secretions such as nectar and carry out acts of pollination on the way many plants bear flowers that favour certain types of pollinator over all others this need not always be an effective strategy because some flowers that are of such a shape that they favor pollinators that pass by their anthers and stigmata on the way to the nectar may get robbed by ants that are small enough to bypass the normal channels or by short-tongued bees that bite through the bases of deep corolla tubes to extract nectar at the end opposite to the anthers and stigma some flowers have specialized mechanisms to trap pollinators to increase effectiveness other flowers will attract pollinators by odor for example bee species such as euglossa cordata are attracted to orchids this way and it has been suggested that the bees will become intoxicated during these visits to the orchid flowers which last up to 90 minutes however in general plants that rely on pollen vectors tend to be adapted to their particular type of vector for example day-pollinated species tend to be brightly coloured but if they are pollinated largely by birds or specialist mammals they tend to be larger and have larger nectar rewards than species that are strictly insect-pollinated they also tend to spread their rewards over longer periods having long flowering seasons their specialist pollinators would be likely to starve if the pollination season were too short
as for the types of pollinators reptile pollinators are known but they form a minority in most ecological situations they are most frequent and most ecologically significant in island systems where insect and sometimes also bird populations may be unstable and less species-rich adaptation to a lack of animal food and of predation pressure might therefore favour reptiles becoming more herbivorous and more inclined to feed on pollen and nectar most species of lizards in the families that seem to be significant in pollination seem to carry pollen only incidentally especially the larger species such as varanidae and iguanidae but especially several species of the gekkonidae are active pollinators and so is at least one species of the lacertidae podarcis lilfordi which pollinates various species but in particular is the major pollinator of euphorbia dendroides on various mediterranean islands
mammals are not generally thought of as pollinators but some rodents bats and marsupials are significant pollinators and some even specialise in such activities in south africa certain species of protea (in particular protea humiflora p amplexicaulis p subulifolia p decurrens and p cordata) are adapted to pollination by rodents (particularly cape spiny mouse acomys subspinosus) and elephant shrews (elephantulus species) the flowers are borne near the ground are yeasty smelling not colourful and sunbirds reject the nectar with its high xylose content the mice apparently can digest the xylose and they eat large quantities of the pollen in australia pollination by flying gliding and earthbound mammals has been demonstrated
examples of pollen vectors include many species of wasps that transport pollen of many plant species being potential or even efficient pollinators
== evolution of plant/pollinator interactions ==
the first fossil record for abiotic pollination is from fern-like plants in the late carboniferous period gymnosperms show evidence for biotic pollination as early as the triassic period many fossilized pollen grains show characteristics similar to the biotically dispersed pollen today furthermore the gut contents wing structures and mouthpart morphologies of fossilized beetles and flies suggest that they acted as early pollinators the association between beetles and angiosperms during the early cretaceous period led to parallel radiations of angiosperms and insects into the late cretaceous the evolution of nectaries in late cretaceous flowers signals the beginning of the mutualism between hymenopterans and angiosperms
== in agriculture ==
pollination management is a branch of agriculture that seeks to protect and enhance present pollinators and often involves the culture and addition of pollinators in monoculture situations such as commercial fruit orchards the largest managed pollination event in the world is in californian almond orchards where nearly half (about one million hives) of the us honey bees are trucked to the almond orchards each spring new york's apple crop requires about 30,000 hives maine's blueberry crop uses about 50,000 hives each year
bees are also brought to commercial plantings of cucumbers squash melons strawberries and many other crops honey bees are not the only managed pollinators a few other species of bees are also raised as pollinators the alfalfa leafcutter bee is an important pollinator for alfalfa seed in western united states and canada bumblebees are increasingly raised and used extensively for greenhouse tomatoes and other crops
the ecological and financial importance of natural pollination by insects to agricultural crops improving their quality and quantity becomes more and more appreciated and has given rise to new financial opportunities the vicinity of a forest or wild grasslands with native pollinators near agricultural crops such as apples almonds or coffee can improve their yield by about 20% the benefits of native pollinators may result in forest owners demanding payment for their contribution in the improved crop results a simple example of the economic value of ecological services farmers can also raise native crops in order to promote native bee pollinator species as shown with l vierecki in delware and l leucozonium in southwest virginia
the american institute of biological sciences reports that native insect pollination saves the united states agricultural economy nearly an estimated $3.1 billion annually through natural crop production pollination produces some $40 billion worth of products annually in the united states alone
pollination of food crops has become an environmental issue due to two trends the trend to monoculture means that greater concentrations of pollinators are needed at bloom time than ever before yet the area is forage poor or even deadly to bees for the rest of the season the other trend is the decline of pollinator populations due to pesticide misuse and overuse new diseases and parasites of bees clearcut logging decline of beekeeping suburban development removal of hedges and other habitat from farms and public concern about bees widespread aerial spraying for mosquitoes due to west nile fears is causing an acceleration of the loss of pollinators
the us solution to the pollinator shortage so far has been for commercial beekeepers to become pollination contractors and to migrate just as the combine harvesters follow the wheat harvest from texas to manitoba beekeepers follow the bloom from south to north to provide pollination for many different crops
in some situations farmers or horticulturists may aim to restrict natural pollination to only permit breeding with the preferred individuals plants this may be achieved through the use of pollination bags
=== improving pollination in areas with suboptimal bee densities ===
in some instances growers demand for beehives far exceeds the available supply the number of managed beehives in the us has steadily declined from close to 6 million after wwii to less than 2.5 million today in contrast the area dedicated to growing bee-pollinated crops has grown over 300% in the same time period additionally in the past five years there has been a decline in winter managed beehives which has reached an unprecedented rate of colony losses at near 30% at present there is an enormous demand for beehive rentals that cannot always be met there is a clear need across the agricultural industry for a management tool to draw pollinators into cultivations and encourage them to preferentially visit and pollinate the flowering crop by attracting pollinators like honeybees and increasing their foraging behavior particularly in the center of large plots we can increase grower returns and optimize yield from their plantings isca technologies from riverside california created a semiochemical formulation called splat bloom that modifies the behavior of honeybees inciting them to visit flowers in every portion of the field
== environmental impacts ==
loss of pollinators also known as pollinator decline (of which colony collapse disorder is perhaps the most well known) has been noticed in recent years observed losses would have significant economic impacts possible explanations for pollinator decline include habitat destruction pesticide parasitism/diseases climate change and others and many researchers believe it is the synergistic effects of these factors which are ultimately detrimental to pollinator populations see david ward roubik ups and downs in pollinator populations when is there a decline
== the structure of plant-pollinator networks ==
wild pollinators often visit a large number of plant species and plants are visited by a large number of pollinator species all these relations together form a network of interactions between plants and pollinators surprising similarities were found in the structure of networks consisting out of the interactions between plants and pollinators this structure was found to be similar in very different ecosystems on different continents consisting of entirely different species
the structure of plant-pollinator networks may have large consequences for the way in which pollinator communities respond to increasingly harsh conditions mathematical models examining the consequences of this network structure for the stability of pollinator communities suggest that the specific way in which plant-pollinator networks are organized minimizes competition between pollinators and may even lead to strong indirect facilitation between pollinators when conditions are harsh this means that pollinator species together can survive under harsh conditions but it also means that pollinator species collapse simultaneously when conditions pass a critical point this simultaneous collapse occurs because pollinator species depend on each other when surviving under difficult conditions
such a community-wide collapse involving many pollinator species can occur suddenly when increasingly harsh conditions pass a critical point and recovery from such a collapse might not be easy the improvement in conditions needed for pollinators to recover could be substantially larger than the improvement needed to return to conditions at which the pollinator community collapsed
