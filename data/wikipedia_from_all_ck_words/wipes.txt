the rights and obligations of the wife in relation to her partner and her status in the community and in law varies between cultures and has varied over time
== summary ==
the word is of germanic origin from proto-germanic *wbam woman in middle english it had the form wif and in old english wf woman or wife it is related to modern german weib (woman female) and danish viv (wife usually poetic) and may derive ultimately from the indo-european root ghwbh- shame pudenda (cf tocharian b kwpe and tocharian a kip each meaning female pudenda with clear sexual overtones) the original meaning of the phrase wife as simply woman unconnected with marriage or a husband/wife is preserved in words such as midwife and fishwife
in many cultures with marriage it is generally expected that a woman will take her husband's surname though that is not universal a married woman may indicate her marital status in a number of ways in western culture a married woman would commonly wear a wedding ring but in other cultures other markers of marital status may be used a married woman is commonly given the honorific title mrs but some married women prefer to be referred to as ms a title which is also used when the marital status of a woman is unknown
== related terminology ==
a woman on her wedding day is usually described as a bride even after the wedding ceremony while being described as a wife is also appropriate after the wedding or after the honeymoon historically if her partner was male he was known as the bridegroom during the wedding and within the marriage is called her husband if her partner is female she may also be described as a bride during and after the ceremony and as a wife within the marriage
wife refers to the institutionalized relation to the other spouse unlike mother a term that puts a woman into the context of her children in some societies especially historically a concubine was a woman who was in an ongoing usually matrimonially oriented relationship with a man who could not be married to her often because of a difference in social status
the term wife is most commonly applied to a woman in a union sanctioned by law (including religious law) not to a woman in an informal cohabitation relationship which may be known as a girlfriend partner cohabitant significant other concubine mistress etc however a woman in a so-called common law marriage may describe herself as a common law wife de facto wife or simply a wife those seeking to advance gender neutrality may refer to both marriage partners as spouses and many countries and societies are rewording their statute law by replacing wife and husband with spouse a former wife whose spouse is deceased is a widow
== termination of the status of a wife ==
the status of a wife may be terminated by divorce annulment or death of the other spouse in the case of divorce terminology such as former-wife or ex-wife is often used with regard to annulment such terms are not strictly speaking correct because annulment unlike divorce is usually retroactive meaning that an annulled marriage is considered to be invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place in the case of the death of the other spouse the term used is widow the social status of such women varies by culture but in some places they may be subject to potentially harmful practices such as widow inheritance or levirate marriage or divorced women may be socially stigmatized in some cultures the termination of the status of wife made life itself meaningless as in the case of those cultures that practiced sati a funeral ritual within some asian communities in which a recently widowed woman committed suicide by fire typically on the husband's funeral pyre
== legal rights of the wife ==
the legal rights of a wife have been since the 19th century and still are in many jurisdictions subject to debate this subject was in particular addressed by john stuart mill in the subjection of women (1869) historically many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to husbands that have been very different from the sets of rights and obligations given to wives in particular the control of marital property inheritance rights and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage have typically been given to male marital partners however this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender among the last european countries to establish full gender equality in marriage were switzerland greece spain and france in the 1980s in various marriage laws around the world however the husband continues to have authority for instance the civil code of iran states at article 1105 in relations between husband and wife the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband
== exchanges of goods or money ==
traditionally and still in some parts of the world the bride or her family bring her husband a dowry or the husband or his family pay a bride price to the bride's family or both are exchanged between the families or the husband pays the wife a dower the purpose of the dowry varies by culture and has varied historically in some cultures it was paid not only to support the establishment of a new family but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife the dowry had to be returned to the wife or her family but during the marriage the dowry was often made inalienable by the husband today dowries continue to be expected in parts of south asia such as india pakistan nepal bangladesh and sri lanka and conflicts related to their payment sometimes result in violence such as dowry deaths and bride burning
== changing of name upon marriage ==
in some cultures particularly in the anglophone west wives often change their surnames to that of the husband upon getting married for some this is a controversial practice due to its tie to the historical doctrine of coverture and to the historically subordinated roles of wives while others argue that today this is merely a harmless tradition that should be accepted as a free choice some jurisdictions consider this practice as discriminatory and contrary to women's rights and have restricted or banned it for example since 1983 when greece adopted a new marriage law which guaranteed gender equality between the spouses women in greece are required to keep their birth names for their whole life
== childbearing ==
traditionally and still in many cultures the role of a wife was closely tied to that of a mother by a strong expectation that a wife ought to bear children while conversely an unmarried woman should not have a child out of wedlock these views have changed in many parts of the world children born outside marriage have become more common in many countries
although some wives in particular in western countries choose not to have children such a choice is not accepted in some parts of the world in northern ghana for example the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children and women using birth control are at risks of threats and coercion in addition some religions are interpreted as requiring children in marriage for instance pope francis said in 2015 that choosing not to have children was selfish
== differences in cultures ==
=== antiquity ===
many traditions like a dower dowry and bride price have long traditions in antiquity the exchange of any item or value goes back to the oldest sources and the wedding ring likewise was always used as a symbol for keeping faith to a person
=== christianity ===
==== historical status ====
christian cultures claim to be guided by the new testament in regard to their view on the position of a wife in society as well as her marriage for example the new testament condemns divorce for both men and women (1 cor 7:1011) and assumes monogamy on the part of the husband the woman is to have her own husband and the husband was to have his own wife (1 cor 7:2) in medieval christianity this was understood to mean that a wife should not share a husband with other wives as a result divorce was relatively uncommon in the pre-modern west particularly in the medieval and early modern period and husbands in the roman later medieval and early modern period did not publicly take more than one wife
in pre-modern times it was unusual to marry for love alone although it became an ideal in literature by the early modern period roman law required brides to be at least 12 years old a standard adopted by catholic canon law in roman law first marriages to brides aged 1225 required the consent of the bride and her father but by the late antique period roman law permitted women over 25 to marry without parental consent the new testament allows a widow to marry any christian she chooses (1 cor 7:39) in the 12th century the catholic church drastically changed legal standards for marital consent by allowing daughters over 12 and sons over 14 to marry without their parents approval even if their marriage was made clandestinely parish studies have confirmed that late medieval women did sometimes marry against their parents approval the catholic church's policy of considering clandestine marriages and marriages made without parental consent to be valid was controversial and in the 16th century both the french monarchy and the lutheran church sought to end these practices with limited success
the new testament made no pronouncements about wives property rights which in practice were influenced more by secular laws than religion most influential in the pre-modern west was the civil law except in english-speaking countries where english common law emerged in the high middle ages in addition local customary law influenced wives property rights as a result wives property rights in the pre-modern west varied widely from region to region because wives property rights and daughters inheritance rights varied widely from region to region due to differing legal systems the amount of property a wife might own varied greatly under roman law daughters inherited equally from their parents if no will was produced under the english common law system which dates to the later medieval period daughters and younger sons were usually excluded from landed property if no will was produced in addition roman law recognized wives property as legally separate from husbands's property as did some legal systems in parts of europe and colonial latin america in contrast english common law moved to a system where a wife with a living husband ("feme couvert") could own little property in her own name unable to easily support herself marriage was very important to most women's economic status this problem has been dealt with extensively in literature where the most important reason for women's limited power was the denial of equal education and equal property rights for females the situation was assessed by the english conservative moralist sir william blackstone the husband and wife are one and the husband is the one. married women's property rights in the english-speaking world improved with the married women's property act 1882 and similar legal changes which allowed wives with living husbands to own property in their own names until late in the 20th century women could in some regions or times sue a man for wreath money when he took her virginity without taking her as his wife
if a woman did not want to marry another option was entering a convent as a nun to become a bride of christ a state in which her chastity and economic survival would be protected both a wife and a nun wore veils which proclaimed their state of protection by the rights of marriage much more significant than the option of becoming a nun was the option of non-religious spinsterhood in the west as first demonstrated quantitatively by john hajnal in the 19th and early 20th centuries the percentage of non-clerical western women who never married was typically as high as 1015% a prevalence of female celibacy never yet documented for any other major traditional civilization in addition early modern western women married at quite high ages (typically mid to late 20s) relative to other major traditional cultures the high age at first marriage for western women has been shown by many parish reconstruction studies to be a traditional western marriage pattern that dates back at least as early as the mid-16th century
==== contemporary status ====
in the 20th century the role of the wife in western marriage changed in two major ways the first was the breakthrough from an institution to companionate marriage for the first time wives became distinct legal entities and were allowed their own property and allowed to sue until then partners were a single legal entity but only a husband was allowed to exercise this right the second change was the drastic alteration of middle and upper-class family life when in the 1960s these wives began to work outside their home and with the social acceptance of divorces the single-parent family and stepfamily or blended family as a more individualized marriage
today a woman may wear a wedding ring in order to show her status as a wife
in western countries today married women usually have an education a profession and they (or their husbands) can take time off from their work in a legally procured system of ante-natal care statutory maternity leave and they may get maternity pay or a maternity allowance the status of marriage as opposed to unmarried pregnant women allows the spouse to be responsible for the child and to speak on behalf of their wife a partner is also responsible for the wife's child in states where they are automatically assumed to be the biological legal parent vice versa a wife has more legal authority in some cases when she speaks on behalf of a spouse than she would have if they were not married e.g when her spouse is in a coma after an accident a wife may have the right of advocacy if they divorce she also might receiveor payalimony (see law and divorce around the world)

there is a widely held expectation which has existed for most of recorded history and in most cultures that a wife is not to have sexual relations with anyone other than her legal husband a breach of this expectation of fidelity is commonly referred to as adultery or extramarital sex historically adultery has been considered to be a serious offense sometimes a crime and even a sin even if that is not so it may still have legal consequences particularly as a ground for a divorce adultery may be a factor to consider in a property settlement it may affect the status of children the custody of children moreover adultery can result in social ostracism in some parts of the world in addition affinity rules of the christian church of judaism and of islam prohibit an ex-wife or widow from engaging in sexual relations with and from marrying a number of relatives of the former husband
in parts of the world adultery may result in violent acts such as honor killings or stoning some jurisdictions especially those that apply sharia law allow for such acts to take place legally
as of september 2010 stoning is a legal punishment in countries such as saudi arabia sudan iran yemen the united arab emirates and some states in nigeria as punishment for zina al-mohsena ("adultery of married persons")
