ceremonial ship launching is the process of transferring a vessel to the water it is a naval tradition in many cultures dating back thousands of years it has been observed as a public celebration and a solemn blessing
in addition to the size and weight of the vessel ship launching imposes stresses on the ship not met during normal operation and represents a considerable engineering challenge in addition to a public spectacle
ship launching involves many superstitions intended to invite good luck such as christening by breaking a sacrificial bottle of champagne over the bow as the ship is named aloud and launched
== methods of launchedit ==
there are three principal methods of conveying a new ship from building site to water only two of which are called launching. the oldest most familiar and most widely used is the end-on launch in which the vessel slides usually stern first down an inclined slipway the side launch whereby the ship enters the water broadside came into 19th-century use on inland waters rivers and lakes and was more widely adopted during world war ii the third method is float-out used for ships that are built in basins or dry docks and then floated by admitting water into the dock in all cases heavy chains are attached to the ship and the drag effect is used to slow the vessel once afloat until tugboats can move the hull to a jetty for fitting out
=== stern-first launchingedit ===
normally ways are arranged perpendicular to the shore line (or as nearly so as the water and maximum length of vessel allows) and the ship is built with its stern facing the water modern slipways take the form of a reinforced concrete mat of sufficient strength to support the vessel with two barricades that extend to well below the water level taking into account tidal variations the barricades support the two launch ways the vessel is built upon temporary cribbing that is arranged to give access to the hull's outer bottom and to allow the launchways to be erected under the complete hull when it is time to prepare for launching a pair of standing ways are erected under the hull and out onto the barricades the surface of these ways are greased (tallow and whale oil were used as grease in sailing ship days.) a pair of sliding ways is placed on top under the hull and a launch cradle with bow and stern poppets is erected on these sliding ways the weight of the hull is then transferred from the build cribbing onto the launch cradle provision is made to hold the vessel in place and then release it at the appropriate moment in the launching ceremony common mechanisms include weak links designed to be cut at a signal and mechanical triggers controlled by a switch from the ceremonial platform
on launching the vessel slides backwards down the slipway on the ways until it floats by itself
=== sideways launchingedit ===
some slipways are built so that the vessel is side-on to the water and is launched sideways this is done where the limitations of the water channel would not allow lengthwise launching but occupies a much greater length of shore the great eastern designed by brunel was built this way as were many landing craft during world war ii this method requires many more sets of ways to support the weight of the ship
=== air-bag launchingedit ===
sometimes ships are launched using a series of inflated tubes underneath the hull which deflate to cause a downward slope into the water this procedure has the advantages of requiring less permanent infrastructure risk and cost the airbags provide support to the hull of the ship and aids its launching motion into the water thus it is arguably safer than other options like sideways launching these airbags are usually cylindrical in shape with hemispherical heads at both ends the xiao qinghe shipyard launched a tank barge with marine airbags on january 20 1981 and it is known as the first use of marine airbags

=== early modern ageedit ===
while the liturgical aspects of ship christenings or baptisms continued in catholic countries the reformation seems for a time to have put a stop to them in protestant europe by the 17th century for example english launchings were secular affairs the christening party for the launch of the 64-gun ship-of-the-line prince royal in 1610 included the prince of wales and famed naval constructor phineas pett who was master shipwright at the woolwich yard pett described the proceedings
the noble prince accompanied with the lord admiral and the great lords were on the poop where the standing great gilt cup was ready filled with wine to name the ship so soon as she had been afloat according to ancient custom and ceremony performed at such times and heaving the standing cup overboard his highness then standing upon the poop with a selected company only besides the trumpeters with a great deal of expression of princely joy and with the ceremony of drinking in the standing cup threw all the wine forwards towards the half-deck and solemnly calling her by name of the prince royal the trumpets sounding the while with many gracious words to me gave the standing cup into my hands
the standing cup was a large cup fashioned of precious metal when the ship began to slide down the ways the presiding official took a ceremonial sip of wine from the cup and poured the rest on the deck or over the bow usually the cup was thrown overboard and belonged to the lucky retriever as navies grew larger and launchings more frequent economy dictated that the costly cup be caught in a net for reuse at other launchings late in 17th century britain the standing-cup ceremony was replaced by the practice of breaking a bottle across the bow

thousands of ships of every description the concerted effort of a mobilized american industry came off the ways during world war ii the historic christening-launching ceremonies continued but travel restrictions other wartime considerations and sheer numbers dictated that such occasions be less elaborate than those in the years before the nation was engaged in desperate worldwide combat on 15 december 1941 the united states maritime commission announced that all formal launching ceremonies for merchant ships being constructed under its authority would be discontinued though simple informal ceremonies without reimbursement to builders could continue
in recent history all u.s navy sponsors have been female in addition to the ceremonial breaking of a champagne bottle on the bow the sponsor remains in contact with the ship's crew and is involved in special events such as homecomings
