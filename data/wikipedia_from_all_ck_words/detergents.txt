a detergent is a surfactant or a mixture of surfactants with cleaning properties in dilute solutions. these substances are usually alkylbenzenesulfonates a family of compounds that are similar to soap but are more soluble in hard water because the polar sulfonate (of detergents) is less likely than the polar carboxyl (of soap) to bind to calcium and other ions found in hard water in most household contexts the term detergent by itself refers specifically to laundry detergent or dish detergent as opposed to hand soap or other types of cleaning agents detergents are commonly available as powders or concentrated solutions detergents like soaps work because they are amphiphilic partly hydrophilic (polar) and partly hydrophobic (non-polar) their dual nature facilitates the mixture of hydrophobic compounds (like oil and grease) with water because air is not hydrophilic detergents are also foaming agents to varying degrees
== chemical classification of detergents ==
detergents are classified into three broad groupings depending on the electrical charge of the surfactants
=== anionic detergents ===
typical anionic detergents are alkylbenzenesulfonates the alkylbenzene portion of these anions is lipophilic and the sulfonate is hydrophilic two different varieties have been popularized those with branched alkyl groups and those with linear alkyl groups the former were largely phased out in economically advanced societies because they are poorly biodegradable an estimated 6 billion kilograms of anionic detergents are produced annually for domestic markets
bile acids such as deoxycholic acid (doc) are anionic detergents produced by the liver to aid in digestion and absorption of fats and oils
=== cationic detergents ===
cationic detergents are similar to the anionic ones with a hydrophobic component but instead of the anionic sulfonate group the cationic surfactants have quaternary ammonium as the polar end the ammonium center is positively charged
=== non-ionic and zwitterionic detergents ===
non-ionic detergents are characterized by their uncharged hydrophilic headgroups typical non-ionic detergents are based on polyoxyethylene or a glycoside common examples of the former include tween triton and the brij series these materials are also known as ethoxylates or peglyates and their metabolites nonylphenol glycosides have a sugar as their uncharged hydrophilic headgroup examples include octyl thioglucoside and maltosides hega and mega series detergents are similar possessing a sugar alcohol as headgroup
zwitterionic detergents possess a net zero charge arising from the presence of equal numbers of +1 and 1 charged chemical groups examples include chaps

== history ==
in world war i there was a shortage of oils synthetic detergents were first made in germany
== major applications of detergents ==
=== laundry detergents ===
one of the largest applications of detergents is for washing clothes the formulations are complex reflecting the diverse demands of the application and the highly competitive consumer market in general laundry detergents contain water softeners surfactants bleach enzymes brighteners fragrances and many other agents the formulation is strongly affected by the temperature of the cleaning water and varies from country to country
the major components of laundry detergents is anionic surfactants alkaline builders water softening agents and anti re deposition agents higher end detergents contain enzymes and optical brighteners some liquid detergents contain non ionic surfactants
sodium tripolyphosphate was an excellent builder used in laundry detergent powders however due to issues of biodegradability many countries have banned the use of phosphates in detergents manufacturers are using substitutes such as edta and other biodegradable chemicals instead
=== fuel additives ===
both carburetors and fuel injector components of otto engines benefit from detergents in the fuels to prevent fouling concentrations are about 300 ppm typical detergents are long-chain amines and amides such as polyisobuteneamine and polyisobuteneamide/succinimide
=== biological reagent ===
reagent grade detergents are employed for the isolation and purification of integral membrane proteins found in biological cells solubilization of cell membrane bilayers requires a detergent that can enter the inner membrane monolayer advancements in the purity and sophistication of detergents have facilitated structural and biophysical characterization of important membrane proteins such as ion channels also the disrupt membrane by binding lps. transporters signaling receptors and photosystem ii
=== soapless soap ===
soapless soap refers to a soapfree liquid cleanser with a slightly acidic ph soapless soaps are used in an array of products
