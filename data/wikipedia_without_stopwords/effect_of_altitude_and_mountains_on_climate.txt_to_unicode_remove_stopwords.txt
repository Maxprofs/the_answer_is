altitude height sometimes known depth defined based context used aviation geometry geographical survey sport general definition altitude distance measurement usually vertical direction reference datum point object reference datum also often varies according context although term altitude commonly used mean height sea level location geography term elevation often preferred usage
vertical distance measurements direction commonly referred depth
altitude aviation
aviation term altitude several meanings always qualified either explicitly adding modifier eg true altitude implicitly context communication parties exchanging altitude information must clear definition used
aviation altitude measured using either mean sea level msl local ground level ground level agl reference datum
pressure altitude divided feet m flight level used transition altitude feet m us may low feet m jurisdictions altimeter reads ft standard pressure setting aircraft said flight level flying flight level altimeter always set standard pressure inhg hpa

several types aviation altitude
indicated altitude reading altimeter altimeter set local barometric pressure mean sea level uk aviation radiotelephony usage vertical distance level point object considered point measured mean sea level referred radio altitudesee qnh
absolute altitude height aircraft terrain flying measured using radar altimeter absolute altimeter also referred radar height feetmetres ground level agl
true altitude actual elevation mean sea level indicated altitude corrected nonstandard temperature pressure
height elevation ground reference point commonly terrain elevation uk aviation radiotelephony usage vertical distance level point object considered point measured specified datum referred radio height specified datum airfield elevation see qfe
pressure altitude elevation standard datum airpressure plane typically millibars hg pressure altitude used indicate flight level standard altitude reporting us class airspace roughly feet pressure altitude indicated altitude altimeter setting hg millibars
density altitude altitude corrected nonisa international standard atmosphere atmospheric conditions aircraft performance depends density altitude affected barometric pressure humidity temperature hot day density altitude airport especially one high elevation may high preclude takeoff particularly helicopters heavily loaded aircraft

absolute altitude altitude terms distance ground directly
true altitude altitude terms elevation sea level

altitude atmospheric studies
regions
earths atmosphere divided several altitude regions regions start finish varying heights depending season distance poles altitudes stated averages
troposphere surface metres mi poles metres mi equator ending tropopause
stratosphere troposphere kilometres mi
mesosphere stratosphere kilometres mi
thermosphere mesosphere kilometres mi
exosphere thermosphere kilometres mi
high altitude low pressure
regions earths surface atmosphere high mean sea level referred high altitude high altitude sometimes defined begin metres ft sea level
high altitude atmospheric pressure lower sea level due two competing physical effects gravity causes air close possible ground heat content air causes molecules bounce expand
lower pressure air expands rises causes cool thus high altitude air cold causes characteristic alpine climate climate dramatically affects ecology high altitude
relation temperature altitude earths atmosphere
environmental lapse rate elr rate decrease temperature altitude stationary atmosphere given time location average international civil aviation organization icao defines international standard atmosphere isa temperature lapse rate kc m f kc ft sea level kilometres ft kilometres ft constant temperature c f lowest assumed temperature isa standard atmosphere contains moisture unlike idealized isa temperature actual atmosphere always fall uniform rate height example inversion layer temperature increases height
altitude effects organisms
humans
medicine recognizes altitudes metres ft start affect humans record humans living extreme altitudes metres ft two years altitude increases atmospheric pressure decreases affects humans reducing partial pressure oxygen lack oxygen metres ft cause serious illnesses altitude sickness high altitude pulmonary edema high altitude cerebral edema higher altitude likely serious effects human body adapt high altitude breathing faster higher heart rate adjusting blood chemistry take days weeks adapt high altitude however metres ft death zone altitude acclimatization becomes impossible according traditional view research suggests adaptation possible
significantly lower overall mortality rate permanent residents higher altitudes additionally dose response relationship increasing elevation decreasing obesity prevalence united states addition recent hypothesis suggests high altitude could protective alzheimers disease via action erythropoietin hormone released kidney response hypoxia however people living higher elevations statistically significant higher rate suicide cause increased suicide risk unknown far
athletes
athletes high altitude produces two contradictory effects performance explosive events sprints metres long jump triple jump reduction atmospheric pressure signifies less atmospheric resistance generally results improved athletic performance endurance events races metres predominant effect reduction oxygen generally reduces athletes performance high altitude sports organizations acknowledge effects altitude performance international association athletic federations iaaf example marks record performances achieved altitude greater metres ft letter
athletes also take advantage altitude acclimatization increase performance changes help body cope high altitude increase performance back sea level changes basis altitude training forms integral part training athletes number endurance sports including track field distance running triathlon cycling swimming
organisms
decreased oxygen availability decreased temperature make life high altitude challenging despite environmental conditions many species successfully adapted high altitudes animals developed physiological adaptations enhance oxygen uptake delivery tissues used sustain metabolism strategies used animals adapt high altitude depend morphology phylogeny example small mammals face challenge maintaining body heat cold temperatures due large volume surface area ratio oxygen used source metabolic heat production hypobaric hypoxia high altitudes problematic
also general trend smaller body sizes lower species richness high altitudes likely due lower oxygen partial pressures factors may decrease productivity high altitude habitats meaning less energy available consumption growth activity
however species birdsthrive high altitude birds thrive physiological features advantageous highaltitude flight
