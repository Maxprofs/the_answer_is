== etymology ==
the english word province is attested since about 1330 and derives from the 13th-century old french province which itself comes from the latin word provincia which referred to the sphere of authority of a magistrate in particular to a foreign territory
a popular etymology is from latin"pro- ("on behalf of") and vincere ("to triumph or to take control of") thus a province would a territory or function that a roman magistrate held control of on behalf of his government in fact the word province is an ancient term from public law which means office belonging to a magistrate this agrees with the latin term's earlier usage as a generic term for a jurisdiction under roman law

the historic european provincesbuilt up of many small regions called pays by the french and cantons by the swiss each with a local cultural identity and focused upon a market townhave been depicted by fernand braudel as the optimum-size political unit in pre-industrial early modern europe he asks was the province not its inhabitants true fatherland'? even centrally-organized france an early nation-state could collapse into autonomous provincial worlds under pressure as during the sustained crisis of the french wars of religion (156298)

to 19th- and 20th-century historians in europe centralized government was a sign of modernity and political maturity in the late 20th century as the european union drew nation-states closer together centripetal forces seemed simultaneously to move countries toward more flexible systems of more localized provincial governing entities under the overall european union umbrella spain after francisco franco has been a state of autonomies formally unitary but in fact functioning as a federation of autonomous communities each exercising different powers (see politics of spain.)

== legal aspects ==
in many federations and confederations the province or state is not clearly subordinate to the national or central government rather it is considered to be sovereign in regard to its particular set of constitutional functions the central- and provincial-government functions or areas of jurisdiction are identified in a constitution those that are not specifically identified are called residual powers. in a decentralized federal system (such as the united states and australia) these residual powers lie at the provincial or state level whereas in a centralized federal system (such as canada) they are retained at the federal level
some of the enumerated powers can be quite important for example canadian provinces are sovereign in regard to such important matters as property civil rights education social welfare and medical services the growth of the modern welfare state has resulted in these functions assigned to the provinces becoming more important compared to those assigned to the federal government and thus provincial governments have become more important than the fathers of confederation originally intended
canada's status as a confederation of provinces under the dominion of the british empire rather than an independent country also had certain legal implications provinces could appeal court rulings over the heads of the supreme court of canada to the judicial committee of the privy council in london as well provinces could bypass the supreme court and go directly to london from any provincial court the canadian supreme court tended to support the view that the canadian constitution was intended to create a powerful central government but the privy council in london held a distinctly opposite view that the constitution provided for stronger provincial powers this provided an opportunity for forum shopping for provinces who opposed federal laws until appeals from canada to the privy council were abolished in 1949 in legal disputes the provincial governments tended to win powers at the expense of the federal government
in addition while the canadian federal government has unlimited taxing power while province governments are restricted to imposing direct taxes the canadian government introduced an income tax during world war i and since it is a direct tax it also became a major revenue generator for provinces in most provinces the federal government now collects income tax for both levels of government and transfers to the provincial governments whatever surcharge they ask for the sales tax also become a major revenue generator for provinces so in 1991 the canadian government introduced a goods and services tax (gst) to share the revenues which proved unpopular both with provincial governments and taxpayers the canadian government has tried to harmonize the two levels of sales taxes but three provinces continue to impose a separate sales tax (british columbia after harmonizing it and shortly thereafter de-harmonizing it after it was struck down by a referendum) while the province of alberta still does not impose a provincial sales tax
the evolution of federations has created an inevitable tug-of-war between concepts of federal supremacy versus states & provinces rights the historic division of responsibility in federal constitutions is inevitably subject to multiple overlaps for example when central governments responsible for foreign policy enter into international agreements in areas where the state or province is sovereign such as the environment or health standards agreements made at the national level can create jurisdictional overlap and conflicting laws this overlap creates the potential for internal disputes that lead to constitutional amendments and judicial decisions that alter the balance of powers
though foreign affairs do not usually fall under a provinces or a federal states competency some states allow them to legally conduct international relations on their own in matters of their constitutional prerogative and essential interest sub-national authorities have a growing interest in paradiplomacy be it performed under a legal framework or as a trend informally admitted as legitimate by the central authorities
in unitary states such as france and china provinces are subordinate to the national central government in theory the central government can create or abolish provinces within its jurisdiction on the other hand although canada is now considered a federal state and not a confederation in practice it is among the world's more decentralized federations canadian confederation and the constitution act 1867 conferred considerable power on the provincial governments which they often use to pursue their own goals independently of the federal government
in canada local governments have been called creatures of the province because the authority of a local government derives solely from the provincial government provinces can create merge and dissolve local governments without the consent of the federal government or the people in the affected locality alberta in particular dissolved and merged hundreds of local governments during the 1940s and 1950s as a consequence of the great depression other provinces have arbitrarily merged and annexed independent suburbs to major canadian cities such as toronto or montreal without the approval of local voters

because canada is the second largest country in the world by area most canadian provinces are very large six of its ten provinces are larger than any country in europe except russia and its largest province quebec 1,542,056 km2 (595,391 sq mi) is almost two and a half times as large as france 640,679 km2 (247,368 sq mi) five of the older canadian provinces ontario quebec new brunswick nova scotia and prince edward island have counties as administrative sub-divisions the actual local government form can vary widely since the canadian constitution assigns local government to provincial jurisdiction the various provinces can create dissolve and reorganize local governments freely and they have been described as creatures of the province the western provinces have more varied types of administrative sub-divisions than the eastern provinces and invent new types at will the province of british columbia has regional districts which function as equivalents of counties manitoba and saskatchewan have urban municipalities rural municipalities and special municipalities or northern municipalities most of alberta's rural municipalities brand themselves counties although in alberta the word has no legal significance and does not describe the government type
the province of alberta has some unusually creative solutions formed in response to local conditions for instance sherwood park is an unincorporated urban service area of 65,465 within strathcona county which has most of the oil refining capacity in western canada fort mcmurray was once a city but dissolved itself and became an urban service area of 70,964 people within the regional municipality (r.m.) of wood buffalo which has several multi-billion dollar oil sands plants and lloydminster a city of 31,483 which sits directly astride the provincial border between alberta and saskatchewan unlike most such cases lloydminster is not a pair of twin cities on opposite sides of a border but is actually incorporated by both provinces as a single city with a single municipal administration the residents objected to the federal government splitting the city in two when it created the two provinces so the two provinces reunified it by declaring it to be a single city in two provinces thereby bypassing the limitations of federal boundaries
