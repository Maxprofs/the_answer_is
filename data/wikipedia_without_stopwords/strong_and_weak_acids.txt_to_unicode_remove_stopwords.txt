acidbase extraction procedure using sequential liquidliquid extractions purify acids bases mixtures based chemical properties
acidbase extraction routinely performed workup chemical syntheses isolation compounds natural products like alkaloids crude extracts product largely free neutral acidic basic impurities possible separate chemically similar acids bases using simple method
theory
fundamental theory behind technique salts ionic tend watersoluble neutral molecules tend
addition acid mixture organic base acid result acid remaining uncharged base protonated form salt organic acid carboxylic acid sufficiently strong selfionization suppressed added acid
conversely addition base mixture organic acid base result base remaining uncharged acid deprotonated give corresponding salt selfionization strong base suppressed added base
acidbase extraction procedure also used separate weak acids stronger acids weak bases stronger bases long difference pka pkb constants large enough example
weak acids phenolic oh groups like phenol naphthol hydroxyindole pka around stronger acids like benzoic acid sorbic acid pka around
weak bases like caffeine nitroaniline pkb around stronger bases like mescaline dimethyltryptamine pkb around
usually ph adjusted value roughly pka pkb constants compounds separated weak acids like citric acid phosphoric acid diluted sulfuric acid used moderately acidic ph values hydrochloric acid concentrated sulfuric acid used strongly acidic ph values similarly weak bases like ammonia sodium bicarbonate nahco used moderately basic ph values stronger bases like potassium carbonate kco sodium hydroxide naoh used strongly alkaline conditions
technique
usually mixture dissolved suitable solvent dichloromethane diethyl ether ether poured separating funnel aqueous solution acid base added ph aqueous phase adjusted bring compound interest required form shaking allowing phase separation phase containing compound interest collected procedure repeated phase opposite ph range order step important process repeated increase separation however often convenient compound dissolved organic phase last step evaporation solvent yields product
limitations
procedure works acids bases large difference solubility charged uncharged form procedure work
zwitterions acidic basic functional groups molecule eg glycine tend watersoluble ph
lipophilic amines easily dissolve aqueous phase charged form eg triphenylamine trihexylamine
lipophilic acids easily dissolve aqueous phase charged form eg fatty acids
lower amines like ammonia methylamine triethanolamine miscible significantly soluble water ph
hydrophilic acids like acetic acid citric acid inorganic acids like sulfuric acid phosphoric acid
alternatives
alternatives acidbase extraction including
