during the 1980s members of the conservative party in britain who opposed some of the more hard-line policies of prime minister margaret thatcher were often referred to by their opponents as wets mrs thatcher coined the usage in 197980 with the meaning of feeble lacking hardness or willing to compromise with the unions the label was especially applied to senior members of the government who were nevertheless outside thatcher's inner circle and who expressed opposition to her strict monetarist policies designed to tackle inflation and her cuts to public spending
young (1989) identifies the most important inner wets as jim prior peter walker and sir ian gilmour as well as lord carrington and norman st john stevas the outer wets were more fragmented and less visible they included francis pym michael heseltine and lord hailsham
gilmour was the most outspoken delivering a lecture at cambridge in february 1980 where he argued in the conservative view economic liberalism la professor hayek because of its starkness and its failure to create a sense of community is not a safeguard of political freedom but a threat to it.
in retaliation to being labelled as wet thatcher's opponents within the party began referring to her supporters as the dries
policies which came to be labelled as dry ones included foremostly reducing public spending cutting taxes lowering interest rates tightly controlling the money supply and reducing the regulatory power of the state all policies which were closely associated with thatcher
outside of the parliamentary conservative party the youth sections of the party saw increasingly bitter factional battles between wets and dries the young conservatives remained in the hands of a strong wet, one nation (tory reform group) faction whilst the federation of conservative students fell to an alliance of libertarian and monday club supporters
