several types volcanic eruptionsduring lava tephra ash lapilli volcanic bombs blocks assorted gases expelled volcanic vent fissurehave distinguished volcanologists often named famous volcanoes type behavior observed volcanoes may exhibit one characteristic type eruption period activity others may display entire sequence types one eruptive series
three different types eruptions wellobserved magmatic eruptions involve decompression gas within magma propels forward phreatomagmatic eruptions another type volcanic eruption driven compression gas within magma direct opposite process powering magmatic activity third eruptive type phreatic eruption driven superheating steam via contact magma eruptive types often exhibit magmatic release instead causing granulation existing rock

eruption mechanismsedit
volcanic eruptions arise three main mechanisms
gas release decompression causing magmatic eruptions
thermal contraction chilling contact water causing phreatomagmatic eruptions
ejection entrained particles steam eruptions causing phreatic eruptions
two types eruptions terms activity explosive eruptions effusive eruptions explosive eruptions characterized gasdriven explosions propels magma tephra effusive eruptions meanwhile characterized outpouring lava without significant explosive eruption
volcanic eruptions vary widely strength one extreme effusive hawaiian eruptions characterized lava fountains fluid lava flows typically dangerous extreme plinian eruptions large violent highly dangerous explosive events volcanoes bound one eruptive style frequently display many different types passive explosive even span single eruptive cycle volcanoes always erupt vertically single crater near peak either volcanoes exhibit lateral fissure eruptions notably many hawaiian eruptions start rift zones strongest surtseyan eruptions develop along fracture zones scientists believed pulses magma mixed together chamber climbing upwarda process estimated take several thousands years columbia university volcanologists found eruption costa ricas iraz volcano likely triggered magma took nonstop route mantle months
