bats are mammals of the order chiroptera (/karptr/ from the greek - cheir hand and - pteron wing") whose forelimbs form webbed wings making them the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight by contrast other mammals said to fly such as flying squirrels gliding possums and colugos can only glide for short distances bats do not flap their entire forelimbs as birds do but instead flap their spread-out digits which are very long and covered with a thin membrane or patagium
bats are the second largest order of mammals (after the rodents) representing about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide with about 1,240 bat species divided into two suborders the less specialized and largely fruit-eating megabats or flying foxes and the highly specialized and echolocating microbats about 70% of bat species are insectivores most of the rest are frugivores or fruit eaters a few species such as the fish-eating bat feed from animals other than insects with the vampire bats being hematophagous or feeding on blood
bats are present throughout most of the world with the exception of extremely cold regions they perform vital ecological roles of pollinating flowers and dispersing fruit seeds many tropical plant species depend entirely on bats for the distribution of their seeds bats are economically important as they consume insect pests reducing the need for pesticides the smallest bat is the kitti's hog-nosed bat measuring 2934 mm (1.141.34 in) in length 15 cm (5.91 in) across the wings and 22.6 g (0.070.09 oz) in mass it is also arguably the smallest extant species of mammal with the etruscan shrew being the other contender the largest species of bat are a few species of pteropus (fruit bats or flying foxes) and the giant golden-crowned flying fox with a weight up to 1.6 kg (4 lb) and wingspan up to 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in)
== classification and evolution ==
bats are mammals in many languages the word for bat is cognate with the word for mouse for example chauve-souris ("bald-mouse") in french murcilago ("blind mouse") in spanish saguzahar ("old mouse") in basque ("flying mouse") in russian slijepi mi ("blind mouse") in bosnian nahkhiir ("leather mouse") in estonian vlermuis (winged mouse) in afrikaans from the dutch word vleermuis (from middle dutch winged mouse") an older english name for bats is flittermouse which matches their name in other germanic languages (for example german fledermaus and swedish fladdermus) bats were formerly thought to have been most closely related to the flying lemurs treeshrews and primates but recent molecular cladistics research indicates that they actually belong to laurasiatheria a diverse group also containing carnivora and artiodactyla
the two traditionally recognized suborders of bats are
megachiroptera (megabats)
microchiroptera (microbats/echolocating bats)
not all megabats are larger than microbats the major distinctions between the two suborders are
microbats use echolocation with the exception of the rousettus genus megabats do not
microbats lack the claw at the second finger of the forelimb
the ears of microbats do not close to form a ring the edges are separated from each other at the base of the ear
microbats lack underfur they are either naked or have guard hairs
megabats eat fruit nectar or pollen most microbats eat insects others may feed on fruit nectar pollen fish frogs small mammals or the blood of animals megabats have well-developed visual cortices and show good visual acuity while microbats rely on echolocation for navigation and finding prey
the phylogenetic relationships of the different groups of bats have been the subject of much debate the traditional subdivision between megachiroptera and microchiroptera reflects the view that these groups of bats have evolved independently of each other for a long time from a common ancestor already capable of flight this hypothesis recognized differences between microbats and megabats and acknowledged that flight has only evolved once in mammals most molecular biological evidence supports the view that bats form a single or monophyletic group
researchers have proposed alternative views of chiropteran phylogeny and classification but more research is needed
in the 1980s a hypothesis based on morphological evidence was offered that stated the megachiroptera evolved flight separately from the microchiroptera the so-called flying primates theory proposes that when adaptations to flight are removed the megachiroptera are allied to primates by anatomical features not shared with microchiroptera one example is that the brains of megabats show a number of advanced characteristics that link them to primates although recent genetic studies strongly support the monophyly of bats debate continues as to the meaning of available genetic and morphological evidence
genetic evidence indicates that megabats originated during the early eocene and should be placed within the four major lines of microbats
consequently two new suborders based on molecular data have been proposed the new suborder of yinpterochiroptera includes the pteropodidae or megabat family as well as the rhinolophidae hipposideridae craseonycteridae megadermatidae and rhinopomatidae families the other new suborder yangochiroptera includes all of the remaining families of bats (all of which use laryngeal echolocation) these two new suborders are strongly supported by statistical tests teeling (2005) found 100% bootstrap support in all maximum likelihood analyses for the division of chiroptera into these two modified suborders this conclusion is further supported by a 15-base-pair deletion in brca1 and a seven-base-pair deletion in plcb4 present in all yangochiroptera and absent in all yinpterochiroptera perhaps most convincingly a phylogenomic study by tsagkogeorga et al (2013) showed that the two new proposed suborders were supported by analyses of thousands of genes
the chiropteran phylogeny based on molecular evidence is controversial because microbat paraphyly implies that one of two seemingly unlikely hypotheses occurred the first suggests that laryngeal echolocation evolved twice in chiroptera once in yangochiroptera and once in the rhinolophoids the second proposes that laryngeal echolocation had a single origin in chiroptera was subsequently lost in the family pteropodidae (all megabats) and later evolved as a system of tongue-clicking in the genus rousettus
analyses of the sequence of the vocalization gene foxp2 were inconclusive as to whether laryngeal echolocation was secondarily lost in the pteropodids or independently gained in the echolocating lineages however analyses of the hearing gene prestin seemed to favor the independent gain in echolocating species rather than a secondary loss in the pteropodids
in addition to yinpterochiroptera and yangochiroptera the names pteropodiformes and vespertilioniformes have also been proposed for these suborders under this new proposed nomenclature the suborder pteropodiformes includes all extant bat families more closely related to the genus pteropus than the genus vespertilio while the suborder vespertilioniformes includes all extant bat families more closely related to the genus vespertilio than to the genus pteropus
little fossil evidence is available to help map the evolution of bats since their small delicate skeletons do not fossilize very well however a late cretaceous tooth from south america resembles that of an early microchiropteran bat most of the oldest known definitely identified bat fossils were already very similar to modern microbats these fossils icaronycteris archaeonycteris palaeochiropteryx and hassianycteris are from the early eocene period 52.5 million years ago archaeopteropus formerly classified as the earliest known megachiropteran is now classified as a microchiropteran
bats were formerly grouped in the superorder archonta along with the treeshrews (scandentia) colugos (dermoptera) and the primates because of the apparent similarities between megachiroptera and such mammals genetic studies have now placed bats in the superorder laurasiatheria along with carnivorans pangolins odd-toed ungulates even-toed ungulates and cetaceans a recent study by zhang et al places chiroptera as a sister taxon to the clade perissodactyla (which includes horses and other odd-toed ungulates) however the first phylogenomic analysis of bats shows that they are not sisters to perissodactyla instead they are sisters to a larger group that includes ungulates and carnivores
the traditional classification of bats is
order chiroptera
suborder megachiroptera (megabats)
pteropodidae
suborder microchiroptera (microbats)
superfamily emballonuroidea
emballonuridae (sac-winged or sheath-tailed bats)
superfamily molossoidea
molossidae (free-tailed bats)
superfamily nataloidea
furipteridae (smoky bats)
myzopodidae (sucker-footed bats)
natalidae (funnel-eared bats)
thyropteridae (disk-winged bats)
superfamily noctilionoidea
mormoopidae (ghost-faced or moustached bats)
mystacinidae (new zealand short-tailed bats)
noctilionidae (bulldog bats or fisherman bats)
phyllostomidae (leaf-nosed bats)
superfamily rhinolophoidea
megadermatidae (false vampires)
nycteridae (hollow-faced or slit-faced bats)
rhinolophidae (horseshoe bats)
hipposideridae (old world leaf-nosed bats)
superfamily rhinopomatoidea
craseonycteridae (bumblebee bat or kitti's hog-nosed bat)
rhinopomatidae (mouse-tailed bats)
superfamily vespertilionoidea
vespertilionidae (vesper bats or evening bats)
antrozoidae (pallid bat and van gelder's bat)
megabats primarily eat fruit or nectar in new guinea they are likely to have evolved for some time in the absence of microbats which has resulted in some smaller megabats of the genus nyctimene becoming (partly) insectivorous to fill the vacant microbat ecological niche furthermore some evidence indicates that the fruit bat genus pteralopex from the solomon islands and its close relative mirimiri from fiji have evolved to fill some niches that were open because there are no nonvolant or nonflying mammals on those islands
=== fossil bats ===
fossilized remains of bats are few as they are terrestrial and light-boned only an estimated 12% of the bat fossil record is complete at the genus level fossil remains of an eocene bat icaronycteris were found in 1960 another eocene bat onychonycteris finneyi was found in the 52-million-year-old green river formation in wyoming united states in 2003 this intermediate fossil has helped to resolve a long-standing disagreement regarding whether flight or echolocation developed first in bats the shape of the rib cage faceted infraspious fossa of the scapula manus morphology robust clavicle and keeled sternum all indicated onychonycteris was capable of powered flight however the well-preserved skeleton showed that the small cochlea of the inner ear did not have the morphology necessary to echolocate o finneyi lacked an enlarged orbical apophysis on the malleus and a stylohyal element with an expanded paddle-like cranial tipboth of which are characteristics linked to echolocation in other prehistoric and extant bat species because of these absences and the presence of characteristics necessary for flight onychonycteris provides strong support for the flight first hypothesis in the evolution of flight and echolocation in bats
the appearance and flight movement of bats 52.5 million years ago were different from those of bats today onychonycteris had claws on all five of its fingers whereas modern bats have at most two claws appearing on two digits of each hand it also had longer hind legs and shorter forearms similar to climbing mammals that hang under branches such as sloths and gibbons this palm-sized bat had short broad wings suggesting it could not fly as fast or as far as later bat species instead of flapping its wings continuously while flying onychonycteris likely alternated between flaps and glides while in the air such physical characteristics suggest that this bat did not fly as much as modern bats do rather flying from tree to tree and spending most of its waking day climbing or hanging on the branches of trees the distinctive features noted on the onychonycteris fossil also support the claim that mammalian flight most likely evolved in arboreal gliders rather than terrestrial runners this model of flight development commonly known as the trees-down theory implies that bats attained powered flight by taking advantage of height and gravity rather than relying on running speeds fast enough for a ground-level take off
the mid-eocene genus necromantis is one of the earliest examples of bats specialised to hunt vertebrate prey as well as one of the largest bats of its epoch
== habitats ==
flight has enabled bats to become one of the most widely distributed groups of mammals apart from the arctic the antarctic and a few isolated oceanic islands bats exist all over the world bats are found in almost every habitat available on earth different species select different habitats during different seasons ranging from seasides to mountains and even deserts but bat habitats have two basic requirements roosts where they spend the day or hibernate and places for foraging most temperate species additionally need a relatively warm hibernation shelter bat roosts can be found in hollows crevices foliage and even human-made structures and include tents the bats construct by biting leaves
the united states is home to an estimated 45 to 48 species of bats the three most common species are myotis lucifugus (little brown bat) eptesicus fuscus (big brown bat) and tadarida brasiliensis (mexican free-tailed bat) the little and the big brown bats are common throughout the northern two-thirds of the country while the mexican free-tailed bat is the most common species in the southwest sometimes even appearing in portions of the southeast
== anatomy ==
=== wings ===
the finger bones of bats are much more flexible than those of other mammals owing to their flattened cross-section and to low levels of minerals such as calcium near their tips in 2006 sears et al published a study that traces the elongation of manual bat digits a key feature required for wing development to the upregulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (bmps) during embryonic development the gene controlling bmp signaling bmp2 is subjected to increased expression in bat forelimbs - resulting in the extension of the offspring's manual digits this crucial genetic alteration helps create the specialized limbs required for volant locomotion sears et al (2006) also studied the relative proportion of bat forelimb digits from several extant species and compared these with a fossil of lcaronycteris index an early extinct species from approximately 50 million years ago the study found no significant differences in relative digit proportion suggesting that bat wing morphology has been conserved for over 50 million years
the wings of bats are much thinner and consist of more bones than the wings of birds allowing bats to maneuver more accurately than the latter and fly with more lift and less drag by folding the wings in toward their bodies on the upstroke they save 35 percent energy during flight the membranes are also delicate ripping easily however the tissue of the bat's membrane is able to regrow such that small tears can heal quickly the surface of their wings is equipped with touch-sensitive receptors on small bumps called merkel cells also found on human fingertips these sensitive areas are different in bats as each bump has a tiny hair in the center making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat to detect and collect information about the air flowing over its wings and to fly more efficiently by changing the shape of its wings in response an additional kind of receptor cell is found in the wing membrane of species that use their wings to catch prey this receptor cell is sensitive to the stretching of the membrane the cells are concentrated in areas of the membrane where insects hit the wings when the bats capture them
=== other ===
the teeth of microbats resemble insectivorans they are very sharp to bite through the hardened armor of insects or the skin of fruit
mammals have one-way valves in their veins to prevent the blood from flowing backwards but bats also have one-way valves in their arteries
the tube-lipped nectar bat (anoura fistulata) has the longest tongue of any mammal relative to its body size this is beneficial to them in terms of pollination and feeding their long narrow tongues can reach deep into the long cup shape of some flowers when the tongue retracts it coils up inside its rib cage
bats possess highly adapted lung systems to cope with the pressures of powered-flight flight is an energetically taxing aerobic activity and requires large amounts of oxygen to be sustained in bats the relative alveolar surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume are significantly larger than most other small quadrupedal mammals
== echolocation ==
bat echolocation is a perceptual system where ultrasonic sounds are emitted specifically to produce echoes by comparing the outgoing pulse with the returning echoes the brain and auditory nervous system can produce detailed images of the bat's surroundings this allows bats to detect localize and even classify their prey in complete darkness at 130 decibels in intensity bat calls are some of the most intense airborne animal sounds
to clearly distinguish returning information bats must be able to separate their calls from the echoes that they receive microbats use two distinct approaches
low duty cycle echolocation bats can separate their calls and returning echoes by time bats that use this approach time their short calls to finish before echoes return this is important because these bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call so they can avoid deafening themselves the time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles so they can clearly hear the returning echo the delay of the returning echoes provides the bat with the ability to estimate the range to their prey
high duty cycle echolocation bats emit a continuous call and separate pulse and echo in frequency the ears of these bats are sharply tuned to a specific frequency range they emit calls outside of this range to avoid self-deafening they then receive echoes back at the finely tuned frequency range by taking advantage of the doppler shift of their motion in flight the doppler shift of the returning echoes yields information relating to the motion and location of the bat's prey these bats must deal with changes in the doppler shift due to changes in their flight speed they have adapted to change their pulse emission frequency in relation to their flight speed so echoes still return in the optimal hearing range
the new yinpterochiroptera and yangochiroptera classification of bats supported by molecular evidence suggests two possibilities for the evolution of echolocation it may have been gained once in a common ancestor of all bats and was then subsequently lost in the old world fruit bats only to be regained in the horseshoe bats or echolocation evolved independently in both the yinpterochiroptera and yangochiroptera lineages
two groups of moths exploit a bat sense to echolocate tiger moths produce ultrasonic signals to warn the bats that they (the moths) are chemically protected or aposematic other moth species produce signals to jam bat echolocation many moth species have a hearing organ called a tympanum which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically sending the moth into random evasive maneuvers
in addition to echolocating prey bat ears are sensitive to the fluttering of moth wings the sounds produced by tymbalate insects and the movement of ground-dwelling prey such as centipedes earwigs etc the complex geometry of ridges on the inner surface of bat ears helps to sharply focus not only echolocation signals but also to passively listen for any other sound produced by the prey these ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a fresnel lens and may be seen in a large variety of unrelated animals such as the aye-aye lesser galago bat-eared fox mouse lemur and others
by repeated scanning bats can mentally construct an accurate image of the environment in which they are moving and of their prey item
=== other senses ===
although the eyes of most microbat species are small and poorly developed leading to poor visual acuity no species is blind microbats use vision to navigate especially for long distances when beyond the range of echolocation and species that are gleanersthat is ones that attempt to swoop down from above to ambush tasty insects like crickets on the ground or moths up a treeoften have eyesight about as good as a rat's some species have been shown to be able to detect ultraviolet light and most cave dwelling species have developed the ability to utilize very dim light they also have high-quality senses of smell and hearing bats hunt at night reducing competition with birds minimizing contact with certain predators and travel large distances (up to 800 km) in their search for food
megabat species often have excellent eyesight as good as if not better than human vision they need this for the warm climates they live in and the very social world they occupy where relations and friends need to be distinguished from other bats in the colony this eyesight is unlike its microbat relations adapted to both night and daylight vision and enables the bat to have some colour vision whereas the microbat sees in blurred shades of grey
== behaviour ==
most microbats are nocturnal and are active at twilight a large portion of bats migrate hundreds of kilometres to winter hibernation dens while some pass into torpor in cold weather rousing and feeding when warm weather allows for insects to be active others retreat to caves for winter and hibernate for six months bats rarely fly in rain as the rain interferes with their echolocation and they are unable to locate their food
the social structure of bats varies with some leading solitary lives and others living in caves colonized by more than a million bats the fission-fusion social structure is seen among several species of bats the term fusion refers to a large numbers of bats that congregate in one roosting area and fission refers to breaking up and the mixing of subgroups with individual bats switching roosts with others and often ending up in different trees and with different roostmates
studies also show that bats make all kinds of sounds to communicate with others scientists in the field have listened to bats and have been able to associate certain sounds with certain behaviours that bats make after the sounds are made
insectivores make up 70% of bat species and locate their prey by means of echolocation of the remainder most feed on fruits only three species sustain themselves with blood
some species even prey on vertebrates the leaf-nosed bats (phyllostomidae) of central america and south america and the two bulldog bat (noctilionidae) species feed on fish at least two species of bat are known to feed on other bats the spectral bat also known as the american false vampire bat and the ghost bat of australia one species the greater noctule bat catches and eats small birds in the air
predators of bats include bat hawks bat falcons and even spiders
=== reproduction ===
most bats have a breeding season which is in the spring for species living in a temperate climate bats may have one to three litters in a season depending on the species and on environmental conditions such as the availability of food and roost sites females generally have one offspring at a time which could be a result of the mother's need to fly to feed while pregnant female bats nurse their young until they are nearly adult size because a young bat cannot forage on its own until its wings are fully developed
female bats use a variety of strategies to control the timing of pregnancy and the birth of young to make delivery coincide with maximum food ability and other ecological factors females of some species have delayed fertilization in which sperm is stored in the reproductive tract for several months after mating in many such cases mating occurs in the fall and fertilization does not occur until the following spring other species exhibit delayed implantation in which the egg is fertilized after mating but remains free in the reproductive tract until external conditions become favorable for giving birth and caring for the offspring
in yet another strategy fertilization and implantation both occur but development of the fetus is delayed until favorable conditions prevail during the delayed development the mother still gives the fertilized egg nutrients and oxygenated blood to keep it alive however this process can go for a long period of time because of the advanced gas exchange system all of these adaptations result in the pup being born during a time of high local production of fruit or insects
at birth the wings are too small to be used for flight young microbats become independent at the age of six to eight weeks while megabats do not until they are four months old
=== life expectancy ===
a single bat can live over 20 years but bat population growth is limited by the slow birth rate
=== hunting feeding and drinking ===
newborn bats rely on the milk from their mothers when they are a few weeks old bats are expected to fly and hunt on their own it is up to them to find and catch their prey along with satisfying their thirst
==== hunting ====
most bats are nocturnal creatures their daylight hours are spent grooming and sleeping they hunt during the night the means by which bats navigate while finding and catching their prey in the dark was unknown until the 1790s when lazzaro spallanzani conducted a series of experiments on a group of blind bats these bats were placed in a room in total darkness with silk threads strung across the room even then the bats were able to navigate their way through the room spallanzani concluded the bats were not using their eyes to fly through complete darkness but something else
spallanzani decided the bats were able to catch and find their prey through the use of their ears to prove this theory spallanzani plugged the ears of the bats in his experiment to his pleasure he found that the bats with plugged ears were not able to fly with the same amount of skill and precision as they were able to without their ears plugged unfortunately for spallanzani the twin concepts of sound waves and acoustics would not be understood for another century and he could not explain why specifically the bats were crashing into walls and the threads that he'd strung up around the room and because of the methodology spallanzani used many of his test subjects died
it was thus well known through the nineteenth century that the chiropteran ability to navigate had something to do with hearing but how they accomplish this was not proven conclusively until the 1930s by donald r griffin a biology student at harvard university using a locally native species the little brown bat he discovered that bats use echolocation to locate and catch their prey when bats fly they produce a constant stream of high-pitched sounds when the sound waves produced by these sounds hit an insect or other animal the echoes bounce back to the bat and guide them to the source
==== feeding and diet ====
the majority of food consumed by bats includes insects fruits and flower nectar vertebrates and blood almost three-fourths of the world's bats are insect eaters bats consume both aerial and ground-dwelling insects each bat is typically able to consume one-third of its body weight in insects each night and several hundred insects in a few hours this means that a group of a thousand bats could eat four tons of insects each year if bats were to become extinct it has been calculated that the insect population would reach an alarmingly high number
===== vitamin c =====
in a test of 34 bat species from six major families of bats including major insect- and fruit-eating bat families all were found to have lost the ability to synthesize vitamin c and this loss may derive from a common bat ancestor as a single mutation however recent results show that there are at least two species of bat the frugivorous bat (rousettus leschenaultii) and insectivorous bat (hipposideros armiger) that have retained their ability to produce vitamin c in fact the whole chiroptera are in the process of losing the ability to synthesize vc which most of them have already lost
===== aerial insectivores =====
watching a bat catch and eat an insect is difficult the action is so fast that all one sees is a bat rapidly change directions and continue on its way scientist frederick a webster discovered how bats catch their prey in 1960 webster developed a high-speed camera that was able to take one thousand pictures per second these photos revealed the fast and precise way in which bats catch insects occasionally a bat will catch an insect in mid-air with its mouth and eat it in the air however more often than not a bat will use its tail membrane or wings to scoop up the insect and trap it in a sort of bug net then the bat will take the insect back to its roost there the bat will proceed to eat said insect often using its tail membrane as a kind of napkin to prevent its meal from falling to the ground one common insect prey is helicoverpa zea a moth that causes major agricultural damage
===== forage gleaners =====
these bats typically fly down and grasp their prey off the ground with their teeth and take it to a nearby perch to eat it generally these bats do not use echolocation to locate their prey instead they rely on the sounds produced by the insects some make unique sounds and almost all make some noise while moving through the environment
===== fruits and flower nectar =====
fruit eating or frugivory is a specific habit found in two families of bats megachiropterans and microchiropterans both include species of bat that feed on fruits these bats feed on the juices of sweet fruits and fulfill the needs of some seeds to be dispersed the fruits preferred by most fruit-eating bats are fleshy and sweet but not particularly strong smelling or colorful to get the juice of these fruits bats pull the fruit off the trees with their teeth and fly back to their roosts with the fruit in their mouths there the bats will consume the fruit in a specific way to do this the bats crush open the fruit and eat the parts that satisfy their hunger the remainder of the fruit the seeds and pulp are spat onto the ground these seeds take root and begin to grow into new fruit trees over 150 types of plants depend on bats in order to reproduce
some bats prefer the nectar of flowers to insects or other animals these bats have evolved specifically for this purpose for example these bats possess long muzzles and long extensible tongues covered in fine bristles that aid them in feeding on particular flowers and plants when they sip the nectar from these flowers pollen gets stuck to their fur and is dusted off when the bats take flight thus pollinating the plants below them the rainforest is said to be the most benefitted of all the biomes where bats live because of the large variety of appealing plants because of their specific eating habits nectar-feeding bats are more prone to extinction than any other type of bat however bats benefit from eating fruits and nectar just as much as from eating insects
===== vertebrates =====
a small group of carnivorous bats feed on other vertebrates and are considered the top carnivores of the bat world these bats typically eat a variety of animals but normally consume frogs lizards birds and sometimes other bats for example one vertebrate predator trachops cirrhosus is particularly skilled at catching frogs these bats locate large groups of frogs by distinguishing their mating calls from other sounds around them they follow the sounds to the source and pluck them from the surface of the water with their sharp canine teeth another example is the greater noctule bat which is believed to catch birds on the wing
also several species of bat feed on fish these types of bats are found on almost all continents they use echolocation to detect tiny ripples in the water's surface to locate fish from there the bats swoop down low inches from the water and use specially enlarged claws on their hind feet to grab the fish out of the water the bats then take the fish to a feeding roost and consume the animal
===== blood =====
a few species of bats exclusively consume blood as their diet this type of diet is referred to as hematophagy and three species of bats exhibit this behavior these species are the common the white-winged and the hairy-legged vampire bats the common vampire bat typically consumes the blood of mammals while the hairy-legged and white-winged vampires feed on the blood of birds these species live only in mexico central and south america with a presence also on the island of trinidad
==== defecation ====
bat dung or guano is so rich in nutrients that it is mined from caves bagged and used by farmers to fertilize their crops during the u.s civil war guano was used to make gunpowder
to survive hibernation months some species build up large reserves of body fat both as fuel and as insulation
==== drinking ====
in 1960 frederic a webster discovered bats method of drinking water using a high-speed camera and flashgun that could take 1,000 photos per second webster's camera captured a bat skimming the surface of a body of water and lowering its jaw to get just one drop of water it then skimmed again to get a second drop of water and so on until it has had its fill a bat's precision and control during flight is very fine and it almost never misses other bats such as the flying fox or fruit bat gently skim the water's surface then land nearby to lick water from chest fur
== conservation efforts ==
through conservancy efforts of groups such as the organization for bat conservation and bat conservation international bats are becoming better understood and people beginning to understand the crucial role bats play in insect control and pollination
in the united kingdom all bats are protected under the wildlife and countryside acts and even disturbing a bat or its roost can be punished with a heavy fine
in sarawak malaysia bats are protected species under the wildlife protection ordinance 1998 (see malaysian wildlife law) the large naked bat (see mammals of borneo) and greater nectar bat are consumed by the local communities
bats can be a tourist attraction the congress avenue bridge in austin texas is the summer home to north america's largest urban bat colony an estimated 1,500,000 mexican free-tailed bats which eat an estimated 10,000 to 30,000 pounds of insects each night an estimated 100,000 tourists per year visit the bridge at twilight to watch the bats leave the roost
=== artificial roosts ===
many people put up bat houses to attract bats just as some put up birdhouses to attract birds reasons for this vary but most revolve around the bats being the primary nocturnal insectivores in most if not all ecologies bat houses can be made from scratch or from kits or bought ready made plans for bat houses exist on many web sites as well as guidelines for designing a bat house
constructed in march 1991 the university of florida bat house is the largest occupied artificial roost in the world the bat house has approximately 300,000 insect-eating residents these bats can eat upwards of 2.5 billion bugs (2,500 pounds or 1,100 kilograms) per night
a 1987 fire caused a colony of bats residing in johnson hall's attic to become homeless this forced them to move to the james g pressly stadium on the north side of campus the odor and the guano from this newly arrived colony did not please spectators thus furthering the movement for a new bat-ordained structure in september 1991 thousands of bats were captured and transported to the newly built bat house in the following evenings these bats flew away and found new homes for three years the bat house remained empty finally in 1995 the bats moved in permanently and the colony continued to grow the colony grew so much that in 2009 part of the original bat house collapsed and a new bat barn was constructed next to it along with that the interior of the original was rebuilt
in britain british hardened field defences of world war ii have been converted to make roosts for bats pillboxes that are well dug-in and thick-walled are naturally damp and provide the stable thermal environment required by bats that would otherwise hibernate in caves with a few minor modifications suitable pillboxes can be converted to artificial caves for bats
again in the uk purpose-built bat houses are occasionally built when existing roosts are destroyed by developments such as new roads one such has been built associated with bat bridges on the new (2008) a38 dobwalls bypass
=== nectar-rich plants attracting moths ===
besides mosquitoes some species of bats also consume moths moths benefit from the availability of nectar-rich plants
=== threats ===
while conservation efforts are in place to protect bats many threats still remain bats are known to carry diseases communicable to humans such as rabies
==== white nose syndrome ====
white nose syndrome is a condition associated with the deaths of millions of bats in the eastern united states and canada the disease is named after a white fungus pseudogymnoascus destructans found growing on the muzzles ears and wings of afflicted bats this fungus which is mostly spread from bat to bat is the sole cause of the disease the fungus was first discovered in central new york state in 2006 and spread quickly to the entire eastern us north of florida mortality rates of 90100% have been observed in most caves new england and the mid-atlantic states have since 2006 witnessed entire species completely extirpated and others with numbers that have gone from the hundreds of thousands even millions to a few hundred or less as of june 2014 this fungus is doing a large amount of damage to the populations of bats that use the caves of the appalachian mountains in the southeastern united states including the mammoth cave system in kentucky which was one of the largest hibernacula in the east as recently as 2010 able to hold over a million bats in canada the provinces of quebec ontario and the maritimes have witnessed identical die offs with the canadian government making preparations to protect the remaining bat populations in manitoba alberta saskatchewan and british columbia since scientific evidence suggests that longer winters where the fungus has a longer period of time to infect bats is a threat to canadian bats
scientists in both countries are alarmed that the lack of bug-eating bats in summer could cause severe problems in the ecosystem of the eastern forests and on farmland and beyond nearly all of the bats continental us and canada are insectivores and save the government billions in pesticides because they are natural predators of bugs that eat crops like cabbages potatoes pears cherries peaches apples wheat and corn consuming tons of them from late may-early october which coincides with the height of planting and harvest they are also facing the possibility that once common species with robust numbers could go extinct given the rapid progress the disease has made in less than a decade there is evidence that at least one species the little brown bat has started to change its roosting behavior which scientists hope may yet save the species from extinction unfortunately this does not negate the fact that their numbers have undergone a very steep crash they were up until 2008 the most common bat in the east and were often seen catching moths attracted to street lamps in new york city montreal and the average small town they were once so common in the average town that citizens often discovered them roosting in maternity colonies in late spring in their attics as of 2014 scientists are reckoning that unless something changes soon the subspecies myotis lucifugus lucifugus may face total population collapse since the population of survivors is dangerously low in an area nearly the size of france in july 2014 the us state of maine recorded a population of this subspecies that is now so low that it and the northern long eared bat are candidates for the state endangered species list after both being plentiful only seven years earlier
the most recent scholarship suggests that the pseudogymnoascus fungus is native to europe where it is part of the naturally occurring biota found on the walls of caves and is harmless to the myotis bentwing pipistrelle and horseshoe bat species that live there however as a novel pathogen it has proven to be lethal to north american bat species that utilise caves or abandoned mines unlike european species most cave dwelling north american bat species form very large winter colonies that can number from a few hundred to many thousands with bats forming tight clusters on the walls and ceilings of caves and mines most north american species shall even migrate many hundreds of miles in september from other states to a very specific type of cave or mine that has a constant temperature of 7.2 c to 10 c they cluster together to conserve body heat and counteract the (compared to most of europe) colder winter temperatures that may blow in from outer portions of the hibernaculum without the natural immunities of their european cousins these north american bats go into hibernation in autumn a few weeks before halloween often forming huge swarms of males and females outside the cave or mine entrance that join up to mate before going off to sleep until spring comes in late march normally they will have been eating moths beetles mosquitoes potato bugs and flies all summer long and have gained weight to prepare for winter however once they enter torpor their immune system response is suppressed to conserve energy and hibernate through winter eventually the bat becomes infected by the fungus the fungus desiccates the bat's wings upsetting hydrostatic balance and the bat chronically thirsty is forced to wake up more often than it must using up its fat reserves and eventually dying from dehydration and starvation by then it will have infected several more of its neighbours in the cluster over time causing hundreds or even thousands to die in a single winter this number includes what would have been the following seasons offspring dead with the pregnant mothers and has a knock on effect on the populations in other states and provinces that never see the return of migratory bats in spring aeolus cave in new england had a headcount numbering 300,000 in 2008 when scientists went to make their count in the spring of 2014 more than 270,000 had already perished and the floors of the caves were covered up to the ankles of researchers with the bones of thousands of bats
species thus far that have been badly affected include the little brown bat the endangered gray myotis the endangered indiana bat the northern long-eared myotis the eastern small-footed myotis the tri-coloured bat and two subspecies of townsend's big-eared bat more than half of all bat species that live in north america use caves at some point in their life cycle in the east though infected specimens have been caught only tree dwelling bats of the lasiurus family and eptesicus fuscus a relative of the serotine bat seem to have been minimally affected these species are far less dependent on caves for their winter survival and the last mentioned species does not cluster tightly if it is underground at all and will also accept manmade structures to hibernate in as of 2014 the geographical spread of white nose syndrome in north american bats has worsened in the sense that infection has crossed the mississippi river species native to northern mexico and the west have not yet been affected but it remains unknown how or if white nose syndrome shall affect bat species here all north american bat species have a very slow reproductive rate with the exception of a handful of species like the little brown bat which occasionally gives birth to twins most females give birth to only one pup a year though measures are being taken to slow the spread of the disease and a cure is being sought the recovery of bats in north america may take decades if not centuries due to this fungus and the prognosis for the future of bats is grim
==== barotrauma and wind turbines ====
evidence suggests barotrauma is causing bat fatalities around wind farms the lungs of bats are typical mammalian lungs and unlike the lungs of birds they are thought to be more sensitive to sudden air pressure changes in their immediate vicinity such as near wind turbines and are more liable to rupture bats suffer a higher death rate than birds in the neighborhood of wind turbines since there are no signs of external trauma the cause has been hypothesized to be a greater sensitivity to sudden pressure fluctuations in the mammalian lung than in that of birds in addition it has been suggested that bats are attracted to these structures perhaps seeking roosts and thereby increasing the death rate acoustic deterrents may prove beneficial in mitigating bat mortality at wind energy facilities
==== pathogens and role in the transmission of zoonoses ====
among ectoparasites bats occasionally carry fleas but are one of the few mammalian orders that cannot host lice (most of the others are water animals)
bats are natural reservoirs for a large number of zoonotic pathogens including rabies severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) henipavirus (i.e nipah virus and hendra virus) and possibly ebola virus their high mobility broad distribution and social behaviour (communal roosting and fission-fusion social structure) make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease many species also appear to have a high tolerance for harbouring pathogens and often do not develop disease while infected however contrary to folklore this is not true of rabies which is as fatal to bats as it is to all other species however a bat may be ill with rabies for a longer time than other mammals
in regions where rabies is endemic only 0.5% of bats carry the disease in the united states bats typically constitute around a quarter of reported cases of rabies in wild animals however their bites account for the vast majority of cases of rabies in humans of the 36 cases of domestically acquired rabies recorded in the country in 19952010 two were caused by dog bites and four patients were infected by receiving transplants from an organ donor who had previously died of rabies all other cases were caused by bat bites rabies is considered fully preventable if the patient is administered a vaccine prior to the onset of symptoms however unlike raccoon or skunk bites bat bites may go ignored or unnoticed and hence untreated rabid bats are broadly distributed throughout the united states in 20082010 cases were reported in every state except alaska and hawaii and puerto rico
rabid bats may be clumsy disoriented and unable to fly which makes it more likely they will come into contact with humans one should avoid handling them or having them in one's living space as with any wild animal if a bat is found in living quarters near a child mentally handicapped person intoxicated person sleeping person or pet living in an area where rabies is known to occur the person or pet should receive immediate medical attention for rabies bats have very small teeth and can bite a sleeping person without being felt there is evidence that bat rabies virus can infect victims purely through airborne transmission ("cryptic rabies") without direct physical contact of the victim with the bat itself this phenomenon has very rarely been reported and has occurred among victims breathing virus-infected air in environments such as caves after long exposures
if a bat is found in a house and the possibility of exposure cannot be ruled out the bat should be sequestered and an animal control officer called immediately so that the bat can be analysed this also applies if the bat is found dead if it is certain that nobody has been exposed to the bat it should be removed from the house the best way to do this with live bats is to close all the doors and windows to the room except one that opens to the outside the bat should soon leave
due to the risk of rabies and to health problems related to their faecal droppings in some regions bats should be excluded from inhabited parts of houses the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) provide fully detailed information on all aspects of bat management in north america including how to capture a bat what to do in case of exposure and how to bat-proof a house humanely in certain countries such as the united kingdom it is illegal to handle bats without a license and advice should be sought from an expert organisation such as the bat conservation trust if a trapped or injured bat is found
where rabies is not endemic as throughout most of western europe small bats can be considered harmless larger bats can give a nasty bite
== bats in human culture ==
=== mythology ===
in european cultures bats have long been associated with witchcraft black magic and darkness the weird sisters incorporate the fur of a bat in their brew in shakespeare's macbeth written around 1603-1605 because bats are mammals yet can fly this gives them status as liminal beings in many cultural traditions in western culture the bat is often a symbol of the night and its foreboding nature the bat is a primary animal associated with fictional characters of the night both villains such as dracula and heroes such as batman the association of the fear of the night with the animal was treated as a literary challenge by kenneth oppel who created a best-selling series of novels beginning with silverwing which feature bats as the central heroic figures much as anthropomorphized rabbits were the central figures to the classic novel watership down
among some native americans such as the creek cherokee and apache the bat is a trickster spirit in tanzania a winged bat cryptid known as popobawa is believed to be a shapeshifting evil spirit that assaults and sodomises its victims
not all legends surrounding bats are negative chinese lore claims that the bat is a symbol of longevity and happiness and is similarly lucky in poland geographical macedonia and among the kwakiutl and arabs
an old wives tale has it that bats will entangle themselves in people's hair one likely source of this belief is that insect-eating bats seeking prey may dive erratically toward people who attract mosquitoes and gnats leading the squeamish to believe the bats are trying to get in their hair
==== aztec ====
in mesoamerican mythology during the classic-contemporary period bats symbolized the land of the dead which was considered to be the underworld they also symbolized destruction and decay bats may have symbolized in this way because they fly only at night and dwell in caves during the daytime and are associated with human skulls and bones by classic maya ceramists central mexicans sometimes depicted bats having snouts that looked like sacrificial knives and carrying human head in the postclassic era bat images were engraved onto funerary urns and were emphasized with large claws and round ears by zapotecs they were commonly associated with death the depiction of bats on funeral urns and goods took on some the characteristics of the jaguar which was and still is another entity of the night and the underworld there have also been instances where bats are portrayed next to other animals portrayed negatively in mesoamerica including scorpions and other nocturnal animals such as owls pre-columbian cultures associated animals with gods and often displayed them in art the moche people depicted bats in their ceramics
a life-size ceramic bat-man was discovered and dug up from the templo mayor the templo mayor is located in the center of the mexica capital of tenochtitlan known as a god of death this statue has the clawed feet and hands of a bat but the body of a man the statue's human-like eyes bulged out from the bat-like head making the zapotec images very realistic and living in the 1930s the kaqchikel maya were said to have proclaimed the bat was the devil's provider kaqchikel would leave the devil's underworld home and collect blood from the animals to be used for scrumptious meals to feed the devil in the myths the beast of prey and the animal that is preyed upon play two significant roles they represent two aspects of lifethe aggressive killing conquering creating aspect of life and the one that is the matter or you might say the subject matter in the devil's underworld dead sinners would work off their sins to get to heaven indicating the bat too was a sinner and worked under the authority of the devil
==== oaxaca ====
according to oaxacan mythology the bat's nocturnal nature can be traced back to its ancient jealousy of birds feathers one day as the myth goes the bat felt isolated and undesirable and told god that he was cold god fair and just turned to birds in the animal kingdom and asked if they would show compassion and donate a feather to the bat to help him keep warm the birds all agreed and began to pluck one feather from their bodies to give to the bat with all of these feathers the bat became even more magnificent-looking than all birds and was able to spread color to the night sky during daylight the bat created rainbows that reflected vibrant colors from the sun with his new beauty and abilities the bat soon became arrogant and conceited the birds grew tired of the bat's self-glorification and decided to fly up to heaven and ask god to do something when the birds told god of the bat's behaviour he was surprised and decided to take a look himself when on earth god called on the bat to show him what he was doing the bat began to fly across the light blue sky where one by one each feather began to fall out uncovering the bat's natural ugly-looking body when all his feathers were gone the bat became distressed and ashamed of his appearance he decided to hide in caves during the day and only come out during the night to search for his long-lost feathers
==== east nigeria ====
according to a particular east nigerian tale the bat developed its nocturnal habits after causing the death of his partner the bush-rat the bat and the bush-rat would share activities such as rummaging through the grass and trees hunting talking and bonding during the day when at night the bat and the bush-rat would alternate in cooking duties cooking what was caught and eat together it appeared to be a dedicated partnership but the bat hated the bush-rat immensely the bush-rat always found the bat's soup more appetising so when eating dinner one night asked the bat why the soup tasted better than his own and also asked how it was made the bat agreed to show him how to make it the next day but instead was forming a malicious plan
next day as the bat prepared his soup the bush-rat came greeting him and asking if he could be shown what was agreed yesterday earlier the bat had found a pot looking exactly like the one he used usually but it held warm water and so decided to use this instead the bat explained to the bush-rat that to make his soup he had to boil himself prior to serving the soup where sweetness and flavor of the soup came from the flesh the bat jumped in the pot seemingly excited with the bush-rat mesmerised after a few minutes the bat climbed out and while the bush-rat was distracted switched pots the bat then served his soup out of the soup pot both tasted it overanxious and eager the bush-rat jumped into the pot of warm water he stayed much longer in the pot dying in the process
when the bush-rat's wife returned that night to find her husband dead she wept and ran to the chief of the land's house telling him about what happened and what she was sure the bat had done in hearing this the chief became angry ordering for the immediate arrest of the bat it just so happened that the bat was flying over the house and overheard what was just said he quickly went into hiding high up in a tree when the chief's men went looking for the bat he could not be found the search to arrest the bat carried on over several days but he still could not be found the bat needed to eat so he flew out of hiding every night to hunt for food to avoid being arrested this according to eastern nigeria mythology is why bats only fly at night
=== tongan ===
the bat is sacred in tonga and is often considered the physical manifestation of a separable soul
=== heraldry ===
the bat is sometimes used as a heraldic symbol in spain the coats of arms of certain cities in eastern spain such as valencia palma de mallorca and fraga have the bat over the shield formerly the barcelona city coat of arms also had a bat crowning it but the bat has been removed in the present-day versions heraldic use of the bat in valencia catalonia and the balearic islands has its origins in a winged dragon (vibra or vibria) which featured in king james i of aragon's helmet or cimera reial this is the most widely accepted theory although there is also a legend that says that due to the intervention of a bat king james was able to win a crucial battle against the saracens that allowed him to win valencia for his kingdom the use of the bat as a heraldic symbol is prevalent in the territories of the former crown of aragon and it is little used elsewhere however it can be found in a few places as in the coats of arms of the city of albacete in spain as well as the town of montchauvet (yvelines) in france
non heraldic organizations also use bats in their symbols certain spanish football clubs including valencia cf and levante ud use bats in their badges the burgee of the royal valencia yacht club (reial club nutic de valncia) displays a bat on a golden field in its center
