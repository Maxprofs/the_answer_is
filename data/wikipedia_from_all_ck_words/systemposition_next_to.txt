the supernatural (medieval latin superntrlis supra above + naturalis natural first used 15201530 ad) is that which is not subject to the laws of physics or more figuratively that which is said to exist above and beyond nature

the metaphysical considerations of the existence of the supernatural can be difficult to approach as an exercise in philosophy or theology because any dependencies on its antithesis the natural will ultimately have to be inverted or rejected
one complicating factor is that there is no universal agreement about the definition of natural or the limits of naturalism concepts in the supernatural domain are closely related to concepts in religious spirituality and occultism or spiritualism additionally by definition anything that exists naturally is not supernatural
for sometimes we use the word nature for that author of nature whom the schoolmen harshly enough call natura naturans as when it is said that nature hath made man partly corporeal and partly immaterial sometimes we mean by the nature of a thing the essence or that which the schoolmen scruple not to call the quiddity of a thing namely the attribute or attributes on whose score it is what it is whether the thing be corporeal or not as when we attempt to define the nature of an angel or of a triangle or of a fluid body as such sometimes we take nature for an internal principle of motion as when we say that a stone let fall in the air is by nature carried towards the centre of the earth and on the contrary that fire or flame does naturally move upwards toward heaven sometimes we understand by nature the established course of things as when we say that nature makes the night succeed the day nature hath made respiration necessary to the life of men sometimes we take nature for an aggregate of powers belonging to a body especially a living one as when physicians say that nature is strong or weak or spent or that in such or such diseases nature left to herself will do the cure sometimes we take nature for the universe or system of the corporeal works of god as when it is said of a phoenix or a chimera that there is no such thing in nature i.e in the world and sometimes too and that most commonly we would express by nature a semi-deity or other strange kind of being such as this discourse examines the notion of
and besides these more absolute acceptions if i may so call them of the word nature it has divers others (more relative) as nature is wont to be set or in opposition or contradistinction to other things as when we say of a stone when it falls downwards that it does it by a natural motion but that if it be thrown upwards its motion that way is violent so chemists distinguish vitriol into natural and fictitious or made by art i.e by the intervention of human power or skill so it is said that water kept suspended in a sucking pump is not in its natural place as that is which is stagnant in the well we say also that wicked men are still in the state of nature but the regenerate in a state of grace that cures wrought by medicines are natural operations but the miraculous ones wrought by christ and his apostles were supernatural
the term supernatural is often used interchangeably with paranormal or preternatural the latter typically limited to an adjective for describing abilities which appear to exceed the bounds of possibility epistemologically the relationship between the supernatural and the natural is indistinct in terms of natural phenomena that ex hypothesi violate the laws of nature in so far as such laws are realistically accountable
parapsychologists use the term psi to refer to an assumed unitary force underlying the phenomena they study psi is defined in the journal of parapsychology as a general term used to identify personal factors or processes in nature which transcend accepted laws (1948 311) and which are non-physical in nature (1962:310) and it is used to cover both extrasensory perception (esp) an awareness of or response to an external event or influence not apprehended by sensory means (1962:309) or inferred from sensory knowledge and psychokinesis (pk) the direct influence exerted on a physical system by a subject without any known intermediate energy or instrumentation (1945:305)
many supporters of supernatural explanations believe that past present and future complexities and mysteries of the universe cannot be explained solely by naturalistic means and argue that it is reasonable to assume that a non-natural entity or entities resolve the unexplained
views on the supernatural vary for example it may be seen as
indistinct from nature from this perspective some events occur according to the laws of nature and others occur according to a separate set of principles external to known nature for example in scholasticism it was believed that god was capable of performing any miracle so long as it didn't lead to a logical contradiction some religions posit immanent deities however and do not have a tradition analogous to the supernatural some believe that everything anyone experiences occurs by the will (occasionalism) in the mind (neoplatonism) or as a part (nondualism) of a more fundamental divine reality (platonism)
incorrectly attributed to nature others believe that all events have natural and only natural causes they believe that human beings ascribe supernatural attributes to purely natural events such as lightning rainbows floods and the origin of life
== philosophy ==
the supernatural is a feature of the philosophical traditions of neoplatonism and scholasticism
== religion ==
most religions include elements of belief in the supernatural (e.g miraculous works by recognized saints the assumption of mary etc.) while also often featuring prominently in the study of the paranormal and occultism
=== christian theology ===
==== the supernatural order ====
in catholic theology the supernatural order is according to new advent defined as the ensemble of effects exceeding the powers of the created universe and gratuitously produced by god for the purpose of raising the rational creature above its native sphere to a god-like life and destiny. the modern catholic dictionary defines it as [t]he sum total of heavenly destiny and all the divinely established means of reaching that destiny which surpass the mere powers and capacities of human nature.
=== process theology ===
process theology is a school of thought influenced by the metaphysical process philosophy of alfred north whitehead (18611947) and further developed by charles hartshorne (18972000)
it is not possible in process metaphysics to conceive divine activity as a supernatural intervention into the natural order of events process theists usually regard the distinction between the supernatural and the natural as a by-product of the doctrine of creation ex nihilo in process thought there is no such thing as a realm of the natural in contrast to that which is supernatural on the other hand if the natural is defined more neutrally as what is in the nature of things then process metaphysics characterizes the natural as the creative activity of actual entities in whitehead's words it lies in the nature of things that the many enter into complex unity (whitehead 1978 21) it is tempting to emphasize process theism's denial of the supernatural and thereby highlight what the process god cannot do in comparison to what the traditional god can do (that is to bring something from nothing) in fairness however equal stress should be placed on process theism's denial of the natural (as traditionally conceived) so that one may highlight what the creatures cannot do in traditional theism in comparison to what they can do in process metaphysics (that is to be part creators of the world with god)
