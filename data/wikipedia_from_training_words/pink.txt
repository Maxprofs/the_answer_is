=== why cooked beef cured ham steamed shrimp and salmon are pinkedit ===
raw beef is red because the muscles of vertebrate animals such as cows and pigs contain a protein called myoglobin which binds oxygen and iron atoms when beef is cooked the myoglobin proteins undergo oxidation and gradually turn from red to pink to brown that is from rare to medium to well-done pork contains less myoglobin than beef and therefore is less red when heated it changes from pinkish-red to less pink to tan or white
ham though it contains myoglobins like beef undergoes a different transformation traditional hams such as prosciutto are made by taking the hind leg or thigh of a pig covering it with sea salt which removes the moisture content and then letting it dry or cure for as long as two years the salt (sodium nitrate) permits the ham to retain its original pink color even when dried out supermarket hams are made by a different and faster process they are brined or infused with a salt-water solution containing sodium nitrite which transfers nitric oxide which bonds with the myoglobin to form the traditional pink cured ham color
