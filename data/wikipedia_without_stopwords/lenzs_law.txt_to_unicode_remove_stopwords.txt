lenzs law lnts common way understanding electromagnetic circuits obey newtons third law conservation energy lenzs law named heinrich lenz says
induced current flows direction always oppose change produced
lenzs law shown negative sign faradays law induction
indicates induced voltage change magnetic flux opposite signs lenzs law qualitative law refers direction induced current relation effect produces without quantitatively relating magnitudes
rigorous mathematical treatment see electromagnetic induction maxwells equations
opposing currents
change magnetic field current induces another electric current direction opposite change currents two coaxial circular conductors respectively initially currents must counterrotate opposing currents repel result
lenzs law states current induced circuit due change motion magnetic field directed oppose change flux exert mechanical force opposing motion
example
currents bound inside atoms strong magnets create counterrotating currents copper aluminum pipe shown dropping magnet pipe descent magnet inside pipe observably slower dropped outside pipe
voltage generated change magnetic flux according faradays law polarity induced voltage produces current whose magnetic field opposes change produces induced magnetic field inside loop wire always acts keep magnetic flux loop constant examples flux increasing induced field acts opposition decreasing induced field acts direction applied field oppose change
detailed interaction charges currents
electromagnetism charges move along electric field lines work done whether involves storing potential energy negative work increasing kinetic energy positive work
net positive work applied charge q gains speed momentum net work q thereby generates magnetic field whose strength units magnetic flux density tesla voltsecond per square meter proportional speed increase q magnetic field interact neighboring charge q passing momentum return q loses momentum
charge q also act q similar manner returns momentum received q backandforth component momentum contributes magnetic inductance closer q q greater effect q inside conductive medium thick slab made copper aluminum readily responds force applied q energy q instantly consumed heat generated current q also stored two opposing magnetic fields energy density magnetic fields tends vary square magnetic fields intensity however case magnetically nonlinear materials ferromagnets superconductors relationship breaks
field energy
electric field stores energy energy density electric field given
general incremental amount work per unit volume w needed cause small change magnetic flux density b
conservation momentum
momentum must conserved process q pushed one direction q ought pushed direction force time however situation becomes complicated finite speed electromagnetic wave propagation introduced see retarded potential means brief period total momentum two charges conserved implying difference accounted momentum fields asserted richard p feynman famous th century electrodynamicist james clerk maxwell called electromagnetic momentum yet treatment fields may necessary lenzs law applied opposite charges normally assumed charges question sign proton electron interaction different electron generating magnetic field would generate emf causes proton accelerate direction electron first might seem violate law conservation momentum interaction seen conserve momentum momentum electromagnetic fields taken account
