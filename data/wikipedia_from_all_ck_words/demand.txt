in economics demand is the utility for a good or service of an economic agent relative to his/her income (note this distinguishes demand from quantity demanded where demand is a listing or graphing of quantity demanded at each possible price in contrast to demand quantity demanded is the exact quantity demanded at a certain price changing the actual price will change the quantity demanded but it will not change the demand because demand is a listing of quantities that would be bought at various prices not just the actual price.)
demand is a buyer's willingness and ability to pay a price for a specific quantity of a good or service demand refers to how much (quantity) of a product or service is desired by buyers at various prices the quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing or able to buy at a certain price the relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the demand (see also supply and demand) the term demand signifies the ability or the willingness to buy a particular commodity at a given point of time ceteris paribus utility preferences and choices underlying demand can be represented as functions of cost benefit odds and other variables
== determinants of (factors affecting) demand ==
innumerable factors and circumstances could affect a buyer's willingness or ability to buy a good some of the more common factors are
good's own price the basic demand relationship is between potential prices of a good and the quantities that would be purchased at those prices generally the relationship is negative meaning that an increase in price will induce a decrease in the quantity demanded this negative relationship is embodied in the downward slope of the consumer demand curve the assumption of a negative relationship is reasonable and intuitive if the price of a new novel is high a person might decide to borrow the book from the public library rather than buy it
price of related goods the principal related goods are complements and substitutes a complement is a good that is used with the primary good examples include hotdogs and mustard beer and pretzels automobiles and gasoline (perfect complements behave as a single good.) if the price of the complement goes up the quantity demanded of the other good goes down mathematically the variable representing the price of the complementary good would have a negative coefficient in the demand function for example qd = a - p - pg where q is the quantity of automobiles demanded p is the price of automobiles and pg is the price of gasoline the other main category of related goods are substitutes substitutes are goods that can be used in place of the primary good the mathematical relationship between the price of the substitute and the demand for the good in question is positive if the price of the substitute goes down the demand for the good in question goes down
personal disposable income in most cases the more disposable income (income after tax and receipt of benefits) a person has the more likely that person is to buy
tastes or preferences the greater the desire to own a good the more likely one is to buy the good there is a basic distinction between desire and demand desire is a measure of the willingness to buy a good based on its intrinsic qualities demand is the willingness and ability to put one's desires into effect it is assumed that tastes and preferences are relatively constant
consumer expectations about future prices income and availability if a consumer believes that the price of the good will be higher in the future he/she is more likely to purchase the good now if the consumer expects that his/her income will be higher in the future the consumer may buy the good now availability (supply side) as well as predicted or expected availability also affects both price and demand
population if the population grows this means that demand will also increase
nature of the good if the good is a basic commodity it will lead to a higher demand
this list is not exhaustive all facts and circumstances that a buyer finds relevant to his willingness or ability to buy goods can affect demand for example a person caught in an unexpected storm is more likely to buy an umbrella than if the weather were bright and sunny
== demand function and demand equation ==
the demand equation is the mathematical expression of the relationship between the quantity of a good demanded and those factors that affect the willingness and ability of a consumer to buy the good for example qd = f(p prg y) is a demand equation where qd is the quantity of a good demanded p is the price of the good prg is the price of a related good and y is income the function on the right side of the equation is called the demand function the semi-colon in the list of arguments in the demand function means that the variables to the right are being held constant as one plots the demand curve in (quantity price) space a simple example of a demand equation is qd = 325 - p - 30prg + 1.4y here 325 is the repository of all relevant non-specified factors that affect demand for the product p is the price of the good the coefficient is negative in accordance with the law of demand the related good may be either a complement or a substitute if a complement the coefficient of its price would be negative as in this example if a substitute the coefficient of its price would be positive income y has a positive coefficient indicating that the good is a normal good if the coefficient was negative the good in question would be an inferior good meaning that the demand for the good would fall as the consumer's income increased specifying values for the non price determinants prg = 4.00 and y = 50 results in the demand equation q = 325 - p - 30(4) +1.4(50) or q = 275 - p if income were to increase to 55 the new demand equation would be q = 282 - p graphically this change in a non price determinant of demand would be reflected in an outward shift of the demand function caused by a change in the x intercept devon clarke
== demand curve ==
in economics the demand curve is the graph depicting the relationship between the price of a certain commodity and the amount of it that consumers are willing and able to purchase at that given price
== price elasticity of demand (ped) ==
ped is a measure of the sensitivity of the quantity variable q to changes in the price variable p elasticity answers the question of the percent by which the quantity demanded will change relative to (divided by) a given percentage change in the price for infinitesimal changes the formula for calculating ped is the absolute value of (q/p)(p/q)
=== determinants of ped ===
the overriding factor in determining ped is the willingness and ability of consumers after a price changes to postpone immediate consumption decisions concerning the good and to search for substitutes (wait and look)
=== elasticity along linear demand curve ===
the slope of a linear demand curve is constant the elasticity of demand changes continuously as one moves down the demand curve because the ratio of price to quantity continuously falls at the point the demand curve intersects the y-axis ped is infinitely elastic because the variable q appearing in the denominator of the elasticity formula is zero there at the point the demand curve intersects the x-axis ped is zero because the variable p appearing in the numerator of the elasticity formula is zero there at one point on the demand curve ped is unitary elastic ped equals one above the point of unitary elasticity is the elastic range of the demand curve (meaning that the elasticity is greater than one) below is the inelastic range in which the elasticity is less than one the decline in elasticity as one moves down the curve is due to the falling p/q ratio
=== constant price elasticity demand ===
where a and c are parameters and the constant price elasticity is c and 
== market structure and the demand curve ==
in perfectly competitive markets the demand curve the average revenue curve and the marginal revenue curve all coincide and are horizontal at the market-given price the demand curve is perfectly elastic and coincides with the average and marginal revenue curves economic actors are price-takers perfectly competitive firms have zero market power that is they have no ability to affect the terms and conditions of exchange a perfectly competitive firm's decisions are limited to whether to produce and if so how much in less than perfectly competitive markets the demand curve is negatively sloped and there is a separate marginal revenue curve a firm in a less than perfectly competitive market is a price-setter the firm can decide how much to produce or what price to charge in deciding one variable the firm is necessarily determining the other variable
== inverse demand function ==
in its standard form a linear demand equation is q = a - bp that is quantity demanded is a function of price the inverse demand equation or price equation treats price as a function g of quantity demanded p = f(q) to compute the inverse demand equation simply solve for p from the demand equation for example if the demand equation is q = 240 - 2p then the inverse demand equation would be p = 120 - 5q the right side of which is the inverse demand function
the inverse demand function is useful in deriving the total and marginal revenue functions total revenue equals price p times quantity q or tr = pq multiply the inverse demand function by q to derive the total revenue function tr = (120 - 5q) q = 120q - 0.5q the marginal revenue function is the first derivative of the total revenue function here mr = 120 - q note that the mr function has the same y-intercept as the inverse demand function in this linear example the x-intercept of the mr function is one-half the value of that of the demand function and the slope of the mr function is twice that of the inverse demand function this relationship holds true for all linear demand equations the importance of being able to quickly calculate mr is that the profit-maximizing condition for firms regardless of market structure is to produce where marginal revenue equals marginal cost (mc) to derive mc the first derivative of the total cost function is taken for example assume cost c equals 420 + 60q + q2 then mc = 60 + 2q equating mr to mc and solving for q gives q = 20 so 20 is the profit maximizing quantity to find the profit-maximizing price simply plug the value of q into the inverse demand equation and solve for p
== residual demand curve ==
the demand curve facing a particular firm is called the residual demand curve the residual demand curve is the market demand that is not met by other firms in the industry at a given price the residual demand curve is the market demand curve d(p) minus the supply of other organizations so(p) dr(p) = d(p) - so(p )
== is the demand curve for pc firm really flat ==
practically every introductory microeconomics text describes the demand curve facing a perfectly competitive firm as being flat or horizontal a horizontal demand curve is perfectly elastic if there are n identical firms in the market then the elasticity of demand ped facing any one firm is
pedmi = npedm - (n - 1) pes
where pedm is the market elasticity of demand pes is the elasticity of supply of each of the other firms and (n -1) is the number of other firms this formula suggests two things the demand curve is not perfectly elastic and if there are a large number of firms in the industry the elasticity of demand for any individual firm will be extremely high and the demand curve facing the firm will be nearly flat
for exshush
pedmi = -1(80) - (79 x 3)
pedmi = -80 - 237 = - 317
that is the firm ped is 317 times as elastic as the market ped if a firm raised its price by one tenth of one percent demand would drop by nearly one third. if the firm raised its price by three tenths of one percent the quantity demanded would drop by nearly 100% three tenths of one percent marks the effective range of pricing power the firm has because any attempt to raise prices by a higher percentage will effectively reduce quantity demanded to zero
== demand management in economics ==
demand management in economics is the art or science of controlling economic or aggregate demand to avoid a recession such management is inspired by keynesian macroeconomics and keynesian economics is sometimes referred to as demand-side economics
== different types of goods demand ==
negative demand if the market response to a product is negative it shows that people are not aware of the features of the service and the benefits offered under such circumstances the marketing unit of a service firm has to understand the psyche of the potential buyers and find out the prime reason for the rejection of the service for example if passengers refuse a bus conductor's call to board the bus the service firm has to come up with an appropriate strategy to remove the misunderstandings of the potential buyers a strategy needs to be designed to transform the negative demand into a positive demand
no demand if people are unaware have insufficient information about a service or due to the consumer's indifference this type of a demand situation could occur the marketing unit of the firm should focus on promotional campaigns and communicating reasons for potential customers to use the firm's services service differentiation is one of the popular strategies used to compete in a no demand situation in the market
latent demand at any given time it is impossible to have a set of services that offer total satisfaction to all the needs and wants of society in the market there exists a gap between desirables and the availables there is always a search on for better and newer offers to fill the gap between desirability and availability latent demand is a phenomenon of any economy at any given time it should be looked upon as a business opportunity by service firms and they should orient themselves to identify and exploit such opportunities at the right time for example a passenger traveling in an ordinary bus dreams of traveling in a luxury bus therefore latent demand is nothing but the gap between desirability and availability
seasonal demand:some services do not have an all year round demand they might be required only at a certain period of time seasons all over the world are very diverse seasonal demands create many problems to service organizations such as:- idling the capacity fixed cost and excess expenditure on marketing and promotions strategies used by firms to overcome this hurdle are like - to nurture the service consumption habit of customers so as to make the demand unseasonal or other than that firms recognize markets elsewhere in the world during the off-season period hence this presents and opportunity to target different markets with the appropriate season in different parts of the world for example the need for christmas cards comes around once a year or the seasonal fruits in a country
demand patterns need to be studied in different segments of the market service organizations need to constantly study changing demands related to there service offerings over various time periods they have to develop a system to chart these demand fluctuations which helps them in predicting the demand cycles demands do fluctuate randomly therefore they should be followed on a daily weekly or a monthly basis
