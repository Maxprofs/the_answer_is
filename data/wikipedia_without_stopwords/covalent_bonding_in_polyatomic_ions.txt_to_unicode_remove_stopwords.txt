fiber typingedit
numerous methods employed fibertyping confusion methods common among nonexperts two commonly confused methods histochemical staining myosin atpase activity immunohistochemical staining myosin heavy chain mhc type myosin atpase activity commonlyand correctlyreferred simply fiber type results direct assaying atpase activity various conditions eg ph myosin heavy chain staining accurately referred mhc fiber type eg mhc iia fibers results determination different mhc isoforms methods closely related physiologically mhc type primary determinant atpase activity note however neither typing methods directly metabolic nature directly address oxidative glycolytic capacity fiber type type ii fibers referred generically accurately refers sum numerical fiber types vs ii assessed myosin atpase activity staining eg type ii fibers refers type iia type iiax type iixa etc
table showing relationship two methods limited fiber types found humans note subtype capitalization used fiber typing vs mhc typing atpase types actually contain multiple mhc types also subtype b b expressed humans either method early researchers believed humans express mhc iib led atpase classification iib however later research showed human mhc iib fact iix indicating iib better named iix iib expressed mammals still accurately seen along iib literature non human fiber types include true iib fibers iic iid etc
fiber typing methods less formally delineated exist spectrum tend focused metabolic functional capacities ie oxidative vs glycolytic fast vs slow contraction time noted fiber typing atpase mhc directly measure dictate parameters however many various methods mechanistically linked others correlated vivo instance atpase fiber type related contraction speed high atpase activity allows faster crossbridge cycling atpase activity one component contraction speed type fibers slow part low speeds atpase activity comparison type ii fibers however measuring contraction speed atpase fiber typing

fiber color
traditionally fibers categorized depending varying color reflection myoglobin content type fibers appear red due high levels myoglobin red muscle fibers tend mitochondria greater local capillary density fibers suited endurance slow fatigue use oxidative metabolism generate atp adenosine triphosphate less oxidative type ii fibers white due relatively low myoglobin reliance glycolytic enzymes
twitch speed
fibers also classified twitch capabilities fast slow twitch traits largely completely overlap classifications based color atpase mhc
authors define fast twitch fiber one myosin split atp quickly mainly include atpase type ii mhc type ii fibers however fast twitch fibers also demonstrate higher capability electrochemical transmission action potentials rapid level calcium release uptake sarcoplasmic reticulum fast twitch fibers rely welldeveloped short term glycolytic system energy transfer contract develop tension times rate slow twitch fibers fast twitch muscles much better generating short bursts strength speed slow muscles fatigue quickly
slow twitch fibers generate energy atp resynthesis means long term system aerobic energy transfer mainly include atpase type mhc type fibers tend low activity level atpase slower speed contraction less well developed glycolytic capacity contain high mitochondrial volumes high levels myoglobin give red pigmentation demonstrated high concentration mitochondrial enzymes thus fatigue resistant slow twitch muscles fire slowly fast twitch fibers able contract longer time fatiguing
type distribution
individual muscles tend mixture various fiber types proportions vary depending actions muscle species instance humans quadriceps muscles contain type fibers soleus type orbicularis oculi muscle eye type motor units within muscle however minimal variation fibers unit fact makes size principal motor unit recruitment viable
total number skeletal muscle fibers traditionally thought change believed sex age differences fiber distribution however relative fiber types vary considerably muscle muscle person person sedentary men women well young children type type fibers people higher end sport tend demonstrate patterns fiber distribution eg endurance athletes show higher level type fibers sprint athletes hand require large numbers type b fibers middle distance event athletes show approximately equal distribution types also often case power athletes throwers jumpers suggested various types exercise induce changes fibers skeletal muscle thought perform endurance type events sustained period time type b fibers transform type fibers however consensus subject may well type b fibers show enhancements oxidative capacity high intensity endurance training brings level able perform oxidative metabolism effectively slow twitch fibers untrained subjects would brought increase mitochondrial size number associated related changes change fiber type

unipennate architecture
fibers unipennate muscles oriented nonzero angle relative axis force generation angle reduces effective force individual fiber effectively pulling offaxis however angle fibers packed muscle volume increasing physiological crosssectional area pcsa effect known fiber packing andin terms force generationit overcomes efficiency loss offaxis orientation tradeoff comes overall speed muscle shortening total excursion overall muscle shortening speed reduced compared fiber shortening speed total distance shortening effects scale pennation angle greater angles lead greater force due increased fiber packing pcsa greater losses shortening speed excursion vastus lateralis example unipennate architecture
multipennate architectures

bipennate arrangements essentially vs fibers stacked top rectus femoris
convergent arrangements triangle fan shaped wide origins narrow insertions wide variation pennation angles architecture actually allow multiple functions instance trapezius prototypical convergent muscle aid shoulder elevation depression
multipennate arrangements limited particular arrangement butwhen used specificallycommonly refer essentially combination bipennate unipennate arrangements convergent arrangements example architecture would human deltoid muscle
