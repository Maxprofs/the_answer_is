achromatopsia (achm) is a medical syndrome that exhibits symptoms relating to at least five conditions the term may refer to acquired conditions such as cerebral achromatopsia also known as color agnosia but it typically refers to an autosomal recessive congenital color vision condition the inability to perceive color and to achieve satisfactory visual acuity at high light levels (typically exterior daylight) the syndrome is also present in an incomplete form which is more properly defined as dyschromatopsia it is estimated to affect 1 in 40,000 live births worldwide
there is some discussion as to whether achromats can see color or not as illustrated in the island of the colorblind by oliver sacks some achromats cannot see color only black white and shades of grey with five different genes currently known to cause similar symptoms it may be that some do see marginal levels of color differentiation due to different gene characteristics with such small sample sizes and low response rates it is difficult to accurately diagnose the typical achromatic conditions if the light level during testing is optimized for them they may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels regardless of the absence of color one common trait is hemeralopia or blindness in full sun in patients with achromatopsia the cone system and fibres carrying color information remain intact this indicates that the mechanism used to construct colors is defective
== terminologyedit ==
color blindness can be classified as
acquired achromatopsia (cerebral achromatopsia)
congenital/inherited achromatopsia
complete typical achromatopsia
incomplete atypical achromatopsia or incomplete atypical dyschromatopsia
related terms
achromatopsiathe complete lack of the perception of color in a subject seeing only in black white and shades of grey
amblyopiadefined conceptually by duke-elder (1973) as a monocular acuity deficit which is not due to refractive error or any organic abnormality a neural condition poor spatial performance of the precision optical servomechanism of the eyes at nominal illumination levels without any morphological cause one form of lazy eye
hemeralopiareduced visual capacity in bright light colloquially day-blindness
nystagmusthis term is used variously to describe both normal and pathological conditions related to the oculomotor system in the current context it is a pathological condition involving an uncontrolled oscillatory movement of the eyes during which the amplitude of oscillation is quite noticeable and the frequency of the oscillation tends to be quite low
photophobiathe avoidance of bright light by those suffering from hemeralopia
== signs and symptomsedit ==
the syndrome is frequently noticed first in children around six months of age by their photophobic activity and/or their nystagmus the nystagmus becomes less noticeable with age but the other symptoms of the syndrome become more relevant as school age approaches visual acuity and stability of the eye motions generally improve during the first 67 years of life (but remain near 20/200) the congenital forms of the condition are considered stationary and do not worsen with age
the five symptoms associated with achromatopsia/dyschromatopsia are
achromatopia
amblyopia (reduced visual acuity)
hemeralopia (with the subject exhibiting photophobia)
nystagmus
iris operating abnormalities
the syndrome of achromatopsia/dyschromatopsia is poorly described in current medical and neuro-ophthalmological texts it became a common term following the popular book by the neuroscientist oliver sacks the island of the colorblind in 1997 up to that time most color-blind subjects were described as achromats or achromatopes those with a lesser degree of color perception abnormality were described as either protanopes deuteranopes or tetartanopes (historically tritanopes)
achromatopsia has also been called rod monochromacy and total congenital color blindness individuals with the congenital form of this condition show complete absence of cone cell activity via electroretinography at high light levels there are at least four genetic causes of congenital achm two of which involve cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (achm2/achm3) a third involves the cone photoreceptor transducin (gnat2 achm4) and the last remains unknown
=== complete achromatopsiaedit ===
aside from a complete inability to see color individuals with complete achromatopsia have a number of other ophthalmologic aberrations included among these aberrations are greatly decreased visual acuity (<0.1 or 20/200) in daylight hemeralopia nystagmus and severe photophobia the fundus of the eye appears completely normal also see pingelap#color-blindness
=== incomplete achromatopsia (dyschromatopsia)edit ===
in general symptoms of incomplete achromatopsia are similar to those of complete achromatopsia except in a diminished form individuals with incomplete achromatopsia have reduced visual acuity with or without nystagmus or photophobia furthermore these individuals show only partial impairment of cone cell function but again have retained rod cell function
== causeedit ==
=== acquirededit ===
acquired achromatopsia/dyschromatopsia is a condition associated with damage to the diencephalon (primarily the thalamus of the mid brain) or the cerebral cortex (the new brain) specifically the fourth visual association area v4 which receives information from the parvocellular pathway involved in colour processing
thalamic achromatopsia/dyschromatopsia is caused by damage to the thalamus it is most frequently caused by tumor growth since the thalamus is well protected from external damage
cerebral achromatopsia is a form of acquired color blindness that is caused by damage to the cerebral cortex of the brain rather than abnormalities in the cells of the eye's retina it is most frequently caused by physical trauma hemorrhage or tumor tissue growth
=== congenitaledit ===
the known causes of the congenital forms of achromatopsia are all due to malfunction of the retinal phototransduction pathway specifically this form of achm seems to result from the inability of cone cells to properly respond to light input by hyperpolarizing known genetic causes of this are mutations in the cone cell cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels cnga3 (achm2) and cngb3 (achm3) as well as the cone cell transducin gnat2 (achm4)
a fourth genetic cause (achm5 omim 613093) has been discovered in 2009 it is a mutation of gene pde6c located on chromosome locus 10 10q24 it is estimated than less than 2% of achromatopsias are caused by a mutation in this gene
== pathophysiologyedit ==
the hemeralopic aspect of achm can be diagnosed non-invasively using electroretinography the response at low (scotopic) and median (mesotopic) light levels will be normal but the response under high light level (photopic) conditions will be absent the mesotopic level is approximately 100 times lower than the clinical level used for the typical high level electroretinogram when as described the condition is due to a saturation in the neural portion of the retina and not due to the absence of the photoreceptors per se
in general the molecular pathomechanism of achm is either the inability to properly control or respond to altered levels of cgmp cgmp is particularly important in visual perception as its level controls the opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (cngs) decreasing the concentration of cgmp results in closure of cngs and resulting hyperpolarization and cessation of glutamate release native retinal cngs are composed of 2 - and 2 -subunits which are cnga3 and cngb3 respectively in cone cells when expressed alone cngb3 cannot produce functional channels whereas this is not the case for cnga3 coassembly of cnga3 and cngb3 produces channels with altered membrane expression ion permeability (na+ vs k+ and ca2+) relative efficacy of camp/cgmp activation decreased outward rectification current flickering and sensitivity to block by l-cis-diltiazem mutations tend to result in the loss of cngb3 function or gain of function (often increased affinity for cgmp) of cnga3 cgmp levels are controlled by the activity of the cone cell transducin gnat2 mutations in gnat2 tend to result in a truncated and presumably non-functional protein thereby preventing alteration of cgmp levels by photons there is a positive correlation between the severity of mutations in these proteins and the completeness of the achromatopsia phenotype
=== achm2edit ===
while some mutations in cnga3 result in truncated and presumably non-functional channels this is largely not the case while few mutations have received in-depth study see table 1 at least one mutation does result in functional channels curiously this mutation t369s produces profound alterations when expressed without cngb3 one such alteration is decreased affinity for cyclic guanosine monophosphate others include the introduction of a sub-conductance altered single-channel gating kinetics and increased calcium permeability when mutant t369s channels coassemble with cngb3 however the only remaining aberration is increased calcium permeability while it is not immediately clear how this increase in ca2+ leads to achm one hypothesis is that this increased current decreases the signal-to-noise ratio other characterized mutations such as y181c and the other s1 region mutations result in decreased current density due to an inability of the channel to traffic to the surface such loss of function will undoubtedly negate the cone cell's ability to respond to visual input and produce achromatopsia at least one other missense mutation outside of the s1 region t224r also leads to loss of function
=== achm3edit ===
while very few mutations in cngb3 have been characterized the vast majority of them result in truncated channels that are presumably non-functional table 2 this will largely result in haploinsufficiency though in some cases the truncated proteins may be able to coassemble with wild-type channels in a dominant negative fashion the most prevalent achm3 mutation t383ifsx12 results in a non-functional truncated protein that does not properly traffic to the cell membrane the three missense mutations that have received further study show a number of aberrant properties with one underlying theme the r403q mutation which lies in the pore region of the channel results in an increase in outward current rectification versus the largely linear current-voltage relationship of wild-type channels concomitant with an increase in cgmp affinity the other mutations show either increased (s435f) or decreased (f525n) surface expression but also with increased affinity for camp and cgmp it is the increased affinity for cgmp and camp in these mutants that is likely the disorder-causing change such increased affinity will result in channels that are insensitive to the slight concentration changes of cgmp due to light input into the retina
=== achm4edit ===
upon activation by light rhodopsin causes the exchange of gdp for gtp in the guanine nucleotide binding protein (g-protein) -transducing activity polypeptide 2 (gnat2) this causes the release of the activated -subunit from the inhibitory /-subunits this -subunit then activates a phosphodiesterase that catalyzes the conversion of cgmp to gmp thereby reducing current through cng3 channels as this process is absolutely vital for proper color processing it is not surprising that mutations in gnat2 lead to achromatopsia the known mutations in this gene table 3 all result in truncated proteins presumably then these proteins are non-functional and consequently rhodopsin that has been activated by light does not lead to altered cgmp levels or photoreceptor membrane hyperpolarization
== managementedit ==
there is generally no treatment to cure achromatopsia however since 2003 there is a cybernetic device called eyeborg that allows people to perceive color through sound waves achromatopsic artist neil harbisson was the first to use such a device in early 2004 the eyeborg allowed him to start painting in color by memorizing the sound of each color
moreover there is some research on gene therapy for animals with achromatopsia with positive results on mice and young dogs but less effectiveness on older dogs however no experiments have been made on humans there are many challenges to conducting gene therapy on humans see gene therapy for color blindness for more details about it
== epidemiologyedit ==
achromatopsia is a relatively uncommon disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 30,000 people (0.0033%) however in the small micronesian atoll of pingelap approximately 5% of the atoll's 3000 inhabitants are afflicted
== society and cultureedit ==
in approximately 1775 typhoon lengkieki struck and devastated the micronesian atoll of pingelap the typhoon and ensuing famine left only around 20 survivors one of whom was heterozygous for achromatopsia four generations after this population bottleneck the prevalence of achromatopsia is 5% with a further 30% as carriers the people of this region have termed achromatopsia maskun which literally means not see in pingelapese this unusual population drew neurologist oliver sacks to the island for which he wrote his 1997 book the island of the colorblind steppenwolf front man john kay has achromatopsia
