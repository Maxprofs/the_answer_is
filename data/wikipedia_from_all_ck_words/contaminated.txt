contamination is the presence of an unwanted constituent contaminant or impurity in a material physical body natural environment workplace etc

contamination has also more specific meanings in science
in chemistry the term usually describes a single constituent but in specialized fields the term can also mean chemical mixtures even up to the level of cellular materials all chemicals contain some level of impurity contamination may be recognized or not and may become an issue if the impure chemical is mixed with other chemicals or mixtures and causes additional chemical reactions the additional chemical reactions can sometimes be beneficial in which case the label contaminant is replaced with reactant or catalyst if the additional reactions are detrimental other terms are often applied such as toxin poison or pollutant depending on the type of molecule involved a major fraction of chemistry is involved with identifying isolating and studying contaminants
in environmental chemistry the term is in some cases virtually equivalent to pollution where the main interest is the harm done on a large scale to humans or to organisms or environments that are important to humans
in radiation protection the radioactive contamination is radioactive substances on surfaces or within solids liquids or gases (including the human body) where their presence is unintended or undesirable or the process giving rise to their presence in such places
also used less formally to refer to a quantity namely the amount of radioactivity in a location or on a surface or on a unit area of a surface such as a square meter or centimeter
contamination may include residual radioactive material remaining at a site after the completion of decommissioning of a site where there was a nuclear reactor such as a power plant experimental reactor isotope reactor or a nuclear powered ship or submarine
the term radioactive contamination may have a connotation that is not intended the term refers only to the presence of radioactivity and gives no indication of the magnitude of the hazard involved
see also environmental monitoring radiation monitoring
in food chemistry and medicinal chemistry the term contamination is used to describe harmful intrusions such as the presence of toxins or pathogens in food or pharmaceutical drugs see food contaminant
in forensic science a contaminant can be fingerprints hair skin or dna from first responders or from sources not related to the ongoing investigation such as family members or friends of the victim who are not suspects
in the biological sciences accidental introduction of foreign material ('contamination') can seriously distort the results of experiments where small samples are used in cases where the contaminant is a living microorganism it can often multiply and take over the experiment especially cultures and render them useless
in geology and especially geochemistry it can have similar effects where even a few grains of modern dust can distort results of sophisticated experiments
the term contamination is sometimes used to describe accidental transfers of organisms from one natural environment to another
it has even been used in the directed panspermia hypothesis about the origin of life on earth which suggests that visiting aliens accidentally infected the planet with microbes from their own world
