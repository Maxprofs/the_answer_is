structure
heart situated middle mediastinum behind breastbone chest level thoracic vertebrae tt largest part heart usually slightly offset left side chest though occasionally may offset right felt left left heart stronger since pumps body parts heart lungs left lung smaller right lung cardiac notch border accommodate heart
heart supplied coronary circulation enclosed doublemembraned sacthe pericardium attaches mediastinum providing anchorage heart back surface heart lies near vertebral column front surface sits deep sternum costal cartilages two great veins venae cavae great arteries aorta pulmonary artery attached upper part heart called base located level third costal cartilage lower tip heart apex lies left sternum cm midsternal line junction fourth fifth ribs near articulation costal cartilages right side heart deflected forwards left deflected back
heart coneshaped base positioned upwards tapering apex stethoscope placed directly apex heartbeats counted adult heart mass grams oz heart typically size fist cm length cm wide cm thickness welltrained athletes much larger hearts due effects exercise heart muscle similar response skeletal muscle
heart wall
heart wall made three layers inner endocardium middle myocardium outer epicardium surrounded doublemembraned sac called pericardium
innermost layer heart called endocardium made lining simple squamous epithelium covers heart chambers valves continuous endothelium veins arteries heart joined myocardium thin layer connective tissue endocardium secreting endothelins may also play role regulating contraction myocardium
middle layer heart wall myocardium cardiac muscle layer involuntary striated muscle tissue surrounded framework collagen myocardium also supplied blood vessels nerve fibers way epicardium help regulate heart rate cardiac muscle tissue autorhythmicity unique ability initiate cardiac action potential fixed rate spreading impulse rapidly cell cell trigger contraction entire heart autorhythmicity still modulated endocrine nervous systems
two types cardiac muscle cell cardiomyocytes ability contract easily modified cardiomyocytes pacemaker cells conducting system cardiomyocytes make bulk cells atria ventricles contractile cells connected intercalated discs allow rapid response impulses action potential pacemaker cells intercalated discs allow cells act syncytium enable contractions pump blood heart major arteries
pacemaker cells make cells form conduction system heart generally much smaller contractile cells myofibrils gives limited contractibility function similar many respects neurons
cardiac muscle pattern elegant complex muscle cells swirl spiral around chambers heart form figure pattern around atria around bases great vessels deeper ventricular muscles also form figure around two ventricles proceed toward apex superficial layers ventricular muscle wrap around ventricles complex swirling pattern allows heart pump blood effectively simple linear pattern would
skeletal muscles heart increase size efficiency exercise thus endurance athletes marathon runners may heart increased size
pericardium surrounds heart consists two membranes inner serous membrane called epicardium outer fibrous membrane enclose pericardial cavity contains pericardial fluid lubricates surface heart
chambers
heart four chambers two upper atria receiving chambers two lower ventricles discharging chambers atria connected ventricles atrioventricular valves separated ventricles coronary sulcus earshaped structure upper right atrium called right atrial appendage auricle another upper left atrium left atrial appendage right atrium right ventricle together sometimes referred right heart sometimes includes pulmonary artery similarly left atrium left ventricle together sometimes referred left heart ventricles separated anterior longitudinal sulcus posterior interventricular sulcus
cardiac skeleton made dense connective tissue gives structure heart forms atrioventricular septum separates atria ventricles fibrous rings serve bases four heart valves cardiac skeleton also provides important boundary hearts electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity interatrial septum separates atria interventricular septum separates ventricles interventricular septum much thicker interatrial septum since ventricles need generate greater pressure contract

physiology
blood flow
heart functions pump circulatory system provide continuous circulation blood throughout body circulation consists systemic circulation body pulmonary circulation lungs blood pulmonary circulation exchanges carbon dioxide oxygen lungs process respiration systemic circulation transports oxygen body returns carbon dioxide relatively deoxygenated blood heart transfer lungs
right heart collects deoxygenated blood two large veins superior inferior venae cavae blood collects right atrium pumped tricuspid valve right ventricle pumped pulmonary artery pulmonary valve blood enters pulmonary circulation carbon dioxide exchanged oxygen lungs happens passive process diffusion
left heart oxygenated blood returned left atrium via pulmonary veins pumped left ventricle mitral valve aorta aortic valve systemic circulation aorta large artery branches many smaller arteries arterioles ultimately capillaries capillaries oxygen nutrients blood supplied body cells metabolism exchanged carbon dioxide waste products
cardiac cycle
cardiac cycle refers complete heartbeat includes systole diastole intervening pause cycle begins contraction atria ends relaxation ventricles systole ventricles heart contract pump blood body diastole ventricles relax fill blood atria ventricles work concert systole ventricles contracting atria relaxed collecting blood ventricles relaxed diastole atria contract pump blood ventricles coordination ensures blood pumped efficiently body
beginning cardiac cycle early diastole atria ventricles relaxed since blood moves areas high pressure areas low pressure chambers relaxed blood flow atria coronary sinus pulmonary veins atria begin fill pressure rise blood move atria ventricles late diastole atria contract pumping blood ventricles causes rise pressure ventricles ventricular systole blood pumped pulmonary artery
atrioventricular valves tricuspid mitral open blood flow ventricles semilunar valves closed prevent backflow ventricles ventricular pressure greater atrial pressure tricuspid mitral valves shut ventricles contract pressure forces semilunar aortic pulmonary valves open ventricles relax semilunar valves close response decreased pressure
cardiac output
cardiac output co measurement amount blood pumped ventricle stroke volume one minute calculated multiplying stroke volume sv beats per minute heart rate hr co sv x hr
average cardiac output using average sv ml lmin range lmin stroke volume normally measured using echocardiogram influenced size heart physical mental condition individual sex contractility duration contraction preload afterload
preload refers much blood ventricles end diastole fullest main factor long takes ventricles fillif ventricles contract faster less time fill preload less preload also affected persons hydration status important frankstarling mechanism states force contraction directly proportional initial length muscle fiber means ventricle contract forcefully stretched
afterload much blood left ventricles systole influenced vascular resistance tension called afterload influenced narrowing heart valves stenosis contraction relaxation peripheral blood vessels
strength heart muscle contractions controls stroke volume influenced positively negatively agents termed inotropes either conditions drugs positive inotropes cause stronger contractions include high blood calcium drugs digoxin act stimulate sympathetic nerves fightorflight response negative inotropes causing weaker contractions include high blood potassium hypoxia acidosis drugs beta blockers calcium channel blockers act parasympathetic nervous system via vagus nerve
electrical conduction
normal rhythmical heart beat called sinus rhythm established sinoatrial node hearts pacemaker electrical signal created travels heart causing heart muscle contract
sinoatrial node found upper part right atrium near junction superior vena cava electrical signal generated sinoatrial node travels right atrium radial way completely understood travels left atrium via bachmanns bundle left right atrium contract together signal travels atrioventricular node found bottom right atrium atrioventricular septumthe boundary right atrium left ventricle septum part cardiac skeleton tissue within heart electrical signal cannot pass forces signal pass atrioventricular node signal travels along bundle left right bundle branches ventricles heart ventricles signal carried specialized tissue called purkinje fibers transmit electric charge cardiac muscle
heart rate
resting heart rate newborn beats per minute bpm gradually decreases maturity gradually increases age adult resting heart rate ranges bpm exercise fitness levels age basal metabolic rate affect heart rate athletes heart rate lower bpm exercise rate bpm maximum rates reaching bpm
sinoatrial node
sinoatrial node creates sustains rhythm sinus rhythm cells sinoatrial node creating action potential cardiac action potential created movement specific electrolytes pacemaker cells action potential spreads nearby cells
sinoatrial cells resting negative charge membranes however rapid influx sodium ions causes membranes charge become positive called depolarisation occurs spontaneously cell sufficiently high charge sodium channels close calcium ions begin enter cell shortly potassium begins leave ions travel ion channels membrane sinoatrial cells potassium calcium start move cell sufficiently high charge called voltagegated shortly calcium channels close potassium channels open allowing potassium leave cell causes cell negative resting charge called repolarization membrane potential reaches approximately mv potassium channels close process may begin
ions move areas concentrated reason sodium moves cell outside potassium moves within cell outside cell calcium also plays critical role influx slow channels means sinoatrial cells prolonged pleateau phase positive charge part called absolute refractory period calcium ions also combine regulatory protein troponin c troponin complex enable contraction cardiac muscle separate protein allow relaxation
influences
normal sinus rhythm heart giving resting heart rate influenced autonomic nervous system sympathetic parasympathetic nerves arise two paired cardiovascular centres medulla oblongatathe vagus nerve parasympathetic nervous system acts decrease heart rate nerves sympathetic trunk act increase heart rate come together cardiac plexus near base heart without parasympathetic input normally predominates sinoatrial node would generate heart rate bpm
nerves sympathetic trunk emerge tt thoracic ganglia travel sinoatrial atrioventricular nodes well atria ventricles ventricles richly innervated sympathetic fibers parasympathetic fibers sympathetic stimulation causes release neurotransmitter norepinephrine also known noradrenaline neuromuscular junction cardiac nerves shortens repolarization period thus speeding rate depolarization contraction results increased heart rate opens chemical ligandgated sodium calcium ion channels allowing influx positively charged ions norepinephrine binds beta receptor high blood pressure medications used block receptors reduce heart rate
cardiovascular centres receive input series receptors including proprioreceptors baroreceptors chemoreceptors plus stimuli limbic system series reflexes help regulate sustain blood flow example increased physical activity results increased rates firing various proprioreceptors located muscles joint capsules tendons increased rates firing parasympathetic stimulation may decrease sympathetic stimulation may increase needed order increase blood flow
similarly baroreceptors stretch receptors located aortic sinus carotid bodies venae cavae locations including pulmonary vessels right side heart rates firing baroreceptors represent blood pressure level physical activity relative distribution blood cardiac centers monitor baroreceptor firing maintain cardiac homeostasis mechanism called baroreceptor reflex increased pressure stretch rate baroreceptor firing increases cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation increase parasympathetic stimulation pressure stretch decrease rate baroreceptor firing decreases cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation decrease parasympathetic stimulation
similar reflex called atrial reflex bainbridge reflex associated varying rates blood flow atria increased venous return stretches walls atria specialized baroreceptors located however atrial baroreceptors increase rate firing stretch due increased blood pressure cardiac center responds increasing sympathetic stimulation inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation increase hr opposite also true
addition autonomic nervous system factors impact include epinephrine norepinephrine thyroid hormones levels various ions including calcium potassium sodium body temperature hypoxia ph balance factors increase heart rate include release norepinephrine hypoxemia low blood pressure dehydration strong emotional response higher body temperature metabolic hormonal factors low potassium sodium level stimulus thyroid hormones decreased body temperature relaxation metabolic factors also contribute decrease heart rate
