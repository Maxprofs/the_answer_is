hydrometallurgy method obtaining metals ores technique within field extractive metallurgy involving use aqueous chemistry recovery metals ores concentrates recycled residual materials metal chemical processing techniques complement hydrometallurgy pyrometallurgy vapour metallurgy molten salt electrometallurgy hydrometallurgy typically divided three general areas
leaching
solution concentration purification
metal metal compound recovery
leaching

five basic leaching reactor configurations insitu heap vat tank autoclave
insitu leaching
insitu leaching also called solution mining process initially involves drilling holes ore deposit explosives hydraulic fracturing used create open pathways within deposit solution penetrate leaching solution pumped deposit makes contact ore solution collected processed beverley uranium deposit example insitu leaching
heap leaching
heap leaching processes crushed sometimes agglomerated ore piled heap lined impervious layer leach solution sprayed top heap allowed percolate downward heap heap design usually incorporates collection sumps allow pregnant leach solution ie solution dissolved valuable metals pumped processing example gold cyanidation pulverized ores extracted solution sodium cyanide presence air dissolves gold leaving behind nonprecious residue
vat leaching
vat leaching also called agitation leaching involves contacting material usually undergone size reduction classification leach solution large vats
tank leaching
stirred tank also called agitation leaching involves contacting material usually undergone size reduction classification leach solution agitated tanks agitation enhance reaction kinetics enhancing mass transfer tanks often configured reactors series
autoclave leaching
autoclave reactors used reactions higher temperatures enhance rate reaction similarly autoclaved enable use gaseous reagents system
solution concentration purification
leaching leach liquor must normally undergo concentration metal ions recovered additionally undesirable metal ions sometimes require removal
precipitation selective removal compound targeted metal removal major impurity precipitation one compounds copper precipitated sulfide means purify nickel leachates
cementation conversion metal ion metal redox reaction typical application involves addition scrap iron solution copper ions iron dissolves copper metal deposited
solvent extraction
ion exchange
gas reduction treating solution nickel ammonia hydrogen affords nickel metal powder
electrowinning particularly selective expensive electrolysis process applied isolation precious metals gold electroplated solutions
solvent extraction
solvent extraction mixture extractant diluent used extract metal one phase another solvent extraction mixture often referred organic main constituent diluent type oil
