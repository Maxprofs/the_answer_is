following the broadcast of the 2005 series executive producer russell t davies claimed that the un were no longer happy to be associated with the fictional organisation and the un's full name could now no longer be used however the unit and un abbreviations could be used as long as it was not explained what the letters stood for in 2008 he announced that the organisation's name had been changed to the unified intelligence taskforce this new name was first mentioned on-screen in the sontaran stratagem also in 2008 in which it was indicated in a line of dialogue that the united nations still supports unit with funding
== creationedit ==
in a 2014 interview with doctor who magazine script editor terrance dicks recalled that he was present at the birth of unit during the production of the doctor who serial the invasion (1968) he credited both scriptwriter and script editor derrick sherwin and producer peter bryant as having come up with the idea beforehand claiming that they were testing the concept in the invasion before it had become central to the show in the doctor who serial spearhead from space (1970) in a series of interviews originally recorded for the 2006 dvd of the doctor who serial inferno (1970) actor nicholas courtney who played brigadier lethbridge-stewart in the invasion similarly described the invasion as a dummy run for the idea of the doctor the main protagonist of doctor who being exiled to earth dicks also said that the idea of exiling the doctor was done because making every serial take place on earth was cheaper to produce than constructing an alien planet and that unit was an idea sherwin had come up with to answer the question of what to do with the doctor after he was exiled to earth
in another 2014 interview in doctor who magazine sherwin recalled that after submitting his scripts for the invasion which included unit to bryant sherwin who was also working freelance as a script editor was told by bryant to introduce his unit idea earlier as it could take some of the weight off [the] shoulders of actor patrick troughton who played the doctor speaking in an interview on the 2011 special edition dvd of spearhead from space sherwin claimed that he had created unit because he wanted to give some considerable support to the doctor so that [troughton] didn't have so many damn lines to learn each week
sherwin told doctor who magazine in 2014 that while working as script editor on the doctor who serial the web of fear (1968) which also involved an army he told scriptwriters mervyn haisman and henry lincoln to include all of the characters that he had originally invented for the invasion sherwin was uncertain if the army forces featured in the web of fear appeared as unit but was convinced that as a teaser for unit's more substantial role in the invasion the web of fear was supposed to have replaced the basic army forces that were seen in the story however previously in an interview recorded for the 2006 dvd of inferno sherwin described the invasion as the start of unit and the beginning of the doctor coming down to earth
== fictional historyedit ==
the roots of unit in the doctor who universe lie in extraterrestrial incursions featured in the second doctor serial the web of fear (1968) and the seventh doctor serial remembrance of the daleks (1988)
following these incidents the newly formed unit's baptism of fire is an invasion by the cybermen in the invasion (1968) the contribution of scientific advice in battling extraterrestrial threats is recognised and both dr elizabeth shaw and the exiled third doctor joins unit just in time to help defeat the autons in spearhead from space (1970)
unit continued to feature in doctor who after spearhead but when the third doctor's exile is lifted in the three doctors (197273) his association with unit becomes more sporadic especially after his regeneration into his fourth incarnation at the end of planet of the spiders (1974) the last appearance of unit in the series for many years was in the seeds of doom (1976) however the organisation continues to execute its mandate to investigate and combat alien activity the final appearance of unit during the original run of doctor who was the seventh doctor serial battlefield (1989)

== unit datingedit ==
the original 19631989 series presents conflicting evidence about when the stories featuring unit are meant to take place and there has been much confusion and continuing fan debate on this subject initially the production team intended for the unit stories to take place in the near future in the 1975 story pyramids of mars sarah jane smith explicitly states that she is from 1980 and in the very next story when the doctor tries to return sarah to 1980 neither she or the doctor are surprised by sergeant benton being part of unit or that brigadier lethbridge stewart's name is on the office door however the 1983 story mawdryn undead explicitly states that the brigadier retired from unit in 1976 and that sergeant benton left the army in 1979
a reference to this confusion appeared in the 2008 episode the sontaran stratagem where the doctor was unsure if his time on the unit staff took place during the 1970s or the 1980s similarly the sarah jane adventures story the lost boy displays a unit file on sarah jane smith which says the service quickly expanded making our presence felt in a golden period that spanned the sixties the seventies and some would say the eighties. yet another reference occurred in the day of the doctor where kate stewart refers to one of my father's incident files codename cromer seventies or eighties depending on the dating protocol the cromer wording is a reference to the 197273 story the three doctors which as well as being the first time that doctors from different eras come together to fight a common foe similar to the war doctor tenth doctor and eleventh doctor in the day of the doctor was the occasion where brigadier lethbridge-stewart on first being transported to an alien world likened it to the norfolk coastal town of cromer kate stewart again refers to the confusion when she describes events from terror of the zygons as occurring in the 70s (or) 80s ("the zygon invasion")
== critical receptionedit ==
the concept of unit has been generally well received by doctor who fans in andrew cartmel's through time an unauthorised and unofficial history of doctor who the sharp contrast between the doctor's eccentric personality and the seriousness and normality of unit is described by cartmel as an inspired stroke
the organisation is often seen within the context of other international organisations which featured in science fiction of the post-war era among others these included smersh and spectre from the james bond novels s.h.i.e.l.d from marvel comics and u.n.c.l.e from the man from u.n.c.l.e like unit intended as a fictional united nations intelligence agency
