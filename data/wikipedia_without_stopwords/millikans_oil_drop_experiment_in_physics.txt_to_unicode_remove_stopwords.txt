oil drop experiment experiment performed robert millikan harvey fletcher measure elementary electric charge charge electron
experiment entailed observing tiny charged droplets oil two horizontal metal electrodes first zero applied electric field terminal velocity droplet measured terminal velocity drag force equals gravitational force depend radius different ways radius droplet therefore mass gravitational force could determined using known density oil adjustable voltage applied plates induce electric field voltage adjusted drops suspended mechanical equilibrium indicating electrical force gravitational force balanced using known electric field millikan fletcher could determine charge oil droplet repeating experiment many droplets confirmed charges small integer multiples certain base value found c within currently accepted value c proposed negative charge single electron
background
starting professor university chicago millikan significant input fletcher improving setup published seminal study remains controversial since papers found fletchers death describe events millikan coerced fletcher relinquishing authorship condition receiving phd return millikan used influence support fletchers career bell labs
millikan fletchers experiment involved measuring force oil droplets glass chamber sandwiched two electrodes one one electrical field calculated could measure droplets charge charge single electron c time millikan fletchers oil drop experiments existence subatomic particles universally accepted experimenting cathode rays j j thomson discovered negatively charged corpuscles called mass times smaller hydrogen atom similar results found george fitzgerald walter kaufmann known electricity magnetism however could explained basis charge continuous variable much way many properties light explained treating continuous wave rather stream photons
elementary charge e one fundamental physical constants accurate value great importance millikan won nobel prize physics part experiment
aside measurement beauty oil drop experiment simple elegant handson demonstration charge actually quantized thomas edison previously thought charge continuous variable became convinced working millikan fletchers apparatus experiment since repeated generations physics students although rather expensive difficult properly
last two decades several computerautomated experiments conducted search isolated fractionally charged particles far evidence fractional charge particles found measuring million drops
experimental procedure
apparatus
millikans fletchers apparatus incorporated parallel pair horizontal metal plates applying potential difference across plates uniform electric field created space ring insulating material used hold plates apart four holes cut ring three illumination bright light another allow viewing microscope
fine mist oil droplets sprayed chamber plates oil type usually used vacuum apparatus chosen extremely low vapour pressure ordinary oil would evaporate heat light source causing mass oil drop change course experiment oil drops became electrically charged friction nozzle sprayed alternatively charging could brought including ionising radiation source xray tube droplets entered space plates charged could made rise fall changing voltage across plates
method
initially oil drops allowed fall plates electric field turned quickly reach terminal velocity friction air chamber field turned large enough drops charged ones start rise upwards electric force fe greater downwards gravitational force fg way bits paper picked charged rubber rod likely looking drop selected kept middle field view alternately switching voltage drops fallen experiment continued one drop
drop allowed fall terminal velocity v absence electric field calculated drag force acting drop worked using stokes law
v terminal velocity ie velocity absence electric field falling drop viscosity air r radius drop
weight w volume d multiplied density acceleration due gravity g however needed apparent weight apparent weight air true weight minus upthrust equals weight air displaced oil drop perfectly spherical droplet apparent weight written
terminal velocity oil drop accelerating therefore total force acting must zero two forces f w must cancel one another f w implies
r calculated w easily worked
field turned back electric force drop
q charge oil drop e electric field plates parallel plates
v potential difference d distance plates
one conceivable way work q would adjust v oil drop remained steady could equate fe w also determining fe proves difficult mass oil drop difficult determine without reverting use stokes law practical approach turn v slightly oil drop rises new terminal velocity v
fraud allegations
controversy raised historian gerald holton use selectivity results millikans second experiment measuring electron charge holton pointed millikan disregarded data large set oil drops experiments without apparent reason allan franklin former high energy experimentalist philosopher science university colorado tried rebut point holton franklin contends millikans exclusions data affect final value e concedes substantial cosmetic surgery millikan performed effect reducing statistical error e enabled millikan claim calculated e better one half one percent fact millikan included data thrown would within would still resulted millikan measured e better anyone else time slightly larger uncertainty might allowed disagreement results within physics community david goodstein counters millikan plainly states included drops undergone complete series observations excluded drops group
millikans experiment example psychological effects scientific methodology
commencement address given california institute technology caltech reprinted surely youre joking mr feynman well pleasure finding things physicist richard feynman noted
learned lot experience handle ways fool one example millikan measured charge electron experiment falling oil drops got answer know quite right little bit incorrect value viscosity air interesting look history measurements charge electron millikan plot function time find one little bit bigger millikans next ones little bit bigger next ones little bit bigger finally settle number higher
didnt discover new number higher right away thing scientists ashamed ofthis historybecause apparent people things like got number high millikans thought something must wrongand would look find reason something might wrong got number close millikans value didnt look hard eliminated numbers far things like
accepted value elementary charge c indicates uncertainty last two decimal places nobel lecture millikan gave measurement statc equals c difference less one percent five times greater millikans standard error disagreement significant
