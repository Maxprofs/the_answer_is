plant cells eukaryotic cells differ several key aspects cells eukaryotic organisms distinctive features include
large central vacuole waterfilled volume enclosed membrane known tonoplast maintains cells turgor controls movement molecules cytosol sap stores useful material digests waste proteins organelles
cell wall composed cellulose hemicellulose pectin many cases lignin secreted protoplast outside cell membrane contrasts cell walls fungi made chitin bacteria made peptidoglycan
specialized celltocell communication pathways known plasmodesmata pores primary cell wall plasmalemma endoplasmic reticulum adjacent cells continuous
plastids notable chloroplast contains chlorophyll greencolored pigment absorbs sunlight allows plant make food process known photosynthesis types plastids amyloplasts specialized starch storage elaioplasts specialized fat storage chromoplasts specialized synthesis storage pigments mitochondria genome encoding genes plastids genomes unique genes presumed arose prokaryotic endosymbionts living cells early eukaryotic ancestor land plants algae
cell division construction phragmoplast template building cell plate late cytokinesis characteristic land plants groups algae notably charophytes order trentepohliales
sperm bryophytes pteridophytes cycads ginkgo flagella similar animals conifers flowering plants lack flagella centrioles present animal cells
cell types
parenchyma cells living cells functions ranging storage support photosynthesis phloem loading transfer cells apart xylem phloem vascular bundles leaves composed mainly parenchyma cells parenchyma cells epidermis specialized light penetration focusing regulation gas exchange others among least specialized cells plant tissue may remain totipotent capable dividing produce new populations undifferentiated cells throughout lives parenchyma cells thin permeable primary walls enabling transport small molecules cytoplasm responsible wide range biochemical functions nectar secretion manufacture secondary products discourage herbivory parenchyma cells contain many chloroplasts concerned primarily photosynthesis called chlorenchyma cells others majority parenchyma cells potato tubers seed cotyledons legumes storage function
collenchyma cells collenchyma cells alive maturity primary wall cells mature meristem derivatives initially resemble parenchyma differences quickly become apparent plastids develop secretory apparatus er golgi proliferates secrete additional primary wall wall commonly thickest corners three cells come contact thinnest two cells come contact though arrangements wall thickening possible
pectin hemicellulose dominant constituents collenchyma cell walls dicotyledon angiosperms may contain little cellulose petasites collenchyma cells typically quite elongated may divide transversely give septate appearance role cell type support plant axes still growing length confer flexibility tensile strength tissues primary wall lacks lignin would make tough rigid cell type provides could called plastic support support hold young stem petiole air cells stretched cells around elongate stretchable support without elastic snapback good way describe collenchyma parts strings celery collenchyma
sclerenchyma cells sclerenchyma cells greek skleros hard hard tough cells function mechanical support two broad types sclereids stone cells fibres cells develop extensive secondary cell wall laid inside primary cell wall secondary wall impregnated lignin making hard impermeable water thus cells cannot survive long cannot exchange sufficient material maintain active metabolism sclerenchyma cells typically dead functional maturity cytoplasm missing leaving empty central cavity
functions sclereid cells hard cells give leaves fruits gritty texture include discouraging herbivory damaging digestive passages small insect larval stages physical protection solid tissue hard sclereid cells form pit wall peach many fruits functions fibres include provision loadbearing support tensile strength leaves stems herbaceous plants sclerenchyma fibres involved conduction either water nutrients xylem carbon compounds phloem likely may evolved modifications xylem phloem initials early land plants

xylem cells elongated cells lignified secondary thickening cell walls xylem cells specialised conduction water first appeared plants transition land silurian period million years ago see cooksonia possession xylem defines vascular plants tracheophytes xylem tracheids pointed elongated xylem cells simplest continuous primary cell walls lignified secondary wall thickenings form rings hoops reticulate networks complex tracheids valvelike perforations called bordered pits characterise gymnosperms ferns pteridophytes gymnosperms xylem tracheids angiosperms also xylem vessels vessel members hollow xylem cells without end walls aligned endtoend form long continuous tubes bryophytes lack true xylem cells sporophytes waterconducting tissue known hydrome composed elongated cells simpler construction
phloem specialised tissue food transport higher plants phloem cells mainly transport sucrose along pressure gradients generated osmosis phenomenon called translocation phloem consists two cell types sieve tubes intimately associated companion cells sieve tube elements lack nuclei ribosomes metabolism functions regulated adjacent nucleate companion cells sieve tubes joined endtoend perforate endplates known sieve plates allow transport photosynthate sieve elements companion cells connected sieve tubes via plasmodesmata responsible loading phloem sugars bryophytes lack phloem moss sporophytes simpler tissue analogous function known leptome
plant epidermal cells specialised parenchyma cells covering external surfaces leaves stems roots epidermal cells aerial organs arise superficial layer cells known tunica l l layers covers plant shoot apex whereas cortex vascular tissues arise innermost layer shoot apex known corpus l layer epidermis roots originates layer cells immediately beneath root cap
epidermis aerial organs roots covered cuticle made polyester cutin andor hydrocarbon polymer cutan superficial layer epicuticular waxes epidermal cells primary shoot thought plant cells biochemical capacity synthesize cutin several cell types may present epidermis notable among stomatal guard cells glandular clothing hairs trichomes root hairs primary roots shoot epidermis plants guard cells chloroplasts chloroplasts contain green pigment chlorophyll needed photosynthesis
