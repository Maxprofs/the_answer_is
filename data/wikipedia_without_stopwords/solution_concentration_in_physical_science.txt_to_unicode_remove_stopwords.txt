misconceptions recoilredigr
hollywood depictions firearm shooting victims thrown several feet backwards inaccurate although oftencited reason conservation energy although energy must conserved mean kinetic energy bullet must equal recoil energy gun fact many times greater example bullet fired m rifle approximately joules kinetic energy leaves muzzle recoil energy gun less joules despite imbalance energy still conserved total energy system firing chemical energy stored propellant equal total energy firing kinetic energy recoiling firearm plus kinetic energy bullet ejecta plus heat energy explosion order work distribution kinetic energy firearm bullet necessary use law conservation momentum combination law conservation energy
reasoning applies bullet strikes target bullet may kinetic energy hundreds even thousands joules theory enough lift person well ground energy however cannot efficiently given target total momentum must conserved approximately fraction energy transferred target energy transferred target divided total kinetic energy bullet cannot larger inverse ratio masses target bullet
