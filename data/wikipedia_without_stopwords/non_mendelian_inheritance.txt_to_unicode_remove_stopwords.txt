nonmendelian inheritance general term refers pattern inheritance traits segregate accordance mendels laws laws describe inheritance traits linked single genes chromosomes nucleus mendelian inheritance parent contributes one two possible alleles trait genotypes parents genetic cross known mendels laws used determine distribution phenotypes expected population offspring several situations proportions phenotypes observed progeny match predicted values
nonmendelian inheritance plays role several disease processes
types
extranuclear inheritance
extranuclear inheritance also known cytoplasmic inheritance form nonmendelian inheritance first discovered carl correns working mirabilis jalapa correns observed leaf color dependent genotype maternal parent based data determined trait transmitted character present cytoplasm ovule later research ruth sager others identified dna present chloroplasts responsible unusual inheritance pattern observed work poky strain mold neurospora crassa begun mary hershel mitchell ultimately led discovery genetic material mitochondria well
according endosymbiont theory mitochondria chloroplasts free living organisms taken eukaryotic cell time mitochondria chloroplasts formed symbiotic relationship eukaryotic hosts although transfer number genes organelles nucleus prevents living independently still possesses genetic material form double stranded dna
transmission organellar dna responsible phenomenon extranuclear inheritance chloroplasts mitochondria present cytoplasm maternal gametes paternal gametes sperm example cytoplasmic mitochondria thus phenotype traits linked genes found either chloroplasts mitochondria determined exclusively maternal parent
humans mitochondrial diseases class diseases many affect muscles eye
gene conversion
gene conversion one major forms nonmendelian inheritance gene conversion reparation process dna recombination piece dna sequence information transferred one dna helix remains unchanged another dna helix whose sequence altered may occur mismatch repair strands dna derived different parents thus mismatch repair convert one allele phenomenon detected offspring nonmendelian ratios frequently observed eg fungal crosses
infectious heredity
another form nonmendelian inheritance known infectious heredity infectious particles viruses may infect host cells continue reside cytoplasm cells presence particles results altered phenotype phenotype may subsequently transmitted progeny phenotype dependent presence invader host cells cytoplasm inheritance determined infected status maternal parent result uniparental transmission trait extranuclear inheritance
one well studied examples infectious heredity killer phenomenon exhibited yeast two doublestranded rna viruses designated l m responsible phenotype l virus codes capsid proteins viruses well rna polymerase thus m virus infect cells already harboring l virus particles m viral rna encodes toxin secreted host cell kills susceptible cells growing close proximity host m viral rna also renders host cell immune lethal effects toxin cell susceptible must therefore either uninfected harbor l virus
l m viruses capable exiting host cell conventional means transfer cell cell host undergoes mating progeny mating involving doubly infected yeast cell also infected l m viruses therefore killer phenotype passed progeny
heritable traits result infection foreign particles also identified drosophila wild type flies normally full recover anesthetized carbon dioxide certain lines flies identified die exposure compound carbon dioxide sensitivity passed mothers progeny sensitivity due infection sigma virus rhabdovirus capable infecting drosophila
although process usually associated viruses recent research shown wolbachia bacterium also capable inserting genome host
genomic imprinting
genomic imprinting represents yet another example nonmendelian inheritance conventional inheritance genes given trait passed progeny parents however genes epigenetically marked transmission altering levels expression imprints created gamete formation erased creation germ line cells therefore new pattern imprinting made generation
genes imprinted differently depending parental origin chromosome contains mice insulinlike growth factor gene undergoes imprinting protein encoded gene helps regulate body size mice possess two functional copies gene larger two mutant copies size mice heterozygous locus depends parent wild type allele came functional allele originated mother offspring exhibit dwarfism whereas paternal allele generate normal sized mouse maternal igf gene imprinted imprinting results inactivation igf gene chromosome passed mother
imprints formed due differential methylation paternal maternal alleles results differing expression alleles two parents sites significant methylation associated low levels gene expression higher gene expression found unmethylated sites mode inheritance phenotype determined specific allele transmitted offspring also sex parent transmitted
mosaicism
individuals possess cells genetic differences cells body termed mosaics differences result mutations occur different tissues different periods development mutation happens nongamete forming tissues characterized somatic germline mutations occur egg sperm cells passed offspring mutations occur early development affect greater number cells result individual identified mosaic strictly based phenotype
mosaicism also results phenomenon known xinactivation female mammals two x chromosomes prevent lethal gene dosage problems one chromosomes inactivated following fertilization process occurs randomly cells organisms body given females two x chromosomes almost certainly differ specific pattern alleles result differing cell phenotypes depending chromosome silenced calico cats almost female demonstrate one commonly observed manifestations process
trinucleotide repeat disorders
trinucleotide repeat disorders also follow nonmendelian pattern inheritance diseases caused expansion microsatellite tandem repeats consisting stretch three nucleotides normal individuals number repeated units relatively low successive generation chance number repeats expand occurs progeny progress premutation ultimately affected status individuals number repeats falls premutation range good chance affected children progress affected status exhibit symptoms particular disease prominent trinucleotide repeat disorders include fragile x syndrome huntingtons disease case fragile x syndrome thought symptoms result increased methylation accompanying reduced expression fragile x mental retardation gene individuals sufficient number repeats
