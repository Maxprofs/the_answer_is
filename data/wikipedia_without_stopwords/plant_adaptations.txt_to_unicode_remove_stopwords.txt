oligotroph organism live environment offers low levels nutrients may contrasted copiotrophs prefer nutritionally rich environments oligotrophs characterized slow growth low rates metabolism generally low population density
adjective oligotrophic may used refer environments offer little sustain life organisms survive environments adaptations support survival etymologically word oligotroph combination greek adjective oligos meaning adjective trophikos meaning feeding
oligotrophic environments include deep oceanic sediments caves glacial polar ice deep subsurface soil aquifers ocean waters leached soils
examples oligotrophic organisms cavedwelling olm bacterium pelagibacter ubique abundant organism oceans estimated individuals total lichens extremely low metabolic rate
plant adaptations
plant adaptations oligotrophic soils provide greater efficient nutrient uptake reduced nutrient consumption efficient nutrient storage improvements nutrient uptake facilitated root adaptations nitrogenfixing root nodules mycorrhizae cluster roots consumption reduced slow growth rates efficient use lowavailability nutrients example use highly available ions maintain turgor pressure lowavailability nutrients reserved building tissues despite adaptations nutrient requirement typically exceed uptake growing season many oligotrophic plants ability store nutrients example trunk tissues demand low remobilise demand increases
oligotrophic environments
ecosystem environment said oligotrophic offers little sustain life term commonly utilised describe environments water ice air rock soil low nutrient levels
oligotrophic environments special interest alternative energy sources survival strategies upon life could rely
antarctic
lake vostok freshwater lake isolated world beneath km mi antarctic ice approximately million years frequently held primary example oligotrophic environment
australia
sandplains lateritic soils southern western australia extremely thick craton precluded geological activity since cambrian glaciation renew soils since carboniferous thus soils extremely nutrientpoor vegetation must use strategies cluster roots gain even smallest quantities nutrients phosphorus sulfur
vegetation regions however remarkable biodiversity places great tropical rainforest produces spectacular wildflowers world however severely threatened climate change moved winter rain belt south also clearing agriculture use fertilizers primarily driven low land costs make farming economic even yields fraction europe north america
