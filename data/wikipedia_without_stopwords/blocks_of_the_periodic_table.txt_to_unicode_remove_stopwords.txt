discussion nature energies blocks naturally appear order complex atoms see atomic orbital electron configuration
periodic nature filling orbitals well emergence p d f blocks obvious order filling given matrix form increasing principal quantum numbers starting new rows periods matrix subshell composed first two quantum numbers repeated many times required pair electrons may contain result compressed periodic table entry representing two successive elements
periodic table
approximate correspondence nomenclature blocks based electronic configuration groupings elements based chemical properties sblock pblock together usually considered main group elements dblock corresponds transition metals fblock lanthanides actinides however everyone agrees exact membership set elements example group elements zn cd hg considered main group scientists transition metals others groups columns fblock groups numbered
periodic tables organized blocks helium placed next hydrogen instead top neon tables organized chemical properties helium sblock outer electrons atomic orbital addition blocks listed table hypothetical gblock pictured gblock elements seen expanded extended periodic table also lutetium lawrencium placed scandium yttrium reflect status dblock elements although argued lanthanum actinium instead hold positions electrons f f orbitals respectively lutetium lawrencium
pblock elements
pblock right side periodic table includes elements six columns beginning column ending column helium top column included pblock periodic table shown pblock colored yellow containing elements
pblock home biggest variety elements block contains three types elements metals nonmetals metalloids generally pblock elements best described terms element type column number
pblock elements unified fact valence electrons outermost electrons p orbital p orbital consists six lobed shapes coming central point evenly spaced angles p orbital hold maximum six electrons hence six columns pblock elements column first column pblock one valence electron elements column second column pblock two valence electrons trend continues way reach column six valence electrons
metals
pblock metals classic metal characteristics shiny good conductors heat electricity lose electrons easily generally metals high melting points readily react nonmetals form ionic compounds ionic compounds form positive metal ion bonds negative nonmetal ion
pblock metals several fascinating properties gallium rd row column metal melt palm hand tin fourth row column abundant flexible extremely useful metal important component many metal alloys like bronze solder pewter
sitting right beneath tin lead toxic metal ancient people used lead variety things food sweeteners pottery glazes eating utensils many historians suspect lead poisoning related fall roman civilization long time lead used manufacturing paints within last century lead paint use restricted due toxic nature
metalloids
metalloids properties metals nonmetals term metalloid lacks strict definition elements commonly recognized metalloids pblock boron silicon germanium arsenic antimony tellurium
silicon perhaps famous metalloid second abundant element earths crust one main ingredients glass used make microchips computers electronic devices valuable silicon technology industry silicon valley california named
germanium properties similar silicon yet element much rare arsenic toxic metalloid used throughout history additive metal alloys paints even makeup
noble gases
previously called inert gases name changed gases inert noble gases nitrogen noble gases located far right column periodic table also known group zero group eighteen
noble gases full outer shells eight electrons however top noble gases helium shell full two electrons fact outer shells full means rarely react elements led original title inert
chemical properties gases also used laboratory help stabilize reactions would usually proceed quickly atomic numbers increase elements become rarer rare nature rare useful elements
halogens
second column right side periodic table group halogen family elements elements one electron shy full shells close full trait combining many different elements reactive often found bonding metals elements group one elements one electron
halogens react intensity fluorine reactive combines elements around periodic table columns reactivity decreases atomic number increases
halogen combines another element resulting compound called halide one best examples halide sodium chloride nacl
