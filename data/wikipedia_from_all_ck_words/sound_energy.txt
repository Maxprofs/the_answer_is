sound energy is a form of energy associated with the vibration of matter the si unit of sound energy is the joule (j) sound is a mechanical wave and as such consists physically in oscillatory elastic compression and in oscillatory displacement of a fluid therefore the medium acts as storage for both potential and kinetic energy as well
consequently the sound energy in a volume of interest is defined as the sum of the potential and kinetic energy densities integrated over that volume
where
v is the volume of interest
p is the sound pressure
v is the particle velocity
0 is the density of the medium without sound present
is the local density of the medium
c is the speed of sound
