overview
relatively little known precambrian despite making roughly seveneighths earths history known largely discovered onwards precambrian fossil record poorer succeeding phanerozoic fossils present eg stromatolites limited biostratigraphic use many precambrian rocks heavily metamorphosed obscuring origins others destroyed erosion remain deeply buried beneath phanerozoic strata
thought earth coalesced material orbit around sun roughly ma billion years ago ga may struck large marssized planetesimal shortly formed splitting material formed moon see giant impact hypothesis stable crust apparently place ma since zircon crystals western australia dated ma
term precambrian recognized international commission stratigraphy general term including archean proterozoic eons still used geologists paleontologists general discussions requiring specific eon names briefly also called cryptozoic eon
life forms
known life originated carbon billion year old rocks islands western greenland may organic origin wellpreserved bacteria older billion years found western australia probable fossils million years older found area fairly solid record bacterial life throughout remainder precambrian
excluding contested reports much older forms usa india first complex multicellular life forms seem appeared roughly ma oldest fossil evidence complex life comes lantian formation least million years ago quite diverse collection softbodied forms known variety locations worldwide ma referred ediacaran vendian biota hardshelled creatures appeared toward end time span middle later cambrian period diverse fauna recorded burgess shale including may represent stem groups modern taxa rapid radiation lifeforms early cambrian called cambrian explosion life

planetary environment oxygen catastrophe

atmosphere early earth well understood geologists believe composed primarily nitrogen carbon dioxide relatively inert gases lacking free oxygen disputed evidence support oxygenrich atmosphere since early archean
molecular oxygen present significant fraction earths atmosphere photosynthetic life forms evolved began produce large quantities byproduct metabolism radical shift inert oxidizing atmosphere caused ecological crisis sometimes called oxygen catastrophe first oxygen would quickly combine elements earths crust primarily iron produced supply oxidizable surfaces ran oxygen began accumulate atmosphere modern highoxygen atmosphere developed evidence lies older rocks contain massive banded iron formations laid iron oxygen first combined
subdivisions
established terminology evolved covering early years earths existence radiometric dating allows plausible real dates assigned specific formations features precambrian supereon divided three eons hadean ma archean ma proterozoic ma see timetable precambrian
proterozoic eon refers time lower cambrian boundary ma back ma originally used synonym precambrian hence included everything prior cambrian boundary proterozoic eon divided three eras neoproterozoic mesoproterozoic paleoproterozoic
neoproterozoic youngest geologic era proterozoic eon cambrian period lower boundary ma back ma neoproterozoic corresponds precambrian z rocks older north american geology
ediacaran youngest geologic period within neoproterozoic era geologic time scale dates ma period ediacaran fauna appeared
cryogenian middle period neoproterozoic era ma
tonian earliest period neoproterozoic era ma
mesoproterozoic middle era proterozoic eon ma corresponds precambrian y rocks older north american geology
paleoproterozoic oldest era proterozoic eon ma corresponds precambrian x rocks older north american geology
archean eon ma
hadean eon ma term intended originally cover time preserved rocks deposited although zircon crystals ma demonstrate existence crust hadean eon records hadean time come moon meteorites
proposed precambrian divided eons eras reflect stages planetary evolution rather current scheme based upon numerical ages system could rely events stratigraphic record demarcated gssps precambrian could divided five natural eons characterized follows
accretion differentiation period planetary formation giant moonforming impact event
hadean dominated heavy bombardment ga possibly including cool early earth period end late heavy bombardment period
archean period defined first crustal formations isua greenstone belt deposition banded iron formations due increasing atmospheric oxygen content
transition period continued iron banded formation first continental red beds
proterozoic period modern plate tectonics first animals
precambrian supercontinents
movement plates caused formation breakup continents time including occasional formation supercontinent containing continents earliest known supercontinent vaalbara formed protocontinents supercontinent billion years ago ga vaalbara broke ga ago supercontinent kenorland formed ga ago broke sometime ga protocontinent cratons called laurentia baltica australia kalahari supercontinent columbia nuna formed period billion years broke billion years ago supercontinent rodinia thought formed billion years ago embodied earths continents broken eight continents around million years ago
