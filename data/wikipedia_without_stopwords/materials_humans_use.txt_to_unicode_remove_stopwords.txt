alien species
kravak kravak name translated people sorrow killer clanbased bipedal anthropoids mix reptillian insectoid features communicate guttural language hard humans comprehend thus making relations difficult relations complicated fact kravak pass several gender behaviorial stages age make somewhat unpredictable members one stage aggressive territorial another stage kravak technology similar humans cases advanced favor powerful nonenergy based weaponry railguns missiles also lack shield technology
savasku savasku extremely longlived semiaquatic lifeforms resembling giant nearlyimmobile jellyfish ancient race seen many spacefaring species rise fall little known race except fact seem obsessed balance fearful change believe young spacefaring races like humans naive left unchecked ruthlessly oppose expansion space savasku technology biosynthetic spaceships alive genetically created grown specific purposes construct ships equipped various weapon organs generate energy beams launch spore projectiles
phalon phalons carbonbased oxygenbreathing species somewhat humanoid physique however multijointed limbs exoskeletal hides flat triangularshaped heads dominated single trilensed eye three sexes fertile males females numerous asexual group comprises military force like savasku phalon technology biosynthetic nature however use genetically grown materials like humans use metal plastic building snaillike spaceships made organic components alive right phalon thinkingprocess similar humans two species carry meaningful conversations however phalons completely amoral take want without considering payment wish without regard consequence
overview game mechanics
full thrust ft uses sixsided dice d combat resolutions typically game ft requires lots sixsided dice version rule set measurements ft based movement units mu equal whatever measurements players wish use usually either inches centimeters depends sizes models used size battle board normally rulers tape measures used measure distances models traditional figurebased wargames ft also played hexprinted battle board inch hex represents one mu rules explicitly support
ft turnbased game player secretly writes movement orders players move ships simultaneously one another accordance orders combat played several phases missile movement fighter attacks directfire weapons etc game may played one side wiped set number turns commonly explicit objective set side victory determined remaining forces end game one side taken heavy damage player decides retract fleet game play
point values
pickup game rather part extended campaign players build fleets warships based point values opposing forces decide many points using play larger powerful ships cost points reasonable guide length complexity battle
mass factors
ship mass factor represents size hull systems weapons drives defences etc must fit inside ship gets larger classification could change smallest ships usually scouts frigates corvettes mass medium mass ships destroyers cruisers mass heaviest ships battleships dreadnoughts carriers mass game capable handling superships mass factors adding weapons systems costs points well mass
thrust rating
ships need sublight engines thrust rating number represents many movement units mu battle map ship change speed per turn speed incremental instance ship thrust factor increase speed mus per turn speed one turn next next also slow thrust rating per turn well speed would take turns slow dead stop
two movement systems available default cinematic system ships move turn style wet navy vessels seen space opera film television vector system rather realistic representation movement space somewhat complex
movement ships planned ahead time miniatures physically moved movements written movement orders sheet kept secret players turn begins players must move ships written orders sheet movement orders must also include launching missiles fighters
ftl
ships also ftl fasterthanlight drives ones dont insystem defence ships orbital stations battle riders brought combat via ftl tug
ftl normally used tactical strategic purposes allowing damaged ship outnumbered fleet flee battle preserve remaining strength due physical nature ftl system desperation used weapon although much chance destroying ship deploys enemy vessel
variant settings one based star trek universe full trek may different technology rules full trek nature warp drive allows shiptoship combat warp
weapons
several weapon systems available full thrust game
beam weapons
common ship weapons beam batteries power level higher larger number farther battery fire damage dice weapon inflicts
every power level battery beams fire movement units mus ship table level battery fire maximum range mu level fire maximum mu every mu beam fires loses die damaging power instance level battery inflicts dice damage within mu die damage
second edition ver ft rules batteries letter designation class c batteries equivalent level batteries class powerful mega aa batteries added mega aas could fire farthest chance burning ver beam weapon system refined former class became class former class b became class
theory limit powerful beam weapon instance massive super ship could beam weapon class higher although application would impractical due increases mass point cost ship would better chance inflicting damage several smaller weapons instead one super weapon
systems
kinds offensive weapons include pulse torpedoes needle beams target specific system enemy ship disable submunition packs missiles minelayers megadamage weapons nova cannon wave gun
ships protected pointdefense systems pdss clusters smaller weapons used shoot missiles enemy fighters also screen systems use beam attacks though weapons impeded missiles mass driver projectiles pass hull pdss asset miscellaneous systems include reflex fields chance deflecting beam back attacker cloaking fields enhanced sensors
ships required include fire control sensors designs without firecons ship cannot select targets firecons incorporated design targets ship fire per turn specialised firecon area defence fire control allows ships pds attack missiles fighters aimed targets manner aegis ship
fleet book vol xeno files added even weapons including mass drivers strange alien weapons living ships hulls
fighters
players include carriers fleets may dispatch groups fighters battle many kinds specialized fighter different tactical attacks interceptors instance better chances destroying enemy fighters antiship strike ability torpedo fighters heavy oneshot antiship punch vulnerable fighters
