an autotroph ("self-feeding from the greek autos self and trophe nourishing") or producer is an organism that produces complex organic compounds (such as carbohydrates fats and proteins) from simple substances present in its surroundings generally using energy from light (photosynthesis) or inorganic chemical reactions (chemosynthesis) they are the producers in a food chain such as plants on land or algae in water in contrast to heterotrophs as consumers of autotrophs they do not need a living source of energy or organic carbon autotrophs can reduce carbon dioxide to make organic compounds for biosynthesis and also create a store of chemical energy most autotrophs use water as the reducing agent but some can use other hydrogen compounds such as hydrogen sulfide phototrophs (green plants and algae) a type of autotroph convert electromagnetic energy from sunlight into chemical energy in the form of reduced carbon
autotrophs can be photoautotrophs or chemoautotrophs phototrophs use light as an energy source while chemotrophs utilize electron donors as a source of energy whether from organic or inorganic sources however in the case of autotrophs these electron donors come from inorganic chemical sources such chemotrophs are lithotrophs lithotrophs use inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide elemental sulfur ammonium and ferrous iron as reducing agents for biosynthesis and chemical energy storage photoautotrophs and lithoautotrophs use a portion of the atp produced during photosynthesis or the oxidation of inorganic compounds to reduce nadp+ to nadph to form organic compounds

some organisms rely on organic compounds as a source of carbon but are able to use light or inorganic compounds as a source of energy such organisms are not defined as autotrophic but rather as heterotrophic an organism that obtains carbon from organic compounds but obtains energy from light is called a photoheterotroph while an organism that obtains carbon from organic compounds but obtains energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds is termed a chemoheterotroph chemolithoheterotroph or lithoheterotroph
evidence suggests that some fungi may also obtain energy from radiation such radiotrophic fungi were found growing inside a reactor of the chernobyl nuclear power plant
== ecology ==
autotrophs are fundamental to the food chains of all ecosystems in the world they take energy from the environment in the form of sunlight or inorganic chemicals and use it to create energy-rich molecules such as carbohydrates this mechanism is called primary production other organisms called heterotrophs take in autotrophs as food to carry out functions necessary for their life thus heterotrophs all animals almost all fungi as well as most bacteria and protozoa depend on autotrophs or primary producers for the energy and raw materials they need heterotrophs obtain energy by breaking down organic molecules (carbohydrates fats and proteins) obtained in food carnivorous organisms rely on autotrophs indirectly as the nutrients obtained from their heterotroph prey come from autotrophs they have consumed
most ecosystems are supported by the autotrophic primary production of plants that capture photons initially released by the sun the process of photosynthesis splits a water molecule (h2o) releasing oxygen (o2) into the atmosphere and reducing carbon dioxide (co2) to release the hydrogen atoms that fuel the metabolic process of primary production plants convert and store the energy of the photon into the chemical bonds of simple sugars during photosynthesis these plant sugars are polymerized for storage as long-chain carbohydrates including other sugars starch and cellulose glucose is also used to make fats and proteins when autotrophs are eaten by heterotrophs i.e. consumers such as animals the carbohydrates fats and proteins contained in them become energy sources for the heterotrophs proteins can be made using nitrates sulfates and phosphates in the soil

 ^ the word autotroph comes from the greek autos self and trophe nutrition, related to trephein to make solid congeal thicken
