a hazard is a situation that poses a level of threat to life health property or environment most hazards are dormant or potential with only a theoretical risk of harm however once a hazard becomes active it can create an emergency a hazardous situation that has come to pass is called an incident hazard and possibility interact together to create risk
identification of hazard risks is the first step in performing a risk assessment
== modes of a hazardedit ==
hazards are sometimes classified into three modes
dormantthe situation presents a potential hazard but no people property or environment is currently affected for instance a hillside may be unstable with the potential for a landslide but there is nothing below or on the hillside that could be affected
armedpeople property or environment are in potential harm's way
activea harmful incident involving the hazard has actually occurred often this is referred to not as an active hazard but as an accident emergency incident or disaster
=== types of hazardedit ===
hazards are generally labeled as one of five types
physical hazards are conditions or situations that can cause the body physical harm or intense stress physical hazards can be both natural and human made elements
chemical hazards are substances that can cause harm or damage to the body property or the environment chemical hazards can be both natural or human made origin
biological hazards are biological agents that can cause harm to the human body these some biological agents can be viruses parasites bacteria food fungi and foreign toxins
psychological hazards are created during work related stress or a stressful environment.a person can be a hazard when he/she is affected psychological disturbance through -stress,shift patterns and also can be a hazard when a person is under the influence of alcohol,illness and lack of training

== classifying hazardsedit ==
by its nature a hazard involves something that could potentially be harmful to a person's life health property or the environment one key concept in identifying a hazard is the presence of stored energy that when released can cause damage stored energy can occur in many forms chemical mechanical thermal radioactive electrical etc another class of hazard does not involve release of stored energy rather it involves the presence of hazardous situations examples include confined or limited egress spaces oxygen-depleted atmospheres awkward positions repetitive motions low-hanging or protruding objects etc
there are several methods of classifying hazard but most systems use some variation on the factors of likelihood of the hazard turning into an incident and the seriousness of the incident if it were to occur (this discussion moved away from hazard to a discussion of risk.)
a common method is to score both likelihood and seriousness on a numerical scale (with the most likely and most serious scoring highest) and multiplying one by the other to produce a comparative score
risk = hazard vulnerability / capacity
this score identifies hazards that require mitigation a low score on likelihood of occurrence may mean that the hazard is dormant whereas a high score indicates it may be an active hazard
an important component of seriousness if incident occurred is serious to whom? different populations may be affected differently by accidents for example an explosion has widely differing effects on different populations depending on the distance from the explosion these possible effects range from death from overpressure or shrapnel to inhalation of noxious gases (for people downwind) to exposure to a loud noise
=== prioritization of hazardsedit ===
hazards can be identified and prioritized using the smug model the smug model provides a means for prioritizing hazards based on the risk they present during an emergency the smug model stands for seriousness manageability urgency growth.it also consists various disease spreading viruses
