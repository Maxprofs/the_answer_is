the term shrimp is used to refer to some decapod crustaceans although the exact animals covered can vary used broadly it may cover any of the groups with elongated bodies and a primarily swimming mode of locomotion chiefly caridea and dendrobranchiata in some fields however the term is used more narrowly and may be restricted to caridea to smaller species of either group or to only the marine species under the broader definition shrimp may be synonymous with prawn covering stalk-eyed swimming crustaceans with long narrow muscular tails (abdomens) long whiskers (antennae) and slender legs they swim forward by paddling with swimmerets on the underside of their abdomens crabs and lobsters have strong walking legs whereas shrimp have thin fragile legs which they use primarily for perching
shrimp are widespread and abundant they can be found feeding near the seafloor on most coasts and estuaries as well as in rivers and lakes to escape predators some species flip off the seafloor and dive into the sediment they usually live from one to seven years shrimp are often solitary though they can form large schools during the spawning season there are thousands of species and usually there is a species adapted to any particular habitat any small crustacean which resembles a shrimp tends to be called one
they play important roles in the food chain and are important food sources for larger animals from fish to whales the muscular tails of shrimp can be delicious to eat and they are widely caught and farmed for human consumption commercial shrimp species support an industry worth 50 billion dollars a year and in 2010 the total commercial production of shrimp was nearly 7 million tonnes (see production chart below) shrimp farming took off during the 1980s particularly in china and by 2007 the harvest from shrimp farms exceeded the capture of wild shrimp there are significant issues with excessive bycatch when shrimp are captured in the wild and with pollution damage done to estuaries when they are used to support shrimp farming many shrimp species are small as the term shrimp suggests about 2 cm (0.79 in) long but some shrimp exceed 25 cm (9.8 in) larger shrimp are more likely to be targeted commercially and are often referred to as prawns particularly in britain
== classification ==
shrimp are swimming crustaceans with long narrow muscular abdomens and long antennae unlike crabs and lobsters shrimp have well developed pleopods (swimmerets) and slender walking legs they are more adapted for swimming than walking historically it was the distinction between walking and swimming that formed the primary taxonomic division into the former suborders natantia and reptantia members of the natantia (shrimp in the broader sense) were adapted for swimming while the reptantia (crabs lobsters etc.) were adapted for crawling or walking some other groups also have common names that include the word shrimp any small swimming crustacean resembling a shrimp tends to be called one
== description ==
the diagram on the right and the following description refers mainly to the external anatomy of the common european shrimp crangon crangon as a typical example of a decapod shrimp the body of the shrimp is divided into two main parts the head and thorax which are fused together to form the cephalothorax and a long narrow abdomen the shell which protects the cephlathorax is harder and thicker than the shell elsewhere on the shrimp and is called the carapace the carapace typically surrounds the gills through which water is pumped by the action of the mouthparts the rostrum eyes whiskers and legs also issue from the carapace the rostrum from the latin rstrum meaning beak looks like a beak or pointed nose at the front of the shrimp's head it is a rigid forward extension of the carapace and can be used for attack or defence it may also stabilize the shrimp when it swims backwards two bulbous eyes on stalks sit either side of the rostrum these are compound eyes which have panoramic vision and are very good at detecting movement two pairs of whiskers (antennae) also issue from the head one of these pairs is very long and can be twice the length of the shrimp while the other pair are quite short the antennae have sensors on them which allow the shrimp to feel where they touch and also allow them to smell or taste things by sampling the chemicals in the water the long antennae help the shrimp orient itself with regard to its immediate surroundings while the short antennae help assess the suitability of prey
eight pairs of appendages issue from the cephlathorax the first three pairs the maxillipeds latin for jaw feet are used as mouthparts in crangon crangon the first pair the maxillula pumps water into the gill cavity after the maxilliped come more five pairs of appendages the pereiopods these form the ten decapod legs in crangon crangon the first two pairs of pereiopods have claws or chela the chela can grasp food items and bring them to the mouth they can also be used for fighting and grooming the remaining six legs are long and slender and are used for walking or perching
the muscular abdomen has six segments and has a thinner shell than the carapace each segment has a separate overlapping shell which can be transparent the first five segments each have a pair of appendages on the underside which are shaped like paddles and are used for swimming forward the appendices are called pleopods or swimmerets and can be used for more purposes than just swimming some shrimp species use them for brooding eggs others have gills on them for breathing and the males in some species use the first pair or two for insemination the sixth segment terminates in the telson flanked by two pairs of appendages called the uropods the uropods allow the shrimp to swim backwards and function like rudders steering the shrimp when it swims forward together the telson and uropods form a splayed tail fan if a shrimp is alarmed it can flex its tail fan in a rapid movement this results in a backward dart called the caridoid escape reaction (lobstering)
== habitat ==
shrimp are widespread and can be found near the seafloor of most coasts and estuaries as well as in rivers and lakes there are numerous species and usually there is a species adapted to any particular habitat most shrimp species are marine although about a quarter of the described species are found in fresh water marine species are found at depths of up to 5,000 metres (16,000 ft) and from the tropics to the polar regions
== behaviour ==
there are many variations in the ways different types of shrimp look and behave even within the core group of caridean shrimp the small delicate pederson's shrimp (above) looks and behaves quite unlike the large commercial pink shrimp or the snapping pistol shrimp the caridean family of pistol shrimp are characterized by big asymmetrical claws the larger of which can produce a loud snapping sound the family is diverse and worldwide in distribution consisting of about 600 species colonies of snapping shrimp are a major source of noise in the ocean and can interfere with sonar and underwater communication the small emperor shrimp has a symbiotic relationship with sea slugs and sea cucumbers and may help keep them clear of ectoparasites
most shrimp are omnivorous but some are specialised for particular modes of feeding some are filter feeders using their setose (bristly) legs as a sieve some scrape algae from rocks cleaner shrimp feed on the parasites and necrotic tissue of the reef fish they groom in turn shrimp are eaten by various animals particularly fish and seabirds and frequently host bopyrid parasites
== species ==
=== decapods ===
there is little agreement among taxonomists concerning the phylogeny of crustaceans within the decapods every study gives totally different results nor do even one of these studies match any of the rival morphology studies some taxonomists identify shrimp with the infraorder caridea and prawns with the suborder dendrobranchiata while different experts give different answers there is no disagreement that the caridean species are shrimp there are over 3000 caridean species occasionally they are referred to as true shrimp
traditionally decapods were divided into two suborders the natantia or swimmers and the reptantia or walkers the natantia or swimmers included the shrimp they were defined by their abdomen which together with its appendages was well adapted for swimming the reptantia or walkers included the crabs and lobsters these species have small abdominal appendages but robust legs well adapted for walking the natantia was thought to be paraphyletic that is it was thought that originally all decapods were like shrimp
however classifications are now based on clades and the paraphyletic suborder natantia has been discontinued on this basis taxonomic classifications now divide the order decapoda into the two suborders dendrobranchiata for the largest shrimp clade and pleocyemata for all other decapods the pleocyemata are in turn divided into half a dozen infra-orders
the taxonomists de grave and fransen 2011 recognise four major groups of shrimp the suborder dendrobranchiata and the infraorders procarididea stenopodidea and caridea this group is identical to the traditional natantia group and contains decapods only
all shrimp of commercial interest belong to the natantia the fao determine the categories and terminology used in the reporting of global fisheries they define a shrimp as a decapod crustacean of the suborder natantia
according to the codex alimentarius commission of the fao and who the term shrimp (which includes the frequently used term prawn) refers to the species covered by the most recent edition of the fao listing of shrimp fao species catalogue volume 1 shrimps and prawns of the world an annotated catalogue of species of interest to fisheries fao fisheries synopsis no 125. in turn the species catalogue says the highest category it deals with is the suborder natantia of the order crustacea decapoda to which all shrimps and prawns belong
other decapod crustaceans also called shrimp are the ghost or mud shrimp belonging to the infra-order thalassinidea in australia they are called yabbies the monophyly of the group is not certain recent studies have suggested dividing the group into two infraorders gebiidea and axiidea
=== non-decapods ===
a wide variety of non-decapod crustaceans are also commonly referred to as shrimp this includes the brine shrimp clam shrimp fairy shrimp and tadpole shrimp belonging to the branchiopods the lophogastridan shrimp opossum shrimp and skeleton shrimp belonging the malacostraca and seed shrimp which are ostracods many of these species look quite unlike like the commercial decapod shrimp that are eaten as seafood for example skeleton shrimp have short legs and a slender tail like a scorpion tail fairy shrimp swim upside down with swimming appendages that look like leaves and the tiny seed shrimp have bivalved carapaces which they can open or close krill resemble miniature shrimp and are sometimes called krill shrimp
some mantis shrimp are a foot long and have bulging eyes a flattened tail and formidable claws equipped with clubs or sharp spikes which it can use to knock out its opponents

=== history ===
in 1991 archeologists suggested that ancient raised paved areas near the coast in chiapas mexico were platforms used for drying shrimp in the sun and that adjacent clay hearths were used to dry the shrimp when there was no sun the evidence was circumstantial because the chitinous shells of shrimp are so thin they degrade rapidly leaving no fossil remains in 1985 quitmyer and others found direct evidence dating back to 600 ad for shrimping off the southeastern coast of north america by successfully identifying shrimp from the archaeological remains of their mandibles (jaws) clay vessels with shrimp decorations have been found in the ruins of pompeii in the 3rd century ad the greek author athenaeus wrote in his literary work deipnosophistae  of all fish the daintiest is a young shrimp in fig leaves.
in north america native americans captured shrimp and other crustaceans in fishing weirs and traps made from branches and spanish moss or used nets woven with fibre beaten from plants at the same time early european settlers oblivious to the protein-rich coasts all about them starved from lack of protein in 1735 beach seines were imported from france and cajun fishermen in louisiana started catching white shrimp and drying them in the sun as they still do today in the mid nineteenth century chinese immigrants arrived for the california gold rush many from the pearl river delta where netting small shrimp had been a tradition for centuries some immigrants starting catching shrimp local to san francisco bay particularly the small inch long crangon franciscorum these shrimp burrow into the sand to hide and can be present in high numbers without appearing to be so the catch was dried in the sun and was exported to china or sold to the chinese community in the united states this was the beginning of the american shrimping industry overfishing and pollution from gold mine tailings resulted in the decline of the fishery it was replaced by a penaeid white shrimp fishery on the south atlantic and gulf coasts these shrimp were so abundant that beaches were piled with windrows from their moults modern industrial shrimping methods originated in this area
for shrimp to develop into one of the world's most popular foods it took the simultaneous development of the otter trawl and the internal combustion engine. shrimp trawling can capture shrimp in huge volumes by dragging a net along the seafloor trawling was first recorded in england in 1376 when king edward iii received a request that he ban this new and destructive way of fishing in 1583 the dutch banned shrimp trawling in estuaries
in the 1920s diesel engine were adapted for use in shrimp boats power winches were connected to the engines and only small crews were needed to rapidly lift heavy nets on board and empty them shrimp boats became larger faster and more capable new fishing grounds could be explored trawls could be deployed in deeper offshore waters and shrimp could be tracked and caught round the year instead of seasonally as in earlier times larger boats trawled offshore and smaller boats worked bays and estuaries by the 1960s steel and fibreglass hulls further strengthened shrimp boats so they could trawl heavier nets and steady advances in electronics radar sonar and gps resulted in more sophisticated and capable shrimp fleets
as shrimp fishing methods industrialised parallel changes were happening in the way shrimp were processed in the 19th century sun dried shrimp were largely replaced by canneries in the 20th century the canneries were replaced with freezers.
in the 1970s significant shrimp farming was initiated particularly in china the farming accelerated during the 1980s as demand for shrimp exceeded supply and as excessive bycatch and threats to endangered sea turtle became associated with trawling for wild shrimp in 2007 the production of farmed shrimp exceeded the capture of wild shrimp
=== commercial species ===
although there are thousands of species of shrimp worldwide only about 20 of these species are commercially significant the following table contains the principal commercial shrimp the seven most harvested species all of them are decapods most of them belong to the dendrobranchiata and four of them are penaeid shrimp
=== fishing ===
commercial techniques for catching wild shrimp include otter trawls seines and shrimp baiting a system of nets is used when trawling baited traps are common in parts of the pacific northwest
shrimp trawling can result in very high incidental catch rates of non-target species in 1997 the fao found discard rates up to 20 pounds for every pound of shrimp the world average was 5.7 pounds for every pound of shrimp trawl nets in general and shrimp trawls in particular have been identified as sources of mortality for species of finfish and cetaceans bycatch is often discarded dead or dying by the time it is returned to the sea and may alter the ecological balance in discarded regions worldwide shrimp trawl fisheries generate about 2% of the world's catch of fish in weight but result in more than one third of the global bycatch total
the most extensively fished species are the akiami paste shrimp the northern prawn the southern rough shrimp and the giant tiger prawn together these four species account for nearly half of the total wild capture in recent years the global capture of wild shrimp has been overtaken by the harvest from farmed shrimp
=== farming ===
a shrimp farm is an aquaculture business for the cultivation of marine shrimp or prawns for human consumption commercial shrimp farming began in the 1970s and production grew steeply particularly to match the market demands of the united states japan and western europe the total global production of farmed shrimp reached more than 1.6 million tonnes in 2003 representing a value of nearly 9 billion u.s dollars about 75% of farmed shrimp are produced in asia in particular in china thailand and in the philippines the other 25% are produced mainly in latin america where brazil is the largest producer the largest exporting nation is thailand
as can be seen from the global production chart on the left significant aquaculture production started slowly in the 1970s and then rapidly expanded during the 1980s after a lull in growth during the 1990s due to pathogens production took off again and by 2007 exceeded the capture from wild fisheries by 2010 the aquaculture harvest was 3.9 million tonnes compared to 3.1 million tonnes for the capture of wild shrimp
in the earlier years of marine shrimp farming the preferred species was the large giant tiger prawn this species is reared in circular holding tanks where they think they are in the open ocean and swim in never ending migration around the circumference of the tank in 2000 global production was 630,984 tonnes compared to only 146,362 tonnes for whiteleg shrimp subsequently these positions reversed and by 2010 the production of giant tiger prawn increased modestly to 781,581 tonnes while whiteleg shrimp rocketed nearly twenty-fold to 2,720,929 tonnes the whiteleg shrimp is currently the dominant species in shrimp farming it is a moderately large shrimp reaching a total length of 230 mm (9") and is particularly suited to farming because it breeds well in captivity can be stocked at small sizes grows fast and at uniform rates has comparatively low protein requirements and adapts well to variable environmental conditions. in china prawns are cultured along with sea cucumbers and some fish species in integrated multi-trophic systems
the major producer of farmed shrimp is china other significant producers are thailand indonesia india vietnam brazil ecuador and bangladesh most farmed shrimp is exported to the united states the european union and japan
investigations by the guardian in 2014 and the associated press in 2015 found human rights abuses on fishing boats operated by thailand the boats are manned with slaves and catch shrimp and fish (including fish for the production of fishmeal which is fed to farmed prawns) greenpeace has challenged the sustainability of tropical shrimp farming practices on the grounds that farming these species has led to the destruction of vast areas of mangroves in several countries [and] over-fishing of juvenile shrimp from the wild to supply farms. greenpeace has placed a number of the prominent tropical shrimp species that are farmed commercially on its seafood red list including the whiteleg shrimp indian prawn and giant tiger shrimp
=== as food ===
shrimp are marketed and commercialized with several issues in mind most shrimp are sold frozen and marketed based on their categorization of presentation grading colour and uniformity shrimp have high levels of omega-3 fatty acids and low levels of mercury usually shrimp is sold whole though sometimes only the meat of shrimp is marketed
as with other seafood shrimp is high in calcium iodine and protein but low in food energy a shrimp-based meal is also a significant source of cholesterol from 122 mg to 251 mg per 100 g of shrimp depending on the method of preparation shrimp consumption however is considered healthy for the circulatory system because the lack of significant levels of saturated fat in shrimp means that the high cholesterol content in shrimp actually improves the ratio of ldl to hdl cholesterol and lowers triglycerides
shrimp and other shellfish are among the most common food allergens they are not kosher and thus are forbidden in jewish cuisine shrimp are halal according to some madhhib and therefore permissible to most but not all muslims
=== aquaria ===
several types of shrimp are kept in home aquaria some are purely ornamental while others are useful in controlling algae and removing debris freshwater shrimp commonly available for aquaria include the bamboo shrimp japanese marsh shrimp (caridina multidentata also called amano shrimp, as their use in aquaria was pioneered by takashi amano) cherry shrimp (neocaridina heteropoda) and ghost or glass shrimp (palaemonetes spp.) popular saltwater shrimp include the cleaner shrimp lysmata amboinensis the fire shrimp (lysmata debelius) and the harlequin shrimp (hymenocera picta)
== shrimp versus prawn ==
the terms shrimp and prawn are common names not scientific names they are vernacular or colloquial terms which lack the formal definition of scientific terms they are not taxa but are terms of convenience with little circumscriptional significance there is no reason to avoid using the terms shrimp or prawn when convenient but it is important not to confuse them with the names or relationships of actual taxa
according to the crustacean taxonomist tin-yam chan the terms shrimp and prawn have no definite reference to any known taxonomic groups although the term shrimp is sometimes applied to smaller species while prawn is more often used for larger forms there is no clear distinction between both terms and their usage is often confused or even reverse in different countries or regions.
a lot of confusion surrounds the scope of the term shrimp part of the confusion originates with the association of smallness that creates problems with shrimp-like species that are not small the expression jumbo shrimp can be viewed as an oxymoron a problem that doesn't exist with the commercial designation jumbo prawns
the term shrimp originated around the 14th century with the middle english shrimpe akin to the middle low german schrempen and meaning to contract or wrinkle and the old norse skorpna meaning to shrivel up it is not clear where the term prawn originated but early forms of the word surfaced in england in the early 15th century as prayne praine and prane according to the linguist anatoly liberman it is unclear how shrimp in english came to be associated with small no germanic language associates the shrimp with its size the same holds for romance it remains unclear in what circumstances the name was applied to the crustacean.
taxonomic studies in european on shrimp and prawns were shaped by the common shrimp and the common prawn both found in huge numbers along the european coastlines the common shrimp crangon crangon was categorised in 1758 by carl linnaeus and the common prawn was categorised in 1777 by thomas pennant the common shrimp is a small burrowing species aligned with the notion of a shrimp as being something small whereas the common prawn is much larger the terms true shrimp or true prawn are sometimes used to mean what a particular person thinks is a shrimp or prawn this varies with the person using the terms but such terms are not normally used in the scientific literature because the terms shrimp and prawn themselves lack scientific standing over the years the way shrimp and prawn are used has changed and nowadays the terms are almost interchangeable although from time to time some biologists declare certain common names should be confined to specific taxa the popular use of these names seems to continue unchanged
== miscellanea ==
only 57 exclusively fossil species are known in the shrimp fossil record the earliest date from the lower jurassic and cretaceous
various coastal settlements in the united states have claimed the title shrimp capital of the world for example the claim was made earlier in the nineteenth century for the port of brunswick in georgia and fernandina and saint augustine in florida more recent claims have been made for aransas pass and brownsville in texas as well as morgan city in louisiana the claim has also been made for mazatln in mexico
