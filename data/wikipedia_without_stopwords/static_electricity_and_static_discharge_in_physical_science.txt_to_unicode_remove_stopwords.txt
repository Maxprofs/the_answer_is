charge antiparticle equals corresponding particle opposite sign quarks fractional charges either freestanding quarks never observed theoretical reason fact asymptotic freedom
electric charge macroscopic object sum electric charges particles make charge often small matter made atoms atoms typically equal numbers protons electrons case charges cancel yielding net charge zero thus making atom neutral
ion atom group atoms lost one electrons giving net positive charge cation gained one electrons giving net negative charge anion monatomic ions formed single atoms polyatomic ions formed two atoms bonded together case yielding ion positive negative net charge
formation macroscopic objects constituent atoms ions usually combine form structures composed neutral ionic compounds electrically bound neutral atoms thus macroscopic objects tend toward neutral overall macroscopic objects rarely perfectly net neutral
