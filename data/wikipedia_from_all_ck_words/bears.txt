bears are mammals of the family ursidae bears are classified as caniforms or doglike carnivorans with the pinnipeds being their closest living relatives although only eight species of bears are extant they are widespread appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the northern hemisphere and partially in the southern hemisphere bears are found on the continents of north america south america europe and asia
common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs long snouts shaggy hair plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws and short tails while the polar bear is mostly carnivorous and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets
with the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young bears are typically solitary animals they are generally diurnal but may be active during the night (nocturnal) or twilight (crepuscular) particularly around humans bears possess an excellent sense of smell and despite their heavy build and awkward gait are adept runners climbers and swimmers in autumn some bear species forage large amounts of fermented fruits which affects their behaviour bears use shelters such as caves and burrows as their dens most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period (up to 100 days) of sleep similar to hibernation
bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur with their tremendous physical presence and charisma they play a prominent role in the arts mythology and other cultural aspects of various human societies in modern times the bears existence has been pressured through the encroachment on their habitats and the illegal trade of bears and bear parts including the asian bile bear market the iucn lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered and even least concern species such as the brown bear are at risk of extirpation in certain countries the poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited but still ongoing
== etymologyedit ==
the english word bear comes from old english bera and belongs to a family of names for the bear in germanic languages that originate from an adjective meaning brown in scandinavia the word for bear is bjrn (or bjrn) and is a relatively common given name for males the use of this name is ancient and has been found mentioned in several runestone inscriptions
the reconstructed proto-indo-european name of the bear is *htos whence sanskrit rka avestan ara greek (arktos) latin ursus welsh arth (whence perhaps arthur") albanian ari armenian (arj) also compared is hittite artagga- the name of a monster or predator in the binomial name of the brown bear ursus arctos linnaeus simply combined the latin and greek names
the proto-indo-european (pie) word for bear *htos seems to have been subject to taboo deformation or replacement in some languages (as was the word for wolf wlkwos) resulting in the use of numerous unrelated words with meanings like brown one (english bruin) and honey-eater (slavic medved) thus some indo-european language groups do not share the same pie root
== evolutionary historyedit ==
the family ursidae is one of nine families in the suborder caniformia or doglike carnivores within the order carnivora bears closest living relatives are the pinnipeds canids and musteloids
the following synapomorphic (derived) traits set bears apart from related families
presence of an alisphenoid canal
paroccipital processes that are large and not fused to the auditory bullae
auditory bullae are not enlarged
lacrimal bone is vestigial
cheek teeth are bunodont and hence indicative of a broad hypocarnivorous (not strictly meat-eating) diet (although hypercarnivorous (strictly meat-eating) taxa are known from the fossil record)
carnassials are flattened
additionally members of this family possess posteriorly oriented m2 postprotocrista molars elongated m2 molars and a reduction of the premolars
modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies ailuropodinae (monotypic with the giant panda) tremarctinae (monotypic with the spectacled bear) and ursinae (containing six species divided into one to three genera depending on the authority)
=== fossil bearsedit ===
the earliest members of ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily amphicynodontinae including parictis (late eocene to early middle miocene 3818 mya) and the slightly younger allocyon (early oligocene 3430 mya) both from north america these animals looked very different from today's bears being small and raccoon-like in overall appearance and diets perhaps more similar to that of a badger parictis does not appear in eurasia and africa until the miocene it is unclear whether late-eocene ursids were also present in eurasia although faunal exchange across the bering land bridge may have been possible during a major sea level low stand as early as the late eocene (about 37 mya) and continuing into the early oligocene european genera morphologically are very similar to allocyon and also the much younger american kolponomos (about 18 mya) are known from the oligocene including amphicticeps and amphicynodon
the raccoon-sized dog-like cephalogale is the oldest-known member of the subfamily hemicyoninae which first appeared during the middle oligocene in eurasia about 30 mya ago the subfamily also includes the younger genera phoberocyon (2015 mya) and plithocyon (157 mya)
a cephalogale-like species gave rise to the genus ursavus during the early oligocene (3028 mya) this genus proliferated into many species in asia and is ancestral to all living bears species of ursavus subsequently entered north america together with amphicynodon and cephalogale during the early miocene (2118 mya)
members of the living lineages of bears diverged from ursavus between 15 and 20 mya ago likely via the species ursavus elmensis based on genetic and morphological data the ailuropodinae (pandas) were the first to diverge from other living bears about 19 mya ago although no fossils of this group have been found before about 5 mya
the new world short-faced bears (tremarctinae) differentiated from ursinae following a dispersal event into north america during the mid-miocene (about 13 mya) they invaded south america (~1 ma) following formation of the isthmus of panama their earliest fossil representative is plionarctos in north america (~ 102 ma) this genus is probably the direct ancestor to the north american short-faced bears (genus arctodus) the south american short-faced bears (arctotherium) and the spectacled bears tremarctos represented by both an extinct north american species (t floridanus) and the lone surviving representative of the tremarctinae the south american spectacled bear (t ornatus)
the subfamily ursinae experienced a dramatic proliferation of taxa about 5.34.5 mya ago coincident with major environmental changes with the first members of the genus ursus also appearing around this time the sloth bear is a modern survivor of one of the earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event (5.3 mya) it took on its peculiar morphology related to its diet of termites and ants no later than by the early pleistocene by 34 mya ago the species ursus minimus appears in the fossil record of europe apart from its size it was nearly identical to today's asiatic black bear it is likely ancestral to all bears within ursinae perhaps aside from the sloth bear two lineages evolved from u minimus the black bears (including the sun bear the asiatic black bear and the american black bear) and the brown bears (which includes the polar bear) modern brown bears evolved from u minimus via ursus etruscus which itself is ancestral to both the extinct pleistocene cave bear and today's brown and polar bears species of ursinae have migrated repeatedly into north america from eurasia as early as 4 mya during the early pliocene
the fossil record of bears is exceptionally good direct ancestor-descendent relationships between individual species are often fairly well established with sufficient intermediate forms known to make the precise cut-off between an ancestral and its daughter species subjective
other extinct bear genera include agriarctos indarctos and agriotherium (sometimes placed within hemicyonids)
=== taxonomic revisions of living bear speciesedit ===
the giant panda's taxonomy (subfamily ailuropodinae) has long been debated its original classification by armand david in 1869 was within the bear genus ursus but in 1870 it was reclassified by alphonse milne-edwards to the raccoon family in recent studies the majority of dna analyses suggest that the giant panda has a much closer relationship to other bears and should be considered a member of the family ursidae estimates of divergence dates place the giant panda as the most ancient offshoot among living taxa within ursidae having split from other bears as recently as 11.6 mya to as distantly as 22.1 mya the red panda was included within ursidae in the past however more recent research does not support such a conclusion and instead places it in its own family ailuridae in superfamily musteloidea along with mustelidae procyonidae and mephitidae multiple similarities between the two pandas including the presence of false thumbs are thus thought to represent an example of convergent evolution for feeding primarily on bamboo
unlike their neighbors elsewhere the brown bears of alaska's abc islands evidently are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears in the world researchers gerald shields and sandra talbot of the university of alaska fairbanks institute of arctic biology studied the dna of several samples of the species and found that their dna is different from that of other brown bears the discovery has shown that while all other brown bears share a brown bear as their closest relative those of alaska's abc islands differ and share their closest relation with the polar bear also the very rare tibetan blue bear is a type of brown bear this animal has never been photographed
koalas are often referred to as bears due to their appearance however they are marsupials not bears

== biologyedit ==
=== morphologyedit ===
bears are generally bulky and robust animals with relatively short legs they are sexually dimorphic with regard to size with the males being larger larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species and where a species varies in size across its distribution individuals from larger-sized areas tend also to vary more bears are the most massive terrestrial members of the order carnivora some exceptional polar bears and kodiak bears (a brown bear subspecies) have been weighed at over 750 kg (1,650 lb) as to which species is the largest depends on whether the assessment is based on which species has the largest individuals (brown bears) or on the largest average size (polar bears) as some races of brown bears are much smaller than polar bears adult male kodiak bears average 480 to 533 kg (1,058 to 1,175 lb) compared to an average of 386 to 408 kg (851 to 899 lb) in adult male polar bears per the guinness book of world records the smallest bears are the sun bears of asia which weigh an average of 65 kg (143 lb) for the males and 45 kg (99 lb) for the females though the smallest mature females can weigh only 20 kg (44 lb) all medium"-sized bear species (which include the other five extant species) are around the same average weight with males averaging around 100 to 120 kg (220 to 260 lb) and females averaging around 60 to 85 kg (132 to 187 lb) although it is not uncommon for male american black bears to considerably exceed average weights head-and-body length can range from 120 cm (47 in) in sun bears to 300 cm (120 in) in large polar and brown bears and shoulder height can range from 60 cm (24 in) to over 160 cm (63 in) in the same species respectively the tails of bears are often considered a vestigial feature and can range from 3 to 22 cm (1.2 to 8.7 in)
unlike most other land carnivorans bears are plantigrade they distribute their weight toward the hind feet which makes them look lumbering when they walk they are still quite fast with the brown bear reaching 48 km/h (30 mph) although they are still slower than felines and canines bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance bears nonretractable claws are used for digging climbing tearing and catching prey their ears are rounded
bears have an excellent sense of smell better than the dogs (canidae) or possibly any other mammal this sense of smell is used for signalling between bears (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food smell is the principal sense used by bears to find most of their food
==== dentitionedit ====
unlike most other members of the carnivora bears have relatively undeveloped carnassial teeth and their teeth are adapted for a diet that includes a significant amount of vegetable matter the canine teeth are large and the molar teeth flat and crushing considerable variation occurs in dental formula even within a given species this may indicate bears are still in the process of evolving from carnivorous to predominantly herbivorous diets polar bears appear to have secondarily re-evolved fully functional carnassials as their diets have switched back towards carnivory the dental formula for living bears is 3.1.2-4.23.1.2-4.3
=== distribution and habitatedit ===
bears are primarily found in the northern hemisphere and with one exception only in asia north america and europe the single exception is the spectacled bear (tremarctos ornatus) native to south america it inhabits the andean region the atlas bear a subspecies of the brown bear was the only bear native to africa it was distributed in north africa from morocco to libya but has been extinct since around the 1870s the most widespread species is the brown bear which occurs from western europe eastwards through asia to the western areas of north america the american black bear is restricted to north america and the polar bear is restricted to the arctic sea all the remaining species are asian
with the exception of the polar bear bears are mostly forest species some species particularly the brown bear may inhabit or seasonally use other areas such as alpine scrub or tundra
=== behaviouredit ===
while many people think bears are nocturnal they are in fact generally diurnal active for the most part during the day the belief that they are nocturnal apparently comes from the habits of bears that live near humans which engage in some nocturnal activities such as raiding trash cans or crops while avoiding humans the sloth bear of asia is the most nocturnal of the bears but this varies by individual and females with cubs are often diurnal to avoid competition with males and nocturnal predators bears are overwhelmingly solitary and are considered to be the most asocial of all the carnivora liaisons between breeding bears are brief and the only times bears are encountered in small groups are mothers with young or occasional seasonal bounties of rich food (such as salmon runs)
=== vocalizationsedit ===
bears produce a variety of vocalizations such as
moaning produced mostly as mild warnings to potential threats or in fear
barking produced during times of alarm excitement or to give away the animal's position
huffing made during courtship or between mother and cubs to warn of danger
growling produced as strong warnings to potential threats or in anger
roaring used much for the same reasons as growls and also to proclaim territory and for intimidation
humming a loud monotonous buzzing sound primarily employed by cubs
=== diet and interspecific interactionsedit ===
most bears have diets of more plant than animal matter and are completely opportunistic omnivores some bears will climb trees to obtain mast (edible vegetative or reproductive parts such as acorns) smaller species that are more able to climb include a greater amount of this in their diets such masts can be very important to the diets of these species and mast failures may result in long-range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources one exception is the polar bear which has adopted a diet mainly of marine mammals to survive in the arctic the other exception is the giant panda which has adopted a diet mainly of bamboo stable isotope analysis of the extinct giant short-faced bear (arctodus simus) shows it was also an exclusive meat-eater probably a scavenger the sloth bear though not as specialized as the previous two species has lost several front teeth usually seen in bears and developed a long suctioning tongue to feed on the ants termites and other burrowing insects they favour at certain times of the year these insects can make up 90% of their diets all bears will feed on any food source that becomes available the nature of which varies seasonally a study of asiatic black bears in taiwan found they would consume large numbers of acorns when they were most common and switch to ungulates at other times of the year
regarding warm-blooded animals bears will typically take small or young animals as they are easier to catch however both species of black bears and the brown bear can sometimes take large prey such as ungulates often bears will feed on other large animals when they encounter a carcass whether or not the carcass is claimed by or is the kill of another predator this competition is the main source of interspecies conflict bears are able to defend a carcass against some comers mother bears also can usually defend their cubs against other predators
the tiger is the only predator known to regularly prey on adult bears including fully grown adults of brown bears sloth bears asiatic black bears and sun bears when hunting bears tigers will position themselves from the leeward side of a rock or fallen tree waiting for the bear to pass by when the bear passes the tiger will spring from an overhead position and grab the bear from under the chin with one forepaw and the throat with the other the immobilised bear is then killed with a bite to the spinal column after killing a bear the tiger will concentrate its feeding on the bear's fat deposits such as the back legs and groin
=== breedingedit ===
the age at which bears reach sexual maturity is highly variable both between and within species sexual maturity is dependent on body condition which is in turn dependent upon the food supply available to the growing individual the females of smaller species may have young in as little as two years whereas the larger species may not rear young until they are four or even nine years old first breeding may be even later in males where competition for mates may leave younger males without access to females
the bear's courtship period is very brief bears in northern climates reproduce seasonally usually after a period of inactivity similar to hibernation although tropical species breed all year round cubs are born toothless blind and bald the cubs of brown bears usually born in litters of one to three will typically stay with the mother for two full seasons they feed on their mother's milk through the duration of their relationship with their mother although as the cubs continue to grow nursing becomes less frequent and cubs learn to begin hunting with the mother they will remain with the mother for about three years until she enters the next cycle of estrus and drives the cubs off bears will reach sexual maturity in five to seven years male bears especially polar and brown bears will kill and sometimes devour cubs born to another father to induce a female to breed again female bears are often successful in driving off males in protection of their cubs despite being rather smaller
=== winter dormancyedit ===
many bears of northern regions are assumed to hibernate in the winter a belief supported by a number of scientific studies while many bear species do go into a physiological state often colloquially called hibernation or winter sleep it is not true hibernation in true hibernators body temperatures drop to near ambient and heart rates slow drastically but the animals periodically rouse themselves to urinate or defecate and to eat from stored food the body temperature of bears on the other hand drops only a few degrees from normal and the heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute they normally do not wake during this hibernation so do not eat drink urinate or defecate the entire period higher body heat and being easily roused may be adaptations because females give birth to their cubs during this winter sleep
== relationship with humansedit ==
some species such as the polar bear american black bear grizzly bear sloth bear and brown bear are dangerous to humans especially in areas where they have become used to people all bears are physically powerful and are likely capable of fatally attacking a person but they for the most part are shy are easily frightened and will avoid humans injuries caused by bears are rare but are often widely reported the danger that bears pose is often vastly exaggerated in part by the human imagination however when a mother feels that her cubs are threatened she will behave ferociously it is recommended to give all bears a wide berth because they are behaviorally unpredictable
where bears raid crops or attack livestock they may come into conflict with humans these problems may be the work of only a few bears but they create a climate of conflict as farmers and ranchers may perceive all losses as due to bears and advocate the preventive removal of all bears mitigation methods may be used to reduce bear damage to crops and reduce local antipathy towards bears
laws have been passed in many areas of the world to protect bears from habitat destruction public perception of bears is often very positive as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets ability to stand on two legs and symbolic importance and support for bear protection is widespread at least in more affluent societies in more rural and poorer regions attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers some populated areas with bear populations have also outlawed the feeding of bears including allowing them access to garbage or other food waste bears in captivity have been trained to dance box or ride bicycles however this use of the animals became controversial in the late 20th century bears were kept for baiting in europe at least since the 16th century
=== bear huntedit ===
some cultures use bears for food and folk medicine their meat is dark and stringy like a tough cut of beef in cantonese cuisine bear paws are considered a delicacy the peoples of china japan and korea use bears body parts and secretions (notably their gallbladders and bile) as part of traditional chinese medicine more than 12,000 bile bears are thought to be kept on farms for their bile in china vietnam and south korea bear meat must be cooked thoroughly as it can be infected with trichinella spiralis which can cause trichinosis

=== myth and legendedit ===
there is evidence of prehistoric bear worship anthropologists such as joseph campbell have regarded this as a common feature in most of the fishing and hunting-tribes the prehistoric finns along with most siberian peoples considered the bear as the spirit of one's forefathers this is why the bear (karhu) was a greatly respected animal with several euphemistic names (such as otso mesikmmen and kontio) the bear is the national animal of finland
