== history ==
denver city was founded in november 1858 as a mining town during the pike's peak gold rush in western kansas territory that summer a group of gold prospectors from lawrence kansas had arrived and established montana city on the banks of the south platte river this was the first settlement in what was later to become the city of denver the site faded quickly however and by the summer of 1859 it was abandoned in favor of auraria (named after the gold mining town of auraria georgia) and st charles city
on november 22 1858 general william larimer a land speculator from eastern kansas territory placed cottonwood logs to stake a claim on the bluff overlooking the confluence of the south platte river and cherry creek across the creek from the existing mining settlement of auraria and on the site of the existing townsite of st charles larimer named the town site denver city to curry favor with kansas territorial governor james w denver larimer hoped that the town's name would help make it the county seat of arapaho county but unknown to him governor denver had already resigned from office the location was accessible to existing trails and was across the south platte river from the site of seasonal encampments of the cheyenne and arapaho the site of these first towns is now the site of confluence park near downtown denver larimer along with associates in the st charles city land company sold parcels in the town to merchants and miners with the intention of creating a major city that would cater to new emigrants denver city was a frontier town with an economy based on servicing local miners with gambling saloons livestock and goods trading in the early years land parcels were often traded for grubstakes or gambled away by miners in auraria in may 1859 denver city residents donated 53 lots to the leavenworth & pike's peak express in order to secure the region's first overland wagon route offering daily service for passengers mail freight and gold, the express reached denver on a trail that trimmed westward travel time from twelve days to six in 1863 western union furthered denver's dominance of the region by choosing the city for its regional terminus

finally linked to the rest of the nation by rail denver prospered as a service and supply center the young city grew during these years attracting millionaires with their mansions as well as the poverty and crime of a rapidly growing city denver citizens were proud when the rich chose denver and were thrilled that horace tabor the leadville mining millionaire built an impressive business block at 16th and larimer as well as the elegant tabor grand opera house luxurious hotels including the much-loved brown palace hotel soon followed as well as splendid homes for millionaires like the croke patterson campbell mansion at 11th and pennsylvania and the now-demolished moffat mansion at 8th and grant intent on transforming denver into one of the world's great cities leaders wooed industry and enticed laborers to work in these factories soon in addition to the elite and a large middle class denver had a growing population of german italian and chinese laborers soon followed by african-americans and spanish-surname workers unprepared for this influx the silver crash of 1893 unsettled political social and economic balances laying the foundation for ethnic bigotry such as the red scare and the rise of the ku klux klan as well as corruption and crime

there is also an older downtown grid system that was designed to be parallel to the confluence of the south platte river and cherry creek most of the streets downtown and in lodo run northeastsouthwest and northwestsoutheast this system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal if the streets were in a normal ns/ew grid only the ns streets would receive sunlight with the grid oriented to the diagonal directions the nwse streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the morning and the nesw streets receive it in the afternoon this idea was from henry brown the founder of the brown palace hotel there is now a plaque across the street from the brown palace hotel which honors this idea the nwse streets are numbered while the nesw streets are named the named streets start at the intersection of colfax avenue and broadway with the block-long cheyenne place the numbered streets start underneath the colfax and i-25 viaducts there are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid there are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid such as park avenue morrison road and speer boulevard larimer street named after william larimer jr. the founder of denver which is located in the heart of lodo is the oldest street in denver
