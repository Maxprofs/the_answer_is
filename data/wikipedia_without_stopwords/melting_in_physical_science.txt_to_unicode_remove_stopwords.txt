melting also known fusion physical process results phase transition substance solid liquid occurs internal energy solid increases typically application heat pressure increases substances temperature melting point melting point ordering ions molecules solid breaks less ordered state solid melts become liquid object melted completely molten although word typically used substances melt high temperature molten iron molten lava
substances molten state generally reduced viscosity temperature increases exception principle element sulfur whose viscosity increases point due polymerization decreases higher temperatures molten state
organic compounds melt mesophases states partial order solid liquid
melting firstorder phase transition
thermodynamics point view melting point change gibbs free energy g material zero nonzero changes enthalpy h entropy known respectively enthalpy fusion latent heat fusion entropy fusion melting therefore classified firstorder phase transition melting occurs gibbs free energy liquid becomes lower solid material temperature occurs dependent ambient pressure
lowtemperature helium known exception general rule helium negative enthalpy fusion temperatures k helium also slightly negative enthalpy fusion k means appropriate constant pressures heat must removed substances order melt
melting criteria
among theoretical criteria melting lindemann born criteria frequently used basis analyse melting conditions lindemann criterion states melting occurs vibrational instability eg crystals melt average amplitude thermal vibrations atoms relatively high compared interatomic distances eg u lrs u atomic displacement lindemann parameter l rs onehalf interatomic distance lindemann melting criterion supported experimental data crystalline materials glassliquid transitions amorphous materials born criterion based rigidity catastrophe caused vanishing elastic shear modulus eg crystal longer sufficient rigidity mechanically withstand load
supercooling
standard set conditions melting point substance characteristic property melting point often equal freezing point however carefully created conditions supercooling superheating past melting freezing point occur water clean glass surface often supercool several degrees freezing point without freezing fine emulsions pure water cooled degrees celsius without nucleation form ice nucleation occurs due fluctuations properties material material kept still often nothing physical vibration trigger change supercooling superheating may occur thermodynamically supercooled liquid metastable state respect crystalline phase likely crystallize suddenly
melting amorphous solids glasses
glasses amorphous solids usually fabricated molten material cools rapidly glass transition temperature without sufficient time regular crystal lattice form solids characterised high degree connectivity molecules fluids lower connectivity structural blocks melting solid material also considered percolation via broken connections particles eg connecting bonds approach melting amorphous material occurs broken bonds form percolation cluster tg dependent quasiequilibrium thermodynamic parameters bonds eg enthalpy hd entropy sd formation bonds given system given conditions
fc percolation threshold r universal gas constant although hd sd true equilibrium thermodynamic parameters depend cooling rate melt found available experimental data viscosity amorphous materials
even melting point quasiliquid films observed crystalline surfaces thickness film temperature dependent effect common crystalline materials premelting shows effects eg frost heave growth snowflakes taking grain boundary interfaces account maybe even movement glaciers
