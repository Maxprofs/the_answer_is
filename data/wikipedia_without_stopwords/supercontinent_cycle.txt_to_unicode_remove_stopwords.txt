recent supercontinent pangaea formed million years ago two different views history earlier supercontinents first proposes series supercontinents vaalbara billion years ago ur billion years ago kenorland billion years ago columbia billion years ago rodinia billion million years ago pannotia million years ago whose dispersal produced fragments ultimately collided form pangaea
second view protopangeapaleopangea based palaeomagnetic geological evidence supercontinent cycles occur ga ediacaran period instead continental crust comprised single supercontinent ga broke first time somewhere around ga reconstruction based observation small peripheral modifications made primary reconstruction data show palaeomagnetic poles converged quasistatic positions long intervals ga intervening periods poles appear conformed unified apparent polar wander path thus paleomagnetic data adequately explained existence single protopangeapaleopangea supercontinent prolonged quasiintegrity prolonged duration supercontinent could explained operation lid tectonics comparable tectonics operating mars venus precambrian times opposed plate tectonics seen contemporary earth

hypothesized supercontinent cycle complemented wilson cycle named plate tectonics pioneer j tuzo wilson describes periodic opening closing ocean basins oldest seafloor material found today dates million years old whereas oldest continental crust material found today dates least billion years old makes sense emphasize much longer record planetary pulse recorded continents
effects sea level
known sea level generally low continents together high apart example sea level low time formation pangaea permian pannotia latest neoproterozoic rose rapidly maxima ordovician cretaceous times continents dispersed age oceanic lithosphere provides major control depth ocean basins therefore global sea level oceanic lithosphere forms midocean ridges moves outwards happens conductively cools shrinks cooling shrinking decreases thickness increases density oceanic lithosphere result general lowering elevation seafloor away midocean ridges oceanic lithosphere less million years old simple cooling halfspace model conductive cooling works depth ocean basins areas nearby subduction function age oceanic lithosphere general

mean level sea floor decreases volume ocean basins increases factors control sea level remain constant sea level falls converse also true younger oceanic lithosphere leads shallower oceans higher sea levels factors remain constant
area oceans change continents rift stretching continents decreases raises sea level result continental collision compressing continents leads increase lowers sea level increasing sea level flood continents decreasing sea level expose continental shelves
continental shelf low slope small increase sea level result large change percent continents flooded
world ocean average young seafloor relatively shallow sea level high continents flooded world ocean average old seafloor relatively deep sea level low continents exposed
thus relatively simple relationship supercontinent cycle mean age seafloor
supercontinent lots old seafloor low sea level
dispersed continents lots young seafloor high sea level
also climatic effect supercontinent cycle amplify
supercontinent continental climate dominant continental glaciation likely still lower sea level
dispersed continents maritime climate dominant continental glaciation unlikely sea level lowered mechanism
relation global tectonics

relation climate

continents moving together
sea level low due lack seafloor production
climate cooler arid

relation evolution
principal mechanism evolution natural selection among diverse populations genetic drift occurs frequently small populations diversity observed consequence isolation less isolation thus less diversification occurs continents together producing one continent one ocean one coast latest neoproterozoic early paleozoic times tremendous proliferation diverse metazoa occurred isolation marine environments resulted breakup pannotia
northsouth arrangement continents oceans leads much diversity isolation eastwest arrangements northsouth arrangements give climatically different zones along communication routes north south separated water land continental oceanic zones similar climate formation similar tracts continents ocean basins oriented eastwest would lead much less isolation diversification slower evolution since continent ocean fewer climatic zones cenozoic isolation maximized northsouth arrangement
diversity measured number families follows supercontinent cycle well
