muscle contractions described based two variables force length force differentiated either tension load muscle tension force exerted muscle object whereas load force exerted object muscle muscle tension changes without corresponding changes muscle length muscle contraction described isometric muscle length changes muscle tension remains muscle contraction isotonic isotonic contraction muscle length either shorten produce concentric contraction lengthen produce eccentric contraction furthermore muscle length shortens contraction concentric muscle length lengthens contraction eccentric natural movements underlie locomotor activity muscle contractions multifaceted able produce changes length tension timevarying manner thus length tension unlikely remain constant muscle active locomotor activity
isometric contraction
isometric contraction muscle generates tension without changing length example found muscles hand forearm grip object joints hand move muscles generate sufficient force prevent object dropped
isotonic contraction
isotonic contraction tension muscle remains constant despite change muscle length occur muscles maximal force contraction exceeds total load muscle
concentric contraction
concentric contraction muscle tension sufficient overcome load muscle shortens contracts occurs force generated muscle exceeds load opposing contraction
concentric contraction muscle stimulated contract according sliding filament theory occurs throughout length muscle generating force origin insertion causing muscle shorten changing angle joint relation elbow concentric contraction biceps would cause arm bend elbow hand moved leg shoulder biceps curl concentric contraction triceps would change angle joint opposite direction straightening arm moving hand towards leg
eccentric contraction
eccentric contraction tension generated insufficient overcome external load muscle muscle fibers lengthen contract rather working pull joint direction muscle contraction muscle acts decelerate joint end movement otherwise control repositioning load occur involuntarily eg attempting move weight heavy muscle lift voluntarily eg muscle smoothing movement shortterm strength training involving eccentric concentric contractions appear increase muscular strength training concentric contractions alone however exerciseinduced muscle damage also greater lengthening contractions
eccentric contraction biceps muscle elbow starts movement bent straightens hand moves away shoulder eccentric contraction triceps muscle elbow starts movement straight bends hand moves towards shoulder desmin titin zline proteins involved eccentric contractions mechanism poorly understood comparison crossbridge cycling concentric contractions
though muscle negative amount mechanical work work done muscle chemical energy fat glucose atp nevertheless consumed although less would consumed concentric contraction force example one expends energy going flight stairs going flight
muscles undergoing heavy eccentric loading suffer greater damage overloaded muscle building strength training exercise compared concentric loading eccentric contractions used weight training normally called negatives concentric contraction muscle fibers slide across pulling zlines together eccentric contraction filaments slide past opposite way though actual movement myosin heads eccentric contraction known exercise featuring heavy eccentric load actually support greater weight muscles approximately stronger eccentric contractions concentric contractions also results greater muscular damage delayed onset muscle soreness one two days training exercise incorporates eccentric concentric muscular contractions ie involving strong contraction controlled lowering weight produce greater gains strength concentric contractions alone unaccustomed heavy eccentric contractions easily lead overtraining moderate training may confer protection injury
eccentric contractions movement
eccentric contractions normally occur braking force opposition concentric contraction protect joints damage virtually routine movement eccentric contractions assist keeping motions smooth also slow rapid movements punch throw part training rapid movements pitching baseball involves reducing eccentric braking allowing greater power developed throughout movement
eccentric contractions researched ability speed rehabilitation weak injured tendons achilles tendinitis patellar tendonitis also known jumpers knee patellar tendonosis shown benefit highload eccentric contractions
