description
mutations involve duplication large sections dna usually genetic recombination duplications major source raw material evolving new genes tens hundreds genes duplicated animal genomes every million years genes belong larger gene families shared ancestry known homology novel genes produced several methods commonly duplication mutation ancestral gene recombining parts different genes form new combinations new functions
protein domains act modules particular independent function mixed together produce genes encoding new proteins novel properties example human eye uses four genes make structures sense light three cone cell color vision one rod cell night vision four arose single ancestral gene another advantage duplicating gene even entire genome increases engineering redundancy allows one gene pair acquire new function copy performs original function types mutation occasionally create new genes previously noncoding dna
changes chromosome number may involve even larger mutations segments dna within chromosomes break rearrange example homininae two chromosomes fused produce human chromosome fusion occur lineage apes retain separate chromosomes evolution important role chromosomal rearrangements may accelerate divergence population new species making populations less likely interbreed thereby preserving genetic differences populations
sequences dna move genome transposons make major fraction genetic material plants animals may important evolution genomes example million copies alu sequence present human genome sequences recruited perform functions regulating gene expression another effect mobile dna sequences move within genome mutate delete existing genes thereby produce genetic diversity
nonlethal mutations accumulate within gene pool increase amount genetic variation abundance genetic changes within gene pool reduced natural selection favorable mutations may accumulate result adaptive changes
example butterfly may produce offspring new mutations majority mutations effect one might change color one butterflys offspring making harder easier predators see color change advantageous chance butterflys surviving producing offspring little better time number butterflies mutation may form larger percentage population
neutral mutations defined mutations whose effects influence fitness individual accumulate time due genetic drift believed overwhelming majority mutations significant effect organisms fitness also dna repair mechanisms able mend changes become permanent mutations many organisms mechanisms eliminating otherwisepermanently mutated somatic cells
beneficial mutations improve reproductive success
causes
four classes mutations spontaneous mutations molecular decay mutations due errorprone replication bypass naturally occurring dna damage also called errorprone translesion synthesis errors introduced dna repair induced mutations caused mutagens scientists may also deliberately introduce mutant sequences dna manipulation sake scientific experimentation
spontaneous mutation
spontaneous mutations molecular level caused
tautomerism base changed repositioning hydrogen atom altering hydrogen bonding pattern base resulting incorrect base pairing replication
depurination loss purine base g form apurinic site ap site
deamination hydrolysis changes normal base atypical base containing keto group place original amine group examples include c u hx hypoxanthine corrected dna repair mechanisms mec methylcytosine less likely detected mutation thymine normal dna base
slipped strand mispairing denaturation new strand template replication followed renaturation different spot slipping lead insertions deletions
errorprone replication bypass
increasing evidence majority spontaneously arising mutations due errorprone replication translesion synthesis past dna damage template strand naturally occurring oxidative dna damages arise least times per cell per day humans times per cell per day rats mice majority mutations caused translesion synthesis likewise yeast kunz et al found spontaneous single base pair substitutions deletions caused translesion synthesis
errors introduced dna repair
although naturally occurring doublestrand breaks occur relatively low frequency dna repair often causes mutation nonhomologous end joining nhej major pathway repairing doublestrand breaks nhej involves removal nucleotides allow somewhat inaccurate alignment two ends rejoining followed addition nucleotides fill gaps consequence nhej often introduces mutations
induced mutation

base analogs eg bromodeoxyuridine brdu
alkylating agents eg nethylnnitrosourea enu agents mutate replicating nonreplicating dna contrast base analog mutate dna analog incorporated replicating dna classes chemical mutagens certain effects lead transitions transversions deletions
agents form dna adducts eg ochratoxin
dna intercalating agents eg ethidium bromide
dna crosslinkers
oxidative damage
nitrous acid converts amine groups c diazo groups altering hydrogen bonding patterns leads incorrect base pairing replication
radiation
ultraviolet light uv nonionizing radiation two nucleotide bases dnacytosine thymineare vulnerable radiation change properties uv light induce adjacent pyrimidine bases dna strand become covalently joined pyrimidine dimer uv radiation particular longerwave uva also cause oxidative damage dna
classification mutation types

smallscale mutations affecting small gene one nucleotides including
point mutations often caused chemicals malfunction dna replication exchange single nucleotide another changes classified transitions transversions common transition exchanges purine purine g pyrimidine pyrimidine c transition caused nitrous acid base mispairing mutagenic base analogs brdu less common transversion exchanges purine pyrimidine pyrimidine purine ct ag example transversion conversion adenine cytosine c point mutation reversed another point mutation nucleotide changed back original state true reversion secondsite reversion complementary mutation elsewhere results regained gene functionality point mutations occur within protein coding region gene may classified three kinds depending upon erroneous codon codes
silent mutations code sufficiently similar amino acid
missense mutations code different amino acid
nonsense mutations code stop codon truncate protein
insertions add one extra nucleotides dna usually caused transposable elements errors replication repeating elements insertions coding region gene may alter splicing mrna splice site mutation cause shift reading frame frameshift significantly alter gene product insertions reversed excision transposable element
deletions remove one nucleotides dna like insertions mutations alter reading frame gene general irreversible though exactly sequence might theory restored insertion transposable elements able revert short deletion say bases location either highly unlikely exist exist
largescale mutations chromosomal structure including
amplifications gene duplications leading multiple copies chromosomal regions increasing dosage genes located within
deletions large chromosomal regions leading loss genes within regions
mutations whose effect juxtapose previously separate pieces dna potentially bringing together separate genes form functionally distinct fusion genes eg bcrabl include
chromosomal translocations interchange genetic parts nonhomologous chromosomes
interstitial deletions intrachromosomal deletion removes segment dna single chromosome thereby apposing previously distant genes example cells isolated human astrocytoma type brain tumor found chromosomal deletion removing sequences fused glioblastoma fig gene receptor tyrosine kinase ros producing fusion protein figros abnormal figros fusion protein constitutively active kinase activity causes oncogenic transformation transformation normal cells cancer cells
chromosomal inversions reversing orientation chromosomal segment

effect function
lossoffunction mutations also called inactivating mutations result gene product less function partially wholly inactivated allele complete loss function null allele often called amorphic mutation mullers morphs schema phenotypes associated mutations often recessive exceptions organism haploid reduced dosage normal gene product enough normal phenotype called haploinsufficiency
gainoffunction mutations also called activating mutations change gene product effect gets stronger enhanced activation even superseded different abnormal function new allele created heterozygote containing newly created allele well original express new allele genetically defines mutations dominant phenotypes often called neomorphic mutation
dominant negative mutations also called antimorphic mutations altered gene product acts antagonistically wildtype allele mutations usually result altered molecular function often inactive characterized dominant semidominant phenotype humans dominant negative mutations implicated cancer eg mutations genes p atm cebpa ppargamma marfan syndrome caused mutations fbn gene located chromosome encodes fibrillin glycoprotein component extracellular matrix marfan syndrome also example dominant negative mutation haploinsufficiency
lethal mutations mutations lead death organisms carry mutations

though relatively mutations advantageous play important role evolutionary changes like neutral mutations weakly selected advantageous mutations lost due random genetic drift strongly selected advantageous mutations likely fixed knowing dfe advantageous mutations may lead increased ability predict evolutionary dynamics theoretical work dfe advantageous mutations done john h gillespie h allen orr proposed distribution advantageous mutations exponential wide range conditions general supported experimental studies least strongly selected advantageous mutations
general accepted majority mutations neutral deleterious rare mutations advantageous however proportion types mutations varies species indicates two important points first proportion effectively neutral mutations likely vary species resulting dependence effective population size second average effect deleterious mutations varies dramatically species addition dfe also differs coding regions noncoding regions dfe noncoding dna containing weakly selected mutations
