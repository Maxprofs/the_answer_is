baking is a method of cooking food that uses prolonged dry heat normally in an oven but also in hot ashes or on hot stones the most common baked item is bread but many other types of foods are baked heat is gradually transferred from the surface of cakes cookies and breads to their centre as heat travels through it transforms batters and doughs into baked goods with a firm dry crust and a softer centre baking can be combined with grilling to produce a hybrid barbecue variant by using both methods simultaneously or one after the other baking is related to barbecuing because the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit
because of historical social and familial roles baking has traditionally been performed at home by women for domestic consumption and by men in bakeries and restaurants for local consumption when production was industrialized baking was automated by machines in large factories the art of baking remains a fundamental skill and is important for nutrition as baked goods especially breads are a common but important food both from an economic and cultural point of view a person who prepares baked goods as a profession is called a baker
== foods and techniquesedit ==
all types of food can be baked but some require another special care and protection from direct heat various techniques have been developed to provide this protection
in addition to bread baking is used to prepare cakes pastries pies tarts quiches cookies scones crackers pretzels and more these popular items are known collectively as baked goods, and are often sold at a bakery which is a store that carries only baked goods or at markets grocery stores or through other venues
meat including cured meats such as ham can also be baked but baking is usually reserved for meatloaf smaller cuts of whole meats or whole meats that contain stuffing or coating such as bread crumbs or buttermilk batter some foods are surrounded with moisture during baking by placing a small amount of liquid (such as water or broth) in the bottom of a closed pan and letting it steam up around the food a method commonly known as braising or slow baking larger cuts prepared without stuffing or coating are more often roasted which is a similar process using higher temperatures and shorter cooking times roasting however is only suitable for finer cuts of meat so other methods have been developed to make tougher meat cuts palatable after baking one of these is the method known as en crote (french for in a crust") which protects the food from direct heat and seals the natural juices inside meat poultry game fish or vegetables can be prepared by baking en crote well-known examples include beef wellington where the beef is encased in pastry before baking pt en crote where the terrine is encased in pastry before baking and the vietnamese variant a meat-filled pastry called pt chaud the en crote method also allows meat to be baked by burying it in the embers of a fire a favourite method of cooking venison in this case the protective casing (or crust) is made from a paste of flour and water and is discarded before eating salt can also be used to make a protective crust that is not eaten another method of protecting food from the heat while it is baking is to cook it en papillote (french for in parchment") in this method the food is covered by baking paper (or aluminium foil) to protect it while it is being baked the cooked parcel of food is sometimes served unopened allowing diners to discover the contents for themselves which adds an element of surprise
eggs can also be used in baking to produce savoury or sweet dishes in combination with dairy products especially cheese they are often prepared as a dessert for example although a baked custard can be made using starch (in the form of flour cornflour arrowroot or potato flour) the flavour of the dish is much more delicate if eggs are used as the thickening agent baked custards such as crme caramel are among the items that need protection from an oven's direct heat and the bain-marie method serves this purpose the cooking container is half submerged in water in another larger one so that the heat in the oven is more gently applied during the baking process baking a successful souffl requires that the baking process be carefully controlled the oven temperature must be absolutely even and the oven space not shared with another dish these factors along with the theatrical effect of an air-filled dessert have given this baked food a reputation for being a culinary achievement similarly a good baking technique (and a good oven) are also needed to create a baked alaska because of the difficulty of baking hot meringue and cold ice cream at the same time
baking can also be used to prepare various other foods such as pizzas baked potatoes baked apples baked beans some casseroles and pasta dishes such as lasagne
== baking in ancient timesedit ==
the first evidence of baking occurred when humans took wild grass grains soaked them in water and mixed everything together mashing it into a kind of broth-like paste the paste was cooked by pouring it onto a flat hot rock resulting in a bread-like substance later when humans mastered fire the paste was roasted on hot embers which made bread-making easier as it could now be made any time fire was created the world's oldest oven was discovered in croatia in 2014 dating back 6500 years ago the ancient egyptians baked bread using yeast which they had previously been using to brew beer bread baking began in ancient greece around 600 bc leading to the invention of enclosed ovens ovens and worktables have been discovered in archaeological digs from turkey (hacilar) to palestine (jericho) and date back to 5600 bc.
baking flourished during the roman empire beginning around 300 bc the pastry cook became an occupation for romans (known as the pastillarium) and became a respected profession because pastries were considered decadent and romans loved festivity and celebration thus pastries were often cooked especially for large banquets and any pastry cook who could invent new types of tasty treats was highly prized around 1 ad there were more than three hundred pastry chefs in rome and cato wrote about how they created all sorts of diverse foods and flourished professionally and socially because of their creations cato speaks of an enormous number of breads including libum (sacrificial cakes made with flour) placenta (groats and cress) spira (our modern day flour pretzels) scibilata (tortes) savaillum (sweet cake) and globus apherica (fritters) a great selection of these with many different variations different ingredients and varied patterns were often found at banquets and dining halls the romans baked bread in an oven with its own chimney and had mills to grind grain into flour a bakers guild was established in 168 bc in rome
== commercial bakingedit ==
eventually the roman art of baking became known throughout europe and eventually spread to eastern parts of asia by the 13th century in london commercial trading including baking had many regulations attached in the case of food they were designed to create a system so there was little possibility of false measures adulterated food or shoddy manufactures. there were by that time twenty regulations applying to bakers alone including that every baker had to have the impression of his seal upon each loaf of bread
beginning in the 19th century alternative leavening agents became more common such as baking soda bakers often baked goods at home and then sold them in the streets this scene was so common that rembrandt among others painted a pastry chef selling pancakes in the streets of germany with children clamoring for a sample in london pastry chefs sold their goods from handcarts this developed into a delivery system of baked goods to households and greatly increased demand as a result in paris the first open-air caf of baked goods was developed and baking became an established art throughout the entire world
baking eventually developed into a commercial industry using automated machinery which enabled more goods to be produced for widespread distribution in the united states the baking industry was built on marketing methods used during feudal times and production techniques developed by the romans. some makers of snacks such as potato chips or crisps have produced baked versions of their snack products as an alternative to the usual cooking method of deep-frying in an attempt to reduce their calorie or fat content baking has opened up doors to businesses such as cake shops and factories where the baking process is done with larger amounts in large open furnaces
the aroma and texture of baked goods as they come out of the oven are strongly appealing but is a quality that is quickly lost since the flavour and appeal largely depend on freshness commercial producers have to compensate by using food additives as well as imaginative labeling as more and more baked goods are purchased from commercial suppliers producers try to capture that original appeal by adding the label home-baked. such attempts seek to make an emotional link to the remembered freshness of baked goods as well as to attach positive associations the purchaser has with the idea of home to the bought product freshness is such an important quality that restaurants although they are commercial (and not domestic) preparers of food bake their own products for example scones at the ritz london hotel are not baked until early afternoon on the day they are to be served to make sure they are as fresh as possible.
== equipmentedit ==
baking needs an enclosed space for heating typically in an oven the fuel can be supplied by wood coal gas or electricity adding and removing items from an oven may be done by hand with an oven mitt or by a peel a long handled tool specifically used for that purpose
many commercial ovens are provided with two heating elements one for baking using convection and thermal conduction to heat the food and one for broiling or grilling heating mainly by radiation another piece of equipment still used for baking is the dutch oven also called a bake kettle bastable bread oven fire pan bake oven kail pot tin kitchen roasting kitchen doufeu (french gentle fire") or feu de compagne (french country oven") [it] originally replaced the cooking jack as the latest fireside cooking technology, combining the convenience of pot-oven and hangover oven.
asian cultures have adopted steam baskets to produce the effect of baking while reducing the amount of fat needed
== processedit ==
there are eleven events that occur concurrently during baking and some of them such as starch glutenization would not occur at room temperature
fats melt
gases form and expand
microorganisms die
sugar dissolves
egg and gluten proteins coagulate
starches gelatinise
gases evaporate
caramelization and maillard browning occur on crust
enzymes are inactivated
changes occur to nutrients
pectin breaks down
the dry heat of baking changes the form of starches in the food and causes its outer surfaces to brown giving it an attractive appearance and taste the browning is caused by caramelization of sugars and the maillard reaction maillard browning occurs when sugars break down in the presence of proteins because foods contain many different types of sugars and proteins maillard browning contributes to the flavour of a wide range of foods including nuts roast beef and baked bread. the moisture is never entirely sealed in over time an item being baked will become dry this is often an advantage especially in situations where drying is the desired outcome like drying herbs or roasting certain types of vegetables
the baking process does not require any fat to be used to cook in an oven when baking consideration must be given to the amount of fat that is contained in the food item higher levels of fat such as margarine butter or vegetable shortening will cause an item to spread out during the baking process
with the passage of time breads harden and become stale this is not primarily due to moisture being lost from the baked products but more a reorganization of the way in which the water and starch are associated over time this process is similar to recrystallization and is promoted by storage at cool temperatures such as in a domestic refrigerator
== cultural and religious significanceedit ==
baking especially of bread holds special significance for many cultures it is such a fundamental part of everyday food consumption that the children's nursery rhyme pat-a-cake pat-a-cake baker's man takes baking as its subject baked goods are normally served at all kinds of party and special attention is given to their quality at formal events they are also one of the main components of a tea party including at nursery teas and high teas a tradition which started in victorian britain reportedly when anna russell duchess of bedford grew tired of the sinking feeling which afflicted her every afternoon round 4 o'clock  in 1840 she plucked up courage and asked for a tray of tea bread and butter and cake to be brought to her room once she had formed the habit she found she could not break it so spread it among her friends instead as the century progressed afternoon tea became increasingly elaborate.
benedictine sisters of the benedectine monastery of caltanissetta producing the crocette they used to be prepared for the holy crucifix festivity this was situated next to the church of the holy cross from which the sweets take the name
for jews matzo is a baked product of considerable religious and ritual significance baked matzah bread can be ground up and used in other dishes such as gefilte fish and baked again for christians bread has to be baked to be used as an essential component of the sacrament of the eucharist in the eastern christian tradition baked bread in the form of birds is given to children to carry to the fields in a spring ceremony that celebrates the forty martyrs of sebaste
