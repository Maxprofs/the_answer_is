2 (two /tu/) is a number numeral and glyph it is the natural number following 1 and preceding 3
== in mathematics ==
the number two has many properties in mathematics an integer is called even if it is divisible by 2 for integers written in a numeral system based on an even number such as decimal and hexadecimal divisibility by 2 is easily tested by merely looking at the last digit if it is even then the whole number is even in particular when written in the decimal system all multiples of 2 will end in 0 2 4 6 or 8
two is the smallest and the first prime number and the only even prime number (for this reason it is sometimes called the oddest prime") the next prime is three two and three are the only two consecutive prime numbers 2 is the first sophie germain prime the first factorial prime the first lucas prime the first ramanujan prime and the first smarandache-wellin prime it is an eisenstein prime with no imaginary part and real part of the form  it is also a stern prime a pell number the first fibonacci prime and a markov numberappearing in infinitely many solutions to the markov diophantine equation involving odd-indexed pell numbers
it is the third fibonacci number and the third and fifth perrin numbers
despite being prime two is also a superior highly composite number because it is a natural number which has more divisors than any other number scaled relative to the number itself the next superior highly composite number is six
vulgar fractions with only 2 or 5 in the denominator do not yield infinite decimal expansions as is the case with all other primes because 2 and 5 are factors of ten the decimal base
two is the base of the simplest numeral system in which natural numbers can be written concisely being the length of the number a logarithm of the value of the number (whereas in base 1 the length of the number is the value of the number itself) the binary system is used in computers
for any number x
x+x = 2x addition to multiplication
xx = x2 multiplication to exponentiation
xx = x2 exponentiation to tetration
in general
hyper(x,n,x) = hyper(x,n+1,2)
two also has the unique property that 2+2 = 22 = 2=22=22 and so on no matter how high the level of the hyperoperation is
two is the only number x such that the sum of the reciprocals of the powers of x equals itself in symbols
this comes from the fact that
powers of two are central to the concept of mersenne primes and important to computer science two is the first mersenne prime exponent
taking the square root of a number is such a common mathematical operation that the spot on the root sign where the exponent would normally be written for cubic roots and other such roots is left blank for square roots as it is considered tacit
the square root of 2 was the first known irrational number
the smallest field has two elements
in the set-theoretical construction of the natural numbers 2 is identified with the set  this latter set is important in category theory it is a subobject classifier in the category of sets
two is a primorial as well as its own factorial two often occurs in numerical sequences such as the fibonacci number sequence but not quite as often as one does two is also a motzkin number a bell number an all-harshad number a meandric number a semi-meandric number and an open meandric number
two is the number of n-queens problem solutions for n = 4 with one exception all known solutions to znm's problem start with 2
two also has the unique property such that
and also
for a not equal to zero
the number of domino tilings of a 22 checkerboard is 2
in n-dimensional space for any n any two distinct points determine a line
for any polyhedron homeomorphic to a sphere the euler characteristic is
where v is the number of vertices e is the number of edges and f is the number of faces
as of jun 2015 there are only two known wieferich primes in base 2
with the exception of the sequence 3 5 7 the maximum number of consecutive odd numbers that are prime is two

== evolution of the glyph ==
the glyph used in the modern western world to represent the number 2 traces its roots back to the brahmin indians who wrote 2 as two horizontal lines the modern chinese and japanese languages still use this method the gupta rotated the two lines 45 degrees making them diagonal and sometimes also made the top line shorter and made its bottom end curve towards the center of the bottom line apparently for speed the nagari started making the top line more like a curve and connecting to the bottom line the ghubar arabs made the bottom line completely vertical and now the glyph looks like a dotless closing question mark restoring the bottom line to its original horizontal position but keeping the top line as a curve that connects to the bottom line leads to our modern glyph

=== judaism ===
the number 2 is important in judaism with one of the earliest reference being that god ordered noah to put two of every unclean animal (gen 7:2) in his ark (see noah's ark) later on the ten commandments were given in the form of two tablets the number also has ceremonial importance such as the two candles that are traditionally kindled to usher in the shabbat recalling the two different ways shabbat is referred to in the two times the ten commandments are recorded in the torah these two expressions are known in hebrew as ("guard and remember") as in guard the shabbat day to sanctify it (deut 5:12) and remember the shabbat day to sanctify it (ex 20:8) two challahs (lechem mishneh) are placed on the table for each shabbat meal and a blessing made over them to commemorate the double portion of manna which fell in the desert every friday to cover that day's meals and the shabbat meals
