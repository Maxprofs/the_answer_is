population genetics fixation change gene pool situation exists least two variants particular gene allele situation one alleles remains absence mutation allele must eventually lost completely population fixed permanently established population whether gene ultimately lost fixed dependent selection coefficients chance fluctuations allelic proportions fixation refer gene general particular nucleotide position dna chain locus
process substitution previously nonexistent allele arises mutation undergoes fixation spreading population random genetic drift andor positive selection frequency allele ie gene variant present member said fixed population
similarly genetic differences taxa said fixed species
history fixation
earliest mention gene fixation published works found kimuras probability fixation mutant genes population paper published kimuras paper able use mathematical techniques determine probability fixation mutant genes population able determine probability fixation dependent initial frequency allele mean variance gene frequency change per generation
probability fixation
conditions genetic drift alone every finite set genes alleles coalescent point descendants converge single ancestor ie coalesce fact used derive rate gene fixation neutral allele one form selection population varying size provided finite nonzero effect natural selection stipulated negligible probability given time allele ultimately become fixed locus simply frequency population time example population includes allele frequency equal allele frequency equal chance infinite number generations fixed locus assuming genetic drift operating evolutionary force
diploid population size n neutral mutation rate initial frequency novel mutation simply n number new mutations per generation since fixation rate rate novel neutral mutation multiplied probability fixation overall fixation rate thus rate fixation mutation subject selection simply rate introduction mutations
fixed population sizes probability fixation new allele selective advantage approximated using theory branching processes population nonoverlapping generations n genes individuals time n forms markov chain following assumptions introduction individual possessing allele selective advantage corresponds number offspring one individual must follow fixed distribution independently determined framework generating functions satisfy recursion relation used compute probabilities descendants time n shown furthermore converge specific value probability individual descendants probability fixation since indefinite survival beneficial allele permit increase frequency point selective forces ensure fixation
probability fixation also influenced population size changes growing populations selection coefficients effective means beneficial alleles likely become fixed whereas deleterious alleles likely lost populations shrinking size selection coefficients effective thus higher probability beneficial alleles lost deleterious alleles fixed beneficial mutation rare lost purely due chance individual offspring matter selection coefficient growing populations average individual higher expected number offspring whereas shrinking populations average individual lower number expected offspring thus growing populations likely beneficial allele passed individuals next generation continues allele flourishes population eventually fixed however shrinking population likely allele may passed simply parents produce offspring would cause even beneficial mutation lost
time fixation
additionally research done average time takes neutral mutation become fixed kimura ohta showed new mutation eventually fixes spend average ne generations polymorphism population ne effective population size number individuals idealised population genetic drift required produce equivalent amount genetic diversity usually population statistic used define effective population size heterozygosity others used
fixation rates easily modeled well see long takes gene become fixed varying population sizes generations example biology project genetic drift simulation model genetic drift see quickly gene worm color goes fixation terms generations different population sizes
additionally fixation rates modeled using coalescent trees coalescent tree traces descent alleles gene population aims trace back single ancestral copy called recent common ancestor
examples fixation research
schwartz indiana university able artificially induce gene fixation maize subjecting samples suboptimal conditions schwartz located mutation gene called adh homozygous causes maize unable produce alcohol dehydrogenase schwartz subjected seeds normal alcohol dehydrogenase activity activity flooding conditions observed whether seeds able germinate found subjected flooding seeds alcohol dehydrogenase activity germinated ultimately caused gene fixation adh wild type allele adh mutation lost experimented population
lee langley begun conducted another research study related gene fixation focused drosophila melanogaster population data effects genetic hitchhiking caused selective sweeps genetic hitchhiking occurs one allele strongly selected driven fixation causes surrounding areas also driven fixation even though selected looking drosophila melanogaster population data lee et al found reduced amount heterogeneity within base pairs focal substitutions accredit smallscale hitchhiking effects also found neighboring fixations changed amino acid polarities maintaining overall polarity protein stronger selection pressures additionally found substitutions slowly evolving genes associated stronger genetic hitchhiking effects
