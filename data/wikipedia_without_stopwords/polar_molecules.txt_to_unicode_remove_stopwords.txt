polarity bonds
atoms attract electrons force amount pull atom exerts electrons called electronegativity atoms high electronegativities fluorine oxygen nitrogen exert greater pull electrons atoms lower electronegativities bond leads unequal sharing electrons atoms electrons drawn closer atom higher electronegativity
electrons negative charge unequal sharing electrons within bond leads formation electric dipole separation positive negative electric charge amount charge separated dipoles usually smaller fundamental charge called partial charges denoted delta plus delta minus symbols introduced christopher ingold wife hilda usherwood bond dipole moment calculated multiplying amount charge separated distance charges
dipoles within molecules interact dipoles molecules creating dipoledipole intermolecular forces
classification
chemists classify polarity chemical bonds three groups
nonpolar bonds occur difference electronegativity two atoms less
polar bonds occur difference electronegativity two atoms
ionic bonds occur difference electronegativity two atoms greater
bonds fall one two extremes completely nonpolar completely polar completely nonpolar bond occurs electronegativities identical therefore possess difference zero completely polar bond correctly called ionic bond occurs difference electronegativities large enough one atom actually takes electron terms polar nonpolar usually applied covalent bonds bonds polarity complete determine polarity covalent bond using numerical means difference electronegativity atoms taken pauling scale result less bond generally nonpolar covalent result bond generally polar covalent result greater bond generally considered ionic
pauling considered partial ionic character bond approximate function difference electronegativity two bonded atoms estimated difference corresponds ionic character greater difference corresponds bond predominantly ionic
polarity molecules
molecules described polar covalent nonpolar covalent ionic often relative term one molecule simply polar nonpolar another however following properties typical molecules
molecule composed one chemical bonds molecular orbitals different atoms molecule may polar either result polar bonds due differences electronegativity described result asymmetric arrangement nonpolar covalent bonds nonbonding pairs electrons known full molecular orbital molecular compounds either polar covalent non polar covalent bonds
polar molecules
polar molecule net dipole result opposing charges ie partial positive partial negative charges polar bonds arranged asymmetrically water ho example polar molecule since slight positive charge one side slight negative charge dipoles cancel resulting net dipole due polar nature water molecule polar molecules generally able dissolve water examples include sugars like sucrose many polar oxygenhydrogen oh groups overall highly polar
bond dipole moments molecule cancel molecule polar example water molecule ho contains two polar oh bonds bent nonlinear geometry bond dipole moments cancel molecule forms molecular dipole negative pole oxygen positive pole midway two hydrogen atoms figure bond joins central o atom negative charge red h atom positive charge blue

ozone o molecules two oo bonds nonpolar electronegativity difference atoms element however distribution electrons uneven since central atom share electrons two atoms outer atoms share electrons one atom central atom deprived electrons others central atom formal charge outer atoms formal charge since molecule bent geometry result dipole across whole ozone molecule
nonpolar molecules
molecule may nonpolar either equal sharing electrons two atoms diatomic molecule symmetrical arrangement polar bonds complex molecule example boron trifluoride bf trigonal planar arrangement three polar bonds results overall dipole molecule
every molecule polar bonds polar molecule carbon dioxide co two polar co bonds geometry co linear two bond dipole moments cancel net molecular dipole moment molecule nonpolar
examples household nonpolar compounds include fats oil petrolgasoline therefore nonpolar molecules waterinsoluble hydrophobic room temperature many nonpolar organic solvents turpentine able dissolve polar substances comparing polar nonpolar molecule similar molar masses polar molecule general higher boiling point dipoledipole interaction polar molecules causes greater attachment common form interaction hydrogen bond also known hbond
methane molecule ch four ch bonds arranged tetrahedrally around carbon atom bond polarity though strong however bonds arranged symmetrically overall dipole molecule diatomic oxygen molecule o polarity covalent bond equal electronegativity hence polarity molecule
hybrids
large molecules one end polar groups attached another end nonpolar groups good surfactants aid formation stable emulsions blends water fats surfactants reduce interfacial tension oil water adsorbing liquidliquid interface
