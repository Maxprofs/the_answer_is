a tropical climate is a climate typically found within the tropics while a few locations outside the tropics are considered to have a tropical climate in the kppen climate classification it is a non-arid climate in which all twelve months have mean temperatures of at least 18 c (64 f) unlike the extra-tropics where there are strong variations in day length and temperature with season tropical temperature remains relatively constant throughout the year and seasonal variations are dominated by precipitation
== subtypesedit ==
within the tropical climate zone there are distinct varieties based on precipitation
tropical rainforest climate (af) all twelve months have average precipitation of at least 60 mm (2.4 in) these climates usually occur within 510 latitude of the equator in some eastern-coast areas they may extend to as much as 25 away from the equator this climate is dominated by the doldrums low pressure system all year round and therefore has no natural seasons

tropical monsoon climate (am) this type of climate most common in south and central america results from the monsoon winds which change direction according to the seasons this climate has a driest month (which nearly always occurs at or soon after the winter solstice for that side of the equator) with rainfall less than 60 mm but more than (100 [total annual precipitation {mm}/25])

note that in this scheme many places within the tropics do not have a tropical climate for example the sahara desert mountaintops within the tropics e.g mount kenya can be cold however like lowlands in the tropics (and unlike cold winter temperate zone regions) there is little seasonal variation of temperature in alpine regions of the tropics
== intertropical convergence zoneedit ==
because of the effect of sun angle on climate most areas within the tropics are hot year-round with diurnal variations in temperature exceeding seasonal variations seasonal variations in tropical climate are dominated by changes in precipitation which are in turn largely influenced by the tropical rain belt or intertropical convergence zone (itcz) a portion of the hadley cell the itcz is shown for july average in the graphic areas of ascending air have heavy rainfall areas of descending air are dry the itcz somewhat follows the solar equator throughout the year but with geographical variations and in some areas (india) is heavily influenced by local large-scale monsoons
