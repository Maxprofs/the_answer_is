conducting is the art of directing a musical performance such as an orchestral or choral concert by way of visible gestures with the hands arms face and head the primary duties of the conductor are to unify performers set the tempo execute clear preparations (upbeats) and beats (meter) and to listen critically and shape the sound of the ensemble
the conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the full score which contains the musical notation for all the instruments and/or voices he or she may or may not use a baton in the 2010s most conductors do not play an instrument when conducting although in earlier periods of classical music history leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common in baroque music from the 1600s to the 1750s the group would typically be led by the harpsichordist or first violinist (see concertmaster) an approach that some 2010s-era conductor-performers also use for music from this period conducting while playing a piano or synthesizer may also be done with musical theatre pit orchestras communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in art music but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles there may be occasional spoken instructions such as a count in") however in rehearsals frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung
conductors act as guides to the orchestras and/or choirs they conduct they choose the works to be performed and study their scores to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g. regarding tempo articulation phrasing repetitions of sections and so on) work out their interpretation and relay their vision to the performers they may also attend to organizational matters such as scheduling rehearsals planning a concert season hearing auditions and selecting members and promoting their ensemble in the media orchestras choirs concert bands and other sizable musical ensembles such as big bands are usually led by conductors
== nomenclatureedit ==
the principal conductor of an orchestra or opera company is sometimes referred to as a music director or chief conductor or by the german words kapellmeister or dirigent conductors of choirs or choruses are sometimes referred to as choral director chorus master or choirmaster particularly for choirs associated with an orchestra conductors of concert bands military bands marching bands and other bands may hold the title of band director bandmaster or drum major respected senior conductors are sometimes referred to by the italian word maestro ("master as in one who has mastered the art")
== historyedit ==
=== middle ages to 18th centuryedit ===
an early form of conducting is cheironomy the use of hand gestures to indicate melodic shape this has been practiced at least as far back as the middle ages in the christian church the person giving these symbols held a staff to signify his role and it seems that as music became more rhythmically involved the staff was moved up and down to indicate the beat acting as an early form of baton
in the 17th century other devices to indicate the passing of time came into use rolled up sheets of paper smaller sticks and unadorned hands are all shown in pictures from this period the large staff was responsible for the death of jean-baptiste lully who injured his foot with one while conducting a te deum for the king's recovery from illness the wound became gangrenous and lully refused amputation whereupon the gangrene spread to his leg and he died two months later
in instrumental music throughout the 18th century a member of the ensemble usually acted as the conductor this was sometimes the concertmaster who could use his bow as a baton or a lutenist who would move the neck of his instrument in time with the beat it was common to conduct from the harpsichord in pieces that had a basso continuo part in opera performances there were sometimes two conductors the keyboard player was in charge of the singers and the principal violinist or leader was in charge of the orchestra
=== 19th centuryedit ===
by the early 19th century it became the norm to have a dedicated conductor who did not also play an instrument during the performance the size of the usual orchestra expanded during this period and the use of a baton became more common as it was easier to see than bare hands or rolled-up paper among the earliest notable conductors were louis spohr carl maria von weber louis-antoine jullien and felix mendelssohn all of whom were also composers mendelssohn is claimed to have been the first conductor to utilize a wooden baton to keep time a practice still generally in use today among prominent conductors who did not or do not use a baton include pierre boulez kurt masur james conlon and yuri temirkanov also leopold stokowski vasily safonov eugene ormandy (for a period) and dimitri mitropoulos
the composers hector berlioz and richard wagner attained greatness as conductors and they wrote two of the earliest essays dedicated to the subject berlioz is considered the first virtuoso conductor wagner was largely responsible for shaping the conductor's role as one who imposes his own view of a piece onto the performance rather than one who is just responsible for ensuring entries are made at the right time and that there is a unified beat predecessors who focused on conducting include franois habeneck who founded the orchestre de la socit des concerts du conservatoire in 1828 though berlioz was later to be alarmed at habeneck's loose standards of rehearsal
wagner's one-time champion hans von blow (18301894) was particularly celebrated as a conductor although he also maintained his initial career as a pianist an instrument on which he was regarded as among the greatest performers (he was a prized piano student of franz liszt whose daughter cosima he married although she was to abandon him for wagner liszt was a major figure in the history of conducting who attained remarkable performances)
blow raised the technical standards of conducting to an unprecedented level through such innovations as separate detailed rehearsals of different sections of the orchestra ("sectional rehearsal") in his posts as head of (sequentially) the bavarian state opera meiningen court orchestra and berlin philharmonic he brought a level of nuance and subtlety to orchestral performance previously heard only in solo instrumental playing and in doing so made a profound impression on young artists like richard strauss who at the age of 20 served as his assistant and felix weingartner who came to disapprove of his interpretations but was deeply impressed by his orchestral standards
=== 20th centuryedit ===
the next generation of conductors brought technical standards to new levels perhaps most notable was the hungarian-born arthur nikisch (18551922) who succeeded blow as music director of the berlin philharmonic in 1895 he had previously served as head of the leipzig opera boston symphony orchestra and leipzig gewandhaus orchestra and was to serve as music director of the london symphony orchestra nikisch premiered important works by anton bruckner and pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky who greatly admired his work johannes brahms after hearing him conduct his fourth symphony said it was quite exemplary it's impossible to hear it any better.
nikisch took the london symphony orchestra on tour through the united states in april 1912 the first american tour by a european orchestra he also made one of the earliest recordings of a complete symphony the beethoven fifth with the berlin philharmonic in november 1913 nikisch was also the first conductor to have his art captured on film alas silently the film confirms reports that he made particularly mesmerizing use of eye contact and expression to communicate with an orchestra such later conductors as fritz reiner stated that this aspect of his technique had a strong influence on their own
conductors of the generations after nikisch often left extensive recorded evidence of their arts two particularly influential and widely recorded figures are often treated somewhat inaccurately as interpretive antipodes they were the italian conductor arturo toscanini (18671957) and the german conductor wilhelm furtwngler (18861954) toscanini played in orchestras under giuseppe verdi and made his debut conducting aida in 1886 filling in at the last minute for an indisposed conductor he is to this day regarded by such authorities as james levine as the greatest of all verdi conductors but toscanini's repertory was wide and it was in his interpretations of the german symphonists beethoven and brahms that he was particularly renowned and influential favoring stricter and faster tempi than a conductor like blow or before him wagner still his style shows more inflection than his reputation may suggest and he was particularly gifted at revealing detail and getting orchestras to play in a singing manner
furtwngler whom many regard as the greatest interpreter of wagner (although toscanini was also admired in this composer) and bruckner conducted beethoven and brahms with a good deal of inflection of tempo but generally in a manner that revealed the structure and direction of the music particularly clearly he was an accomplished composer as well as performer and a disciple of the theorist heinrich schenker who emphasized concern for underlying long-range harmonic tensions and resolutions in a piece a strength of furtwngler's conducting along with his interest in the large-scale furtwngler also shaped the details of the piece in a particularly compelling and expressive manner
the two men had very different techniques toscanini's was italianate with a long large baton and clear beats (often not using his left hand) furtwngler beat time with less apparent precision because he wanted a more rounded sound (although it is a myth that his technique was vague many musicians have attested that he was easy to follow in his own way) in any event their examples illustrate a larger point about conducting technique in the first half of the 20th century it was not standardized great and influential conductors of the middle 20th century like leopold stokowski (18821977) otto klemperer (18851973) herbert von karajan (19081989) and leonard bernstein (19181990) incidentally the first american conductor to attain greatness and international fame had widely varied techniques
karajan and bernstein formed another apparent antipode in the 1960s80s karajan as music director of the berlin philharmonic (195589) and bernstein as for part of that period music director of the new york philharmonic (195769) and later frequent guest conductor in europe karajan's technique was highly controlled and eventually he conducted with his eyes often closed bernstein's technique was demonstrative with highly expressive facial gestures and hand and body movements karajan could conduct for hours without moving his feet while bernstein was known at times to leap into the air at a great climax as the music director of the berlin philharmonic karajan cultivated warm blended beauty of tone which has sometimes been criticized as too uniformly applied by contrast in bernstein's only appearance with the berlin philharmonic in 1979 performing mahler's symphony no 9 he tried to get the orchestra to produce an ugly tone in a certain passage in which he believed it suited the expressive meaning of the music (the first horn player refused and finally agreed to let an understudy play instead of himself)
both karajan and bernstein made extensive use of advances in media to convey their art but in tellingly different ways bernstein hosted major prime-time national television series to educate and reach out to children and the public at large about classical music karajan made a series of films late in his life but in them he did not talk both made numerous recordings but their attitudes toward recording differed karajan frequently made new studio recordings to take advantage of advances in recording technique which fascinated him he played a role in setting the specifications of the compact disc but bernstein in his post-new york days came to insist on (for the most part) live concert recordings believing that music-making did not come to life in a studio without an audience
in the last third of the 20th century conducting technique particularly with the right hand and the baton became increasingly standardized conductors like willem mengelberg in amsterdam until the end of world war ii had had extensive rehearsal time to mold orchestras very precisely and thus could have idiosyncratic techniques modern conductors who spend less time with any given orchestra must get results with much less rehearsal time a more standardized technique allows communication to be much more rapid nonetheless conductors techniques still show a great deal of variety particularly with the use of the left hand facial and eye expression and body language
=== 21st centuryedit ===
women conductors were almost unheard of in the ranks of leading orchestral conductors through most of the 19th and 20th centuries but today artists like marin alsop and simone young have broken the gender barrier alsop was appointed music director of the baltimore symphony orchestra in 2007 the first woman ever appointed to head a major us orchestra and also of the orquestra sinfnica do estado de so paulo in 2012 and alsop was the first woman to conduct on the last night of the proms young scored similar firsts when she became head of the hamburg state opera and philharmoniker hamburg in 2005 she is also the first woman conductor to record the ring cycle of richard wagner more information on women conductors is provided below
while mexico has produced several major international conductors alondra de la parra has become the first mexican-born woman to attain distinction in the profession similarly asian origin has become unremarkable because of the international successes of conductors from the far east such as seiji ozawa who was the boston symphony orchestra's music director from 1973 until 2002 after holding similar posts in san francisco and toronto and myung-whun chung who has held major posts in germany and france and now is bringing the seoul philharmonic orchestra to international attention there is still under-representation of artists of black origin in the conducting profession but there have been notable exceptions such as henry lewis dean dixon james depreist paul freeman and michael morgan more information on black conductors is provided below
== techniqueedit ==
conducting is a means of communicating artistic directions to performers during a performance although there are many formal rules on how to conduct correctly others are subjective and a wide variety of different conducting styles exist depending upon the training and sophistication of the conductor the primary responsibilities of the conductor are to unify performers set the tempo execute clear preparations and beats listen critically and shape the sound of the ensemble and to control the interpretation and pacing of the music communication is non-verbal during a performance however in rehearsal frequent interruptions allow directions as to how the music should be played during rehearsals the conductor may stop the playing of a piece to request changes in the phrasing or request a change in the timbre of a certain section in amateur orchestras the rehearsals are often stopped to draw the musicians attentions to performance errors or transposition mistakes
conducting requires an understanding of the elements of musical expression (tempo dynamics articulation) and the ability to communicate them effectively to an ensemble the ability to communicate nuances of phrasing and expression through gestures is also beneficial conducting gestures are preferably prepared beforehand by the conductor while studying the score but may sometimes be spontaneous
a distinction is sometimes made between orchestral conducting and choral conducting typically orchestral conductors use a baton more often than choral conductors the grip of the baton varies from conductor to conductor
=== beat and tempoedit ===
at the beginning of a piece of music the conductor raises his or her hands (or hand if he or she only uses a single hand) to indicate that the piece is about to begin this is a signal for the orchestra members to ready their instruments to be played and/or for the choristers to be ready and watching the conductor then looks at the different sections of the orchestra (winds strings etc.) and/or choir to ensure that all the orchestra members are ready to play and choir members are ready in some choral works the conductor may signal to a pianist or organist to play a note or chord so that the choir members can determine their starting notes then the conductor gives one or more preparatory beats to commence the music the preparatory beat before the orchestra and/or choir begins is the upbeat the beat of the music is typically indicated with the conductor's right hand with or without a baton the hand traces a shape in the air in every bar (measure) depending on the time signature indicating each beat with a change from downward to upward motion the images show the most common beat patterns as seen from the conductor's point of view
the downbeat indicates the first beat of the bar and the upbeat indicates the best before the first note of the piece and the last beat of the bar the instant at which the beat occurs is called the ictus (plural icts or ictuses) and is usually indicated by a sudden (though not necessarily large) click of the wrist or change in baton direction in some instances ictus is also used to refer to a horizontal plane in which all the ictuses are physically located such as the top of a music stand where a baton is tapped at each ictus the gesture leading up to the ictus is called the preparation and the continuous flow of steady beats is called the takt (the german word for bar measure and beat)
if the tempo is slow or slowing or if the time signature is compound a conductor will sometimes indicate subdivisions of the beats the conductor can do this by adding a smaller movement in the same direction as the movement for the beat that it belongs to
changes to the tempo are indicated by changing the speed of the beat to carry out and to control a rallentando (slowing down the pace of the music) a conductor may introduce beat subdivisions
while some conductors use both hands to indicate the beat with the left hand mirroring the right formal education discourages such an approach the second hand can be used for cueing the entrances of individual players or sections and to aid indications of dynamics phrasing expression and other elements
during an instrumental solo section (or in an opera orchestra during a vocalist's unaccompanied solo) some conductors stop counting out all the subdivisions and simply tap the baton down once per bar to aid performers who are counting bars of rests
there is a difference between the textbook definition of where the ictus of a downbeat occurs and the actual performance practice in professional orchestras with an abrupt loud sforzando chord a professional orchestra will often play slightly after the striking of the ictus point of the baton stroke
=== dynamicsedit ===
dynamics are indicated in various ways the dynamic may be communicated by the size of the conducting movements larger shapes representing louder sounds changes in dynamic may be signalled with the hand that is not being used to indicate the beat an upward motion (usually palm-up) indicates a crescendo a downward motion (usually palm-down) indicates a diminuendo changing the size of conducting movements frequently results in changes in the character of the music depending upon the circumstances
dynamics can be fine-tuned using various gestures showing one's palm to the performers or leaning away from them may demonstrate a decrease in volume to adjust the overall balance of the various instruments or voices these signals can be combined or directed toward a particular section or performer
=== cueingedit ===
the indication of entries when a performer or section should begin playing (perhaps after a long period of rests) is called cueing a cue must forecast with certainty the exact moment of the coming ictus so that all the players or singers affected by the cue can begin playing simultaneously cueing is most important for cases where a performer or section has not been playing for a lengthy time cueing is also helpful in the case of a pedal point with string players when a section has been playing the pedal point for a lengthy period a cue is important to indicate when they should change to a new note cueing is achieved by engaging the players before their entry (by looking at them) and executing a clear preparation gesture often directed toward the specific players an inhalation which may or may not be a semi-audible sniff from the conductor is a common element in the cueing technique of some conductors mere eye contact or a look in the general direction of the players may be sufficient in many instances as when more than one section of the ensemble enters at the same time larger musical events may warrant the use of a larger or more emphatic cue designed to encourage emotion and energy
=== other musical elementsedit ===
articulation may be indicated by the character of the ictus ranging from short and sharp for staccato to long and fluid for legato many conductors change the tension of the hands strained muscles and rigid movements may correspond to marcato while relaxed hands and soft movements may correspond to legato or espressivo phrasing may be indicated by wide overhead arcs or by a smooth hand motion either forwards or side-to-side a held note is often indicated by a hand held flat with palm up the end of a note called a cutoff or release may be indicated by a circular motion the closing of the palm or the pinching of finger and thumb a release is usually preceded by a preparation and concluded with a complete stillness
conductors aim to maintain eye contact with the ensemble as much as possible encouraging eye contact in return and increasing the dialogue between players/singers and conductor facial expressions may also be important to demonstrate the character of the music or to encourage the players
in some cases such as where there has been little rehearsal time to prepare a piece a conductor may discreetly indicate how the bars of music will be beat immediately before the start of the movement by holding up their fingers in front of their chest (so only the performers can see) for example in a 4/4 piece that the conductor will beat in two (two ictus points or beats per bar) the conductor would hold up two fingers in front of his or her chest
in most cases there is a short pause between movements of a symphony concerto or dance suite this brief pause gives orchestra or choir members time to turn the pages of their part and ready themselves for the start of the next movement string players may apply rosin or wipe sweat off their hands with a handkerchief reed players may take this time to change to a new reed in some cases woodwind or brass players will use the pause to switch to a different instrument (e.g. from trumpet to cornet or from clarinet to eb clarinet) if the conductor wishes to immediately begin one movement after another for musical reasons this is called attacca the conductor will instruct the orchestra members and choristers to write the term in their parts so that they will be ready to go immediately to the next movement
== rolesedit ==
the roles of a conductor vary a great deal between different conducting positions and different ensembles in some cases a conductor will also be the musical director of the symphony choosing the program for the entire season including concerts by guest conductors concerto soloists pop concerts and so on a senior conductor may attend some or all of the auditions for new members of the orchestra to ensure that the candidates have the playing style and tone that the conductor prefers and that candidates meet the highest performance standards some choral conductors are hired to prepare a choir for several weeks which will subsequently be directed by another conductor the choral conductor is usually acknowledged for their preparatory work in the concert program
some conductors may have a significant public relations role giving interviews to the local news channel and appearing on television talk shows to promote the upcoming season or particular concerts on the other hand a conductor hired to guest conduct a single concert may only have the responsibility of rehearsing the orchestra for several pieces and conducting one or two concerts while a handful of conductors become well-known celebrities most are only known within the classical music scene
== training and educationedit ==
classical choral and instrumental conducting have established and comprehensive systems of instruction and training aspiring conductors can study at colleges conservatories and universities conservatories which are the standard musical training system in france and in quebec (canada) provide lessons and amateur conducting experience universities offer a range of conducting programs including courses in conducting as part of bachelor's degrees a small number of master of music degrees in conducting and an even smaller number of doctor of musical arts degrees in conducting as well there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and training festivals which give students the opportunity to conduct a wide range of music
bachelor's degrees (referred to as b.mus or b.m) are four-year programs that include conducting lessons amateur orchestra experience and a sequence of courses in music history music theory and liberal arts courses (e.g. english literature) which give the student a more well-rounded education students do not usually specialize in conducting at the b.mus stage instead they usually develop general music skills such as singing playing an orchestral instrument performing in a choir playing in orchestra and playing a keyboard instrument such as the piano or the organ orchestral conductors are expected to be able to rehearse and lead choirs in works for orchestra and choir as such orchestral conductors need to know the major languages used in choral writing (including french italian and latin among others) and they must understand the correct diction of these languages in a choral singing context the opposite is also true a choral conductor will be expected to rehearse and lead a string orchestra or full orchestra when performing works for choir and orchestra as such a choral conductor needs to know how to rehearse and lead instrument sections
master of music degrees (m.mus.) in conducting consist of private conducting lessons ensemble experience coaching and graduate courses in music history and music theory along with one or two conducted concerts a master's degree in music (referred to as an m.mus or m.m.) is often the required minimum credential for people who wish to become a professor of conducting
doctor of musical arts (referred to as d.m.a. dma d.mus.a or a.mus.d) degrees in conducting provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree) for this reason admission is highly selective examinations in music history music theory ear training/dictation and an entrance examination and conducting audition are required students perform a number of conducted concerts including a combination lecture-conducted concert with an accompanying doctoral dissertation advanced coursework students must typically maintain a minimum b average a dma in conducting is a terminal degree and as such it qualifies the holder to teach in colleges universities and conservatories in addition to academic study another part of the training pathway for many conductors is conducting amateur orchestras such as youth orchestras school orchestras and community orchestras
a small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting these individuals often have achieved renown as an instrumental or vocal performer and they have often undertaken a great deal of training in their area of expertise (instrumental performance or singing) another way that a small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting is by learning on the job by conducting amateur orchestras school orchestras and community orchestras (or the equivalent choral ensembles)
== role of womenedit ==
the majority of professional orchestra conductors are male the guardian called conducting one of the last glass ceilings in the music industry in 2014 ...bachtrack reported that in a list of the world's 150 top conductors that year only five were women. there are a small number of female conductors who have become top-ranked international conductors in january 2005 australian conductor simone young became the first woman to conduct the vienna philharmonic in 2008 marin alsop a protg of leonard bernstein became the first woman to become the music director and principal conductor of a major us orchestra when she won the top job at the baltimore symphony there were ...protests from a large swathe of the baltimore symphony when she was first named music director but since that time plaudits [have] roll[ed] in. in 2014 alsop was the first woman conductor to lead the last night of the proms concertone of the most important classical music events in britainin its 118-year history
according the uk's radio 3 editor edwina wolstencroft the music world has been happy to have female performers for a long time...[;]but owning authority and power in public is another matter that's where female conductors have had a hard time our society is more resistant to women being powerful in public than to women being entertaining. yuri temirkanov the music director of the st petersburg philharmonic gave his views on the appropriateness of women conductors in a september 2013 interview stating that the essence of the conductor's profession is strength the essence of a woman is weakness. finnish conductor jorma panula who was named as one of the 60 most powerful people in music in a november 2000 issue of bbc music magazine provided his views on female conductors in a 2014 television interview he stated that women [conductors] of course they are trying some of them are making faces sweating and fussing but it is not getting any better only worse it's not a problem if they choose the right pieces if they take more feminine music bruckner or stravinsky will not do but debussy is ok this is a purely biological question.
in 2013 vasily petrenko the principal conductor of the oslo philharmonic and the royal liverpool philharmonic provoked outrage when he told a norwegian newspaper that orchestras react better when they have a man in front of them because a cute girl on the podium means that musicians think about other things. petrenko stated that [w]hen conducted by a man [orchestral] musicians encounter fewer erotic distractions. he also stated that when women have families it becomes difficult to be as dedicated as is demanded in the business bruno mantovani the director of the paris conservatoire gave an interview about women conductors in which he raised the problem of maternity and ability of women to withstand the physical challenges and stresses of the profession which he described as involving conducting taking a plane taking another plane conducting again. the low percentage of women conductors is not because women do not study conducting in music school indeed in 2009 and 2012 almost half of the recipients of conducting doctorates were women
notable female conductors include
marin alsop
frieda belinfante
gisele ben-dor
sian edwards
joann faletta
jane glover
mirga grainyt-tyla
natalia luis-bassa
simone young
== role of black conductorsedit ==
historically the vast majority of conductors have been caucasian however there are a small number of notable conductors who are of african caribbean or african-american ancestry
dean dixon (1915-1976) studied conducting with albert stoessel at the juilliard school and columbia university when early pursuits of conducting engagements were stifled because of racial bias (he was african american) he formed his own orchestra and choral society in 1931 in 1941 he guest-conducted the nbc symphony orchestra and the new york philharmonic during its summer season he later guest-conducted the philadelphia orchestra and boston symphony orchestra in 1948 he won the ditson conductor's award dixon was honoured by the american society of composers authors and publishers (ascap) with the award of merit for encouraging the participation of american youth in music in 1948 dixon was awarded the alice m ditson award for distinguished service to american music
henry lewis (1932-1996) attended the university of southern california and at age 16 joined the los angeles philharmonic becoming the first black instrumentalist in a major symphony orchestra lewis founded the los angeles chamber orchestra he gained national recognition in 1961 when he was appointed assistant conductor of the los angeles philharmonic orchestra under zubin mehta he was the first african-american to lead a major symphony orchestra he made his metropolitan opera debut in 1972
james depreist (1936-2013) was one of the first african-american conductors on the world stage he was the director emeritus of conducting and orchestral studies at the juilliard school and laureate music director of the oregon symphony depreist studied composition with vincent persichetti at the philadelphia conservatory while earning a bachelor's degree at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania and a master's degree from the annenberg school for communication at the university of pennsylvania he won first prize in the dimitri mitropoulos international conducting competition he was then chosen by leonard bernstein to become assistant conductor of the new york philharmonic during the 196566 season
paul freeman (1936-2015) was a conductor composer and founder of the chicago sinfonietta freeman earned bachelor master and doctoral degrees from the eastman school of music a fulbright scholarship enabled him to study for two years at the hochshule fr musik (university for music) in berlin germany with ewald lindemann he later studied conducting with pierre monteux at the american symphony orchestra he was the music director of the opera theatre of rochester for six years he then held posts as associate conductor of the dallas symphony orchestra from 1968-1970 and detroit symphony orchestra from 1970-1979 paul freeman's papers are held at the center for black music research at columbia college chicago
michael morgan (born 1957) is music director of the oakland east bay symphony and the sacramento philharmonic orchestra and artistic director of festival opera in walnut creek california while a student at oberlin college conservatory of music he spent a summer at the oberlin college conservatory at tanglewood there he was a student of gunther schuller and seiji ozawa and it was at that time that he first worked with leonard bernstein in 1980 he won first prize in the hans swarovsky international conductors competition in vienna austria and became assistant conductor of the saint louis symphony orchestra under leonard slatkin his operatic debut was in 1982 at the vienna state opera in 1986 sir georg solti chose him to become the assistant conductor of the chicago symphony orchestra
