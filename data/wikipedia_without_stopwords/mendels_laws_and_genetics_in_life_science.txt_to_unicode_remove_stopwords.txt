genetics study genes heredity genetic variation living organisms generally considered field biology intersects frequently many life sciences strongly linked study information systems
father genetics gregor mendel late thcentury scientist augustinian friar mendel studied trait inheritance patterns way traits handed parents offspring observed organisms pea plants inherit traits way discrete units inheritance term still used today somewhat ambiguous definition referred gene
trait inheritance molecular inheritance mechanisms genes still primary principle genetics st century modern genetics expanded beyond inheritance studying function behavior genes gene structure function variation distribution studied within context cell organism eg dominance within context population genetics given rise number subfields including epigenetics population genetics organisms studied within broad field span domain life including bacteria plants animals humans
genetic processes work combination organisms environment experiences influence development behavior often referred nature versus nurture intra extracellular environment cell organism may switch gene transcription classic example two seeds genetically identical corn one placed temperate climate one arid climate average height two corn stalks may genetically determined equal one arid climate grows half height one temperate climate due lack water nutrients environment
etymology
word genetics stems ancient greek genetikos meaning genitivegenerative turn derives genesis meaning origin
gene
modern working definition gene portion sequence dna codes known cellular function process eg function make melanin molecules single gene similar single word english language nucleotides molecules make genes seen letters english language nucleotides named according four nitrogenous bases contain four bases cytosine guanine adenine thymine single gene may small number nucleotides large number nucleotides way word may small large eg cell vs electrophysiology single gene often interacts neighboring genes produce cellular function even ineffectual without neighboring genes seen way word may meaning context sentence series nucleotides put together without forming gene non coding regions dna like string letters put together without forming word eg udkslk nonetheless words letters like genes must nucleotides
quick heuristic often used always true one gene one protein meaning singular gene codes singular protein type cell enzyme transcription factor etc
sequence nucleotides gene read translated cell produce chain amino acids turn folds protein order amino acids protein corresponds order nucleotides gene relationship nucleotide sequence amino acid sequence known genetic code amino acids protein determine folds unique threedimensional shape structure ultimately responsible proteins function proteins carry many functions needed cells live change dna gene alter proteins amino acid sequence thereby changing shape function rendering protein ineffective even malignant eg sickle cell anemia changes genes called mutations

features inheritance
discrete inheritance mendels laws
fundamental level inheritance organisms occurs passing discrete heritable units called genes parents progeny property first observed gregor mendel studied segregation heritable traits pea plants experiments studying trait flower color mendel observed flowers pea plant either purple whitebut never intermediate two colors different discrete versions gene called alleles
case pea diploid species individual plant two copies gene one copy inherited parent many species including humans pattern inheritance diploid organisms two copies allele given gene called homozygous gene locus organisms two different alleles given gene called heterozygous
set alleles given organism called genotype observable traits organism called phenotype organisms heterozygous gene often one allele called dominant qualities dominate phenotype organism allele called recessive qualities recede observed alleles complete dominance instead incomplete dominance expressing intermediate phenotype codominance expressing alleles
pair organisms reproduce sexually offspring randomly inherit one two alleles parent observations discrete inheritance segregation alleles collectively known mendels first law law segregation
notation diagrams
geneticists use diagrams symbols describe inheritance gene represented one letters often symbol used mark usual nonmutant allele gene
fertilization breeding experiments especially discussing mendels laws parents referred p generation offspring f first filial generation f offspring mate offspring called f second filial generation one common diagrams used predict result crossbreeding punnett square
studying human genetic diseases geneticists often use pedigree charts represent inheritance traits charts map inheritance trait family tree
multiple gene interactions
organisms thousands genes sexually reproducing organisms genes generally assort independently means inheritance allele yellow green pea color unrelated inheritance alleles white purple flowers phenomenon known mendels second law law independent assortment means alleles different genes get shuffled parents form offspring many different combinations genes assort independently demonstrating genetic linkage topic discussed later article
often different genes interact way influences trait blueeyed mary omphalodes verna example exists gene alleles determine color flowers blue magenta another gene however controls whether flowers color white plant two copies white allele flowers whiteregardless whether first gene blue magenta alleles interaction genes called epistasis second gene epistatic first
many traits discrete features eg purple white flowers instead continuous features eg human height skin color complex traits products many genes influence genes mediated varying degrees environment organism experienced degree organisms genes contribute complex trait called heritability measurement heritability trait relativein variable environment environment bigger influence total variation trait example human height trait complex causes heritability united states nigeria however people experience variable access good nutrition health care height heritability
molecular basis inheritance
dna chromosomes
molecular basis genes deoxyribonucleic acid dna dna composed chain nucleotides four types adenine cytosine c guanine g thymine genetic information exists sequence nucleotides genes exist stretches sequence along dna chain viruses exception rulesometimes viruses use similar molecule rna instead dna genetic material viruses cannot reproduce without host unaffected many genetic processes tend considered living organisms
dna normally exists doublestranded molecule coiled shape double helix nucleotide dna preferentially pairs partner nucleotide opposite strand pairs c pairs g thus twostranded form strand effectively contains necessary information redundant partner strand structure dna physical basis inheritance dna replication duplicates genetic information splitting strands using strand template synthesis new partner strand
genes arranged linearly along long chains dna basepair sequences bacteria cell usually contains single circular genophore eukaryotic organisms plants animals dna arranged multiple linear chromosomes dna strands often extremely long largest human chromosome example million base pairs length dna chromosome associated structural proteins organize compact control access dna forming material called chromatin eukaryotes chromatin usually composed nucleosomes segments dna wound around cores histone proteins full set hereditary material organism usually combined dna sequences chromosomes called genome
haploid organisms one copy chromosome animals many plants diploid containing two chromosome thus two copies every gene two alleles gene located identical loci two homologous chromosomes allele inherited different parent
many species socalled sex chromosomes determine gender organism humans many animals y chromosome contains gene triggers development specifically male characteristics evolution chromosome lost content also genes x chromosome similar chromosomes contains many genes x y chromosomes form strongly heterogeneous pair
reproduction
cells divide full genome copied daughter cell inherits one copy process called mitosis simplest form reproduction basis asexual reproduction asexual reproduction also occur multicellular organisms producing offspring inherit genome single parent offspring genetically identical parents called clones
eukaryotic organisms often use sexual reproduction generate offspring contain mixture genetic material inherited two different parents process sexual reproduction alternates forms contain single copies genome haploid double copies diploid haploid cells fuse combine genetic material create diploid cell paired chromosomes diploid organisms form haploids dividing without replicating dna create daughter cells randomly inherit one pair chromosomes animals many plants diploid lifespan haploid form reduced single cell gametes sperm eggs
although use haploiddiploid method sexual reproduction bacteria many methods acquiring new genetic information bacteria undergo conjugation transferring small circular piece dna another bacterium bacteria also take raw dna fragments found environment integrate genomes phenomenon known transformation processes result horizontal gene transfer transmitting fragments genetic information organisms would otherwise unrelated
recombination genetic linkage
diploid nature chromosomes allows genes different chromosomes assort independently separated homologous pair sexual reproduction wherein haploid gametes formed way new combinations genes occur offspring mating pair genes chromosome would theoretically never recombine however via cellular process chromosomal crossover crossover chromosomes exchange stretches dna effectively shuffling gene alleles chromosomes process chromosomal crossover generally occurs meiosis series cell divisions creates haploid cells
first cytological demonstration crossing performed harriet creighton barbara mcclintock research experiments corn provided cytological evidence genetic theory linked genes paired chromosomes fact exchange places one homolog
probability chromosomal crossover occurring two given points chromosome related distance points arbitrarily long distance probability crossover high enough inheritance genes effectively uncorrelated genes closer together however lower probability crossover means genes demonstrate genetic linkage alleles two genes tend inherited together amounts linkage series genes combined form linear linkage map roughly describes arrangement genes along chromosome
gene expression
genetic code
genes generally express functional effect production proteins complex molecules responsible functions cell proteins made one polypeptide chains composed sequence amino acids dna sequence gene rna intermediate used produce specific amino acid sequence process begins production rna molecule sequence matching genes dna sequence process called transcription
messenger rna molecule used produce corresponding amino acid sequence process called translation group three nucleotides sequence called codon corresponds either one twenty possible amino acids protein instruction end amino acid sequence correspondence called genetic code flow information unidirectional information transferred nucleotide sequences amino acid sequence proteins never transfers protein back sequence dnaa phenomenon francis crick called central dogma molecular biology
specific sequence amino acids results unique threedimensional structure protein threedimensional structures proteins related functions simple structural molecules like fibers formed protein collagen proteins bind proteins simple molecules sometimes acting enzymes facilitating chemical reactions within bound molecules without changing structure protein protein structure dynamic protein hemoglobin bends slightly different forms facilitates capture transport release oxygen molecules within mammalian blood
single nucleotide difference within dna cause change amino acid sequence protein protein structures result amino acid sequences changes dramatically change properties protein destabilizing structure changing surface protein way changes interaction proteins molecules example sicklecell anemia human genetic disease results single base difference within coding region globin section hemoglobin causing single amino acid change changes hemoglobins physical properties sicklecell versions hemoglobin stick stacking form fibers distort shape red blood cells carrying protein sickleshaped cells longer flow smoothly blood vessels tendency clog degrade causing medical problems associated disease
dna sequences transcribed rna translated protein productssuch rna molecules called noncoding rna cases products fold structures involved critical cell functions eg ribosomal rna transfer rna rna also regulatory effect hybridization interactions rna molecules eg microrna
nature nurture
although genes contain information organism uses function environment plays important role determining ultimate phenotypes organism displays complementary relationship often referred nature nurture phenotype organism depends interaction genes environment interesting example coat coloration siamese cat case body temperature cat plays role environment cats genes code dark hair thus hair producing cells cat make cellular proteins resulting dark hair dark hairproducing proteins sensitive temperature ie mutation causing temperaturesensitivity denature highertemperature environments failing produce darkhair pigment areas cat higher body temperature lowtemperature environment however proteins structure stable produces darkhair pigment normally protein remains functional areas skin colder legs ears tail face cat darkhair extremities
environment plays major role effects human genetic disease phenylketonuria mutation causes phenylketonuria disrupts ability body break amino acid phenylalanine causing toxic buildup intermediate molecule turn causes severe symptoms progressive mental retardation seizures however someone phenylketonuria mutation follows strict diet avoids amino acid remain normal healthy
popular method determining genes environment nature nurture contribute phenotype studying identical fraternal twins siblings multiple births identical siblings come zygote genetically fraternal siblings genetically different one another normal siblings analyzing statistics often twin set certain disorder compared sets twins scientists determine whether disorder caused genetic environmental factors ie whether nature nurture causes one famous example multiple birth study genain quadruplets identical quadruplets diagnosed schizophrenia
gene regulation
genome given organism contains thousands genes genes need active given moment gene expressed transcribed mrna exist many cellular methods controlling expression genes proteins produced needed cell transcription factors regulatory proteins bind dna either promoting inhibiting transcription gene within genome escherichia coli bacteria example exists series genes necessary synthesis amino acid tryptophan however tryptophan already available cell genes tryptophan synthesis longer needed presence tryptophan directly affects activity genestryptophan molecules bind tryptophan repressor transcription factor changing repressors structure repressor binds genes tryptophan repressor blocks transcription expression genes thereby creating negative feedback regulation tryptophan synthesis process
differences gene expression especially clear within multicellular organisms cells contain genome different structures behaviors due expression different sets genes cells multicellular organism derive single cell differentiating variant cell types response external intercellular signals gradually establishing different patterns gene expression create different behaviors single gene responsible development structures within multicellular organisms patterns arise complex interactions many cells
within eukaryotes exist structural features chromatin influence transcription genes often form modifications dna chromatin stably inherited daughter cells features called epigenetic exist top dna sequence retain inheritance one cell generation next epigenetic features different cell types grown within medium retain different properties although epigenetic features generally dynamic course development like phenomenon paramutation multigenerational inheritance exist rare exceptions general rule dna basis inheritance
genetic change
mutations
process dna replication errors occasionally occur polymerization second strand errors called mutations impact phenotype organism especially occur within protein coding sequence gene error rates usually low error every million basesdue proofreading ability dna polymerases processes increase rate changes dna called mutagenic mutagenic chemicals promote errors dna replication often interfering structure basepairing uv radiation induces mutations causing damage dna structure chemical damage dna occurs naturally well cells use dna repair mechanisms repair mismatches breaks repair however always restore original sequence
organisms use chromosomal crossover exchange dna recombine genes errors alignment meiosis also cause mutations errors crossover especially likely similar sequences cause partner chromosomes adopt mistaken alignment makes regions genomes prone mutating way errors create large structural changes dna sequence duplications inversions deletions entire regions accidental exchange whole parts sequences different chromosomes chromosomal translocation
natural selection evolution
mutations alter organisms genotype occasionally causes different phenotypes appear mutations little effect organisms phenotype health reproductive fitness mutations effect usually deleterious occasionally beneficial studies fly drosophila melanogaster suggest mutation changes protein produced gene percent mutations harmful remainder either neutral weakly beneficial
population genetics studies distribution genetic differences within populations distributions change time changes frequency allele population mainly influenced natural selection given allele provides selective reproductive advantage organism well factors mutation genetic drift genetic draft artificial selection migration
many generations genomes organisms change significantly resulting evolution process called adaptation selection beneficial mutations cause species evolve forms better able survive environment new species formed process speciation often caused geographical separations prevent populations exchanging genes application genetic principles study population biology evolution known modern synthesis
comparing homology different species genomes possible calculate evolutionary distance may diverged genetic comparisons generally considered accurate method characterizing relatedness species comparison phenotypic characteristics evolutionary distances species used form evolutionary trees trees represent common descent divergence species time although show transfer genetic material unrelated species known horizontal gene transfer common bacteria
