the focal length of an optical system is a measure of how strongly the system converges or diverges light for an optical system in air it is the distance over which initially collimated rays are brought to a focus a system with a shorter focal length has greater optical power than one with a long focal length that is it bends the rays more sharply bringing them to a focus in a shorter distance
in most photography and all telescopy where the subject is essentially infinitely far away longer focal length (lower optical power) leads to higher magnification and a narrower angle of view conversely shorter focal length or higher optical power is associated with a wider angle of view on the other hand in applications such as microscopy in which magnification is achieved by bringing the object close to the lens a shorter focal length (higher optical power) leads to higher magnification because the subject can be brought closer to the center of projection
== thin lens approximationedit ==
for a thin lens in air the focal length is the distance from the center of the lens to the principal foci (or focal points) of the lens for a converging lens (for example a convex lens) the focal length is positive and is the distance at which a beam of collimated light will be focused to a single spot for a diverging lens (for example a concave lens) the focal length is negative and is the distance to the point from which a collimated beam appears to be diverging after passing through the lens
when a lens is used to form an image of some object the distance from the object to the lens u the distance from the lens to the image v and the focal length f are related by
the focal length of a thin lens can be easily measured by using it to form an image of a distant light source on a screen the lens is moved until a sharp image is formed on the screen in this case 1/u is negligible and the focal length is then given by
== general optical systemsedit ==
for a thick lens (one which has a non-negligible thickness) or an imaging system consisting of several lenses and/or mirrors (e.g. a photographic lens or a telescope) the focal length is often called the effective focal length (efl) to distinguish it from other commonly used parameters
front focal length (ffl) or front focal distance (ffd) (sf) is the distance from the front focal point of the system (f) to the vertex of the first optical surface (s1)
back focal length (bfl) or back focal distance (bfd) (sf) is the distance from the vertex of the last optical surface of the system (s2) to the rear focal point (f)
for an optical system in air the effective focal length (f and f) gives the distance from the front and rear principal planes (h and h) to the corresponding focal points (f and f) if the surrounding medium is not air then the distance is multiplied by the refractive index of the medium (n is the refractive index of the substance from which the lens itself is made n1 is the refractive index of any medium in front of the lens n2 is that of any medium in back of it) some authors call these distances the front/rear focal lengths distinguishing them from the front/rear focal distances defined above
in general the focal length or efl is the value that describes the ability of the optical system to focus light and is the value used to calculate the magnification of the system the other parameters are used in determining where an image will be formed for a given object position
for the case of a lens of thickness d in air (n1 = n2 = 1) and surfaces with radii of curvature r1 and r2 the effective focal length f is given by
where n is the refractive index of the lens medium the quantity 1/f is also known as the optical power of the lens
the corresponding front focal distance is
and the back focal distance
in the sign convention used here the value of r1 will be positive if the first lens surface is convex and negative if it is concave the value of r2 is negative if the second surface is convex and positive if concave note that sign conventions vary between different authors which results in different forms of these equations depending on the convention used
for a spherically curved mirror in air the magnitude of the focal length is equal to the radius of curvature of the mirror divided by two the focal length is positive for a concave mirror and negative for a convex mirror in the sign convention used in optical design a concave mirror has negative radius of curvature so
where is the radius of curvature of the mirror's surface
see radius of curvature (optics) for more information on the sign convention for radius of curvature used here
== in photographyedit ==
camera lens focal lengths are usually specified in millimetres (mm) but some older lenses are marked in centimetres (cm) or inches
focal length (f) and field of view (fov) of a lens are inversely proportional for a standard rectilinear lens fov = 2 arctan (x / (2f)) where x is the diagonal of the film
when a photographic lens is set to infinity its rear nodal point is separated from the sensor or film at the focal plane by the lens's focal length objects far away from the camera then produce sharp images on the sensor or film which is also at the image plane
to render closer objects in sharp focus the lens must be adjusted to increase the distance between the rear nodal point and the film to put the film at the image plane the focal length () the distance from the front nodal point to the object to photograph () and the distance from the rear nodal point to the image plane () are then related by
as is decreased must be increased for example consider a normal lens for a 35 mm camera with a focal length of  to focus a distant object () the rear nodal point of the lens must be located a distance from the image plane to focus an object 1 m away () the lens must be moved 2.6 mm farther away from the image plane to 
the focal length of a lens determines the magnification at which it images distant objects it is equal to the distance between the image plane and a pinhole that images distant objects the same size as the lens in question for rectilinear lenses (that is with no image distortion) the imaging of distant objects is well modelled as a pinhole camera model this model leads to the simple geometric model that photographers use for computing the angle of view of a camera in this case the angle of view depends only on the ratio of focal length to film size in general the angle of view depends also on the distortion
a lens with a focal length about equal to the diagonal size of the film or sensor format is known as a normal lens its angle of view is similar to the angle subtended by a large-enough print viewed at a typical viewing distance of the print diagonal which therefore yields a normal perspective when viewing the print this angle of view is about 53 degrees diagonally for full-frame 35 mm-format cameras the diagonal is 43 mm and a typical normal lens has a 50 mm focal length a lens with a focal length shorter than normal is often referred to as a wide-angle lens (typically 35 mm and less for 35 mm-format cameras) while a lens significantly longer than normal may be referred to as a telephoto lens (typically 85 mm and more for 35 mm-format cameras) technically long focal length lenses are only telephoto if the focal length is longer than the physical length of the lens but the term is often used to describe any long focal length lens
due to the popularity of the 35 mm standard cameralens combinations are often described in terms of their 35 mm equivalent focal length that is the focal length of a lens that would have the same angle of view or field of view if used on a full-frame 35 mm camera use of a 35 mm-equivalent focal length is particularly common with digital cameras which often use sensors smaller than 35 mm film and so require correspondingly shorter focal lengths to achieve a given angle of view by a factor known as the crop factor
