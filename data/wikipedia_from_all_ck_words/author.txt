=== legal significanceedit ===
in copyright law there is a necessity for little flexibility as to what constitutes authorship the united states copyright office defines copyright as a form of protection provided by the laws of the united states (title 17 u.s code) to authors of original works of authorship holding the title of author over any literary dramatic musical artistic [or] certain other intellectual works give rights to this person the owner of the copyright exclusive right to do or authorize any production or distribution of their work any person or entity wishing to use intellectual property held under copyright must receive permission from the copyright holder to use this work and often will be asked to pay for the use of copyrighted material after a fixed amount of time the copyright expires on intellectual work and it enters the public domain where it can be used without limit copyright law has been amended time and time again since the inception of the law to extend the length of this fixed period where the work is exclusively controlled by the copyright holder however copyright is merely the legal reassurance that one owns his/her work technically someone owns their work from the time it's created an interesting aspect of authorship emerges with copyright in that it can be passed down to another upon one's death the person who inherits the copyright is not the author but enjoys the same legal benefits
questions arise as to the application of copyright law how does it for example apply to the complex issue of fan fiction if the media agency responsible for the authorized production allows material from fans what is the limit before legal constraints from actors music and other considerations come into play as well how does copyright apply to fan-generated stories for books what powers do the original authors as well as the publishers have in regulating or even stopping the fan fiction
=== literary significanceedit ===
in literary theory critics find complications in the term author beyond what constitutes authorship in a legal setting in the wake of postmodern literature critics such as roland barthes and michel foucault have examined the role and relevance of authorship to the meaning or interpretation of a text
barthes challenges the idea that a text can be attributed to any single author he writes in his essay death of the author (1968) that it is language which speaks not the author the words and language of a text itself determine and expose meaning for barthes and not someone possessing legal responsibility for the process of its production every line of written text is a mere reflection of references from any of a multitude of traditions or as barthes puts it the text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture it is never original with this the perspective of the author is removed from the text and the limits formerly imposed by the idea of one authorial voice one ultimate and universal meaning are destroyed the explanation and meaning of a work does not have to be sought in the one who produced it as if it were always in the end through the more or less transparent allegory of the fiction the voice of a single person the author confiding in us the psyche culture fanaticism of an author can be disregarded when interpreting a text because the words are rich enough themselves with all of the traditions of language to expose meanings in a written work without appealing to the celebrity of an author their tastes passions vices is to barthes to allow language to speak rather than author
michel foucault argues in his essay what is an author? (1969) that all authors are writers but not all writers are authors he states that a private letter may have a signatoryit does not have an author for a reader to assign the title of author upon any written work is to attribute certain standards upon the text which for foucault are working in conjunction with the idea of the author function foucault's author function is the idea that an author exists only as a function of a written work a part of its structure but not necessarily part of the interpretive process the author's name indicates the status of the discourse within a society and culture and at one time was used as an anchor for interpreting a text a practice which barthes would argue is not a particularly relevant or valid endeavor
expanding upon foucault's position alexander nehamas writes that foucault suggests an author [...] is whoever can be understood to have produced a particular text as we interpret it not necessarily who penned the text it is this distinction between producing a written work and producing the interpretation or meaning in a written work that both barthes and foucault are interested in foucault warns of the risks of keeping the author's name in mind during interpretation because it could affect the value and meaning with which one handles an interpretation
literary critics barthes and foucault suggest that readers should not rely on or look for the notion of one overarching voice when interpreting a written work because of the complications inherent with a writer's title of author. they warn of the dangers interpretations could suffer from when associating the subject of inherently meaningful words and language with the personality of one authorial voice instead readers should allow a text to be interpreted in terms of the language as author.
== relationship between author and publisheredit ==
the author of a work may receive a percentage calculated on a wholesale or a specific price and/or a fixed amount on each book sold publishers at times reduced the risk of this type of arrangement by agreeing only to pay this after a certain amount of copies had sold in canada this practice occurred during the 1890s but was not commonplace until the 1920s established and successful authors may receive advance payments set against future royalties but this is no longer common practice most independent publishers pay royalties as a percentage of net receipts - how net receipts are calculated varies from publisher to publisher under this arrangement the author does not pay anything towards the expense of publication the costs and financial risk are all carried by the publisher who will then take the greatest percentage of the receipts see compensation for more
commissioned this is where the publisher makes all the publication arrangements and the author covers all expenses (today the practice of authors self-publishing or paying for their publications is sometimes called vanity publishing and is looked down upon by many mainstream publishers even though it may have been a common and accepted practice in the past) this type of publisher normally charges an flat fee for arranging publication offers a platform for selling and then takes a percentage of the sale of every copy of a book the author would receive the rest of the money made an alternative self-publishing method commonly adopted is to use a third-party print-on-demand publishing platform such as http://www.createspace.com but this type of platforms creates books that are only available through limited outlets and not through mainstream distributors and bookshops (createspace for example is exclusive to its owner amazon) a popular alternative to these free self-publishing platforms is feed a read http://www.feedaread.com
== relationship between author and editoredit ==
the relationship between the author and the editor often the author's only liaison to the publishing company is often characterized as the site of tension for the author to reach his or her audience the work usually must attract the attention of the editor the idea of the author as the sole meaning-maker of necessity changes to include the influences of the editor and the publisher in order to engage the audience in writing as a social act there are three principal areas covered by editors - proofing (checking the grammar and spelling looking for typing errors) story (potentially an area of deep angst for both author and publisher) and layout (the setting of the final proof ready for publishing often requires minor text changes so a layout editor is required to ensure that these do not alter the sense of the text)
pierre bourdieu's essay the field of cultural production depicts the publishing industry as a space of literary or artistic position-takings, also called the field of struggles, which is defined by the tension and movement inherent among the various positions in the field bourdieu claims that the field of position-takings [...] is not the product of coherence-seeking intention or objective consensus, meaning that an industry characterized by position-takings is not one of harmony and neutrality in particular for the writer their authorship in their work makes their work part of their identity and there is much at stake personally over the negotiation of authority over that identity however it is the editor who has the power to impose the dominant definition of the writer and therefore to delimit the population of those entitled to take part in the struggle to define the writer as cultural investors, publishers rely on the editor position to identify a good investment in cultural capital which may grow to yield economic capital across all positions
according to the studies of james curran the system of shared values among editors in britain has generated a pressure among authors to write to fit the editors expectations removing the focus from the reader-audience and putting a strain on the relationship between authors and editors and on writing as a social act even the book review by the editors has more significance than the readership's reception
== compensationedit ==
a standard contract for an author will usually include provision for payment in the form of an advance and royalties an advance is a lump sum paid in advance of publication an advance must be earned out before royalties are payable an advance may be paid in two lump sums the first payment on contract signing and the second on delivery of the completed manuscript or on publication
an author's contract may specify for example that they will earn 10% of the retail price of each book sold some contracts specify a scale of royalties payable (for example where royalties start at 10% for the first 10,000 sales but then increase to a higher percentage rate at higher sale thresholds)
an author's book must earn the advance before any further royalties are paid for example if an author is paid a modest advance of $2000 and their royalty rate is 10% of a book priced at $20 - that is $2 per book - the book will need to sell 1000 copies before any further payment will be made publishers typically withhold payment of a percentage of royalties earned against returns
in some countries authors also earn income from a government scheme such as the elr (educational lending right) and plr (public lending right) schemes in australia under these schemes authors are paid a fee for the number of copies of their books in educational and/or public libraries
these days many authors supplement their income from book sales with public speaking engagements school visits residencies grants and teaching positions
ghostwriters technical writers and textbooks writers are typically paid in a different way usually a set fee or a per word rate rather than on a percentage of sales
