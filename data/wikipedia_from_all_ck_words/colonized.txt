== definitionsedit ==
the word colony comes from the latin word colnia this in turn derives from the word colnus which means colonist but also implies a farmer cologne is an example of a settlement preserving this etymology other less obvious settlements that began as roman colonia include cities from belgrade to york a tell-tale sign of a settlement once being a roman colony is a city centre with a grid pattern the terminology is taken from architectural analogy where a column pillar is beneath the (often stylized) head capital which is also a biological analog of the body as subservient beneath the controlling head (with capital coming from the latin caput meaning head') so colonies are not independently self-controlled but rather are controlled from a separate entity that serves the capital function
