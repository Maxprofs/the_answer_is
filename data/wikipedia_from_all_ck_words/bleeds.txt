bleeding technically known as hemorrhaging or haemorrhaging (see american and british spelling differences) is blood escaping from the circulatory system bleeding can occur internally where blood leaks from blood vessels inside the body or externally either through a natural opening such as the mouth nose ear urethra vagina or anus or through a break in the skin hypovolemia is a massive decrease in blood volume and death by excessive loss of blood is referred to as exsanguination typically a healthy person can endure a loss of 1015% of the total blood volume without serious medical difficulties (by comparison blood donation typically takes 810% of the donor's blood volume) the stopping or controlling of bleeding is called hemostasis and is an important part of both first aid and surgery

hemorrhaging is broken down into four classes by the american college of surgeons advanced trauma life support (atls)
class i hemorrhage involves up to 15% of blood volume there is typically no change in vital signs and fluid resuscitation is not usually necessary
class ii hemorrhage involves 15-30% of total blood volume a patient is often tachycardic (rapid heart beat) with a narrowing of the difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures the body attempts to compensate with peripheral vasoconstriction skin may start to look pale and be cool to the touch the patient may exhibit slight changes in behavior volume resuscitation with crystalloids (saline solution or lactated ringer's solution) is all that is typically required blood transfusion is not typically required
class iii hemorrhage involves loss of 30-40% of circulating blood volume the patient's blood pressure drops the heart rate increases peripheral hypoperfusion (shock) such as capillary refill worsens and the mental status worsens fluid resuscitation with crystalloid and blood transfusion are usually necessary
class iv hemorrhage involves loss of >40% of circulating blood volume the limit of the body's compensation is reached and aggressive resuscitation is required to prevent death
this system is basically the same as used in the staging of hypovolemic shock
individuals in excellent physical and cardiovascular shape may have more effective compensatory mechanisms before experiencing cardiovascular collapse these patients may look deceptively stable with minimal derangements in vital signs while having poor peripheral perfusion elderly patients or those with chronic medical conditions may have less tolerance to blood loss less ability to compensate and may take medications such as betablockers that can potentially blunt the cardiovascular response care must be taken in the assessment of these patients

intracerebral hemorrhage bleeding in the brain caused by the rupture of a blood vessel within the head see also hemorrhagic stroke
subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) implies the presence of blood within the subarachnoid space from some pathologic process the common medical use of the term sah refers to the nontraumatic types of hemorrhages usually from rupture of a berry aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation(avm) the scope of this article is limited to these nontraumatic hemorrhages

== causesedit ==
bleeding arises due to either traumatic injury underlying medical condition or a combination
=== traumatic injuryedit ===
traumatic bleeding is caused by some type of injury there are different types of wounds which may cause traumatic bleeding these include
abrasion - also called a graze this is caused by transverse action of a foreign object against the skin and usually does not penetrate below the epidermis
excoriation - in common with abrasion this is caused by mechanical destruction of the skin although it usually has an underlying medical cause
hematoma - caused by damage to a blood vessel that in turn causes blood to collect under the skin
laceration - irregular wound caused by blunt impact to soft tissue overlying hard tissue or tearing such as in childbirth in some instances this can also be used to describe an incision
incision - a cut into a body tissue or organ such as by a scalpel made during surgery
puncture wound - caused by an object that penetrated the skin and underlying layers such as a nail needle or knife
contusion - also known as a bruise this is a blunt trauma damaging tissue under the surface of the skin
crushing injuries - caused by a great or extreme amount of force applied over a period of time the extent of a crushing injury may not immediately present itself
ballistic trauma - caused by a projectile weapon such as a firearm this may include two external wounds (entry and exit) and a contiguous wound between the two
the pattern of injury evaluation and treatment will vary with the mechanism of the injury blunt trauma causes injury via a shock effect delivering energy over an area wounds are often not straight and unbroken skin may hide significant injury penetrating trauma follows the course of the injurious device as the energy is applied in a more focused fashion it requires less energy to cause significant injury any body organ including bone and brain can be injured and bleed bleeding may not be readily apparent internal organs such as the liver kidney and spleen may bleed into the abdominal cavity the only apparent signs may come with blood loss bleeding from a bodily orifice such as the rectum nose or ears may signal internal bleeding but cannot be relied upon bleeding from a medical procedure also falls into this category
=== medical conditionedit ===
medical bleeding denotes hemorrhage as a result of an underlying medical condition (i.e causes of bleeding that are not directly due to trauma) blood can escape from blood vessels as a result of 3 basic patterns of injury
intravascular changes - changes of the blood within vessels (e.g blood pressure clotting factors)
intramural changes - changes arising within the walls of blood vessels (e.g aneurysms dissections avms vasculitides)
extravascular changes - changes arising outside blood vessels (e.g h pylori infection brain abscess brain tumor)
the underlying scientific basis for blood clotting and hemostasis is discussed in detail in the articles coagulation hemostasis and related articles the discussion here is limited to the common practical aspects of blood clot formation which manifest as bleeding
certain medical conditions can also make patients susceptible to bleeding these are conditions that affect the normal hemostatic functions of the body hemostasis involves several components the main components of the hemostatic system include platelets and the coagulation system
platelets are small blood components that form a plug in the blood vessel wall that stops bleeding platelets also produce a variety of substances that stimulate the production of a blood clot one of the most common causes of increased bleeding risk is exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (or nsaids") the prototype for these drugs is aspirin which inhibits the production of thromboxane nsaids inhibit the activation of platelets and thereby increase the risk of bleeding the effect of aspirin is irreversible therefore the inhibitory effect of aspirin is present until the platelets have been replaced (about ten days) other nsaids such as ibuprofen (motrin) and related drugs are reversible and therefore the effect on platelets is not as long-lived
there are several named coagulation factors that interact in a complex way to form blood clots as discussed in the article on coagulation deficiencies of coagulation factors are associated with clinical bleeding for instance deficiency of factor viii causes classic hemophilia a while deficiencies of factor ix cause christmas disease"(hemophilia b) antibodies to factor viii can also inactivate the factor vii and precipitate bleeding that is very difficult to control this is a rare condition that is most likely to occur in older patients and in those with autoimmune diseases von willebrand disease is another common bleeding disorder it is caused by a deficiency of or abnormal function of the von willebrand factor which is involved in platelet activation deficiencies in other factors such as factor xiii or factor vii are occasionally seen but may not be associated with severe bleeding and are not as commonly diagnosed
in addition to nsaid-related bleeding another common cause of bleeding is that related to the medication warfarin ("coumadin and others) this medication needs to be closely monitored as the bleeding risk can be markedly increased by interactions with other medications warfarin acts by inhibiting the production of vitamin k in the gut vitamin k is required for the production of the clotting factors ii vii ix and x in the liver one of the most common causes of warfarin-related bleeding is taking antibiotics the gut bacteria make vitamin k and are killed by antibiotics this decreases vitamin k levels and therefore the production of these clotting factors
deficiencies of platelet function may require platelet transfusion while deficiencies of clotting factors may require transfusion of either fresh frozen plasma or specific clotting factors such as factor viii for patients with hemophilia
== etymologyedit ==
the word haemorrhage (or hmorrhage using the ligature) comes from latin haemorrhagia from ancient greek (haimorrhaga a violent bleeding) from (haimorrhags bleeding violently) from (hama blood) + - (-raga) from (rhgnnai to break burst)
