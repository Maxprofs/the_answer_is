subjectivity is an inherently social mode that comes about through innumerable interactions within society as much as subjectivity is a process of individuation it is equally a process of socialization the individual never being isolated in a self-contained environment but endlessly engaging in interaction with the surrounding world culture is a living totality of the subjectivity of any given society constantly undergoing transformation subjectivity is both shaped by it and shapes it in turn but also by other things like the economy political institutions communities as well as the natural world
though the boundaries of societies and their cultures are indefinable and arbitrary the subjectivity inherent in each one is palatable and can be recognized as distinct from others subjectivity is in part a particular experience or organization of reality which includes how one views and interacts with humanity objects consciousness and nature so the difference between different cultures brings about an alternate experience of existence that forms life in a different manner a common effect on an individual of this disjunction between subjectivities is culture shock where the subjectivity of the other culture is considered alien and possibly incomprehensible or even hostile
political subjectivity is an emerging concept in social sciences and humanities political subjectivity is a reference to the deep embeddedness of subjectivity in the socially intertwined systems of power and meaning politicality, writes sadeq rahimi in meaning madness and political subjectivity is not an added aspect of the subject but indeed the mode of being of the subject that is precisely what the subject is.

subjectivity presupposes a subject one that experiences all the phenomena that make up and produce subjectivity the subject is the form of an existing being while subjectivity is the content and the process of subjectivation is the alteration of what it means to be that subject it is a classic philosophical question of whether the self or the subject is a transient or permanent aspect of existence whatever the answer to the problem it can be said that subjectivity which is the way that the subject expresses itself constantly undergoes change though still retains constant characteristics depending on the subject who has the potential to affect their subjectivity this is true that subjectivity is constantly undergoing change because what makes up our psychic experience is a wide range of perceptions sensations emotions thoughts and beliefs that through the passage of time and our relation to space constantly generate transformation in terms of our subjective relation to the world
