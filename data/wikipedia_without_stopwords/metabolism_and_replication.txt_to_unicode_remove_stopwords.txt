concept minimal genome assumes genomes reduced bare minimum given contain many nonessential genes limited situational importance organism therefore collection essential genes put together minimum genome could created artificially stable environment adding genes creation organism desired properties possible concept minimal genome arose observations many genes appear necessary survival order create new organism scientist must determine minimal set genes required metabolism replication achieved experimental computational analysis biochemical pathways needed carry basic metabolism reproduction good model minimal genome mycoplasma genitalium organism smallest known genome genes used organism usually considered essential survival based concept minimal set genes proposed
genome reduction nature
bacteria
many naturally occurring bacteria reduced genomes even though may reduced bare minimum although genomes thus minimal good models genome reduction thus minimal genomes genome reduction occurs commonly endosymbiotic parasitic pathogenic bacteria live hosts host provides nutrients bacteria require hence bacteria need genes producing compounds examples include species buchnera chlamydia treponema mycoplasma many others one reduced genomes freeliving bacteria found pelagibacter ubique encodes proteins mycoplasma genitalium used prime model minimal genomes human urogenital pathogen smallest genome size kb consists proteincoding genes
viruses
viruses smallest genomes nature instance bacteriophage ms consists nucleotides singlestranded rna encodes four proteins similarly among eukaryotic viruses porcine circoviruses among smallest encode open reading frames
