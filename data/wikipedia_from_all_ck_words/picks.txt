== reception ==
writing for allmusic critic stephen thomas erlewine called the album an entertaining if ultimately disposable artifact as always his playing is subtle and tasteful but the album doesn't provide enough inventive or energetic performances to be of lasting interest. norm rosenfield of country standard time wrote you don't have to be a guitar fan to enjoy atkins arrangements that add unexpected harmonies with generous helpings of class so when chet picks on the beatles it's only the highest form of flattery.
