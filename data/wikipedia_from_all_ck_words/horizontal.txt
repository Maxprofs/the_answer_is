softball is a variant of baseball played with a larger ball on a smaller field it was invented in 1887 in chicago as an indoor game it was at various times called indoor baseball mush ball playground softbund ball kitten ball and because it was also played by women ladies baseball the name softball was given to the game in 1926
a tournament held in 1933 at the chicago world's fair spurred interest in the game the amateur softball association (asa) of america (founded 1933) governs the game in the united states and sponsors annual sectional and world series championships the world baseball softball confederation (wbsc) regulates rules of play in more than 110 countries including the united states and canada before the wbsc was formed in 2013 the international softball federation filled this role women's fast-pitch softball became a summer olympic sport in 1996 but it (and baseball) were dropped in 2005 from the 2012 games
there are two types of softball in the most common type slow-pitch softball the ball which can measure either 11 or 12 inches in circumference depending on the league must arch on its path to the batter there are 10 players in a team in fastpitch softball the pitch is fast there are nine players on the field at one time and bunting and stealing are permitted softball rules vary somewhat from those of baseball two major differences are that the ball must be pitched underhandfrom 46 ft (14 m) for men or 43 ft(13.1 m) for women as compared with 60.5 ft (18.4 m) in baseballand that seven innings instead of nine constitute a regulation game
despite the name the ball used in softball is not very soft it is about 12 in (30.5 cm) in circumference (11 or 12 in for slow-pitch) which is 3 in (8 cm) larger than a baseball the infield in softball is smaller than on an adult or high school baseball diamond but identical to that used by little league baseball each base is 60 ft (18 m) from the next as opposed to baseball's 90 ft (27 m)
== history ==
the earliest known softball game was played in chicago illinois on thanksgiving day 1887 it took place at the farragut boat club at a gathering to hear the outcome of the yale university and harvard university football game when the score was announced and bets were settled a yale alumnus threw a boxing glove at a harvard supporter the other person grabbed a stick and swung at it george hancock called out play ball! and the game began with the boxing glove tightened into a ball a broom handle serving as a bat this first contest ended with a score of 41-40 the ball being soft was fielded barehanded
george hancock is credited as the game's inventor for his development of ball and an undersized bat in the next week the farragut club soon set rules for the game which spread quickly to outsiders envisioned as a way for baseball players to maintain their skills during the winter the sport was called indoor baseball under the name of indoor-outdoor the game moved outside in the next year and the first rules were published in 1889
in 1895 lewis rober sr of minneapolis organized outdoor games as exercise for firefighters this game was known as kitten ball (after the first team to play it) lemon ball or diamond ball rober's version of the game used a ball 12 inches (30 cm) in circumference rather than the 16-inch (41 cm) ball used by the farragut club and eventually the minneapolis ball prevailed although the dimensions of the minneapolis diamond were passed over in favor of the dimensions of the chicago one rober may not have been familiar with the farragut club rules fire station no 19 in minneapolis rober's post from 1896 to 1906 was listed on the national register of historic places in part for its association with the sport's development the first softball league outside the united states was organized in toronto in 1897
the name softball dates back to 1926 the name was coined by walter hakanson of the ymca at a meeting of the national recreation congress (in addition to indoor baseball kitten ball and diamond ball names for the game included mush ball and pumpkin ball".) the name softball had spread across the united states by 1930 by the 1930s similar sports with different rules and names were being played all over the united states and canada the formation of the joint rules committee on softball in 1934 standardized the rules and naming throughout the united states
sixteen-inch softball also sometimes referred to as mushball or super-slow pitch is a direct descendant of hancock's original game defensive players are not allowed to wear fielding gloves sixteen-inch softball is played extensively in chicago where devotees such as the late mike royko consider it the real game and new orleans in new orleans sixteen-inch softball is called cabbage ball and is a popular team sport in area elementary and high schools
by the 1940s fast pitch began to dominate the game although slow pitch was present at the 1933 world's fair the main course of action taken was to lengthen the pitching distance slow pitch achieved formal recognition in 1953 when it was added to the program of the amateur softball association and within a decade had surpassed fast pitch in popularity
the first british women's softball league was established in 1953
in 1991 women's fast-pitch softball was selected to debut at the 1996 summer olympics the 1996 olympics also marked a key era in the introduction of technology in softball the ioc funded a landmark bio-mechanical study on pitching during the games
in 2002 sixteen-inch slow pitch was written out of the isf official rules although it is still played extensively in the united states under the amateur softball association of america or asa rules
the 117th meeting of the international olympic committee held in singapore in july 2005 voted to drop softball and baseball as olympic sports for the 2012 summer olympic games
other sanctioning bodies of softball are aau nsa pony asa isc usssa triple crown and isa
== overview ==
fast-pitch softball is played between two teams on a large field with nine players from one team on the field at a time slow-pitch softball is played with ten fielders the field is usually composed of a dirt or brick-dust infield that contains the quadrilateral shape and running areas and a grass outfield however the field can consist of other solid and dry surfaces such as artificial turf or asphalt there are four (4) bases on the infield (first base second base third base and home plate) the bases are arranged in a square and are typically 45 to 65 feet (13,7 to 19,8 meters) apart near the center of this square is the pitcher's circle and within the circle is the rubber a small flat rectangular piece of rubber about a foot and a half in length the rubber can be 40 or 43 feet away from home plate depending on age level and the league one is playing in
the object of the game is to score more runs (points) than the other team by batting (hitting) a ball into play and running around the bases touching each one in succession the ball is a sphere of light material covered with leather or synthetic material it is 10 to 12 inches (or rarely 16 inches) (28 to 30.5 centimeters) in circumference the game is officiated by one or more neutral umpires players and umpires are generally free to ask for a brief stoppage at any time when the ball is not in play (called a time out) or immediately following a play once its outcome is clear
the game is played in usually seven innings each inning is divided into a top half in which the away team bats and tries to score runs while the home team occupies the field and tries to record three outs then a bottom half when the teams roles are reversed some leagues play with a reduced number of innings or with a time limit rather than the traditional seven innings
to start play the offense sends a batter to home plate the batting order must be fixed at the start of the game and players may not bat out of turn the defense's pitcher stands atop the rubber and throws (pitches") the ball towards home plate using an underhanded motion in fast-pitch the pitcher must have both feet in contact with the pitching rubber at all times in slow-pitch the pitcher is allowed to take one step back prior to releasing the ball during the forward movement the batter attempts to hit the pitched ball with a bat a long round smooth stick made of wood metal or composite if the pitcher throws three strikes against a batter then the batter is out and the next batter in the order comes up to bat a strike is recorded any time a batter swings at and misses a pitch or when a batter hits a ball foul (out of play) a strike is also recorded any time the batter does not swing at a pitch that crosses home plate within an area known as the strike zone to be within the strike zone the pitch must cross over home plate and as it crosses it must be above the knees and slightly below the shoulders (roughly the armpit or the shirt logo) the strike zone therefore varies from batter to batter a pitch outside the strike zone is a ball if the batter reaches four balls the batter is awarded the first base in what is known as a walk the umpire behind home plate is the sole arbiter of balls and strikes a foul ball may or may not result in a strikeout dependent upon what association and local league rules however bunting a foul ball does result in a strikeout in some associations and leagues bunting is not allowed and results in an out
the batter attempts to swing the bat and hit the ball fair (into the field of play) after a successful hit the batter becomes a baserunner (or runner) and must run to first base the defense attempts to field the ball and may throw the ball freely between players so one player can field the ball while another moves to a position to put out the runner the defense can tag the runner by touching the runner with the ball while the runner is not on a base the defense can also touch first base while in possession of the ball in this case it is sufficient to beat the batter to first base and an actual tag of the batter is unnecessary a runner is said to be thrown out when the play involves two or more defensive players runners generally cannot be put out when touching a base but only one runner may occupy a base at any time and runners may not pass each other when a ball is batted into play runners generally must attempt to advance if there are no open bases behind them for example a runner on first base must run to second base if the batter puts the ball in play in such a situation the defense can throw to the base that the lead runner is attempting to take (a force out) and the defense can then also throw to the previous base this can result in a multiple-out play a double play is two outs while a triple play a very rare occurrence is three outs runners with an open base behind them are not forced to advance and do so at their own risk the defense must tag such runners directly to put them out rather than tagging the base
a ball hit in the air and caught before hitting the ground in fair or foul territory puts the batter out a fly ball is a ball hit high and deep a pop fly is a ball hit high but short and a line drive is a ball hit close to the horizontal after the catch runners must return to their original bases if the defense throws the ball to that base before the runner returns the runner is out as well resulting in a double play a runner who remains on the base until the ball is touched or returns to the base (tags up) after the catch may try to advance to the next base at the risk of being tagged out between bases as in baseball the infield fly rule applies in some game situations to prevent the defense from recording multiple force outs by deliberately dropping an easy catch
offensive strategy is mostly just to hit the ball skillfully to let the batter reach base and advance other runners around the bases to score runs the count of balls and strikes indicates how aggressive the batter should be the offense may try to sacrifice with the batter deliberately making an out in order to advance runners defensive strategy is more complex as particular situations (number of outs and positions of baserunners) and particular batters call for different positioning of fielders and different tactical decisions the defense may decide to allow a run if it can achieve one or multiple outs
== gameplay ==
the playing field is divided into fair territory and foul territory fair territory is further divided into the infield and the outfield and the territory beyond the outfield fence
the field is defined by foul lines that meet at a right angle at home plate the minimum length of the baselines varies classification of play (see below for official measurements) a fence running between the baselines defines the limits of the field distance from home plate to the fence varies by field
behind home plate is a backstop it must be between 25 and 30 feet (7.62 and 9.14 meters) behind home plate depending on the type of division that is playing
home plate is one corner of a diamond with bases at each corner the bases other than home plate are 15 in (38 cm) square of canvas or a similar material and not more than 5 in (13 cm) thick the bases are usually securely fastened to the ground the bases are numbered counter clockwise as first base second base and third base often but not always outside first base (that is in foul territory) and adjacent and connected to it there is a contrast-colored double base or safety base it is intended to prevent collisions between the first baseman and the runner the runner runs for the foul portion of the double base after hitting the ball while the fielding team tries to throw the ball to the regular first base before the runner reaches the safety base however not all softball diamonds have these safety bases and they are much more common in women's softball than in men's the double base is required in isf championships
the infield consists of the diamond and the adjacent space in which the infielders (see below) normally play the outfield is the remaining space between the baselines and between the outfield fence and the infield the infield is usually skinned (dirt) while the outfield has grass in regulation competitions
near the center of the diamond is the pitching plate in fast pitch a skinned circle 16 feet (4.88 meters) in diameter known as the pitching circle is around the pitching plate
a field is officially required to have a warning track between 15 and 12 feet (5 and 4 meters) from the outfield fence however if the game is being played on a field larger than required no warning track is required before the temporary outfield fencing
located in foul territory outside both baselines are two coach's boxes each box is behind a line 15 feet (5 meters) long located 12 feet (3 meters) from each baseline

== equipment ==
equipment required in softball includes a ball a bat (metal or wooden) gloves uniforms and protective gear for example helmets for the offensive team and a helmet shin guards and chest protector for the defensive catcher also cleats sliding shorts face masks and knee sliders may be worn for softball
=== ball ===
despite the sport's name softballs are not especially soft the size of the ball varies according to the classification of play the permitted circumferences in international play are 120.125 in (30.50.3 cm) in mass between 6.25 oz (178 g) and 7.0 oz (198.4 g) in fast pitch 110.125 in (29.70.3 cm) mass between 5.875 oz (166.5 g) and 6.125 oz (173.6 g) in slow pitch for comparison under the current rules of major league baseball a baseball has a mass between 5 and 5 14 ounces (142 and 149 g) and is 9 to 9 14 inches (229235 mm) in circumference (2 783 in or 7376 mm in diameter) a 12-inch circumference ball is generally used in slow pitch although in rare cases some leagues (especially recreational leagues) do use a 14-inch circumference ball some balls have a raised seam and others do not the ball is most often covered in white or yellow leather in two pieces roughly the shape of a figure-8 and sewn together with red thread although other coverings are permitted the core of the ball may be made of long fiber kapok or a mixture of cork and rubber or a polyurethane mixture or another approved material
in 2004 high-visibility yellow optic covering long-used for restricted flight balls in co-ed recreational leagues became standard for competitive play yellow is the color of official ncaa and naia softballs yellow softballs are fast becoming the standard for all levels of play for girls and women's play in particular white balls are also allowed but are much more common in slow pitch than in fast pitch
in chicago where softball was invented it remains traditional to play with a ball 16 inches (41 centimeters) in circumference the fielders do not wear gloves or mitts a 16 softball when new is rough and hard with hand and finger injuries to fielders frequent if they do not give when receiving a ball but the ball breaks in slightly during a game and continues to soften over time with continued play a well-broken-in ball is called a mush ball and is favoured for informal pick-up games and when playing in limited space such as a city street (because the ball does not go as far) a 16-inch ball is also used for wheelchair softball
=== bat ===
the bat used by the batter can be made of wood aluminum or composite materials such as carbon fiber sizes may vary but they may be no more than 34 inches (86 cm) long 6.0 inches (6 cm) in diameter or 38 oz (1.2 kilograms) in mass the standard bat barrel diameter for both slowpitch and fastpitch softball is 214 inches many players prefer a smaller barrel which reduces mass and allows higher swing speed although there are a variety of bats used there are several that are banned due to performance enhancement these bats are determined to be illegal by the amateur softball association of america several bats are banned because of the harm it may place upon other teams and or give them an unfair advantage for example with a thinner wall players are able to swing the bat faster which allows the ball to go faster harder and further major league softball played at recreational parks include a variety of teams men's women's co-ed each league has its own specific regulations with bats but most must be approved by the amateur softball association many bats may be doctored in a sense that they are end loaded shaved and or painted end loading of a cap refers to the addition of weight manually placed at the end of the barrel to distribute more weight at the tip shaving bats require machine use in order to remove the inner walls of the bat to improve elasticity lastly painting bats is done because competitors purchase illegal bats that are dangerous and hazardous to the opposing team these three doctored and juiced techniques are banned from leagues but are still done today
=== gloves ===
all defensive players wear fielding gloves made of leather or similar material gloves have webbing between the thumb and forefinger known as the pocket no part of the glove is allowed to be the same color as that of the ball including that of its seams pitchers are also not allowed to have any white on their gloves including the seams it is up to the umpire's discretion if he or she believes that any coloring on the glove interferes with or hinders the batter from seeing the ball clearly gloves used in softball are usually larger than the ones used in baseball no glove larger than 14 (36 cm) can be used in asa (american softball association) sanctioned play there are different size gloves for different positions on the field for example catchers and 1st baseman have what is called a mitt and the pocket of the mitt is larger than any other glove a catcher's glove has much extra padding in it and does not have finger holes to put your fingers in a 1st baseman's glove still has much padding in it but has finger wholes for them an outfielder's glove is smaller than the catchers but still large a normal outfielder's glove ranges from 13 inches to 14 inches these extra inches gives the outfielders the extra reach to catch a fly ball far away from them an infielder's glove is typically the smallest glove on the field they typically range from 11 inches to 13 inches the point of an infielder's glove being smaller is that way after fielding a ground ball it is quicker to take the ball out of and then throw it where they need to a pitcher's glove is all about the comfort to them but it must be large enough to cover the ball the advantage of it being larger is that way the batter doesn't see the grip on the ball that the pitcher is about to throw to them
=== uniform ===
each team wears a distinctive uniform the uniform may includes a cap or visor a shirt tight sliding undershorts (optional) socks and pants these are the components for which standards are set
caps visors and headbands are optional for female players and sometimes have to be the same color caps are mandatory for male players a fielder who chooses to wear a helmet (see below) is not required to wear a cap
many female players use sliding shorts otherwise known as compression shorts in other sports these shorts help to protect the upper thigh when sliding into a base sliders may also be worn for similar protection these are somewhat padded shinguards that extend usually from the ankle to the knee of the wearer and wrap all the way around the leg(s) they protect the shin calf etc from getting bruised or damaged while sliding into homeplate and make it much more comfortable to slide into the plate most male players use long baseball-style pants
at the back of the uniform an arabic numeral from numbers 0 through 99 must be visible numbers such as 02 and 2 are considered identical also on the back of the uniforms players names are optional
all players are required to wear shoes they may have cleats or spikes the spikes must extend less than 0.75 inch (19 mm) away from the sole rounded metal spikes are illegal as are ones made from hard plastic or other synthetic materials high school athletes are sometimes permitted to wear metal cleats such as in ohio
many recreational leagues prohibit the use of metal cleats or spikes to reduce the possible severity of injuries when a runner slides feet-first into a fielder at all youth (under 15) levels in co-ed (the official terminology for mixed teams) slow pitch and in modified pitch metal spikes are usually not allowed
=== protective equipment ===
a helmet must have two ear flaps one on each side helmets and cages that are damaged or altered are forbidden helmets must be worn by batters and runners in fastpitch helmets are optional in slowpitch in ncaa fastpitch softball you have the option to wear a helmet with or without a face mask most female travel ball teams for fast pitch softball require the batter to wear a helmet with a face mask in male fastpitch masks are generally only used for medical reasons in fast pitch the catcher must wear a protective helmet with a face-mask and throat protector shin guards and body protector shin guards also protect the kneecap
in slow pitch the catcher must wear a helmet and mask at youth levels at adult levels there is no formal requirement for the catcher to wear a mask although the official rules recommend it a female catcher may optionally wear a body protector in slow pitch
there is an option to wear a face mask on the field it is recommended in lower age groups
in any form of softball any player (other than fast pitch catchers on defense) can wear a protective face mask or face guard as usual it must be in proper condition and not damaged altered or the like this is intended to prevent facial injuries
== umpires ==
decisions about plays are made by umpires similar to a referee in american football the number of umpires on a given game can range from a minimum of one to a maximum of seven there is never more than one plate umpire there can be up to three base umpires and up to a further three umpires positioned in the outfield most fast pitch games use a crew of two umpires (one plate umpire one base umpire)
official umpires are often nicknamed blue because of their uniforms in many jurisdictions most significantly isf ncaa and asa games umpires wear navy blue slacks a light powder blue shirt and a navy baseball cap some umpires wear a variant of the uniform some umpires in asa wear heather gray slacks and may also wear a navy blue shirt umpires from the usssa wear red shirts with grey slacks national softball association (nsa) umpires wear an official nsa white-colored umpire shirt with black pants or black shorts nsa fast-pitch umpires wear the white nsa umpires shirt and heather gray slacks
decisions are usually indicated by both the use of hand signals and by vocalizing the call safe calls are made by signaling with flat hands facing down moving away from each other and a verbal call of safe out calls are made by raising the right hand in a clenched fist with a verbal call of out strikes are called by the plate umpire who uses the same motion as the out call with a verbal call of strike balls are only called verbally with no hand gesture the umpire also has the option of not saying anything on a ball it is understood that when he stands up the pitch was not a strike foul balls are called by extending both arms up in the air with a verbal call of foul ball while fair balls are indicated only by pointing towards fair territory with no verbal call no signal is given for balls that are obviously foul and for closer calls that are not borderline a mere acknowledgement signal is given
all decisions made by the umpire(s) are considered to be final only decisions where a rule might have been misinterpreted are considered to be protestable at some tournaments there might be a rules interpreter or tournament chief umpire (tcu) (also known as the umpire in chief or uic) available to pass judgment on such protests but it is usually up to the league or association involved to decide if the protest would be upheld protests are never allowed on what are considered judgment calls balls strikes and fouls
== gameplay ==
a softball game can last anywhere from 3 to 7 innings depending on the league rules and type of softball however 7 innings is the most common in each inning each team bats until three batters have been put out (see below) the teams take turns batting officially which team bats first is decided by a coin toss although a league may decide otherwise at its discretion the most common rule is that the home team bats second batting second is also called last at-bat many softball players prefer to bat second because they feel they have more control in the last inning since they have the last at-bat
in the event of a tie extra innings are usually played until the tie is broken except in certain tournaments and championships if the home team is leading and the road team has just finished its half of the seventh inning the game ends because it is not necessary for the home team to bat again in all forms of softball the defensive team is the fielding team the offensive team is at bat or batting and is trying to score runs
=== pitching ===
play begins with the umpire saying play ball after the batter is ready and all fielders (except the catcher) are in fair territory the pitcher stands at the pitching plate and attempts to throw the ball past the batter to the catcher behind home plate the throw or pitch must be made with an underarm motion the ball must be released below the hip when the hand is no farther from the hip than the elbow to get it in the strike zone
for fastpitch softball the traditional pitching style is a windmill motion extending the throwing hand around the body and releasing the ball at about hip level at maximum speeds strength acquired in the underhand windmill motion is based from the open to close hip motion without correct form and hip movement pitches can be inaccurate and can lose strength and speed in girls fastpitch 12u up to 18u level can throw between 30 mph and 60 mph or more girls who can pitch at the faster speeds are often recruited to play division 1 college softball however speed is not always the most important factor in fastpitch softball pitchers can throw balls that curve inwards (screwball) and outwards (curveball) on right-handed batters there are also riseballs that can appear to move upwards and out of the strikezone (as an attempt to force the batter to swing or cause them to hit a weak pop-up) drop balls and drop curves (to cause the batter to hit groundballs this is important at the higher levels where strikeouts occur less often) the other common pitches are change-up and fastballs a change of pace (off-speed) is also very important good pitchers will be able to throw all their pitches at varying speeds and possibly even different pitching motions pitchers use deception as a primary tactic for getting batters out as the reaction times are approximately half a second or less
the pitcher tries to throw the ball so that it passes through the strike zone however in advanced play a highly skilled pitcher may deliberately pitch a ball outside the strike zone if she believes the batter is likely to swing in other instances such as when an extremely powerful hitter comes up to bat and they are followed by a weaker hitter a pitcher may deliberately walk the first batter based on the calculation that the next batter will be an easy out the strike zone is slightly different in different forms of softball a pitch that passes through that zone is a strike a pitch that the batter swings at is also a strike as is any hit ball that lands in foul territory
a pitch which is not a strike and which the batter does not swing at is known as a ball the number of balls and strikes is called the count the number of balls is always given first as 2 and 1 2 and 2 and so on a count of 3 and 2 is a full count since the next ball or strike will end the batter's turn at the plate unless the ball goes foul
there is also an illegal form of pitching known as crow-hopping a crow hop occurs when the pitcher pushes with the pivot foot from somewhere other than the pitching plate this often involves jumping from the pitching plate and replanting somewhere in front of the pitching plate the umpire sticks his left arm out straight to the side and clenches his fist this results in a ball being awarded to the batter and any runners on base advancing to the next base if the batter swings at the pitch that is deemed illegal and puts the ball in play the defense is given the option to accept the results of the play or accept the penalty listed previously image to the right demonstrates a legal pitch as the push-off foot has not left the ground the ball must be released simultaneously with the lead leg step
in fast pitch softball there are various types of pitches some are the fastball changeup dropball riseball screwball curveball dropcurve dropchange
in 16-inch softball as well as a number of varieties of slow pitch the pitch is lobbed so that the ball rises above the batter's head and lands on either the plate itself or a small rectangular area on the ground behind the plate (these restrictions make it much easier to put the ball into play and extremely difficult to use pitching as a defensive strategy as the physics of projectile motion limit how fast a ball can be thrown under such conditions and still be called a strike to a speed much slower than a traditionally thrown ball.) umpires will make calls based on where the ball lands behind the plate a pitch in the well (pictured) is considered a perfect pitch in other varieties of slow pitch the only restriction is that the windmill cannot be used thus the pitching arm cannot be raised above the shoulder and both the wind-up and the release must be underhand still allowing for moderate speed and control in pitching
at higher levels of play pitchers aim for the inner and outer corners of the plate when throwing fastballs pitchers also vary throwing fastballs at different heights to make hitting the ball even harder for the individual up at bat similarly both the dropball and the riseball are pitches that change heights to the batter the dropball appears to be coming in level but then as the ball reaches the plate the pitch drops trying to force the batter to hit the top of the ball this should result in the batter hitting a groundball when pitchers throw riseballs batters see the ball coming in straight but when the ball reaches the plate it rises the purpose of the riseball is to have the batter hit an easy pop-fly or strike out another pitch that breaks at the last minute is the curveball when pitchers throw curveballs they snap their wrist and follow their arm across their body making the ball curve to the outside of the plate pitchers can also make the ball curve to the inside of the plate by snapping their wrist the opposite direction (away from their body).the one pitch that drastically changes speed is the changeup disrupting the batter's timing
fast pitch pitches may reach high speeds at the 1996 summer olympics one pitch reached 73.3 miles per hour (118 kilometers per hour) male pitching can reach speeds around 85 miles per hour (137 kilometers per hour)
=== batters ===
the offensive team sends one batter at a time to home plate to use the bat to try to hit the pitch forward into fair territory the order the players bat in known as the batting order must stay the same throughout the game substitutes and replacements must bat in the same position as the player they are replacing in co-ed male and female batters must alternate
the batter stands facing the pitcher inside a batter's box (there is one on each side of the plate to compensate for either right or left handed batters) the bat is held with both hands over the shoulder and away from the pitcher (90 degree angle) the ball is usually hit with a full swinging motion in which the bat may move through more than 360 degrees the batter usually steps forward with the front foot the body weight shifts forward as the batter simultaneously swings the bat a bunt is another form of batting there are different types including a sacrifice bunt or slap bunt there is also regular slapping in which a batter takes position on the left side of the plate and usually stands in the back of the box but it is possible form anywhere the batter takes a step back with their leading foot as the pitcher is in the middle of the windup crosses over with their back foot and runs toward first base while they swing there are many different types of slapping and they all vary depending on the batter and their strengths there are half swing slaps fake slaps and full swing slaps each type of slap has a different purpose or goal no matter what way the batter hits the ball they must be inside the batter's box when the bat makes contact with the ball if the batter steps out of the box while swinging the batter is out
once the ball is hit into fair territory the runner must try to advance to first base or beyond while running to first base the batter is a batter-runner when she safely reaches first (see below) she becomes a base-runner or runner
a batted ball hit high in the air is a fly ball a fly ball hit upward at an angle greater than 45 degrees is a pop fly a batted ball driven in the air through the infield at a height at which an infielder could play it if in the right position is a line drive a batted ball which hits the ground within the diamond is a ground ball if a batted ball hits a player or a base it is considered to have hit the ground
a batter can also advance to first if hit by the pitch if a batter is hit by the pitch it is a dead ball and she is rewarded first base she must make an attempt to get out of the way and it is the umpire's judgmental call whether the batter attempted to move if he feels the batter could have moved and avoided getting hit he or she will not reward the batter first base and the pitch will be recorded as a ball
=== getting the batter out ===
the batter is out if three strikes are called (a strikeout") a ball hit by the batter is caught before touching the ground (a flyout") the batter goes to a base that is already tagged ("tagged or tag play") a fielder holding the ball touches a base which is the only base towards which the batter may run before the batter arrives there (a force out or force play") or in certain special circumstances there is also a not so common occurrence when the batter has 2 strikes and swings at strike three if the catcher doesn't catch the ball the batter has the chance to run to first base and the catcher can throw the batter out at first base
=== advancing around the bases ===
if the player hits the ball and advances to a base without a fielding error or an out being recorded then that is called a base hit the bases must be reached in order counterclockwise starting with first base after hitting the ball the batter may advance as many bases as possible an advance to first base on the one hit is a single to second base is a double to third base is a triple and to home plate is a home run home runs are usually scored by hitting the ball over the outfield fence but may be scored on a hit which does not go over the fence a home run includes any ball that bounces off a fielder and goes over the fence in fair-territory (depending upon association and local league rules) or that hits the foul pole if a batted ball bounces off a fielder (in fair territory) and goes over the fence in foul territory or if it goes over the fence at a location that is closer than the official distance the batter is awarded a double instead
if a runner becomes entitled to the base where another runner is standing the latter runner must advance to the next base for example if a player hits the ball and there is a runner on first the runner on first must try to advance to second because the batter-runner is entitled to first base if the batter reaches first base without being put out then that player can then be forced to run towards second base the next time a ball is driven into fair territory that is because the player must vacate first base to allow the next batter to reach it and consequently can only go to second base where a force out may be recorded
runners may advance at risk to be put out on a hit by another player after a fly ball has been caught provided the player was touching a base at the time the ball was first touched or after or (in fast pitch) automatically when a pitch is delivered illegally
runners advance without liability to be put out when a walk advances another player to the runner's current base or automatically in certain special circumstances described below
==== special circumstances ====
if there is a wild throw (or overthrow") in which the ball goes out of the designated play area each runner is awarded two (2) bases from the last base touched at the time of the throw retreating past a made base negates the advance to that base if a fielder intentionally carries a ball out of play two (2) bases are awarded from the time the ball leaves the field of play if this is unintentional (fielder's momentum) the award is one (1) base if on a tag play the fielder loses control (after establishing control) of the ball and it leaves the field of play one (1) base is awarded
if there is a wild pitch in which the ball goes out of the designated play area each runner is awarded one (1) base from the base occupied at the time of the pitch
in fast pitch runners may try to  steal bases by running to the next base on the pitch and reaching it before being tagged with the ball the point at which a runner can steal a base varies in fast pitch the runner is allowed to begin stealing a base when the ball is released from the windmill pitching motion but until recently stealing was forbidden in slow pitch because a runner has the opportunity to get a larger head start while the slow pitch is making its way to the batter as a result of rule changes initiated by the independent softball association which later made its way to the amateur softball association and the international softball federation in the 21st century most levels of slow pitch permit stealing bases provided the runner starts when the ball either touches the ground or crosses the plate this rule encourages pitchers to be more responsible with the pitch and catchers to play defense as balls which miss the catcher are now grounds to have stolen bases
no matter what level of play all baserunners must keep one foot on a base until the pitcher throws the ball or until the ball crosses the front edge of home plate (depends on association)
in fast pitch if the catcher drops strike three (a passed ball") with less than two outs the batter can attempt to run to first base if first base is unoccupied the catcher must then attempt to throw the ball to first base ahead of the runner if he or she cannot the runner is safe with two outs the batter can attempt to run to first whether or not it is already occupied
depending on the league in slow pitch only a foul ball with two strikes on the batter means the batter is out stealing in 16-inch softball is severely restricted as a runner may only steal the base in front of them if it is open and if they are thrown at  la pickoff move or snap throw this results in many inexperienced players being thrown or doubled off when they attempt to advance on a wild pickoff at another baserunner
=== scoring runs ===
a run is scored when a player has touched all four bases in order proceeding counterclockwise around them they need not be touched on the same play a batter may remain safely on a base while play proceeds and attempt to advance on a later play
a run is not scored if the last out is a force out or occurs during the same play that the runner crosses home plate for instance if a runner is on third base prior to a hit and he or she crosses home plate after an out is made either on the batter or another runner the run is not counted
=== ending the game ===
the team with the most runs after seven innings wins the game the last (bottom) half of the seventh inning or any remaining part of the seventh inning is not played if the team batting second is leading
if the game is tied play usually continues until a decision is reached by using the international tie-breaker rule or if time is expired the score would be just tied starting in the top of the last inning the batting team starts with a base-runner on second base which is the player who is the last available to bat (in other words the batter who last took their position in the batter's box regardless whether they were the last out or another runner was put out)
in games where one team leads by a large margin the run ahead rule may come into play in order to avoid embarrassing weaker teams in fast pitch and modified pitch a margin of 15 runs after three innings 10 after four or 7 after five is sufficient for a win to be declared for the leading team in slow pitch the margin is 20 runs after four innings or 15 after five innings in the ncaa the required margin after 5 innings is 8 runs the mercy rule takes effect at the end of an inning thus if the team batting first is ahead by enough runs for the rule to come into effect the team batting second is given their half of the inning to try to narrow the margin
a game may be lost due to a forfeit a score of 70 for the team not at fault is recorded (generally one run is awarded for each inning that would have been played) a forfeit may be called due to any of these circumstances if a team does not show up to play if one side refuses to continue play if a team fails to resume play after a suspension of play ends if a team uses tactics intended to unfairly delay or hasten the game if a player removed from the game does not leave within one minute of being instructed to do so if a player that cannot play enters the game and one pitch has been thrown if a team does not have for whatever reason enough players to continue or if after warning by the umpire a player continues to intentionally break the rules of the game this last rule is rarely enforced as players who break rules after being warned are usually removed
the plate umpire may suspend play because of darkness or anything that puts players or spectators in danger if five innings have been played the game is recorded as it stands this includes ties if fewer than four innings have been played the game is not considered a regulation game
games that are not regulation or are regulation ties are resumed from the point of suspension if it is a championship game it is replayed from the beginning team rosters may be changed
== positions ==
there are nine players out on the field at one time in fast-pitch softball and 10 players in slow-pitch softball although the pitcher and catcher have the ball the most each person has a specific job in the infield there is the pitcher catcher first baseman second baseman shortstop and third baseman in the outfield there is a left fielder center fielder and right fielder in slow-pitch softball there is an extra outfielder in the outfield who is specified as a roamer or rover normally the defensive team will play with four outfielders meaning there is a left fielder left-center fielder right-center fielder and right fielder
in fast-pitch softball it is common for teams to use a designated player in the lineup this player which functions like the designated hitter in baseball hits in place of one of the position players but does not play defense
=== pitcher ===
the pitcher is the individual who throws the ball from the middle of the diamond as in baseball fastpitch softball has a rubber used to control the pitchers delivery a pitcher must have both feet on the rubber at the start of their delivery but neither foot is on the rubber when the ball is released in baseball the rubber is on a mound of dirt as gravity is used to generate speed in softball the pitchers throw from within a circle and the rubber in the circle is not elevated the circle is also used to control base runners when the pitcher is in possession of the ball in the circle a runner who has passed a base must either advance or return to the base they cannot bait the pitcher to throw or they will be called out the pitcher usually throws the ball in the strike zone in softball the pitcher uses an underarm motion to pitch the ball towards the strike zone as soon as the pitcher makes a throw the fielders are ready to field balls that are hit in the middle of the diamond pitchers usually tend to be tall very flexible and have good upper body strength pitchers can be righthanded or lefthanded the softball pitcher makes a windmill motion while throwing under hand unlike baseball pitchers who throw over hand
=== catcher ===
the catcher is normally behind home plate in a squatted position (some plays may require the catcher to stand at an angle for intentional walks) at the plate the catcher is responsible for catching pitches keeping mispitched balls in front of the plate calling pitches that are normally done through hand signals and they are considered the leaders of the field catchers must know how many outs there are the number of strikes and balls on the batter so they can relay that to their team-mates they must also know how many runners are on base and where the ball should be thrown next in the following play catchers are strong need to be smart and quick on their feet and have accurate throws so they can pick runners off at each base catchers should be able to have strong and muscular legs to squat for a long period of time the gear worn by a catcher protects them from balls thrown in the dirt or wild pitches the catcher is allowed to take off his/her mask to catch a pop fly or to watch the play the catchers gear can be very hot some catchers wear pads under their knees to help keep the knees healthy most catchers are loud big tough and not afraid to get down and dirty some say that the catcher is the most important player on the field
=== first baseman ===
the first baseman is the position to the right side of the diamond when facing the field the major role of the first baseman is to receive throws from other defensive players in order to get a force play at first base another role they play is to make fielding plays on all balls hit towards first base the first baseman is usually involved in every play that occurs on the field individuals at first base have quick hands a good reach and are always on the lookout to catch the player off base they are also generally taller and left-handed throwing which gives them an extended reach first basemen however can be both left and right handed just like the catcher first basemen may wear mitts
=== second baseman ===
the second baseman plays in between the first baseman and second base itself usually closer to second base if the ball is hit to the left side of the field the second baseman covers second base if the ball is hit to right-field or center field they become the cut-off for the center fielder or the right fielder depending who the ball was hit to if the ball is hit to the first baseman the second baseman then is responsible for covering first if the ball is hit to the second baseman they either throw the ball to second if there was already a player on first or they throw to first if there was nobody on if there is a runner on first and the person up to bat hits the ball to the shortstop or the third baseman the second baseman is in charge of covering second to receive the throw from the shortstop or third baseman then depending where the runner is between home and first the second baseman makes the decision to throw the ball to first or to hold the ball also in the case of a bunt the second baseman must cover first as the first baseman runs to get the ball from the bunt then it is often thrown back to first base
=== shortstop ===
the shortstop fields all balls hit to the infield between the second and third bases this individual also helps cover second base third base and is frequently involved in force plays double plays and frequently throws the ball to the catcher to throw out runners at home plate on steals to second base (when the runner from first is advancing to second on the pitch) the shortstop usually covers the shortstop only doesn't cover second base when a right handed batter is up in this case the second baseman covers the steal most short stops are very quick agile and think fast shortstops may play in a restricted zone but are faced with many types of hits and interact closely with the 2nd base 3rd base and home plate often double plays are due to quick thinking/reaction by the short stop when a ball is hit up the middle and the shortstop catches it they will flip the ball to the second baseman for the best result shortstop also takes the cut off for the left field when the play is at second base when the ball is hit to the right side of the outfield the short stop then covers second base if there is a runner on first base and there is a hit down the line or in the gap to right field the shortstop will then go for the cut to third meaning the runner that is going from first to second will most likely be advancing to third and in that case the shortstop will be the cut off for the throw from right field to third base shortstop is one of the most difficult positions to play due to the amount of balls being hit in that direction
=== third baseman ===
the third baseman is the position on the left side of the diamond when you are looking at the field they are responsible for fielding all balls hit their way including bunts in fact the third baseman fields more bunts than a pitcher and first baseman do third base is also called the hot corner because the ball can pop off the bat at the fielder very fast third baseman must have great reflexes and be very quick on their feet it also helps if they can run fast but it isn't a requirement a third baseman must have a very strong arm so that they can throw a runner out from across the diamond any ball that the third baseman can get they should they will have more momentum towards first base when fielding the ball than a shortstop they are also closer to first base when they cut off a slower ground ball towards shortstop third baseman are responsible for covering third base at all times unless the ball is hit to them in that instance the shortstop is responsible for third base third baseman must be smart have great reflexes have a strong arm and be quick with their hands
=== outfielders ===
the outfielders are players that cover the grassy area behind the infield outfielders are named for their positions in the field relative to home plate traditional outfield positions include a left fielder a center fielder and a right fielder each player has specific job as being an outfielder in some leagues and organizations four outfield players are utilized by each team with the center field position being shared between two players known as the left-center fielder and the right-center fielder (or alternatively the deep center fielder and the short fielder)
==== right fielder ====
the right fielders position is on the right side of the field behind the first baseman when looking at the field from behind home plate the right fielder is part of a group of two other fielders that make up the outfield the right fielder has a multitude of jobs over the course of a softball game generally outfielders act as a back-up to the infielders when they make plays or if the ball is hit past the infield right field has a particular job of covering the area behind first base if the ball is to be thrown in that area right field is meant to cover this area is the ball gets past the first baseman this will prevent base-runners from advancing to unwanted bases traditionally in the game of softball the right fielder will have the strongest arm out of the two other outfielders the right fielder must have the strongest arm because they have the furthest possibility to throw the ball a right fielder will throw the ball to each base more than the other outfielders will because of their position in respect to the bases
==== center fielder ====
the center fielders position is in the middle of the outfield directly behind second base when looking at the field from behind home plate the center fielder is part of a group of two other fielders that make up the outfield generally outfielders act as a back-up to the infielders when they make plays or if the ball is hit past the infield specifically the center fielder covers the area behind second base if the ball is going to be thrown in that direction by covering this area if the ball does get past the infielder the center fielder can prevent base-runners from advancing to unwanted bases within the game of softball the center fielder is traditionally the fastest of the three outfielders the center fielder needs to be the quickest because of the large area of field they must cover besides being a quick player the center fielder must have a strong throwing arm because of the distance between the player and home plate
==== left fielder ====
the left fielders position is on the left side of the outfield behind the third baseman when looking at the field from behind home plate the left fielder is part of a group of two other fielders that make up the outfield generally outfielders act as a back-up to the infielders when they make plays or if the ball is hit past the infield the left fielder must field their position but also cover the area behind third base if a ball is thrown or hit in that direction the left fielder covers this area in the case that the ball will pass the infielders the left fielder can then prevent the base runner from advancing to unwanted bases besides covering certain areas of the field the left fielder must be the smartest of the outfielders in the left field position the player has full view of the field the players the base-runners and the batter the left fielder must constantly be aware of the situation on the field and know what must be done in different circumstances
== modification of rules ==
one reason for the popularity of softball is the ease of modification of its rules thereby allowing the game to be adapted to a variety of skill levels for example in some slow pitch softball leagues a batter starts at bat with a count of one ball one strike in some leagues the number of home runs that can be hit by a team are limited in other leagues stealing of bases is prohibited some groups allow for a more defensive game by making home plate a force out for first base this reduces scoring evenly on both sides and allows for some margin of error
co-recreational leagues where men and women play on the same team often adopt rules intended to reduce gender inequality under the assumption that men will be generally more powerful for example rules may stipulate that there must be an equal number of men and women on the team or that batting order alternate male and female batters some leagues only require 3 women to play but they must be present on the field at all times in most co-ed or mixed gender leagues there is something called an encroachment line this requires the outfielders to stay behind a line till the ball is hit if an outfielder passes in front of this line before the female batter hits a fair ball the batter will receive a single base or the result of the play and the base runners will advance accordingly the line will be 180 feet from home plate one possible rule requires male batters to switch hit some leagues even use different balls for male and female batters while these modified rules are common there are questions as to their place in modern adult sports
some leagues require teams to use limited flight softballs these softballs when hit will not go as far as regular softballs other leagues limit the number of runs which can be scored in an inning five is a common limit
by allowing these and other modifications softball can be enjoyed by children teenagers and adults senior leagues with players over the age of 60 are not uncommon
an example of a rule modification is the offensive pitcher (or self pitch") often found in informal games where the emphasis is on the social rather than the competitive aspects of the game the pitcher aids the batter by attempting to give the easiest pitch to hit there are no walks and a batter is normally given a fixed number of pitches to attempt to hit (usually 3 or 4) the batter is considered to strike out if the batter fails to hit the ball into fair territory after the given number of pitches the pitcher does not act as a fielder and a rule is often made that if a batted ball touches the pitcher the batter is out
in some leagues the number of pitches to walk or strikeout can be reduced for instance one strike is an out and two balls is a walk this is common in leagues where doubleheaders are played or in late season leagues when reduced daylight is an issue it results in shorter games as players are more apt to swing even at marginal pitches rather than risk striking out on one pitch
many leagues also include a second first base immediately adjacent to the main one this is usually orange and the batter running through first base is supposed to run straight through it this minimizes the chances of a collision by the same token some leagues have an alternate home plate and rule that plays at home are always force plays in these cases there is typically a white line drawn approximately 1/3 of the way down the baseline that is considered a point of no return this is designed to reduce the pickle which can put a great strain on the ankles and knees of older baserunners
=== indoor play ===
despite the fact that it was originally intended to be played indoors softball is usually played outdoors the indoor form is sometimes called arena softball it is most similar to slow pitch there are no official rules for the indoor form but some general conventions are given below
only the wall behind the batter is considered foul territory the other walls are considered fair if a ball hits a wall and is caught before it lands the batter flies out usually there is a small area on one of the walls that results in a home run being awarded if the batted ball hits it
pitching is generally a little slower because of the indoor turf or pitched through a pitching machine
the placement of the fielders is different the pitcher also acts as the second baseman there is sometimes a catcher
there is no limit to the number of batters a team may have available although only so many can bat in one inning
