ecosystem processesedit
energy carbon enter ecosystems photosynthesis incorporated living tissue transferred organisms feed living dead plant matter eventually released respiration mineral nutrients hand recycled within ecosystems
ecosystems controlled external internal factors external factors also called state factors control overall structure ecosystem way things work within influenced ecosystem important climate climate determines biome ecosystem embedded rainfall patterns temperature seasonality determine amount water available ecosystem supply energy available influencing photosynthesis parent material underlying geological material gives rise soils determines nature soils present influences supply mineral nutrients topography also controls ecosystem processes affecting things like microclimate soil development movement water system may difference ecosystem present wetland situated small depression landscape one present adjacent steep hillside

decompositionedit
carbon nutrients dead organic matter broken group processes known decomposition releases nutrients reused plant microbial production returns carbon dioxide atmosphere water used photosynthesis absence decomposition dead organic matter would accumulate ecosystem nutrients atmospheric carbon dioxide would depleted approximately terrestrial npp goes directly plant decomposer
decomposition processes separated three categoriesleaching fragmentation chemical alteration dead material water moves dead organic matter dissolves carries watersoluble components taken organisms soil react mineral soil transported beyond confines ecosystem considered lost newly shed leaves newly dead animals high concentrations watersoluble components include sugars amino acids mineral nutrients leaching important wet environments much less important dry ones
fragmentation processes break organic material smaller pieces exposing new surfaces colonization microbes freshly shed leaf litter may inaccessible due outer layer cuticle bark cell contents protected cell wall newly dead animals may covered exoskeleton fragmentation processes break protective layers accelerate rate microbial decomposition animals fragment detritus hunt food passage gut freezethaw cycles cycles wetting drying also fragment dead material
chemical alteration dead organic matter primarily achieved bacterial fungal action fungal hyphae produce enzymes break tough outer structures surrounding dead plant material also produce enzymes break lignin allows access cell contents nitrogen lignin fungi transfer carbon nitrogen hyphal networks thus unlike bacteria dependent solely locally available resources
decomposition rates vary among ecosystems rate decomposition governed three sets factorsthe physical environment temperature moisture soil properties quantity quality dead material available decomposers nature microbial community temperature controls rate microbial respiration higher temperature faster microbial decomposition occurs also affects soil moisture slows microbial growth reduces leaching freezethaw cycles also affect decompositionfreezing temperatures kill soil microorganisms allows leaching play important role moving nutrients around especially important soil thaws spring creating pulse nutrients become available
decomposition rates low wet dry conditions decomposition rates highest wet moist conditions adequate levels oxygen wet soils tend become deficient oxygen especially true wetlands slows microbial growth dry soils decomposition slows well bacteria continue grow albeit slower rate even soils become dry support plant growth rains return soils become wet osmotic gradient bacterial cells soil water causes cells gain water quickly conditions many bacterial cells burst releasing pulse nutrients decomposition rates also tend slower acidic soils soils rich clay minerals tend lower decomposition rates thus higher levels organic matter smaller particles clay result larger surface area hold water higher water content soil lower oxygen content consequently lower rate decomposition clay minerals also bind particles organic material surface making less accessibly microbes soil disturbance like tilling increase decomposition increasing amount oxygen soil exposing new organic matter soil microbes
quality quantity material available decomposers another major factor influences rate decomposition substances like sugars amino acids decompose readily considered labile cellulose hemicellulose broken slowly moderately labile compounds resistant decay like lignin cutin considered recalcitrant litter higher proportion labile compounds decomposes much rapidly litter higher proportion recalcitrant material consequently dead animals decompose rapidly dead leaves decompose rapidly fallen branches organic material soil ages quality decreases labile compounds decompose quickly leaving increasing proportion recalcitrant material microbial cell walls also contain recalcitrant materials like chitin also accumulate microbes die reducing quality older soil organic matter
nutrient cyclingedit
ecosystems continually exchange energy carbon wider environment mineral nutrients hand mostly cycled back forth plants animals microbes soil nitrogen enters ecosystems biological nitrogen fixation deposited precipitation dust gases applied fertilizer since terrestrial ecosystems nitrogenlimited nitrogen cycling important control ecosystem production
modern times nitrogen fixation major source nitrogen ecosystems nitrogen fixing bacteria either live symbiotically plants live freely soil energetic cost high plants support nitrogenfixing symbiontsas much gpp measured controlled conditions many members legume plant family support nitrogenfixing symbionts cyanobacteria also capable nitrogen fixation phototrophs carry photosynthesis like nitrogenfixing bacteria either freeliving symbiotic relationships plants sources nitrogen include acid deposition produced combustion fossil fuels ammonia gas evaporates agricultural fields fertilizers applied dust anthropogenic nitrogen inputs account nitrogen fluxes ecosystems
plant tissues shed eaten nitrogen tissues becomes available animals microbes microbial decomposition releases nitrogen compounds dead organic matter soil plants fungi bacteria compete soil bacteria use organic nitrogencontaining compounds source carbon release ammonium ions soil process known nitrogen mineralization others convert ammonium nitrite nitrate ions process known nitrification nitric oxide nitrous oxide also produced nitrification nitrogenrich oxygenpoor conditions nitrates nitrites converted nitrogen gas process known denitrification
important nutrients include phosphorus sulfur calcium potassium magnesium manganese phosphorus enters ecosystems weathering ecosystems age supply diminishes making phosphoruslimitation common older landscapes especially tropics calcium sulfur also produced weathering acid deposition important source sulfur many ecosystems although magnesium manganese produced weathering exchanges soil organic matter living cells account significant portion ecosystem fluxes potassium primarily cycled living cells soil organic matter
