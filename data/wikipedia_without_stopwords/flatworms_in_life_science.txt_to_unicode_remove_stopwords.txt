bilateria baltri animals bilateral symmetry ie front back end well upside downside therefore left right contrast radially symmetrical animals like jellyfish topside downside front back
bilateria major group animals including majority phyla sponges cnidarians placozoans ctenophores part bilateral embryos triploblastic three germ layers endoderm mesoderm ectoderm nearly bilaterally symmetrical approximately notable exception echinoderms achieve nearradial symmetry adults bilaterally symmetrical larvae
except phyla ie flatworms gnathostomulids bilaterians complete digestive tracts separate mouth anus bilaterians lack body cavities acoelomates ie platyhelminthes gastrotricha gnathostomulida others display primary body cavities deriving blastocoel pseudocoel andor secondary cavities appear de novo example coelom
evolution
hypothetical recent common ancestor bilateria termed urbilaterian nature first bilaterian matter debate one side suggests acoelomates gave rise groups planuloidaceloid hypothesis graff metchnikoff hyman salvini plawen poses first bilaterian coelomate organism main acoelomate phyla flatworms gastrotrichs lost body cavities secondarily archicoelomata hypothesis variations gastrea haeckel sedgwick bilaterosgastrea jgersten trochaea nielsen
first evidence bilateria fossil record comes trace fossils ediacaran sediments first bona fide bilaterian fossil kimberella dating million years ago earlier fossils controversial fossil vernanimalcula may earliest known bilaterian may also represent infilled bubble fossil embryos known around time vernanimalcula million years ago none bilaterian affinities burrows believed created bilaterian life forms found tacuar formation uruguay believed least million years old
phylogeny
two main superphyla main lineages bilateria deuterostomes include echinoderms hemichordates chordates smaller phyla protostomes include rest arthropods annelids mollusks flatworms forth number differences notably embryo develops particular first opening embryo becomes mouth protostomes anus deuterostomes many taxonomists recognize least two superphyla among protostomes ecdysozoa molting animals lophotrochozoa also referred spiralia within latter researchers also recognize another superphylum platyzoa others reject platyzoa monophyly arrow worms chaetognatha proven particularly difficult classify taxonomists placing among deuterostomes others placing among protostomes two recent studies address question chaetognath origins support protostome affinities
modern consensus phylogeny bilateria shown although position certain clades still controversial tree changed considerably nodes marked received broad consensus prominent alternative tree championed nielsen
