suggestion is the psychological process by which one person guides the thoughts feelings or behaviour of another nineteenth century writers on psychology such as william james used the words suggest and suggestion in senses close to those they have in common speechone idea was said to suggest another when it brought that other idea to mind early scientific studies of hypnosis by clark leonard hull and others extended the meaning of these words in a special and technical sense (hull 1933) the original neuro-psychological theory of hypnotic suggestion was based upon the ideo-motor reflex response of william b carpenter and james braid

modern scientific study of hypnosis which follows the pattern of hull's work separates two essential factors trance and suggestion the state of mind induced by trance is said to come about via the process of a hypnotic inductionessentially instructing and suggesting to the subject that they will enter a hypnotic state once a subject enters hypnosis the hypnotist gives suggestions that can produce sought effects commonly used suggestions on measures of suggestibility or susceptibility (or for those with a different theoretical orientation hypnotic talent") include suggestions that one's arm is getting lighter and floating up in the air or that a fly is buzzing around one's head the classic response to an accepted suggestion that one's arm is beginning to float in the air is that the subject perceives the intended effect as happening involuntarily

suggestions however can also have an effect in the absence of a hypnosis these so-called waking suggestions are given in precisely the same way as hypnotic suggestions (i.e. suggestions given within hypnosis) and can produce strong changes in perceptual experience experiments on suggestion in the absence of hypnosis were conducted by early researchers such as hull (1933) more recently researchers such as nicholas spanos and irving kirsch have conducted experiments investigating such non-hypnotic-suggestibility and found a strong correlation between people's responses to suggestion both in- and outside hypnosis
== other forms ==
in addition to the kinds of suggestion typically delivered by researchers interested in hypnosis there are other forms of suggestibility though not all are considered interrelated these include primary and secondary suggestibility (older terms for non-hypnotic and hypnotic suggestibility respectively) hypnotic suggestibility (i.e. the response to suggestion measured within hypnosis) and interrogative suggestibility (yielding to interrogative questions and shifting responses when interrogative pressure is applied see gudjonsson suggestibility scale
metaphors and imagery can be used to deliver suggestion
