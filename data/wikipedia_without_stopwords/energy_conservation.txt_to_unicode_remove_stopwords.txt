energy conservation refers reducing energy consumption using less energy service energy conservation differs efficient energy use refers using less energy constant service example driving less example energy conservation driving amount higher mileage vehicle example energy efficiency energy conservation efficiency energy reduction techniques
even though energy conservation reduces energy services result increased environmental quality national security personal financial security higher savings top sustainable energy hierarchy also lowers energy costs preventing future resource depletion
energy tax
countries employ energy carbon taxes motivate energy users reduce consumption carbon taxes allow consumption shift nuclear power alternatives carry different set environmental side effects limitations meanwhile taxes energy consumption stand reduce energy use across board reducing broader array environmental consequences arising energy production state california employs tiered energy tax whereby every consumer receives baseline energy allowance carries low tax usage increases baseline tax increasing drastically programs aim protect poorer households creating larger tax burden high energy consumers
building design
one primary ways improve energy conservation buildings use energy audit energy audit inspection analysis energy use flows energy conservation building process system reduce amount energy input system without negatively affecting outputs normally accomplished trained professionals part national programs discussed addition recent development smartphone apps enable homeowners complete relativily sophisticated energy audits
building technologies smart meters allow energy users business residential see graphically impact energy use workplace homes advanced realtime energy metering able help people save energy actions
passive solar building design windows walls floors made collect store distribute solar energy form heat winter reject solar heat summer called passive solar design climatic design unlike active solar heating systems doesnt involve use mechanical electrical devices
key designing passive solar building best take advantage local climate elements considered include window placement glazing type thermal insulation thermal mass shading passive solar design techniques applied easily new buildings existing buildings retrofitted
transportation
united states suburban infrastructure evolved age relatively easy access fossil fuels led transportationdependent systems living zoning reforms allow greater urban density well designs walking bicycling greatly reduce energy consumed transportation use telecommuting major corporations significant opportunity conserve energy many americans work service jobs enable work home instead commuting work day
consumer products
consumers often poorly informed savings energy efficient products prominent example energy savings made replacing incandescent light bulbs modern alternatives purchasing light bulbs many consumers opt cheap incandescent bulbs failing take account higher energy costs lower lifespans compared modern compact fluorescent led bulbs although energyefficient alternatives higher upfront cost long lifespan low energy use save consumers considerable amount money price leds also steadily decreasing past five years due improvement semiconductor technology many led bulbs market qualify utility rebates reduce price purchase consumer estimates us department energy state widespread adoption led lighting next years could result billion worth savings united states energy costs
research one must put conserving energy often time consuming costly average consumer cheaper products technology available using todays fossil fuels governments ngos attempting reduce complexity ecolabels make differences energy efficiency easy research shopping
provide kind information support people need invest money time effort energy conservation important understand link peoples topical concerns instance retailers argue bright lighting stimulates purchasing however health studies demonstrated headache stress blood pressure fatigue worker error generally increase common overillumination present many workplace retail settings shown natural daylighting increases productivity levels workers reducing energy consumption
