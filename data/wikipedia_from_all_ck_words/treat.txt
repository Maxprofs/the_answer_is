a valley is a low area between hills often with a river running through it
in geology a valley or dale is a depression that is longer than it is wide the terms u-shaped and v-shaped are descriptive terms of geography to characterize the form of valleys most valleys belong to one of these two main types or a mixture of them (at least) with respect of the cross section of the slopes or hillsides
== valley terminology ==
a valley in its broadest geographic sense is also known as a dale a valley through which a river runs may also be referred to as a vale a small secluded and often wooded valley is known as a dell or in scotland as a glen a wide flat valley through which a river runs is known in scotland as a strath a mountain cove is a small valley closed at one or both ends in the central or southern appalachian mountains which sometimes results from the erosion of a geologic window a small valley surrounded by mountains or ridges is sometimes known as a hollow a deep narrow valley is known as a cwm (also spelled combe or coombe) similar geological structures such as canyons ravines gorges gullies and kloofs are not usually referred to as valleys see also chine a valley formed by erosion is called an erosional valley a valley formed by geologic events such as drop faults or the rise of highlands is called a structural valley

for a comprehensive list of world wide river valleys see river valleys (category)
a valley formed by flowing water or river valley is usually v-shaped the exact shape will depend on the characteristics of the stream flowing through it rivers with steep gradients as in mountain ranges produce steep walls and a bottom shallower slopes may produce broader and gentler valleys however in the lowest stretch of a river where it approaches its base level it begins to deposit sediment and the valley bottom becomes a floodplain
some broad v examples are
north america black canyon of the gunnison national park and others in grand canyon np
europe
austria narrow passages of upper inn valley (inntal) affluents of enns
switzerland napf region zurich oberland engadin
germany affluents to the middle reaches of rhine and mosel
some of the first human complex societies originated in river valleys such as that of the nile tigris-euphrates indus ganges yangtze huang he mississippi and arguably amazon in prehistory the rivers were used as a source of fresh water and food (fish and game) as well as a place to wash and a sewer the proximity of water moderated temperature extremes and provided a source for irrigation stimulating the development of agriculture most of the first civilizations developed from these river valley communities another word for river valley is river phenomenon
== vale ==
in geography a vale is a wide river valley usually with a particularly wide flood plain or flat valley bottom
in southern england vales commonly occur between the escarpment slopes of pairs of chalk formations where the chalk dome has been eroded exposing less resistant underlying rock usually claystone
== glacial valleys ==
there are various forms of valley associated with glaciation that may be referred to as glacial valleys
=== u-shaped valley ===
a valley carved by glaciers is normally u-shaped the valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it when the ice recedes or thaws the valley remains often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice floor gradient does not affect the valley's shape it is the glacier's size that does continuously flowing glaciers especially in the ice age and large-sized glaciers carve wide deep incised valleys
examples of u-shaped valleys are found in every mountainous region that has experienced glaciation usually during the pleistocene ice ages most present u-shaped valleys started as v-shaped before glaciation the glaciers carved it out wider and deeper simultaneously changing the shape this proceeds through the glacial erosion processes of glaciation and abrasion which results in large rocky material (glacial till) being carried in the glacier a material called boulder clay is deposited on the floor of the valley as the ice melts and retreats the valley is left with very steep sides and a wide flat floor a river or stream may remain in the valley this replaces the original stream or river and is known as a misfit stream because it is smaller than one would expect given the size of its valley
other interesting glacially carved valleys include
yosemite valley (usa)
side valleys of the austrian river salzach for their parallel directions and hanging mouths
some scottish glens full with bushes and flowers
that of the st mary river in glacier national park in montana usa
=== tunnel valley ===
a tunnel valley is a large long u-shaped valley originally cut under the glacial ice near the margin of continental ice sheets such as that now covering antarctica and formerly covering portions of all continents during past glacial ages.[1]
a tunnel valley can be up to 100 km (62 mi) long 4 km (2.5 mi) wide and 400 m (1,300 ft) deep (its depth may vary along its length)
tunnel valleys were formed by subglacial erosion by water they served as subglacial drainage pathways carrying large volumes of melt water their cross-sections exhibit steep-sided flanks similar to fjord walls and their flat bottoms are typical of subglacial glacial erosion
=== meltwater valley ===
in northern central europe the scandinavian ice sheet during the various ice ages advanced slightly uphill against the lie of the land as a result its meltwaters flowed parallel to the ice margin to reach the north sea basin forming huge flat valleys known as urstromtler unlike the other forms of glacial valley these were formed by glacial meltwaters
== transition forms and valley shoulders ==
depending on the topography the rock types and the climate a lot of transitional forms between v- u- and plain valleys exist their bottoms can be broad or narrow but characteristic is also the type of valley shoulder the broader a mountain valley the lower its shoulders are located in most cases an important exception are canyons where the shoulder almost is near the top of the valley's slope in the alps e.g the tyrolean inn valley the shoulders are quite low (100200 meters above the bottom) many villages are located here (esp at the sunny side) because the climate is very mild even in winter when the valley's floor is completely filled with fog these villages are in sunshine
in some stress-tectonic regions of the rockies or the alps (e.g salzburg) the side valleys are parallel to each other and additionally they are hanging the brooks flow into the river in form of deep canyons or waterfalls usually this fact is the result of a violent erosion of the former valley shoulders a special genesis we find also at artes and glacial cirques at every scottish glen or a northern fjord
== hanging valleys ==
a hanging valley is a tributary valley that is higher than the main valley they are most commonly associated with u-shaped valleys when a tributary glacier flows into a glacier of larger volume the main glacier erodes a deep u-shaped valley with nearly vertical sides while the tributary glacier with a smaller volume of ice makes a shallower u-shaped valley since the surfaces of the glaciers were originally at the same elevation the shallower valley appears to be hanging above the main valley often waterfalls form at or near the outlet of the upper valley
glaciated terrain is not the only site of hanging streams and valleys hanging valleys are also simply the product of varying rates of erosion of the main valley and the tributary valleys the varying rates of erosion are associated with the composition of the adjacent rocks in the different valley locations the tributary valleys are eroded and deepened by glaciers or erosion at a slower rate than that of the main valley floor thus the difference in the two valleys depth increases over time the tributary valley composed of more resistant rock then hangs over the main valley
== valley floors ==
usually the bottom of a main valley is broad independent of the u or v shape it typically ranges from about one to ten kilometers in width and is commonly filled with mountain sediments the shape of the floor can be rather horizontal similar to a flat cylinder or terraced
side valleys are rather v than u-shaped near the mouth waterfalls are possible if it is a hanging valley the location of the villages depends on the across-valley profile on climate and local traditions and on the danger of avalanches or landslides predominant are places on terraces or alluvial fans if they exist
historic siting of villages within the mainstem valleys however have chiefly considered the potential of flooding
== hollows ==
a hollow (holler) is a small valley or dry stream bed this term is commonly used in new england appalachia ozarks arkansas and missouri to describe such geographic features in rural areas it may be pronounced as holler hollows may be formed by river valleys such as mansfield hollow or they may be relatively dry clefts with a notch-like characteristic in that they have a height of land and consequent water divide in their bases
