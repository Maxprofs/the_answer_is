three main types solubility equilibria
simple dissolution
dissolution dissociation characteristic salts equilibrium constant known case solubility product
dissolution reaction characteristic dissolution weak acids weak bases aqueous media varying ph
case equilibrium constant specified quotient activities equilibrium constant dimensionless activity dimensionless quantity however use activities inconvenient equilibrium constant usually divided quotient activity coefficients become quotient concentrations see equilibrium chemistryequilibrium constant details moreover concentration solvent usually taken constant also subsumed equilibrium constant reasons constant solubility equilibrium dimensions related scale concentrations measured solubility constants defined terms concentrations temperature dependent also may depend solvent composition solvent contains also species derived solute
phase effect
equilibria defined specific crystal phases therefore solubility product expected different depending phase solid example aragonite calcite different solubility products even though chemical identity calcium carbonate nevertheless given conditions likely one phase thermodynamically stable therefore phase enters true equilibrium
particle size effect

dissolution dissociation
ionic compounds normally dissociate constituent ions dissolve water example calcium sulfate

calculation solubility cases requires two simultaneous equilibria considered example
experimental determination
determination solubility fraught difficulties first foremost difficulty establishing system equilibrium chosen temperature precipitation dissolution reactions may extremely slow process slow solvent evaporation may issue supersaturation may occur insoluble substances concentrations solution low difficult determine methods used fall broadly two categories static dynamic
static methods
