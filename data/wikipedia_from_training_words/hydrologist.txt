hydrology is the scientific study of the movement distribution and quality of water on earth and other planets including the hydrologic cycle water resources and environmental watershed sustainability a practitioner of hydrology is a hydrologist working within the fields of earth or environmental science physical geography geology or civil and environmental engineering
hydrology is subdivided into surface water hydrology groundwater hydrology (hydrogeology) and marine hydrology domains of hydrology include hydrometeorology surface hydrology hydrogeology drainage basin management and water quality where water plays the central role
oceanography and meteorology are not included because water is only one of many important aspects within those fields
hydrological research can inform environmental engineering policy and planning
the term hydrology is from greek  hydr water and  logos study
== historyedit ==
hydrology has been a subject of investigation and engineering for millennia for example about 4000 bc the nile was dammed to improve agricultural productivity of previously barren lands mesopotamian towns were protected from flooding with high earthen walls aqueducts were built by the greeks and ancient romans while the history of china shows they built irrigation and flood control works the ancient sinhalese used hydrology to build complex irrigation works in sri lanka also known for invention of the valve pit which allowed construction of large reservoirs anicuts and canals which still function
marcus vitruvius in the first century bc described a philosophical theory of the hydrologic cycle in which precipitation falling in the mountains infiltrated the earth's surface and led to streams and springs in the lowlands with adoption of a more scientific approach leonardo da vinci and bernard palissy independently reached an accurate representation of the hydrologic cycle it was not until the 17th century that hydrologic variables began to be quantified
pioneers of the modern science of hydrology include pierre perrault edme mariotte and edmund halley by measuring rainfall runoff and drainage area perrault showed that rainfall was sufficient to account for flow of the seine marriotte combined velocity and river cross-section measurements to obtain discharge again in the seine halley showed that the evaporation from the mediterranean sea was sufficient to account for the outflow of rivers flowing into the sea
advances in the 18th century included the bernoulli piezometer and bernoulli's equation by daniel bernoulli and the pitot tube by henri pitot the 19th century saw development in groundwater hydrology including darcy's law the dupuit-thiem well formula and hagen-poiseuille's capillary flow equation
rational analyses began to replace empiricism in the 20th century while governmental agencies began their own hydrological research programs of particular importance were leroy sherman's unit hydrograph the infiltration theory of robert e horton and c.v theis's aquifer test/equation describing well hydraulics
since the 1950s hydrology has been approached with a more theoretical basis than in the past facilitated by advances in the physical understanding of hydrological processes and by the advent of computers and especially geographic information systems (gis)

== themesedit ==
the central theme of hydrology is that water circulates throughout the earth through different pathways and at different rates the most vivid image of this is in the evaporation of water from the ocean which forms clouds these clouds drift over the land and produce rain the rainwater flows into lakes rivers or aquifers the water in lakes rivers and aquifers then either evaporates back to the atmosphere or eventually flows back to the ocean completing a cycle water changes its state of being several times throughout this cycle
the areas of research within hydrology concern the movement of water between its various states or within a given state or simply quantifying the amounts in these states in a given region parts of hydrology concern developing methods for directly measuring these flows or amounts of water while others concern modelling these processes either for scientific knowledge or for making prediction in practical applications
=== groundwateredit ===
ground water is water beneath earth's surface often pumped for drinking water groundwater hydrology (hydrogeology) considers quantifying groundwater flow and solute transport problems in describing the saturated zone include the characterization of aquifers in terms of flow direction groundwater pressure and by inference groundwater depth (see aquifer test) measurements here can be made using a piezometer aquifers are also described in terms of hydraulic conductivity storativity and transmisivity there are a number of geophysical methods for characterising aquifers there are also problems in characterising the vadose zone (unsaturated zone)
=== infiltrationedit ===
infiltration is the process by which water enters the soil some of the water is absorbed and the rest percolates down to the water table the infiltration capacity the maximum rate at which the soil can absorb water depends on several factors the layer that is already saturated provides a resistance that is proportional to its thickness while that plus the depth of water above the soil provides the driving force (hydraulic head) dry soil can allow rapid infiltration by capillary action this force diminishes as the soil becomes wet compaction reduces the porosity and the pore sizes surface cover increases capacity by retarding runoff reducing compaction and other processes higher temperatures reduce viscosity increasing infiltration
=== soil moistureedit ===
soil moisture can be measured in various ways by capacitance probe time domain reflectometer or tensiometer other methods include solute sampling and geophysical methods
=== surface water flowedit ===
hydrology considers quantifying surface water flow and solute transport although the treatment of flows in large rivers is sometimes considered as a distinct topic of hydraulics or hydrodynamics surface water flow can include flow both in recognizable river channels and otherwise methods for measuring flow once water has reached a river include the stream gauge (see discharge) and tracer techniques other topics include chemical transport as part of surface water sediment transport and erosion
one of the important areas of hydrology is the interchange between rivers and aquifers groundwater/surface water interactions in streams and aquifers can be complex and the direction of net water flux (into surface water or into the aquifer) may vary spatially along a stream channel and over time at any particular location depending on the relationship between stream stage and groundwater levels
=== precipitation and evaporationedit ===
in some considerations hydrology is thought of as starting at the land-atmosphere boundary and so it is important to have adequate knowledge of both precipitation and evaporation precipitation can be measured in various ways disdrometer for precipitation characteristics at a fine time scale radar for cloud properties rain rate estimation hail and snow detection rain gauge for routine accurate measurements of rain and snowfall satellite rainy area identification rain rate estimation land-cover/land-use soil moisture
evaporation is an important part of the water cycle it is partly affected by humidity which can be measured by a sling psychrometer it is also affected by the presence of snow hail and ice and can relate to dew mist and fog hydrology considers evaporation of various forms from water surfaces as transpiration from plant surfaces in natural and agronomic ecosystems a direct measurement of evaporation can be obtained using symon's evaporation pan
detailed studies of evaporation involve boundary layer considerations as well as momentum heat flux and energy budgets
=== remote sensingedit ===
remote sensing of hydrologic processes can provide information of various types sources include land based sensors airborne sensors and satellite sensors information can include clouds surface moisture vegetation cover
=== water qualityedit ===
in hydrology studies of water quality concern organic and inorganic compounds and both dissolved and sediment material in addition water quality is affected by the interaction of dissolved oxygen with organic material and various chemical transformations that may take place measurements of water quality may involve either in-situ methods in which analyses take place on-site often automatically and laboratory-based analyses and may include microbiological analysis
=== integrating measurement and modellingedit ===
budget analyses
parameter estimation
scaling in time and space
data assimilation
quality control of data see for example double mass analysis
=== predictionedit ===
observations of hydrologic processes are used to make predictions of the future behaviour of hydrologic systems (water flow water quality) one of the major current concerns in hydrologic research is prediction in ungauged basins (pub) i.e in basins where no or only very few data exist
=== statistical hydrologyedit ===
by analyzing the statistical properties of hydrologic records such as rainfall or river flow hydrologists can estimate future hydrologic phenomena when making assessments of how often relatively rare events will occur analyses are made in terms of the return period of such events other quantities of interest include the average flow in a river in a year or by season
these estimates are important for engineers and economists so that proper risk analysis can be performed to influence investment decisions in future infrastructure and to determine the yield reliability characteristics of water supply systems statistical information is utilized to formulate operating rules for large dams forming part of systems which include agricultural industrial and residential demands
=== modelingedit ===
hydrological models are simplified conceptual representations of a part of the hydrologic cycle they are primarily used for hydrological prediction and for understanding hydrological processes within the general field of scientific modeling two major types of hydrological models can be distinguished
models based on data these models are black box systems using mathematical and statistical concepts to link a certain input (for instance rainfall) to the model output (for instance runoff) commonly used techniques are regression transfer functions and system identification the simplest of these models may be linear models but it is common to deploy non-linear components to represent some general aspects of a catchment's response without going deeply into the real physical processes involved an example of such an aspect is the well-known behavior that a catchment will respond much more quickly and strongly when it is already wet than when it is dry
models based on process descriptions these models try to represent the physical processes observed in the real world typically such models contain representations of surface runoff subsurface flow evapotranspiration and channel flow but they can be far more complicated these models are known as deterministic hydrology models deterministic hydrology models can be subdivided into single-event models and continuous simulation models
recent research in hydrological modeling tries to have a more global approach to the understanding of the behavior of hydrologic systems to make better predictions and to face the major challenges in water resources management
=== transportedit ===
water movement is a significant means by which other material such as soil gravel boulders or pollutants are transported from place to place initial input to receiving waters may arise from a point source discharge or a line source or area source such as surface runoff since the 1960s rather complex mathematical models have been developed facilitated by the availability of high speed computers the most common pollutant classes analyzed are nutrients pesticides total dissolved solids and sediment
