history
relative atomic mass atomic weight scale traditionally relative scale without explicit unit first relative atomic mass basis suggested john dalton h despite initial mass h used natural unit relative atomic mass suggested wilhelm ostwald relative atomic mass would best expressed terms units mass oxygen evaluation made prior discovery existence elemental isotopes occurred
discovery isotopic oxygen led divergence relative atomic mass representation isotopically weighted oxygen ie naturally occurring oxygen relative atomic mass given value exactly atomic mass units amu chemistry pure o oxygen given mass value exactly amu physics
divergence values could result errors computations unwieldy chemistry amu based relative atomic mass atomic weight natural oxygen including heavy naturallyoccurring isotopes o o massive physics amu based pure isotopic o
reasons reference standard physics chemistry changed carbon choice carbon made minimise divergence prior literature new current unit referred unified atomic mass unit u given new symbol u replaced deprecated amu connected old oxygenbased system dalton da another name unified atomic mass unit
despite change modern sources often still use old term amu define u mass carbon atom mentioned articles introduction therefore general amu likely refer old oxygen standard unit unless source material originates

terminology
unified atomic mass unit dalton different names unit measure unit names watt newton dalton capitalized english symbol da capitalized introduction name dalton gradual change towards using name preference name unified atomic mass unit
international union pure applied chemistry approved use dalton qualification cgpm given approval
consultative committee units part cipm recommended preference usage dalton unified atomic mass unit shorter works better prefixes
international union pure applied physics endorsed use dalton alternative unified atomic mass unit
th edition formal definition si cipm cataloged dalton alongside unified atomic mass unit nonsi unit whose values si units must obtained experimentally units accepted use si definition also noted dalton often combined si prefixes
international organization standardization published updated versions iso gave mixed messages whether unified atomic mass unit deprecated iso general identified dalton earlier called unified atomic mass unit u iso atomic nuclear physics catalogued alternatives
version oxford university press style guide authors life sciences gave following guidance use systme international dunits si wherever possible dalton da conveniently kda permitted nonsi unit molecular mass mass particular band separating gel time author guidelines journal rapid communications mass spectrometry stated dalton da unit mass normally used molecular weight use da place u become commonplace mass spectrometry literature atomic mass unit abbreviated amu archaic unit
response proposed redefinition kilogram proposed dalton redefined na kg thereby breaking link c would result dalton atomic mass unit slightly different definitions suggestion older unit superseded new dalton

definition mole si base unit accepted cgpm
mole amount substance system contains many elementary entities atoms kilogram carbon symbol mol
mole used elementary entities must specified may atoms molecules ions electrons particles specified groups particles
definition mole also determines value universal constant relates number entities amount substance sample constant called avogadro constant symbol na l value mol entities per mole
