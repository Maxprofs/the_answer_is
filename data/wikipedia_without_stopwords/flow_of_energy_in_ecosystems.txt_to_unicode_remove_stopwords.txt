geology
geology science study solid liquid matter constitutes earth field geology encompasses study composition structure physical properties dynamics history earth materials processes formed moved changed field major academic discipline also important mineral hydrocarbon extraction knowledge mitigation natural hazards geotechnical engineering fields understanding past climates environments
geological evolution
geology area evolves time rock units deposited inserted deformational processes change shapes locations
rock units first emplaced either deposition onto surface intrude overlying rock deposition occur sediments settle onto surface earth later lithify sedimentary rock volcanic material volcanic ash lava flows blanket surface igneous intrusions batholiths laccoliths dikes sills push upwards overlying rock crystallize intrude
initial sequence rocks deposited rock units deformed andor metamorphosed deformation typically occurs result horizontal shortening horizontal extension sidetoside strikeslip motion structural regimes broadly relate convergent boundaries divergent boundaries transform boundaries respectively tectonic plates
historical perspective
earth estimated formed billion years ago solar nebula along sun planets moon formed roughly million years later initially molten outer layer earth cooled resulting solid crust outgassing volcanic activity produced primordial atmosphere condensing water vapor came ice delivered comets produced oceans water sources highly energetic chemistry believed produced selfreplicating molecule around billion years ago
continents formed broke reformed surface earth reshaped hundreds millions years occasionally combining make supercontinent roughly million years ago earliest known supercontinent rodinia began break apart continents later recombined form pannotia broke apart million years ago finally pangaea broke apart million years ago
neoproterozoic era covered much earth glaciers ice sheets hypothesis termed snowball earth particular interest precedes cambrian explosion multicellular life forms began proliferate million years ago
since cambrian explosion five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions last mass extinction occurred million years ago meteorite collision probably triggered extinction nonavian dinosaurs large reptiles spared small animals mammals past million years mammalian life diversified
several million years ago species small african ape gained ability stand upright subsequent advent human life development agriculture civilization allowed humans affect earth rapidly previous life form affecting nature quantity organisms well global climate comparison great oxygenation event produced proliferation algae siderian period required million years culminate
present era classified part mass extinction event holocene extinction event fastest ever occurred e o wilson harvard university predict human destruction biosphere could cause extinction onehalf species next years extent current extinction event still researched debated calculated biologists
atmosphere climate weather
earths atmosphere key factor sustaining ecosystem thin layer gases envelops earth held place gravity air mostly nitrogen oxygen water vapor much smaller amounts carbon dioxide argon etc atmospheric pressure declines steadily altitude ozone layer plays important role depleting amount ultraviolet uv radiation reaches surface dna readily damaged uv light serves protect life surface atmosphere also retains heat night thereby reducing daily temperature extremes
terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively lower part atmosphere serves convective system redistributing heat ocean currents another important factor determining climate particularly major underwater thermohaline circulation distributes heat energy equatorial oceans polar regions currents help moderate differences temperature winter summer temperate zones also without redistributions heat energy ocean currents atmosphere tropics would much hotter polar regions much colder
weather beneficial harmful effects extremes weather tornadoes hurricanes cyclones expend large amounts energy along paths produce devastation surface vegetation evolved dependence seasonal variation weather sudden changes lasting years dramatic effect vegetation animals depend growth food
climate measure longterm trends weather various factors known influence climate including ocean currents surface albedo greenhouse gases variations solar luminosity changes earths orbit based historical records earth known undergone drastic climate changes past including ice ages
climate region depends number factors especially latitude latitudinal band surface similar climatic attributes forms climate region number regions ranging tropical climate equator polar climate northern southern extremes weather also influenced seasons result earths axis tilted relative orbital plane thus given time summer winter one part earth directly exposed rays sun exposure alternates earth revolves orbit given time regardless season northern southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons
weather chaotic system readily modified small changes environment accurate weather forecasting limited days overall two things happening worldwide temperature increasing average regional climates undergoing noticeable changes

ponds
pond body standing water either natural manmade usually smaller lake wide variety manmade bodies water classified ponds including water gardens designed aesthetic ornamentation fish ponds designed commercial fish breeding solar ponds designed store thermal energy ponds lakes distinguished streams via current speed currents streams easily observed ponds lakes possess thermally driven microcurrents moderate wind driven currents features distinguish pond many aquatic terrain features stream pools tide pools
rivers
river natural watercourse usually freshwater flowing toward ocean lake sea another river cases river simply flows ground dries completely reaching another body water small rivers may also called several names including stream creek brook rivulet rill general rule defines called river many names small rivers specific geographic location one example burn scotland northeast england sometimes river said larger creek always case due vagueness language river part hydrological cycle water within river generally collected precipitation surface runoff groundwater recharge springs release stored water natural ice snowpacks ie glaciers
streams
stream flowing body water current confined within bed stream banks united states stream classified watercourse less feet metres wide streams important conduits water cycle instruments groundwater recharge serve corridors fish wildlife migration biological habitat immediate vicinity stream called riparian zone given status ongoing holocene extinction streams play important corridor role connecting fragmented habitats thus conserving biodiversity study streams waterways general involves many branches interdisciplinary natural science engineering including hydrology fluvial geomorphology aquatic ecology fish biology riparian ecology others
ecosystems
ecosystems composed variety abiotic biotic components function interrelated way structure composition determined various environmental factors interrelated variations factors initiate dynamic modifications ecosystem important components soil atmosphere radiation sun water living organisms
central ecosystem concept idea living organisms interact every element local environment eugene odum founder ecology stated unit includes organisms ie community given area interacting physical environment flow energy leads clearly defined trophic structure biotic diversity material cycles ie exchange materials living nonliving parts within system ecosystem within ecosystem species connected dependent upon one another food chain exchange energy matter well environment human ecosystem concept grounded deconstruction humannature dichotomy premise species ecologically integrated well abiotic constituents biotope
smaller unit size called microecosystem example microsystem stone life macroecosystem might involve whole ecoregion drainage basin
wilderness
wilderness generally defined areas significantly modified human activity wilderness areas found preserves estates farms conservation preserves ranches national forests national parks even urban areas along rivers gulches otherwise undeveloped areas wilderness areas protected parks considered important survival certain species ecological studies conservation solitude recreation nature writers believe wilderness areas vital human spirit creativity ecologists consider wilderness areas integral part earths selfsustaining natural ecosystem biosphere may also preserve historic genetic traits provide habitat wild flora fauna may difficult recreate zoos arboretums laboratories
life
although universal agreement definition life scientists generally accept biological manifestation life characterized organization metabolism growth adaptation response stimuli reproduction life may also said simply characteristic state organisms
properties common terrestrial organisms plants animals fungi protists archaea bacteria cellular carbonandwaterbased complex organization metabolism capacity grow respond stimuli reproduce entity properties generally considered life however every definition life considers properties essential humanmade analogs life may also considered life
biosphere part earths outer shell including land surface rocks water air atmosphere within life occurs biotic processes turn alter transform broadest geophysiological point view biosphere global ecological system integrating living beings relationships including interaction elements lithosphere rocks hydrosphere water atmosphere air entire earth contains billion tons trillion pounds kilograms biomass life lives within various environments within biosphere
ninetenths total biomass earth plant life animal life depends heavily existence million species plant animal life identified date estimates actual number existing species range several million well million number individual species life constantly degree flux new species appearing others ceasing exist continual basis total number species rapid decline
evolution
origin life earth well understood known occurred least billion years ago hadean archean eons primordial earth substantially different environment found present life forms possessed basic traits selfreplication inheritable traits life appeared process evolution natural selection resulted development evermore diverse life forms
species unable adapt changing environment competition life forms became extinct however fossil record retains evidence many older species current fossil dna evidence shows existing species trace continual ancestry back first primitive life forms
advent photosynthesis basic forms plant life worldwide allowed suns energy harvested create conditions allowing complex life resultant oxygen accumulated atmosphere gave rise ozone layer incorporation smaller cells within larger ones resulted development yet complex cells called eukaryotes cells within colonies became increasingly specialized resulting true multicellular organisms ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation life colonized surface earth
microbes
first form life develop earth microbes remained form life billion years ago multicellular organisms began appear microorganisms singlecelled organisms generally microscopic smaller human eye see include bacteria fungi archaea protista
life forms found almost every location earth liquid water including earths interior reproduction rapid profuse combination high mutation rate horizontal gene transfer ability makes highly adaptable able survive new environments including outer space form essential part planetary ecosystem however microorganisms pathogenic post health risk organisms
plants animals
originally aristotle divided living things plants generally move fast enough humans notice animals linnaeus system became kingdoms vegetabilia later plantae animalia since become clear plantae originally defined included several unrelated groups fungi several groups algae removed new kingdoms however still often considered plants many contexts bacterial life sometimes included flora classifications use term bacterial flora separately plant flora
among many ways classifying plants regional floras depending purpose study also include fossil flora remnants
plant life previous era people many regions countries take great pride individual arrays characteristic flora vary widely across globe due differences climate terrain
regional floras commonly divided categories native flora agricultural garden flora lastly mentioned intentionally grown cultivated types native flora actually introduced centuries ago people migrating one region continent another become integral part native natural flora place introduced example human interaction nature blur boundary considered nature
another category plant historically carved weeds though term fallen disfavor among botanists formal way categorize useless plants informal use word weeds describe plants deemed worthy elimination illustrative general tendency people societies seek alter shape course nature similarly animals often categorized ways domestic farm animals wild animals pests etc according relationship human life
animals category several characteristics generally set apart living things animals eukaryotic usually multicellular although see myxozoa separates bacteria archaea protists heterotrophic generally digesting food internal chamber separates plants algae also distinguished plants algae fungi lacking cell walls
exceptions notably sponges phylum porifera animals bodies differentiated separate tissues include muscles able contract control locomotion nervous system sends processes signals also typically internal digestive chamber eukaryotic cells possessed animals surrounded characteristic extracellular matrix composed collagen elastic glycoproteins may calcified form structures like shells bones spicules framework upon cells move reorganized development maturation supports complex anatomy required mobility
human interrelationship
although humans comprise minuscule proportion total living biomass earth human effect nature disproportionately large extent human influence boundaries humans regard nature made environments clear cut except extremes even extremes amount natural environment free discernible human influence diminishing increasingly rapid pace
development technology human race allowed greater exploitation natural resources helped alleviate risk natural hazards spite progress however fate human civilization remains closely linked changes environment exists highly complex feedback loop use advanced technology changes environment slowly becoming understood manmade threats earths natural environment include pollution deforestation disasters oil spills humans contributed extinction many plants animals
humans employ nature leisure economic activities acquisition natural resources industrial use remains primary component worlds economic system activities hunting fishing used sustenance leisure often different people agriculture first adopted around th millennium bce ranging food production energy nature influences economic wealth
although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials food employed medicinal properties vegetation healing modern human use plants agriculture clearance large tracts land crop growth led significant reduction amount available forestation wetlands resulting loss habitat many plant animal species well increased erosion
aesthetics beauty
beauty nature historically prevalent theme art books filling large sections libraries bookstores nature depicted celebrated much art photography poetry literature shows strength many people associate nature beauty reasons association exists association consists studied branch philosophy called aesthetics beyond certain basic characteristics many philosophers agree explain seen beautiful opinions virtually endless nature wildness important subjects various eras world history early tradition landscape art began china tang dynasty tradition representing nature became one aims chinese painting significant influence asian art
although natural wonders celebrated psalms book job wilderness portrayals art became prevalent especially works romantic movement british artists john constable j m w turner turned attention capturing beauty natural world paintings paintings primarily religious scenes human beings william wordsworths poetry described wonder natural world formerly viewed threatening place increasingly valuing nature became aspect western culture artistic movement also coincided transcendentalist movement western world common classical idea beautiful art involves word mimesis imitation nature also realm ideas beauty nature perfect implied perfect mathematical forms generally patterns nature david rothenburg writes beautiful root science goal art highest possibility humanity ever hope see
value nature
book women counted marilyn waring points value nature measured human economic activity leading destruction nature
matter energy
fields science see nature matter motion obeying certain laws nature science seeks understand reason fundamental science generally understood physics name still recognizable meaning study nature
matter commonly defined substance physical objects composed constitutes observable universe visible components universe believed compose percent total mass remainder believed consist percent cold dark matter percent dark energy exact nature components still unknown intensive investigation physicists
behavior matter energy throughout observable universe appears follow welldefined physical laws laws employed produce cosmological models successfully explain structure evolution universe observe mathematical expressions laws physics employ set twenty physical constants appear static across observable universe values constants carefully measured reason specific values remains mystery
beyond earth
outer space also simply called space refers relatively empty regions universe outside atmospheres celestial bodies outer space used distinguish airspace terrestrial locations discrete boundary earths atmosphere space atmosphere gradually attenuates increasing altitude outer space within solar system called interplanetary space passes interstellar space known heliopause
outer space sparsely filled several dozen types organic molecules discovered date microwave spectroscopy blackbody radiation left big bang origin universe cosmic rays include ionized atomic nuclei various subatomic particles also gas plasma dust small meteors additionally signs human life outer space today material left previous manned unmanned launches potential hazard spacecraft debris reenters atmosphere periodically
although earth body within solar system known support life evidence suggests distant past planet mars possessed bodies liquid water surface brief period mars history may also capable forming life present though water remaining mars frozen life exists mars likely located underground liquid water still exist
conditions terrestrial planets mercury venus appear harsh support life know conjectured europa fourthlargest moon jupiter may possess subsurface ocean liquid water could potentially host life
astronomers started discover extrasolar earth analogs planets lie habitable zone space surrounding star therefore could possibly host life know
