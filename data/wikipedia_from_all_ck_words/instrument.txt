in ancient greece the symposium (greek symposion from sympinein to drink together") was a drinking party literary works that describe or take place at a symposium include two socratic dialogues plato's symposium and xenophon's symposium as well as a number of greek poems such as the elegies of theognis of megara symposia are depicted in greek and etruscan art that shows similar scenes
the equivalent in roman society is the latin convivium
== setting and social occasion ==
the greek symposium was a key hellenic social institution it was a forum for men of respected families to debate plot boast or simply to revel with others they were frequently held to celebrate the introduction of young men into aristocratic society symposia were also held by aristocrats to celebrate other special occasions such as victories in athletic and poetic contests they were a source of pride for them
symposia were usually held in the andrn () the men's quarters of the household the participants or symposiasts would recline on pillowed couches arrayed against the three walls of the room away from the door due to space limitations the couches would number between seven and nine limiting the total number of participants to somewhere between fourteen and twenty seven (oswyn murray gives a figure of between seven and fifteen couches and reckons fourteen to thirty participants a standard size for a drinking group") if any young men took part they did not recline but sat up however in macedonian symposia the focus was not only on drinking but hunting and young men were allowed to recline only after they had killed their first wild boar
food and wine were served entertainment was provided and depending on the occasion could include games songs flute-girls or boys slaves performing various acts and hired entertainment
symposia often were held for specific occasions the most famous symposium of all described in plato's dialogue of that name (and rather differently in xenophon's) was hosted by the poet agathon on the occasion of his first victory at the theater contest of the 416 bc dionysia according to plato's account the celebration was upstaged by the unexpected entrance of the toast of the town the young alcibiades dropping in drunken and nearly naked having just left another symposium
the men apart of the symposium would discuss a multitude of topicsfrom philosophy to love and the differences between genders
== drinking ==
a symposium would be overseen by a symposiarch who would decide how strong the wine for the evening would be depending on whether serious discussions or merely sensual indulgence were in the offing the greeks and romans customarily served their wine mixed with water as the drinking of pure wine was considered a habit of uncivilized peoples however there were major differences between the roman and greek symposiums a roman symposium served wine before with and after food was served and women were allowed to join in a greek symposium wine was only drunk after dinner and women were not allowed to attend the wine was drawn from a krater a large jar designed to be carried by two men and served from pitchers (oenochoe) certain formalities were observed most important among which were libations the pouring of a small amount of wine in honour of various deities or the mourned dead
in a fragment from his c 375 bc play semele or dionysus eubulus has the god of wine dionysos describe proper and improper drinking
for sensible men i prepare only three kraters one for health (which they drink first) the second for love and pleasure and the third for sleep after the third one is drained wise men go home the fourth krater is not mine any more - it belongs to bad behaviour the fifth is for shouting the sixth is for rudeness and insults the seventh is for fights the eighth is for breaking the furniture the ninth is for depression the tenth is for madness and unconsciousness
in keeping with the greek virtue of moderation the symposiarch should have prevented festivities from getting out of hand but greek literature and art often indicate that the third-krater limit was not observed
== pottery ==
symposiums are often featured on attic pottery and richard neer has argued that the chief function of attic pottery was for use in the symposium
== entertainments ==
poetry and music were central to the pleasures of the symposium although free women of status did not attend symposia high-class female prostitutes (hetairai) and entertainers were hired to perform consort and converse with the guests among the instruments women might play was the aulos a greek woodwind instrument sometimes compared to an oboe when string instruments were played the barbiton was the traditional instrument slaves and boys also provided service and entertainment
the guests also participated actively in competitive entertainments a game sometimes played at symposia was kottabos in which players swirled the dregs of their wine in a kylix a platter-like stemmed drinking vessel and flung them at a target another feature of the symposia were skolia drinking songs of a patriotic or bawdy nature performed competitively with one symposiast reciting the first part of a song and another expected to improvise the end of it symposiasts might also compete in rhetorical contests for which reason the word symposium has come to refer in english to any event where multiple speeches are made
== etruscan and roman drinking parties ==
etruscan art shows scenes of banqueting that recall aspects of the greek symposia however one major difference is that women of status participated more fully in this as in other realms of etruscan society as with many other greek customs the aesthetic framework of the symposium was adopted by the romans under the name of comissatio these revels also involved the drinking of assigned quantities of wine and the oversight of a master of the ceremonies appointed for the occasion from among the guests another roman version of the symposium was the convivium
