structureedit
glands organs synthesizes substance hormones release bloodstream endocrine gland cavities inside body outer surface exocrine gland numerous glands exist throughout human body
developmentedit
every gland formed ingrowth epithelial surface ingrowth may beginning possess tubular structure instances glands may start solid column cells subsequently becomes tubulated
growth proceeds column cells may divide give offshoots case compound gland formed many glands number branches limited others salivary pancreas large structure finally formed repeated growth subdivision rule branches unite one another one instance liver occur reticulated compound gland produced compound glands typical secretory epithelium found forming terminal portion branch uniting portions form ducts lined less modified type epithelial cell
glands classified according shape
gland retains shape tube throughout termed tubular gland
second main variety gland secretory portion enlarged lumen variously increased size termed alveolar saccular glands
functionedit
glands divided based function two groups
endocrine glandsedit
endocrine glands secrete substances circulate blood stream glands secrete products basal lamina blood stream lack duct system glands often secrete hormones play important role maintaining homeostasis pineal gland thymus gland pituitary gland thyroid gland two adrenal glands endocrine glands
exocrine glandsedit
exocrine glands secrete products duct onto outer surface body skin human gastrointestinal tract secretion directly onto apical surface glands group divided three groups
apocrine glands portion secreting cells body lost secretion apocrine gland often used refer apocrine sweat glands however thought apocrine sweat glands may true apocrine glands may use apocrine method secretion eg mammery gland sweat gland arm pit pubic region skin around anus lips nipples
holocrine glands entire cell disintegrates secrete substances eg sebaceous glandssebaceous meibomiun zeis gland
merocrine glands cells secrete substances exocytosis eg mucous serous glands also called eccrine eg max sweat gland humans goblet cells salivary gland tear gland intestinal glands
type secretory product exocrine glands may also one three categories
serous glands secrete watery fluid like often proteinrich producteg sweat gland
mucous glands secrete viscous product rich carbohydrates eg glycoproteinsgoblet cell
sebaceous glands secrete lipid product glands also known oil glands pancreas gastric gland
