davissongermer experiment physics experiment conducted american physicists clinton davisson lester germer years confirmed de broglie hypothesis hypothesis advanced louis de broglie says particles matter electrons wave like properties experiment played major role verifying de broglie hypothesis demonstrated waveparticle duality also important historical development establishment quantum mechanics schrdinger equation
history overview
according maxwells equations late th century light thought consist waves electromagnetic fields matter thought consist localized particles however challenged albert einsteins paper photoelectric effect described light discrete localized quanta energy called photons won nobel prize physics louis de broglie presented thesis concerning waveparticle duality theory proposed idea matter displays waveparticle duality photons according de broglie matter radiation alike energy particle related frequency associated wave planck relation
momentum particle related wavelength known de broglie relation

early experiments
davisson began work study electron bombardment secondary electron emissions series experiments continued
davisson germers actual objective study surface piece nickel directing beam electrons surface observing many electrons bounced various angles expected small size electrons even smoothest crystal surface would rough thus electron beam would experience diffuse reflection
experiment consisted firing electron beam electron gun directed piece nickel crystal normal incidence ie perpendicular surface crystal experiment included electron gun consisting heated filament released thermally excited electrons accelerated potential difference giving certain amount kinetic energy towards nickel crystal avoid collisions electrons molecules way towards surface experiment conducted vacuum chamber measure number electrons scattered different angles faraday cup electron detector could moved arc path crystal used detector designed accept elastically scattered electrons
experiment accident occurred air entered chamber producing oxide film nickel surface remove oxide davisson germer heated specimen high temperature oven knowing affected formerly polycrystalline structure nickel form large single crystal areas crystal planes continuous width electron beam
started experiment electrons hit surface scattered atoms originated crystal planes inside nickel crystal
generated diffraction pattern unexpected peaks

questions still needed answered experimentation continued
varying applied voltage electron gun maximum intensity electrons diffracted atomic surface found different angles highest intensity observed angle voltage v giving electrons kinetic energy ev
