a genetic predisposition is a genetic characteristic which influences the possible phenotypic development of an individual organism within a species or population under the influence of environmental conditions in medicine genetic susceptibility to a disease refers to a genetic predisposition to a health problem which may eventually be triggered by particular environmental or lifestyle factors such as tobacco smoking or diet genetic testing is able to identify individuals who are genetically predisposed to certain diseases

predisposition is the capacity we are born with to learn things such as language and concept of self negative environmental influences may block the predisposition (ability) we have to do some things behaviors displayed by animals can be influenced by genetic predispositions genetic predisposition towards certain human behaviors is scientifically investigated by attempts to identify patterns of human behavior that seem to be invariant over long periods of time and in very different cultures
for example philosopher daniel dennett has proposed that humans are genetically predisposed to have a theory of mind because there has been evolutionary selection for the human ability to adopt the intentional stance.[1] the intentional stance is a useful behavioral strategy by which humans assume that others have minds like their own this assumption allows you to predict the behavior of others based on personal knowledge of what you would do
