drug resistance is the reduction in effectiveness of a drug such as an antimicrobial anthelmintic or an antineoplastic in curing a disease or condition when the drug is not intended to kill or inhibit a pathogen then the term is equivalent to dosage failure or drug tolerance more commonly the term is used in the context of resistance that pathogens have acquired that is resistance has evolved antimicrobial resistance and antineoplastic resistance challenge clinical care and drive research when an organism is resistant to more than one drug it is said to be multidrug-resistant even the immune system of an organism is in essence a drug delivery system albeit endogenous and faces the same arms race problems as external drug delivery
the development of antibiotic resistance in particular stems from the drugs targeting only specific bacterial molecules (almost always proteins) because the drug is so specific any mutation in these molecules will interfere with or negate its destructive effect resulting in antibiotic resistance
bacteria are capable of not only altering the enzyme targeted by antibiotics but also by the use of enzymes to modify the antibiotic itself and thus neutralise it examples of target-altering pathogens are staphylococcus aureus vancomycin-resistant enterococci and macrolide-resistant streptococcus while examples of antibiotic-modifying microbes are pseudomonas aeruginosa and aminoglycoside-resistant acinetobacter baumannii
in short the lack of concerted effort by governments and the pharmaceutical industry together with the innate capacity of microbes to develop resistance at a rate that outpaces development of new drugs suggests that existing strategies for developing viable long-term anti-microbial therapies are ultimately doomed to failure without alternative strategies the acquisition of drug resistance by pathogenic microorganisms looms as possibly one of the most significant public health threats facing humanity in the 21st century
resistance to chemicals is only one aspect of the problem another being resistance to physical factors such as temperature pressure sound radiation and magnetism and not discussed in this article but found at physical factors affecting microbial life
== introductionedit ==
drug toxin or chemical resistance is a consequence of evolution and is a response to pressures imposed on any living organism individual organisms vary in their sensitivity to the drug used and some with greater fitness may be capable of surviving drug treatment drug-resistant traits are accordingly inherited by subsequent offspring resulting in a population that is more drug-resistant unless the drug used makes sexual reproduction or cell-division or horizontal gene transfer impossible in the entire target population resistance to the drug will inevitably follow this can be seen in cancerous tumors where some cells may develop resistance to the drugs used in chemotherapy chemotherapy causes fibroblasts near tumors to produce large amounts of the protein wnt16b this protein stimulates the growth of cancer cells which are drug-resistant malaria in 2012 has become a resurgent threat in south east asia and sub-saharan africa and drug-resistant strains of plasmodium falciparum are posing massive problems for health authorities leprosy has shown an increasing resistance to dapsone
a rapid process of sharing resistance exists among single-celled organisms and is termed horizontal gene transfer in which there is a direct exchange of genes particularly in the biofilm state a similar asexual method is used by fungi and is called parasexuality examples of drug-resistant strains are to be found in microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses parasites both endo- and ecto- plants fungi arthropods mammals birds reptiles fish and amphibians
in the domestic environment drug-resistant strains of organism may arise from seemingly safe activities such as the use of bleach tooth-brushing and mouthwashing the use of antibiotics disinfectants and detergents shampoos and soaps particularly antibacterial soaps hand-washing surface sprays application of deodorants sunblocks and any cosmetic or health-care product insecticides and dips the chemicals contained in these preparations besides harming beneficial organisms may intentionally or inadvertently target organisms that have the potential to develop resistance
drug resistance develops naturally but careless practices in drug supply and use are hastening it unnecessarily. - center for global development
the overuse of antibacterial cleaning products in the home may be producing strains of multi-antibiotic-resistant bacteria. - better health channel - australian government
the use and misuse of antimicrobials in human medicine and animal husbandry over the past 70 years has led to a relentless rise in the number and types of microorganisms resistant to these medicines - leading to death increased suffering and disability and higher healthcare costs. - world health organisation 2010
deaths from acute respiratory infections diarrhoeal diseases measles aids malaria and tuberculosis account for more than 85% of the mortality from infection worldwide resistance to first-line drugs in most of the pathogens causing these diseases ranges from zero to almost 100% in some instances resistance to second- and thirdline agents is seriously compromising treatment outcome added to this is the significant global burden of resistant hospital-acquired infections the emerging problems of antiviral resistance and the increasing problems of drug resistance in the neglected parasitic diseases of poor and marginalized populations. - who global strategy for containment of antimicrobial resistance 2010
== mechanismsedit ==
the four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are
drug inactivation or modification e.g. enzymatic deactivation of penicillin g in some penicillin-resistant bacteria through the production of -lactamases
alteration of target site e.g. alteration of pbp the binding target site of penicillins in mrsa and other penicillin-resistant bacteria
alteration of metabolic pathway e.g. some sulfonamide-resistant bacteria do not require para-aminobenzoic acid (paba) an important precursor for the synthesis of folic acid and nucleic acids in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides instead like mammalian cells they turn to utilizing preformed folic acid
reduced drug accumulation by decreasing drug permeability and/or increasing active efflux (pumping out) of the drugs across the cell surface
== metabolic priceedit ==
biological cost or metabolic price is a measure of the increased energy metabolism required to achieve a function
drug resistance has a high metabolic price in pathogens for which this concept is relevant (bacteria endoparasites and tumor cells.) in viruses an equivalent cost is genomic complexity
== treatmentedit ==
the chances of drug resistance can sometimes be minimized by using multiple drugs simultaneously this works because individual mutations can be independent and may tackle only one drug at a time if the individuals are still killed by the other drugs then the mutations cannot persist this was used successfully in tuberculosis however cross resistance where mutations confer resistance to two or more treatments can be problematic
for antibiotic resistance which represents a widespread problem nowadays drugs designed to block the mechanisms of bacterial antibiotic resistance are used for example bacterial resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillins and cephalosporins) can be circumvented by using antibiotics such as nafcillin that are not susceptible to destruction by certain beta-lactamases (the group of enzymes responsible for breaking down beta-lactams) beta-lactam bacterial resistance can also be dealt with by administering beta-lactam antibiotics with drugs that block beta-lactamases such as clavulanic acid so that the antibiotics can work without getting destroyed by the bacteria first recently researchers have recognized the need for new drugs that inhibit bacterial efflux pumps which cause resistance to multiple antibiotics such as beta-lactams quinolones chloramphenicol and trimethoprim by sending molecules of those antibiotics out of the bacterial cell sometimes a combination of different classes of antibiotics may be used synergistically that is they work together to effectively fight bacteria that may be resistant to one of the antibiotics alone
destruction of the resistant bacteria can also be achieved by phage therapy in which a specific bacteriophage (virus that kills bacteria) is used
there is research being done using antimicrobial peptides in the future there is a possibility that they might replace novel antibiotics
