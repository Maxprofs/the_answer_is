a definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word phrase or other set of symbols) definitions can be classified into two large categories intensional definitions (which try to give the essence of a term) and extensional definitions (which list every single object that a term describes) a term may have many different senses and multiple meanings and thus require multiple definitions
in mathematics a definition is used to give a precise meaning to a new term instead of describing a pre-existing term definitions and axioms are the basis on which all of mathematics is constructed
== intensional definitions vs extensional definitions ==
an intensional definition also called a connotative definition specifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for a thing being a member of a specific set any definition that attempts to set out the essence of something such as that by genus and differentia is an intensional definition
an extensional definition also called a denotative definition of a concept or term specifies its extension it is a list naming every object that is a member of a specific set
thus the seven deadly sins can be defined intensionally as those singled out by pope gregory i as particularly destructive of the life of grace and charity within a person thus creating the threat of eternal damnation an extensional definition would be the list of wrath greed sloth pride lust envy and gluttony in contrast while an intensional definition of prime minister might be the most senior minister of a cabinet in the executive branch of government in a parliamentary system an extensional definition is not possible since it is not known who future prime ministers will be
=== classes of intensional definitions ===
a genusdifferentia definition is a type of intensional definition that takes a large category (the genus) and narrows it down to a smaller category by a distinguishing characteristic (i.e the differentia)
more formally a genus-differentia definition consists of
a genus (or family) an existing definition that serves as a portion of the new definition all definitions with the same genus are considered members of that genus
the differentia the portion of the new definition that is not provided by the genus
for example consider the following genus-differentia definitions
a triangle a plane figure that has three straight bounding sides
a quadrilateral a plane figure that has four straight bounding sides
those definitions can be expressed as a genus ("a plane figure and two differentiae ("that has three straight bounding sides and that has four straight bounding sides respectively)
it is possible to have two different genus-differentia definitions that describe the same term especially when the term describes the overlap of two large categories for instance both of these genus-differentia definitions of square are equally acceptable
a square a rectangle that is a rhombus
a square a rhombus that is a rectangle
thus a square is a member of both the genus rectangle and the genus rhombus
=== classes of extensional definitions ===
one important form of the extensional definition is ostensive definition this gives the meaning of a term by pointing in the case of an individual to the thing itself or in the case of a class to examples of the right kind so one can explain who alice (an individual) is by pointing her out to another or what a rabbit (a class) is by pointing at several and expecting another to understand the process of ostensive definition itself was critically appraised by ludwig wittgenstein
an enumerative definition of a concept or term is an extensional definition that gives an explicit and exhaustive listing of all the objects that fall under the concept or term in question enumerative definitions are only possible for finite sets and only practical for relatively small sets
=== divisio and partitio ===
divisio and partitio are classical terms for definitions a partitio is simply an intensional definition a divisio is not an extensional definition but an exhaustive list of subsets of a set in the sense that every member of the divided set is a member of one of the subsets an extreme form of divisio lists all sets whose only member is a member of the divided set the difference between this and an extensional definition is that extensional definitions list members and not subsets
=== nominal definitions vs real definitions ===
in classical thought a definition was taken to be a statement of the essence of a thing aristotle had it that an object's essential attributes form its essential nature and that a definition of the object must include these essential attributes
the idea that a definition should state the essence of a thing led to the distinction between nominal and real essence originating with aristotle in a passage from the posterior analytics he says that the meaning of a made-up name can be known (he gives the example goat stag") without knowing what he calls the essential nature of the thing that the name would denote if there were such a thing this led medieval logicians to distinguish between what they called the quid nominis or whatness of the name and the underlying nature common to all the things it names which they called the quid rei or whatness of the thing (early modern philosophers like locke used the corresponding english terms nominal essence and real essence") the name hobbit for example is perfectly meaningful it has a quid nominis but one could not know the real nature of hobbits even if there were such things and so the real nature or quid rei of hobbits cannot be known by contrast the name man denotes real things (men) that have a certain quid rei the meaning of a name is distinct from the nature that thing must have in order that the name apply to it
this leads to a corresponding distinction between nominal and real definitions a nominal definition is the definition explaining what a word means i.e which says what the nominal essence is and is definition in the classical sense as given above a real definition by contrast is one expressing the real nature or quid rei of the thing
this preoccupation with essence dissipated in much of modern philosophy analytic philosophy in particular is critical of attempts to elucidate the essence of a thing russell described it as a hopelessly muddle-headed notion
more recently kripke's formalisation of possible world semantics in modal logic led to a new approach to essentialism insofar as the essential properties of a thing are necessary to it they are those things it possesses in all possible worlds kripke refers to names used in this way as rigid designators
== terms with multiple definitions ==
=== homonyms ===
a homonym is in the strict sense one of a group of words that share the same spelling and pronunciation but have different meanings thus homonyms are simultaneously homographs (words that share the same spelling regardless of their pronunciation) and homophones (words that share the same pronunciation regardless of their spelling) the state of being a homonym is called homonymy examples of homonyms are the pair stalk (part of a plant) and stalk (follow/harass a person) and the pair left (past tense of leave) and left (opposite of right) a distinction is sometimes made between true homonyms which are unrelated in origin such as skate (glide on ice) and skate (the fish) and polysemous homonyms or polysemes which have a shared origin such as mouth (of a river) and mouth (of an animal)
=== polysemes ===
polysemy is the capacity for a sign (such as a word phrase or symbol) to have multiple meanings (that is multiple semes or sememes and thus multiple senses) usually related by contiguity of meaning within a semantic field it is thus usually regarded as distinct from homonymy in which the multiple meanings of a word may be unconnected or unrelated
== in logic and mathematics ==
in mathematics definitions are generally not used to describe existing terms but to give meaning to a new term the meaning of a mathematical statement changes if definitions change the precise meaning of a term given by a mathematical definition is often different than the english definition of the word used which can lead to confusion for students who do not pay close attention to the definitions given
=== classification of mathematical definitions ===
authors have used different terms to classify definitions used in formal languages like mathematics norman swartz classifies a definition as stipulative if it is intended to guide a specific discussion a stipulative definition might be considered a temporary working definition and can only be disproved by showing a logical contradiction in contrast a descriptive definition can be shown to be right or wrong with reference to general usage
swartz defines a precising definition as one that extends the descriptive dictionary definition (lexical definition) for a specific purpose by including additional criteria a precising definition narrows the set of things that meet the definition
c.l stevenson has identified persuasive definition as a form of stipulative definition which purports to state the true or commonly accepted meaning of a term while in reality stipulating an altered use (perhaps as an argument for some specific belief) stevenson has also noted that some definitions are legal or coercive their object is to create or alter rights duties or crimes
=== recursive definitions ===
a recursive definition sometimes also called an inductive definition is one that defines a word in terms of itself so to speak albeit in a useful way normally this consists of three steps
at least one thing is stated to be a member of the set being defined this is sometimes called a base set
all things bearing a certain relation to other members of the set are also to count as members of the set it is this step that makes the definition recursive
all other things are excluded from the set
for instance we could define a natural number as follows (after peano)
0 is a natural number
each natural number has a unique successor such that
the successor of a natural number is also a natural number
distinct natural numbers have distinct successors
no natural number is succeeded by 0
nothing else is a natural number
so 0 will have exactly one successor which for convenience can be called 1 in turn 1 will have exactly one successor which could be called 2 and so on notice that the second condition in the definition itself refers to natural numbers and hence involves self-reference although this sort of definition involves a form of circularity it is not vicious and the definition has been quite successful
in the same way we can define ancestor as follows
a parent is an ancestor
a parent of an ancestor is an ancestor
nothing else is an ancestor
or simply an ancestor is a parent or a parent of an ancestor
== in medicine ==
in medical dictionaries definitions should to the greatest extent possible be
simple and easy to understand preferably even by the general public
useful clinically or in related areas where the definition will be used
specific that is by reading the definition only it should ideally not be possible to refer to any other entity than the definiendum
measurable
reflecting current scientific knowledge
== issues with definitions ==
=== fallacies of definition ===
certain rules have traditionally been given for definitions (in particular genus-differentia definitions)
a definition must set out the essential attributes of the thing defined
definitions should avoid circularity to define a horse as a member of the species equus would convey no information whatsoever for this reason locking adds that a definition of a term must not consist of terms which are synonymous with it this would be a circular definition a circulus in definiendo note however that it is acceptable to define two relative terms in respect of each other clearly we cannot define antecedent without using the term consequent nor conversely
the definition must not be too wide or too narrow it must be applicable to everything to which the defined term applies (i.e not miss anything out) and to nothing else (i.e not include any things to which the defined term would not truly apply)
the definition must not be obscure the purpose of a definition is to explain the meaning of a term which may be obscure or difficult by the use of terms that are commonly understood and whose meaning is clear the violation of this rule is known by the latin term obscurum per obscurius however sometimes scientific and philosophical terms are difficult to define without obscurity (see the definition of free will in wikipedia for instance)
a definition should not be negative where it can be positive we should not define wisdom as the absence of folly or a healthy thing as whatever is not sick sometimes this is unavoidable however one cannot define a point except as something with no parts nor blindness except as the absence of sight in a creature that is normally sighted
=== limitations of definition ===
given that a natural language such as english contains at any given time a finite number of words any comprehensive list of definitions must either be circular or rely upon primitive notions if every term of every definiens must itself be defined where at last should we stop? a dictionary for instance insofar as it is a comprehensive list of lexical definitions must resort to circularity
many philosophers have chosen instead to leave some terms undefined the scholastic philosophers claimed that the highest genera (the so-called ten generalissima) cannot be defined since a higher genus cannot be assigned under which they may fall thus being unity and similar concepts cannot be defined locke supposes in an essay concerning human understanding that the names of simple concepts do not admit of any definition more recently bertrand russell sought to develop a formal language based on logical atoms other philosophers notably wittgenstein rejected the need for any undefined simples wittgenstein pointed out in his philosophical investigations that what counts as a simple in one circumstance might not do so in another he rejected the very idea that every explanation of the meaning of a term needed itself to be explained as though an explanation hung in the air unless supported by another one claiming instead that explanation of a term is only needed to avoid misunderstanding
locke and mill also argued that individuals cannot be defined names are learned by connecting an idea with a sound so that speaker and hearer have the same idea when the same word is used this is not possible when no one else is acquainted with the particular thing that has fallen under our notice russell offered his theory of descriptions in part as a way of defining a proper name the definition being given by a definite description that picks out exactly one individual saul kripke pointed to difficulties with this approach especially in relation to modality in his book naming and necessity
there is a presumption in the classic example of a definition that the definiens can be stated wittgenstein argued that for some terms this is not the case the examples he used include game number and family in such cases he argued there is no fixed boundary that can be used to provide a definition rather the items are grouped together because of a family resemblance for terms such as these it is not possible and indeed not necessary to state a definition rather one simply comes to understand the use of the term
