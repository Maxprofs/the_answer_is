emergence industrial societies
technological advances several millennia gave humans increasing control environment western industrial revolution th th centuries tapped vast growth potential energy fossil fuels coal used power ever efficient engines later generate electricity modern sanitation systems advances medicine protected large populations disease conditions led human population explosion unprecedented industrial technological scientific growth continued day marking commencement period global human influence known anthropocene global population doubled around million billion people

early th century
th century industrial revolution led exponential increase human consumption resources increase health wealth population perceived simple path progress however economists began developing models nonrenewable resource management see hotellings rule sustainability welfare economy uses nonrenewable resources hartwicks rule
ecology gained general acceptance scientific discipline many concepts vital sustainability explored included interconnectedness living systems single living planetary system biosphere importance natural cycles water nutrients chemicals materials waste passage energy trophic levels living systems
mid th century environmentalism
following deprivations great depression world war ii developed world entered new period escalating growth posts great acceleration surge human enterprise emphatically stamped humanity global geophysical force gathering environmental movement pointed environmental costs associated many material benefits enjoyed innovations technology including plastics synthetic chemicals nuclear energy increasing use fossil fuels transforming society modern industrial agriculturethe green revolution based development synthetic fertilizers herbicides pesticides devastating consequences rural wildlife documented american marine biologist naturalist environmentalist rachel carson silent spring
american geoscientist m king hubberts peak oil theory predicted inevitable peak oil production first united states successive regions world global peak expected thereafter environmentalisms concern pollution population explosion consumerism depletion finite resources found expression small beautiful british economist e f schumacher limits growth published global think tank club rome
late th century
environmental problems becoming global scale energy crises demonstrated extent global community become dependent nonrenewable resource president carter state union address called americans conserve energy eliminate waste make indeed year energy conservation developed world considering problems unchecked development developing countries faced continued poverty deprivation regarded development essential raise living standards peoples international union conservation nature published influential world conservation strategy followed world charter nature drew attention decline worlds ecosystems

st century global awareness
