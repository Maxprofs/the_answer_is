nonvascular plants plants without vascular system xylem phloem although nonvascular plants lack particular tissues many possess simpler tissues specialized internal transport water
nonvascular plants wide variety specialized tissue types leafy liverworts structures look like leaves true leaves single sheets cells cuticle stomata internal air spaces xylem phloem consequently unable control water loss tissues said poikilohydric
land plants life cycle alternation generations diploid sporophyte haploid gametophyte nonvascular land plants gametophyte generation dominant plants sporophytes grow dependent gametophytes taking water mineral nutrients provision photosynthate products photosynthesis
nonvascular plants include two distantly related groups
bryophytes bryophyta mosses marchantiophyta liverworts anthocerotophyta hornworts groups primary plants haploid gametophytes diploid portion attached sporophyte consisting stalk sporangium plants lack lignified waterconducting tissues cant become tall vascular plants
algae especially green algae recent studies demonstrated algae actually consist several unrelated groups turns common features living water photosynthesis misleading indicators close relationship groups algae included archaeplastida still considered relatives land plants
groups sometimes referred lower plants referring status earliest plant groups evolve usage imprecise since groups polyphyletic may used include vascular cryptogams ferns fern allies reproduce using spores nonvascular plants often among first species move new inhospitable territories along prokaryotes protists thus function pioneer species
