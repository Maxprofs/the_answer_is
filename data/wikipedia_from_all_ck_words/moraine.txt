a moraine is any glacially formed accumulation of unconsolidated glacial debris (soil and rock) that occurs in currently glaciated and formerly glaciated regions on earth (i.e a past glacial maximum) through geomorphological processes
== characteristics ==
moraines may be composed of debris ranging in size from silt-sized glacial flour to large boulders the debris is typically sub-angular to rounded in shape moraines may be on the glaciers surface or deposited as piles or sheets of debris where the glacier has melted moraines may also occur when glacier- or iceberg-transported rocks fall into a body of water as the ice melts
=== formation ===
debris could have been scraped off a valley floor as a glacier advanced or may have fallen off the valley walls as a result of frost wedging or landslide when melting
== types of moraines ==
moraines can be classified either by origin location with respect to a glacier or former glacier or by shape the first approach is suitable for moraines associated with contemporary glaciersbut more difficult to apply to old moraines which are defined by their particular morphology since their origin is debated some moraine types are known only from ancient glaciers while medial moraines of valley glaciers are poorly preserved and difficult to distinguish after the retreat or melting of the glacier
=== lateral moraines ===
lateral moraines are parallel ridges of debris deposited along the sides of a glacier the unconsolidated debris can be deposited on top of the glacier by frost shattering of the valley walls and/or from tributary streams flowing into the valley the till is carried along the glacial margin until the glacier melts because lateral moraines are deposited on top of the glacier they do not experience the postglacial erosion of the valley floor and therefore as the glacier melts lateral moraines are usually preserved as high ridges
lateral moraines stand high because they protect the ice under them from the elements causing it to melt or sublime less than the uncovered parts of the glacier multiple lateral moraines may develop as the glacier advances and retreats
=== ground moraines ===
ground moraines are till-covered areas with irregular topography and no ridges often forming gently rolling hills or plains they are accumulated at the base of the ice as lodgment till but may also be deposited as the glacier retreats in alpine glaciers ground moraines are often found between the two lateral moraines ground moraines may be modified into drumlins by the overriding ice
==== rogen moraines ====
rogen moraines or ribbed moraines are a type of basal moraines that form a series of ribs perpendicular to the ice flow in an ice sheet the depressions between the ribs are sometimes filled with water making the rogen moraines look like tigerstripes on aerial photographs rogen moraines are named after lake rogen in hrjedalen sweden the landforms type locality
=== end or terminal moraines ===
end moraines or terminal moraines are ridges of unconsolidated debris deposited at the snout or end of the glacier they usually reflect the shape of the glacier's terminus glaciers act much like a conveyor belt carrying debris from the top of the glacier to the bottom where it deposits it in end moraines end moraine size and shape are determined by whether the glacier is advancing receding or at equilibrium the longer the terminus of the glacier stays in one place the more debris accumulate in the moraine there are two types of end moraines terminal and recessional terminal moraines mark the maximum advance of the glacier recessional moraines are small ridges left as a glacier pauses during its retreat after a glacier retreats the end moraine may be destroyed by postglacial erosion
=== recessional moraine ===
recessional moraines are often observed as a series of transverse ridges running across a valley behind a terminal moraine they form perpendicular to the lateral moraines that they reside between and are composed of unconsolidated debris deposited by the glacier they are created during temporary halts in a glacier's retreat
=== medial moraine ===
a medial moraine is a ridge of moraine that runs down the center of a valley floor it forms when two glaciers meet and the debris on the edges of the adjacent valley sides join and are carried on top of the enlarged glacier as the glacier melts or retreats the debris is deposited and a ridge down the middle of the valley floor is created the kaskawulsh glacier in the kluane national park yukon has a ridge of medial moraine 1 km wide
=== supraglacial moraines ===
supraglacial moraines are created by debris accumulated on top of glacial ice this debris can accumulate due to ice flow toward the surface in the ablation zone melting of surface ice or from debris that falls onto the glacier from valley sidewalls
=== washboard moraines ===
washboard moraines also known as minor or corrugated moraines are low-amplitude geomorphic features caused by glaciers the name washboard moraine refers to the fact that from the air it resembles a washboard
=== veiki moraine ===
a veiki moraine is a kind of hummocky moraine that forms irregular landscapes of ponds and plateaus surrounded by banks it forms from the irregular melting of ice covered with a thick layer of debris veiki moraine is common in northern sweden and parts of canada
== moraines of long island ==
a detailed geomorphological study of new york's long island provides evidence of glacial history of the kame and terminal moraines of the island which were formed by the advance and retreat of two ice sheets
