condensation reaction chemical reaction two molecules moieties functional groups combine form larger molecule together loss small molecule possible small molecules lost water hydrogen chloride methanol acetic acid commonly biological reaction water
two separate molecules react condensation termed intermolecular simple example condensation two amino acids form peptide bond characteristic proteins reaction example opposite hydrolysis splits chemical entity two parts action polar water molecule splits hydroxide hydrogen ions hence energy required
union atoms groups molecule reaction termed intramolecular condensation many cases leads ring formation example dieckmann condensation two ester groups single diester molecule react lose small alcohol molecule form ketoester product
mechanism
many condensation reactions follow nucleophilic acyl substitution aldol condensation reaction mechanism condensations acyloin condensation triggered radical single electron transfer conditions
condensation reactions polymer chemistry
one type polymerization reaction series condensation steps take place whereby monomers monomer chains add form longer chains termed condensation polymerization stepgrowth polymerization occurs example synthesis polyesters nylons may either homopolymerization single monomer ab two different end groups condense copolymerization two comonomers aa bb small molecules usually liberated condensation steps contrast polyaddition reactions liberation small molecules
general condensation polymers form slowly addition polymers often requiring heat generally lower molecular weight monomers consumed early reaction terminal functional groups remain active throughout short chains combine form longer chains high conversion rate required achieve high molecular weights per carothers equation
bifunctional monomers lead linear chains therefore thermoplastic polymers monomer functionality exceeds two product branched chain may yield thermoset polymer
