chemistry suspension heterogeneous mixture containing solid particles sufficiently large sedimentation usually must larger one micrometer internal phase solid dispersed throughout external phase fluid mechanical agitation use certain excipients suspending agents unlike colloids suspensions eventually settle example suspension would sand water suspended particles visible microscope settle time left undisturbed distinguishes suspension colloid suspended particles smaller settle colloids suspensions different solutions dissolved substance solute exist solid solvent solute homogeneously mixed
suspension liquid droplets fine solid particles gas called aerosol particulate atmosphere consist fine dust soot particles sea salt biogenic volcanogenic sulfates nitrates cloud droplets
suspensions classified basis dispersed phase dispersion medium former essentially solid latter may either solid liquid gas
modern chemical process industries high shear mixing technology used create many novel suspensions
suspensions unstable thermodynamic point view however kinetically stable large period time determines shelf life time span needs measured ensure best product quality final consumer dispersion stability refers ability dispersion resist change properties time dj mcclements
technique monitoring physical stabilityedit
multiple light scattering coupled vertical scanning widely used technique monitor dispersion state product hence identifying quantifying destabilization phenomena works concentrated dispersions without dilution light sent sample back scattered particles backscattering intensity directly proportional size volume fraction dispersed phase therefore local changes concentration sedimentation global changes size flocculation aggregation detected monitored
accelerating methods shelf life predictionedit
kinetic process destabilisation rather long several months even years products often required formulator use accelerating methods order reach reasonable development time new product design thermal methods commonly used consists increasing temperature accelerate destabilisation critical temperatures phase inversion chemical degradation temperature affects viscosity also interfacial tension case nonionic surfactants generally interactions forces inside system storing dispersion high temperatures enables simulation real life conditions product eg tube sunscreen cream car summer also accelerate destabilisation processes times
mechanical acceleration including vibration centrifugation agitation sometimes used subject product different forces pushes particles droplets one another hence helping film drainage however emulsions would never coalesce normal gravity artificial gravity moreover segregation different populations particles highlighted using centrifugation vibration
