going equipped received a rating of 6.3/10 from 69 users the one-line review highly recommended the short and said it proves to be a melancholy minor-masterpiece and one of aardman animations best works. animator mag said peter [lord]s contribution was a view of life in and out of prison seen through the eyes of a young offender it is based on a real-life taped interview the animation is smooth and realistic although watching a plasticine figure acting in a realistic way makes the words even more poignant then if the actual person had been filmed.
