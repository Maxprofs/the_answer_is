chromatin is a complex of macromolecules found in cells consisting of dna protein and rna the primary functions of chromatin are 1) to package dna into a smaller volume to fit in the cell 2) to reinforce the dna macromolecule to allow mitosis 3) to prevent dna damage and 4) to control gene expression and dna replication the primary protein components of chromatin are histones that compact the dna chromatin is only found in eukaryotic cells (cells with defined nuclei) prokaryotic cells have a different organization of their dna (the prokaryotic chromosome equivalent is called genophore and is localized within the nucleoid region)
the structure of chromatin depends on several factors the overall structure depends on the stage of the cell cycle during interphase the chromatin is structurally loose to allow access to rna and dna polymerases that transcribe and replicate the dna the local structure of chromatin during interphase depends on the genes present on the dna dna coding genes that are actively transcribed ("turned on") are more loosely packaged and are found associated with rna polymerases (referred to as euchromatin) while dna coding inactive genes ("turned off") are found associated with structural proteins and are more tightly packaged (heterochromatin) epigenetic chemical modification of the structural proteins in chromatin also alters the local chromatin structure in particular chemical modifications of histone proteins by methylation and acetylation as the cell prepares to divide i.e enters mitosis or meiosis the chromatin packages more tightly to facilitate segregation of the chromosomes during anaphase during this stage of the cell cycle this makes the individual chromosomes in many cells visible by optical microscope
in general terms there are three levels of chromatin organization
dna wraps around histone proteins forming nucleosomes the beads on a string structure (euchromatin)
multiple histones wrap into a 30 nm fibre consisting of nucleosome arrays in their most compact form (heterochromatin) (definitively established to exist in vitro the 30-nanometer fibre was not seen in recent x-ray studies of human mitotic chromosomes.)
higher-level dna packaging of the 30 nm fibre into the metaphase chromosome (during mitosis and meiosis)
there are however many cells that do not follow this organisation for example spermatozoa and avian red blood cells have more tightly packed chromatin than most eukaryotic cells and trypanosomatid protozoa do not condense their chromatin into visible chromosomes for mitosis
== during interphaseedit ==
the structure of chromatin during interphase of mitosis is optimized to allow simple access of transcription and dna repair factors to the dna while compacting the dna into the nucleus the structure varies depending on the access required to the dna genes that require regular access by rna polymerase require the looser structure provided by euchromatin
== dynamic chromatin structure and hierarchyedit ==
chromatin undergoes various structural changes during a cell cycle histone proteins are the basic packer and arranger of chromatin and can be modified by various post-translational modifications to alter chromatin packing (histone modification) most of the modifications occur on the histone tail the consequences in terms of chromatin accessibility and compaction depend both on the amino-acid that is modified and the type of modification for example histone acetylation results in loosening and increased accessibility of chromatin for replication and transcription lysine tri-methylation can either be correlated with transcriptional activity (tri-methylation of histone h3 lysine 4) or transcriptional repression and chromatin compaction (tri-methylation of histone h3 lysine 9 or 27) several studies suggested that different modifications could occur simultaneously for example it was proposed that a bivalent structure (with tri-methylation of both lysine 4 and 27 on histone h3) was involved in mammalian early development
polycomb-group proteins play a role in regulating genes through modulation of chromatin structure

=== dna structureedit ===
in nature dna can form three structures a- b- and z-dna a- and b-dna are very similar forming right-handed helices whereas z-dna is a left-handed helix with a zig-zag phosphate backbone z-dna is thought to play a specific role in chromatin structure and transcription because of the properties of the junction between b- and z-dna
at the junction of b- and z-dna one pair of bases is flipped out from normal bonding these play a dual role of a site of recognition by many proteins and as a sink for torsional stress from rna polymerase or nucleosome binding
=== nucleosomes and beads-on-a-stringedit ===
main articles nucleosome chromatosome and histone
the basic repeat element of chromatin is the nucleosome interconnected by sections of linker dna a far shorter arrangement than pure dna in solution
in addition to the core histones there is the linker histone h1 which contacts the exit/entry of the dna strand on the nucleosome the nucleosome core particle together with histone h1 is known as a chromatosome nucleosomes with about 20 to 60 base pairs of linker dna can form under non-physiological conditions an approximately 10 nm beads-on-a-string fibre (fig 1-2) 
the nucleosomes bind dna non-specifically as required by their function in general dna packaging there are however large dna sequence preferences that govern nucleosome positioning this is due primarily to the varying physical properties of different dna sequences for instance adenine and thymine are more favorably compressed into the inner minor grooves this means nucleosomes can bind preferentially at one position approximately every 10 base pairs (the helical repeat of dna)- where the dna is rotated to maximise the number of a and t bases that will lie in the inner minor groove (see mechanical properties of dna.)
=== 30 nanometer chromatin fibreedit ===
with addition of h1 the beads-on-a-string structure in turn coils into a 30 nm diameter helical structure known as the 30 nm fibre or filament the precise structure of the chromatin fibre in the cell is not known in detail and there is still some debate over this
this level of chromatin structure is thought to be the form of euchromatin which contains actively transcribed genes em studies have demonstrated that the 30 nm fibre is highly dynamic such that it unfolds into a 10 nm fiber ("beads-on-a-string") structure when transversed by an rna polymerase engaged in transcription
the existing models commonly accept that the nucleosomes lie perpendicular to the axis of the fibre with linker histones arranged internally a stable 30 nm fibre relies on the regular positioning of nucleosomes along dna linker dna is relatively resistant to bending and rotation this makes the length of linker dna critical to the stability of the fibre requiring nucleosomes to be separated by lengths that permit rotation and folding into the required orientation without excessive stress to the dna in this view different lengths of the linker dna should produce different folding topologies of the chromatin fiber recent theoretical work based on electron-microscopy images of reconstituted fibers supports this view
=== spatial organization of chromatin in the cell nucleusedit ===
the spatial arrangement of the chromatin within the nucleus is not random - specific regions of the chromatin can be found in certain territories territories are for example the lamina-associated domains (lads) and the topological association domains (tads) which are bound together by protein complexes currently polymer models such as the strings & binders switch (sbs) model and the dynamic loop (dl) model are used to describe the folding of chromatin within the nucleus
== chromatin and bursts of transcriptionedit ==
chromatin and its interaction with enzymes has been researched and a conclusion being made is that it is relevant and an important factor in gene expression vincent g allfrey a professor at rockefeller university stated that rna synthesis is related to histone acetylation the lysine amino acid attached to the end of the histones is positively charged the acetylation of these tails would make the chromatin ends neutral allowing for dna access
when the chromatin decondenses the dna is open to entry of molecular machinery fluctuations between open and closed chromatin may contribute to the discontinuity of transcription or transcriptional bursting other factors are probably involved such as the association and dissociation of transcription factor complexes with chromatin the phenomenon as opposed to simple probabilistic models of transcription can account for the high variability in gene expression occurring between cells in isogenic populations
== metaphase chromatin (chromosomes)edit ==
the metaphase structure of chromatin differs vastly to that of interphase it is optimised for physical strength and manageability forming the classic chromosome structure seen in karyotypes the structure of the condensed chromatin is thought to be loops of 30 nm fibre to a central scaffold of proteins it is however not well-characterised
the physical strength of chromatin is vital for this stage of division to prevent shear damage to the dna as the daughter chromosomes are separated to maximise strength the composition of the chromatin changes as it approaches the centromere primarily through alternative histone h1 anologues
it should also be noted that during mitosis while most of the chromatin is tightly compacted there are small regions that are not as tightly compacted these regions often correspond to promoter regions of genes that were active in that cell type prior to entry into chromitosis the lack of compaction of these regions is called bookmarking which is an epigenetic mechanism believed to be important for transmitting to daughter cells the memory of which genes were active prior to entry into mitosis this bookmarking mechanism is needed to help transmit this memory because transcription ceases during mitosis
== chromatin alternative definitionsedit ==
simple and concise definition chromatin is a macromolecular complex of a dna macromolecule and protein macromolecules (and rna) the proteins package and arrange the dna and control its functions within the cell nucleus
a biochemists operational definition chromatin is the dna/protein/rna complex extracted from eukaryotic lysed interphase nuclei just which of the multitudinous substances present in a nucleus will constitute a part of the extracted material partly depends on the technique each researcher uses furthermore the composition and properties of chromatin vary from one cell type to the another during development of a specific cell type and at different stages in the cell cycle
the dna + histone = chromatin definition the dna double helix in the cell nucleus is packaged by special proteins termed histones the formed protein/dna complex is called chromatin the basic structural unit of chromatin is the nucleosome
== alternative chromatin organizationsedit ==
during metazoan spermiogenesis the spermatid's chromatin is remodelled into a more spaced-packaged widened almost crystal-like structure this process is associated with the cessation of transcription and involves nuclear protein exchange the histones are mostly displaced and replaced by protamines (small arginine-rich proteins)
