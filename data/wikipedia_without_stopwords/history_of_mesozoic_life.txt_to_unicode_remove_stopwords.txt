geologic periods
following paleozoic mesozoic extended roughly million years million years ago cenozoic era began time frame separated three geologic periods oldest youngest
triassic million years ago
jurassic million years ago
cretaceous million years ago
lower triassic boundary set permiantriassic extinction event approximately marine species terrestrial vertebrates became extinct also known great dying considered largest mass extinction earths history upper cretaceous boundary set cretaceoustertiary kt extinction event accurately called cretaceouspaleogene kpg extinction event may caused impactor created chicxulub crater yucatn peninsula towards late cretaceous large volcanic eruptions also believed contributed cretaceouspaleogene extinction event approximately genera became extinct including nonavian dinosaurs
triassic
triassic ranges million million years ago triassic desolate transitional state earths history permian extinction lush jurassic period three major epochs early triassic middle triassic late triassic
early triassic lived million million years ago dominated deserts pangaea yet broken thus interior nothing arid earth witnessed massive dieoff life went extinct common life earth lystrosaurus labyrinthodont euparkeria along many creatures managed survive great dying temnospondyli evolved time would dominant predator much triassic
middle triassic spans million million years ago middle triassic featured beginnings breakup pangaea beginning tethys sea ecosystem recovered devastation great dying phytoplankton coral crustaceans recovered reptiles began get bigger bigger new aquatic reptiles evolved ichthyosaurs nothosaurs meanwhile land pine forests flourished bringing along mosquitoes fruit flies first ancient crocodilians evolved sparked competition large amphibians since ruled freshwater world
late triassic spans million million years ago following bloom middle triassic late triassic featured frequent heat spells well moderate precipitation inches per year recent warming led boom reptilian evolution land first true dinosaurs evolve well pterosaurs climatic change however resulted large dieout known triassicjurassic extinction event archosaurs excluding ancient crocodiles synapsids almost large amphibians went extinct well marine life fourth mass extinction event world cause debatable
jurassic
jurassic ranges million years million years ago features major epochs early jurassic middle jurassic late jurassic
early jurassic spans million years million years ago climate much humid triassic result world tropical oceans plesiosaurs ichthyosaurs ammonites fill waters dominant races seas land dinosaurs reptiles stake claim dominant race land species dilophosaurus top first true crocodiles evolved pushing large amphibians near extinction allinall reptiles rise rule world meanwhile first true mammals evolve remained relatively small sized
middle jurassic spans million million years ago epoch reptiles flourished huge herds sauropods brachiosaurus diplodocus filled fern prairies middle jurassic many predators rose well allosaurus conifer forests made large portion forests oceans plesiosaurs quite common ichthyosaurs flourishing epoch peak reptiles
late jurassic spans million million years ago late jurassic featured massive extinction sauropods ichthyosaurs due separation pangaea laurasia gondwana extinction known jurassiccretaceous extinction sea levels rose destroying fern prairies creating shallows wake ichthyosaurs went extinct whereas sauropods whole die jurassic fact species like titanosaurus lived kt extinction increase sealevels opened atlantic sea way would continue get larger time divided world would give opportunity diversification new dinosaurs
cretaceous
cretaceous longest period mesozoic two epochs early cretaceous late cretaceous
early cretaceous spans million million years ago early cretaceous saw expansion seaways result decline extinction sauropods except south america many coastal shallows created caused ichthyosaurs die mosasaurs evolved replace head seas islandhopping dinosaurs like eustreptospondylus evolved cope coastal shallows small islands ancient europe dinosaurs rose fill empty space jurassiccretaceous extinction left behind carcharodontosaurus spinosaurus successful would iguanodon spread every continent seasons came back effect poles got seasonally colder dinosaurs still inhabited area like leaellynasaura inhabited polar forests yearround many dinosaurs migrated summer like muttaburrasaurus since cold crocodiles last stronghold large amphibians like koolasuchus pterosaurs got larger species like tapejara ornithocheirus evolved
late cretaceous spans million million years ago late cretaceous featured cooling trend would continue cenozoic period eventually tropics restricted equator areas beyond tropic lines featured extreme seasonal changes weather dinosaurs still thrived new species tyrannosaurus ankylosaurus triceratops hadrosaurs dominated food web oceans mosasaurs ruled seas fill role ichthyosaurs huge plesiosaurs elasmosaurus evolved also first flowering plants evolved end cretaceous deccan traps volcanic eruptions poisoning atmosphere continuing thought large meteor smashed earth creating chicxulub crater event known kt extinction fifth recent mass extinction event life earth went extinct including nonavian dinosaurs everything kilograms went extinct age dinosaurs
paleogeography tectonics
compared vigorous convergent plate mountainbuilding late paleozoic mesozoic tectonic deformation comparatively mild sole major mesozoic orogeny occurred arctic creating innuitian orogeny brooks range verkhoyansk cherskiy ranges siberia khingan mountains manchuria orogeny related opening arctic ocean subduction north china siberian cratons pacific ocean nevertheless era featured dramatic rifting supercontinent pangaea pangaea gradually split northern continent laurasia southern continent gondwana created passive continental margin characterizes atlantic coastline along us east coast today
end era continents rifted nearly present form laurasia became north america eurasia gondwana split south america africa australia antarctica indian subcontinent collided asian plate cenozoic impact giving rise himalayas
climate
triassic generally dry trend began late carboniferous highly seasonal especially interior pangaea low sea levels may also exacerbated temperature extremes high specific heat capacity water acts temperaturestabilizing heat reservoir land areas near large bodies waterespecially oceansexperience less variation temperature much land constituted pangaea distant oceans temperatures fluctuated greatly interior pangaea probably included expansive areas desert abundant red beds evaporites halite support conclusions evidence exists generally dry climate triassic punctuated episodes increased rainfall important humid episodes carnian pluvial event one rhaetian million years triassicjurassic extinction event
sea levels began rise jurassic probably caused increase seafloor spreading formation new crust beneath surface displaced ocean waters much m ft today flooded coastal areas furthermore pangaea began rift smaller divisions bringing land area contact ocean forming tethys sea temperatures continued increase began stabilize humidity also increased proximity water deserts retreated
climate cretaceous less certain widely disputed higher levels carbon dioxide atmosphere thought caused world temperature gradient north south become almost flat temperatures across planet average temperatures also higher today c fact middle cretaceous equatorial ocean waters perhaps warm c deep ocean may warm sea life land areas near equator may deserts despite proximity water circulation oxygen deep ocean may also disrupted reason large volumes organic matter unable decompose accumulated eventually deposited black shale
data support hypotheses however even overall warmth temperature fluctuations sufficient presence polar ice caps glaciers evidence either quantitative models also unable recreate flatness cretaceous temperature gradient
different studies come different conclusions amount oxygen atmosphere different parts mesozoic concluding oxygen levels lower current level throughout mesozoic concluding lower triassic part jurassic higher cretaceous concluding higher throughout triassic jurassic cretaceous
life
flora
dominant land plant species time gymnosperms vascular conebearing nonflowering plants conifers produce seeds without coating opposed earths current flora dominant land plants terms number species angiosperms one particular plant genus ginkgo thought evolved time represented today single species ginkgo biloba well extant genus sequoia believed evolved mesozoic
plant species distributions markedly different succeeding periods example schizeales fern order skewed northern hemisphere mesozoic better represented southern hemisphere
fauna
extinction nearly animal species end permian period allowed radiation many new lifeforms particular extinction large herbivorous pareiasaurs carnivorous gorgonopsians left ecological niches empty filled surviving cynodonts dicynodonts latter subsequently became extinct
recent research indicates specialized animals formed complex ecosystems high biodiversity complex food webs variety niches took much longer reestablish recovery begin start midtriassic m m years extinction complete m years permiantriassic extinction event animal life dominated various archosaurian reptiles dinosaurs pterosaurs aquatic reptiles ichthyosaurs plesiosaurs mosasaurs
climatic changes late jurassic cretaceous provided adaptive radiation jurassic height archosaur diversity first birds eutherian mammals also appeared angiosperms radiated sometime early cretaceous first tropics even temperature gradient allowed spread toward poles throughout period end cretaceous angiosperms dominated tree floras many areas although evidence suggests biomass still dominated cycad ferns cretaceouspaleogene extinction
argued insects diversified angiosperms insect anatomy especially mouth parts seems particularly wellsuited flowering plants however major insect mouth parts preceded angiosperms insect diversification actually slowed arrived anatomy originally must suited purpose
temperatures seas increased larger animals early mesozoic gradually began disappear smaller animals kinds including lizards snakes perhaps primates evolved cretaceouspaleogene extinction event exacerbated trend large archosaurs became extinct birds mammals thrived today
