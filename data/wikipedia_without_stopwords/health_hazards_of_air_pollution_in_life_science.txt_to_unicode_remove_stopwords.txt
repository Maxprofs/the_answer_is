cost pollution
pollution cost manufacturing activities cause air pollution impose health cleanup costs whole society whereas neighbors individual chooses fireproof home may benefit reduced risk fire spreading houses external costs exist pollution producer may choose produce product would produced producer required pay associated environmental costs responsibility consequence selfdirected action lies partly outside self element externalization involved external benefits public safety less good may produced would case producer receive payment external benefits others

perspectives
earliest precursor pollution generated life forms would natural function existence attendant consequences viability population levels fell within sphere natural selection would included demise population locally ultimately species extinction processes untenable would resulted new balance brought changes adaptations extremes form life consideration pollution superseded survival
humankind factor technology distinguishing critical consideration enabler additional source byproducts short survival human concerns include range quality life health hazards since science holds experimental demonstration definitive modern treatment toxicity environmental harm involves defining level effect observable common examples fields practical measurement crucial include automobile emissions control industrial exposure eg occupational safety health administration osha pels toxicology eg ld medicine eg medication radiation doses
solution pollution dilution dictum summarizes traditional approach pollution management whereby sufficiently diluted pollution harmful wellsuited modern locally scoped applications laboratory safety procedure hazardous material release emergency management assumes dilutant virtually unlimited supply application resulting dilutions acceptable cases
simple treatment environmental pollution wider scale might greater merit earlier centuries physical survival often highest imperative human population densities lower technologies simpler byproducts benign often longer case furthermore advances enabled measurement concentrations possible use statistical methods evaluating outcomes given currency principle probable harm cases assessment warranted resorting deterministic models impractical infeasible addition consideration environment beyond direct impact human beings gained prominence
yet absence superseding principle older approach predominates practices throughout world basis gauge concentrations effluent legal release exceeding penalties assessed restrictions applied one superseding principle contained modern hazardous waste laws developed countries process diluting hazardous waste make nonhazardous usually regulated treatment process migration pollution dilution elimination many cases confronted challenging economical technological barriers
