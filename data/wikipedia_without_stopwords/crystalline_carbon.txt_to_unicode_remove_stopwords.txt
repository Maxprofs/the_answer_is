psr j b extrasolar planet discovered august orbit around psr j millisecond pulsar pulsar planet likely composed largely crystalline carbon density far greater diamond psr j b orbits closely host star planets orbit would fit inside sun existence carbon planets theoretically postulated
observational history
psr j first observed team headed matthew bailes swinburne university technology melbourne australia orbiting planet published journal science august planet confirmed pulsar timing small modulations detected highly regular pulsar signature measured extrapolated observatories britain hawaii australia used confirm observations
host star
psr j pulsar light years away earth serpens cauda constellation approximately one minute border ophiuchus pulsar completes rotations minute approximately miles across mass solar masses
characteristics
psr j b time august discovery densest planet ever discovered nearly times density jupiter times density water slightly massive jupiter believed composed oxygen carbon opposed hydrogen helium main components gas giants like jupiter saturn
oxygen likely surface planet increasingly higher quantities carbon deeper inside planet intense pressure acting upon planet suggests carbon crystallized much like diamond
psr j b orbits host star period hours distance little bit less one solar radius
