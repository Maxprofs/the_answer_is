limit reagent limit reactant chemic reaction substanc total consum chemic reaction complet amount product form limit reagent sinc reaction cannot proceed without one reagent present excess quantiti requir react limit reagent describ excess reagent excess reactant
limit reagent must identifi order calcul percentag yield reaction sinc theoret yield defin amount product obtain limit reagent react complet
given balanc chemic equat describ reaction sever equival way identifi limit reagent evalu excess quantiti reagent
method comparison reactant amount
method use two reactant one reactant chosen balanc chemic equat use determin amount reactant b necessari react amount b actual present exceed amount requir b excess limit reagent amount b present less requir b limit reagent
exampl two reactant
consid combust benzen repres follow chemic equat
mean mole molecular oxygen o requir react mole benzen ch
amount oxygen requir quantiti benzen calcul use crossmultipl rule three exampl mol ch present mol o requir
fact mol o present excess mol unreact oxygen benzen consum benzen limit reagent
conclus verifi compar mole ratio o ch requir balanc equat mole ratio actual present
sinc actual ratio larger requir o reagent excess confirm benzen limit reagent
method comparison product amount form reactant
method chemic equat use calcul amount one product form reactant amount present limit reactant one form smallest amount product consid method extend number reactant easili first method
exampl
g iron iii oxid feo react g aluminium al follow thermit reaction
sinc reactant amount given gram must first convert mole comparison chemic equat order determin mani mole fe produc either reactant
