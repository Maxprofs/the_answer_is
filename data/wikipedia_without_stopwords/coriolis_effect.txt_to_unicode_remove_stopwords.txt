lets imagine train travels frictionless railway line along equator motion necessary speed complete trip around world one day ms analyze coriolis effect three cases travels west rest travelling east cases calculate coriolis effect rotating frame reference earth first check fixed inertial frame image see three cases inertial frame seen fixed point earth along axis rotation
train travels toward west case moving direction rotation earths rotating frame coriolis term pointed inwards towards axis rotation additional force downwards cause train board heavier moving direction
look train fixed nonrotating frame top center earth see speed remains stationary earth spins beneath force acting would gravity reaction track force greater force passengers train experience rest rotating along earth difference coriolis effect accounts rotating frame reference
train comes stop point view earths rotating frame velocity train coriolis force also therefore train passengers recuperate usual weight
fixed inertial frame reference earth train rotating along rest earth percent force gravity provides centripetal force needed achieve circular motion frame reference remaining force could measured scale would make train passengers lighter previous case
train changes direction travels towards east case moving direction earths rotating frame coriolis term directed outward axis rotation upward force would cause train seem lighter still rest
fixed frame reference space train travelling east rotating twice rate rest therefore amount centripetal force needed cause circular path increases leaving less force gravity act track coriolis term accounts previous paragraph
final check imagine frame reference rotating along train frame would rotating twice angular velocity earths rotating frame resulting centrifugal force component imaginary frame would greater since train passengers rest within would component frame explaining train passengers lighter previous two cases
also explains high speed projectiles travelling west get deflected travelling east deflected vertical component coriolis effect called etvs effect
