the coccinellidae (/kksnlda/) are a family of small beetles ranging from 0.8 to 18 mm (0.0315 to 0.708 inches) they are commonly yellow orange or scarlet with small black spots on their wing covers with black legs heads and antennae such colour patterns vary greatly however for example a minority of species such as vibidia duodecimguttata a twelve-spotted species have whitish spots on a brown background coccinellids are found worldwide with over 5,000 species described
coccinellidae are known as ladybugs in north america and ladybirds in other areas entomologists in the united states widely prefer the names ladybird beetles or lady beetles as these insects are not true bugs
the coccinellidae are generally considered useful insects because many species feed on aphids or scale insects which are pests in gardens agricultural fields orchards and similar places within the colonies of such plant-eating pests they will lay hundreds of eggs and when these hatch the larvae will commence feeding immediately however some species do have unwelcome effects among these the most prominent are the subfamily epilachninae which are plant eaters usually epilachninae are only mild agricultural pests eating the leaves of grain potatoes beans and various other crops but their numbers can increase explosively in years when their natural enemies such as parasitoid wasps that attack their eggs are few in such situations they can do major crop damage they occur in practically all the major crop-producing regions of temperate and tropical countries
== etymologyedit ==
the name coccinellid is derived from the latin word coccineus meaning scarlet the name ladybird originated in britain where the insects became known as our lady's bird or the lady beetle mary (our lady) was often depicted wearing a red cloak in early paintings and the spots of the seven-spot ladybird (the most common in europe) were said to symbolise her seven joys and seven sorrows in the united states the name was adapted to ladybug common names in other european languages have the same association for example the german name marienkfer translates to marybeetle
== physical appearanceedit ==
most coccinellids have oval dome-shaped bodies with six short legs depending on the species they can have spots stripes or no markings at all seven-spotted coccinellids are red or orange with three spots on each side and one in the middle they have a black head with white patches on each side
as well as the usual yellow and deep red colourings many coccinellid species are mostly or entirely black dark grey gray or brown and may be difficult for an entomologist/nonentomologists to recognise as coccinellids at all conversely non-entomologists might easily mistake many other small beetles for coccinellids for example the tortoise beetles like the ladybird beetles look similar because they are shaped so that they can cling to a flat surface so closely that ants and many other enemies cannot grip them
non-entomologists are prone to misidentify a wide variety of beetle species in other families as ladybirds i.e coccinellids beetles are particularly prone to such misidentification if they are spotted in red orange or yellow and black examples include the much larger scarabaeid grapevine beetles and spotted species of the chrysomelidae melyridae and others conversely laymen may fail to identify unmarked species of coccinellidae as ladybirds other beetles that have a defensive hemispherical shape like that of the coccinellidae (for example the cassidinae) also are often taken for ladybirds
a common myth totally unfounded is that the number of spots on the insect's back indicates its age in fact the underlying pattern and colouration are determined by the species and genetics of the beetle and develop as the insect matures in some species its appearance is fixed by the time it emerges from its pupa though in most it may take some days for the colour of the adult beetle to mature and stabilise generally the mature colour tends to be fuller and darker than the colour of the callow
== biologyedit ==
coccinellids are best known as predators of sternorrhyncha such as aphids and scale insects but the range of prey species that various coccinellidae may attack is much wider a genus of small black ladybirds stethorus presents one example of predation on non-sternorrhyncha they specialise in mites as prey notably tetranychus spider mites stethorus species accordingly are important in certain examples of biological control
various larger species of coccinellidae attack caterpillars and other beetle larvae several genera feed on various insects or their eggs for example coleomegilla species are significant predators of the eggs and larvae of moths such as species of spodoptera and the plutellidae larvae and eggs of ladybirds either their own or of other species can also be important food resources when alternative prey are scarce as a family the coccinellidae used to be regarded as purely carnivorous but they are now known to be far more omnivorous than previously thought both as a family and in individual species examination of gut contents of apparently specialist predators commonly yield residues of pollen and other plant materials besides the prey they favour most predatory coccinellids include other items in their diets including honeydew pollen plant sap nectar and various fungi the significance of such nonprey items in their diets is still under investigation and discussion
apart from the generalist aphid and scale predators and incidental substances of botanical origin many coccinellidae do favour or even specialise in certain prey types this makes some of them particularly valuable as agents in biological control programmes determination of specialisation need not be a trivial matter though for example the larva of the vedalia ladybird rodolia cardinalis is a specialist predator on a few species of monophlebidae in particular icerya purchasi which is the most notorious of the cottony cushion scale species however the adult r cardinalis can subsist for some months on a wider range of insects plus some nectar
certain species of coccinellids are thought to lay extra infertile eggs with the fertile eggs apparently to provide a backup food source for the larvae when they hatch the ratio of infertile to fertile eggs increases with scarcity of food at the time of egg laying such a strategy amounts to the production of trophic eggs
some species in the subfamily epilachninae are herbivores and can be very destructive agricultural pests (e.g. the mexican bean beetle) again in the subfamily coccinellinae members of the tribe halyziini and the genus tythaspis are mycophagous
while predatory species are often used as biological control agents introduced species of coccinellids are not necessarily benign species such as harmonia axyridis or coccinella septempunctata in north america outcompete and displace native coccinellids and become pests themselves
the main predators of coccinellids are usually birds but they are also the prey of frogs wasps spiders and dragonflies the bright colours of many coccinellids discourage some potential predators from making a meal of them this phenomenon called aposematism works because predators learn by experience to associate certain prey phenotypes with a bad taste a further defence known as reflex bleeding exists in which an alkaloid toxin is exuded through the joints of the exoskeleton triggered by mechanical stimulation (such as by predator attack) in both larval and adult beetles deterring feeding
coccinellids in temperate regions enter diapause during the winter so they often are among the first insects to appear in the spring some species (e.g. hippodamia convergens) gather into groups and move to higher elevations such as a mountain to enter diapause
most coccinellids overwinter as adults aggregating on the south sides of large objects such as trees or houses during the winter months dispersing in response to increasing day length in the spring
predatory coccinellids are usually found on plants which harbour their prey they lay their eggs near their prey to increase the likelihood the larvae will find the prey easily in harmonia axyridis eggs hatch in three to four days from clutches numbering from a few to several dozen depending on resource availability the larvae pass through four instars over 1014 days after which pupation occurs after a teneral period of several days the adults become reproductively active and are able to reproduce again although they may become reproductively quiescent if eclosing late in the season total life span is one to two years on average
== infestations and impactsedit ==
in the united states coccinellids usually begin to appear indoors in the autumn when they leave their summer feeding sites in fields forests and yards and search out places to spend the winter typically when temperatures warm to the mid-60s f (around 18 c) in the late afternoon following a period of cooler weather they will swarm onto or into buildings illuminated by the sun swarms of coccinellids fly to buildings in september through november depending on location and weather conditions homes or other buildings near fields or woods are particularly prone to infestation
after an abnormally long period of hot dry weather in the summer of 1976 in the uk a marked increase in the aphid population was followed by a plague of ladybirds with many reports of people being bitten as the supply of aphids dwindled
the presence of coccinellids in grape harvests can cause ladybird taint in wines produced from the grapes
== as an alien speciesedit ==
harmonia axyridis (the harlequin ladybird) is an example of how an animal might be partly welcome and partly harmful it was introduced into north america from asia in 1916 to control aphids but is now the most common species outcompeting many of the native species it has since spread to much of western europe reaching the uk in 2004 it has become something of a domestic and agricultural pest in some regions and gives cause for ecological concern it similarly has turned up in parts of africa where it has proved variously unwelcome perhaps most prominently in vine-related crops
== uk ladybird surveyedit ==
the atlas ladybirds (coccinellidae) of britain and ireland published in 2011 showed a decline of more than 20% in native species due to environmental changes and competition from foreign invaders the distribution maps compiled over a 20-year period with help from thousands of volunteers showed a decline in the numbers of the common 10-spot and 14-spot ladybirds and a number of other species including the 11-spot 22-spot cream-spot water and hieroglyphic ladybirds coccidula rufa rhyzobius litura and nephus redtenbacheri conversely increases were seen in the numbers of harlequin orange pine and 24-spot ladybirds as well as rhyzobius chrysomeloides the kidney spot ladybird was recorded in scotland for the first time in recent years and the 13-spot was found to have recolonised cornwall devon and the new forest the most commonly recorded species was the 7-spot closely followed by the asian harlequin an invader that arrived from continental europe in 2003 after being introduced to control pests an explosion in the number of orange ladybirds which feed on mildew is thought to have been due to the warmer damper conditions that now prevail in parts of england

== in popular cultureedit ==
coccinellids are and have been for very many years an insect of interest and favour for children the insects had many regional names (now mostly disused) in english such as variations on bishop-barnaby (norfolk and suffolk dialect) barnabee burnabee the bishop-that-burneth and bishy bishy barnabee the etymology is unclear but it may be from st barnabas feast in june when the insect appears or a corruption of bishop-that-burneth from the fiery elytra of the beetles
the ladybird was immortalised in the popular children's nursery rhyme ladybird ladybird
ladybird ladybird fly away home
your house is on fire and your children are gone
all except one and that's little anne
for she has crept under the warming pan
this poem has its counterpart in german as marienwrmchen collected in des knaben wunderhorn and set to music by robert schumann as op 79 no 13
there is also a polish nursery rhyme little ladybirds anthem of which a part ("fly to the sky little ladybird bring me a piece of bread") became a saying
maa biedroneczka siedem kropek miaa
na zielonej ce wesoo fruwaa
zapa j pajczek w swoj pajczyn
- uratuj ci biedronko a ty mi co przynie
biedroneczko le do nieba przynie mi kawaek chleba
little ladybird had seven dots
she was flying over a green meadow
a little spider caught her in its spiderweb
i will set you free little ladybird and you bring me something
fly to the sky little ladybird bring me a piece of bread
many cultures consider coccinellids lucky and have nursery rhymes or local names for the insects that reflect this for instance the turkish name for the insect is uur bcei literally meaning good luck bug in many countries including russia turkey and italy the sight of a coccinellid is either a call to make a wish or a sign that a wish will soon be granted
in christian areas coccinellids are often associated with the virgin mary and the name that the insect bears in the various languages of europe corresponds to this though historically many european languages referenced freyja the fertility goddess of norse mythology in the names the virgin mary has now largely supplanted her so that for example freyjuhna (old norse) and frouehenge have been changed into marihne (norwegian) and marienkfer (german) which corresponds with our lady's bird sometimes the insect is referred to as belonging directly to god (irish bn d polish boa krwka all meaning god's [little] cow") in dutch it is called lieveheersbeestje meaning little animal of our good lord
in both hebrew and yiddish it is called moshe rabbenu's (i.e moses's) little cow or little horse apparently an adaptation from slavic languages occasionally it is called little messiah
