a lichen is a composite organism that arises from algae or cyanobacteria (or both) living among filaments of a fungus in a symbiotic relationship the combined life form has properties that are very different from the properties of its component organisms lichens come in many colors sizes and forms the properties are sometimes plant-like but lichens are not plants lichens may have tiny leafless branches (fruticose) flat leaf-like structures (foliose) flakes that lie on the surface like peeling paint (crustose) or other growth forms a macrolichen is a lichen that is either bush-like or leafy all other lichens are termed microlichens here macro and micro do not refer to size but to the growth form common names for lichens may contain the word moss (e.g. reindeer moss iceland moss") and lichens may superficially look like and grow with mosses but lichens are not related to mosses or any plant lichens do not have roots that absorb water and nutrients as plants do but like plants they produce their own food by photosynthesis using sunlight energy from carbon dioxide water and minerals in their environment when they grow on plants they do not live as parasites and only use the plants as a substrate
lichens occur from sea level to high alpine elevations in a very wide range of environmental conditions and can grow on almost any surface lichens are abundant growing on bark leaves mosses on other lichens and hanging from branches living on thin air (epiphytes) in rain forests and in temperate woodland they grow on bare rock walls gravestones roofs exposed soil surfaces and in the soil as part of a biological soil crust different kinds of lichens have adapted to survive in some of the most extreme environments on earth arctic tundra hot dry deserts rocky coasts and toxic slag heaps they can even live inside solid rock growing between the grains some lichens do not grow on anything living out their lives blowing about the environment it is estimated that 6% of earth's land surface is covered by lichen colonies of lichens may be spectacular in appearance dominating much of the surface of the visual landscape in forests and natural places such as the vertical paint covering the vast rock faces of yosemite national park
the fungus benefits from the symbiotic relation because algae or cyanobacteria produce food by photosynthesis the algae or cyanobacteria benefit by being protected from the environment by the filaments of the fungus which also gather moisture and nutrients from the environment and (usually) provide an anchor to it lichenized fungus may refer to the entire lichen or to the fungus growing in it the lichen combination of fungus with algae and/or cyanobacteria has a very different form (morphology) physiology and biochemistry to the component parts growing by themselves lichens are said to be species but what is meant by species is different from what is meant for plants animals and fungi for which species implies a common ancestral lineage lichens are really combinations of species from two or three different biological kingdoms so there is no common lineage by convention lichens have the same scientific name as the fungus in them and are not classified according to the species of the algae and/or cyanobacteria growing in them the alga or cyanobacterium has its own unique scientific name (binomial name) there are about 20,000 known species of lichens some lichens have lost the ability to reproduce sexually yet continue to speciate recent perspectives on lichens include that they are relatively self-contained miniature ecosystems in and of themselves possibly with more microorganisms living with the fungi algae and/or cyanobacteria performing other functions as partners in a system that evolves as an even more complex composite organism (holobiont)
lichens may be long-lived with some considered to be among the oldest living things they are among the first living things to grow on fresh rock exposed after an event such as a landslide the long life-span and slow and regular growth rate of some lichens can be used to date events (lichenometry) many lichens are very sensitive to environmental disturbances and can be used in cheaply assessing air pollution ozone depletion and metal contamination lichens have been used in making dyes perfumes and in traditional medicines few lichen species are eaten by insects or larger animals such as reindeer
== pronunciationedit ==
in american english lichen is pronounced the same as the verb liken (/lakn/) in british english both this pronunciation and one rhyming with kitchen /ltn/) are used
== growth formsedit ==
lichens grow in a wide range of shapes and forms (morphologies) the shape of a lichen is usually determined by the organization of the fungal filaments the nonreproductive tissues or vegetative body parts is called the thallus lichens are grouped by thallus type since the thallus is usually the most visually prominent part of the lichen thallus growth forms typically correspond to a few basic internal structure types common names for lichens often come from a growth form or color that is typical of a lichen genus
common groupings of lichen thallus growth forms are
fruticose growing up like a tuft or multiply branched leafless mini-shrub or hanging down in strands or tassles 3-dimensional with a nearly round cross section for its branching parts (terete)
foliose growing in 2-dimensional flat leaf-like lobes that lift up from the surface
crustose crust-like adhering tightly to a surface (substrate) like a thick coat of paint
leprose powdery
gelatinous jelly like
filamentous stringy or like matted hair
byssoid whispy like teased wool
structureless
there are variations in growth types in a single lichen species grey areas between the growth type descriptions and overlapping between growth types so some authors might describe lichens using different growth type descriptions
when a crustose lichen gets old the center may start to crack up like old-dried paint old-broken asphalt paving or like the polygonal islands of cracked-up mud in a dried lakebed this is called being rimose or areolate and the island pieces separated by the cracks are called areolas the areolas appear separated but are (or were) connected by an underlying prothallus or hypothallus when a crustose lichen grows from a center and appears to radiate out it is called crustose placodioid when the edges of the areolas lift up from the substrate it is called squamulose some people who study lichens (lichenologists) group squamulose lichens separately from crustose lichens
these growth form groups are not precisely defined foliose lichens may sometimes branch and appear to be fruticose fruticose lichens may have flattened branching parts and appear leafy squamulous lichens may appear where the edges lift up gelatinous lichens may appear leafy when dry means of telling them apart in these cases are in the sections below
structures involved in reproduction often appears as discs bumps or squiggly lines on the surface of the thallus the thallus is not always the part of the lichen that is most visually noticeable some lichens can grow inside solid rock between the grains (endolithic lichens) with only the sexual fruiting part visible growing outside the rock these may be dramatic in color or appearance forms of these sexual parts are not in the above growth form categories the most visually noticeable reproductive parts are often circular raised plate-like or disc-like outgrowths with crinkly edges and are described in sections below
=== coloredit ===
lichens come in many colors coloration is usually determined by the photosynthetic component special pigments such as yellow usnic acid give lichens a variety of colors including reds oranges yellows and browns especially in exposed dry habitats in the absence of special pigments lichens are usually bright green to olive gray when wet gray or grayish-green to brown when dry this is because moisture causes the surface skin (cortex) to become more transparent exposing the green photobiont layer different colored lichens covering large areas of exposed rock surfaces or lichens covering or hanging from bark can be a spectacular display when the patches of diverse colors come to life or glow in brilliant displays following rain
different colored lichens may inhabit different adjacent sections of a rock face depending on the angle of exposure to light
color is used in identification color changes depending on when a lichen is wet or dry color descriptions when used for identification are based on when the lichen is dry dry lichens with a cyanobacterium as the photosynthetic partner tend to be dark grey brown or black
the underside of the leaf-like lobes of foliose lichens is a different color from the top side (dorsiventral) often brown or black sometimes white a fruticose lichen may have flattened branches appearing similar to a foiliose lichen but the underside of a leaf-like structure on a fruticose lichen is the same color as the top side the leaf-like lobes of a foliose lichen may branch giving the appearance of a fruticose lichen but the underside will be a different color from the top side
the sheen on some jelly-like gelatinous lichens is from mucusy excretions
=== internal structure and growth formsedit ===
a lichen is made up of a simple photosynthesizing organism usually green algae or cyanobacteria surrounded by filaments of a fungus generally most of a lichen's bulk is made of interwoven fungal filaments although in filamentous and gelatinous lichens this is not the case the fungus is called a mycobiont the photosynthesizing organism is called a photobiont algal photobionts are called phycobionts cyanobacteria photobionts are called cyanobionts
the part of a lichen that is not involved in reproduction the body or vegetative tissue of a lichen is called the thallus the thallus form is very different from any form where the fungus or alga are growing separately the thallus is made up of filaments of the fungus called hyphae the filaments grow by branching then rejoining to create a mesh which is called being anastomose the mesh of fungal filaments may be dense or loose
generally the fungal mesh surrounds the algal or cyanobacterial cells often enclosing them within complex fungal tissues that is unique to lichen associations the thallus may or may not have a protective skin of densely packed fungal filaments which is called a cortex fruticose lichens have one cortex layer wrapping around the branches foliose lichens have an upper cortex on the top side of the leaf and a separate lower cortex on the bottom side crustose and squamulose lichens have only an upper cortex with the inside of the lichen in direct contact with the surface they grow on (the substrate) even if the edges peel up from the substrate and appear flat and leaf-like they lack a lower cortex unlike foliose lichens filamentous byssoid leprose gelatinous filimentous and other lichens do not have a cortex which is called being ecorticate
fruticose foliose crustose and squamulose lichens generally have up to three different types of tissue differentiated by having different densities of fungal filaments the top layer where the lichen contacts the environment is called a cortex the cortex is made of densely tightly woven packed and glued together (agglutinated) fungual filaments the dense packing makes the cortex act like a protective skin keeping other organisms out and reducing the intensity of sunlight on the layers below the cortex layer can be up to several hundred micrometers (m) in thickness (less than a millimeter) the cortex may be further topped by an epicortex of secretions not cells 0.61 m thick in some lichens this secretion layer may or may not have pores
below the cortex layer is a layer called the photobiontic layer or symbiont layer the symbiont layer has less densely packed fungal filaments with the photosynthetic partner embedded in them the less dense packing allows air circulation during photosynthesis similar to the anatomy of a leaf each cell or group of cells of the photobiont is usually individually wrapped by hyphae and in some cases penetrated by an haustorium in crustose and foliose lichens algae in the photobiontic layer is diffuse among the fungal filaments decreasing in gradation into the layer below in fruticose lichens the photobiontic layer is sharply distinct from the layer below
the layer beneath the symbiont layer called is called the medulla the medulla is less densely packed with fungal filaments than the layers above in foliose lichens there is (usually) another densely packed layer of fungal filaments called the lower cortex root-like fungal structures called rhizines (usually) grow from the lower cortex to attach or anchor the lichen to the substrate fruticose lichens have a single cortex wrapping all the way around the stems and branches the medulla is the lowest layer and may form a cottony white inner core for the branchlike thallus or it may be hollow crustose and squamulose lichens lack a lower cortex and the medulla is in direct contact with the substrate (biology) that the lichen grows on
in crustose areolate lichens the edges of the areolas peel up from the substrate and appear leafy in squamulose lichens the part of the lichen thallus that is not attached to the substrate may also appear leafy but these leafy parts lack a lower cortex which distinguishes crustose and squamulose lichens from foliose lichens conversely foliose lichens may appear flattened against the substrate like a crustose lichen but most of the leaf-like lobes can be lifted up from the substrate because it is separated from it by a tightly packed lower cortex
gelatinous byssoid and leprose lichens lack a cortex (are ecorticate) and generally have only undifferentiated tissue similar to only having a symbiont layer
in lichens that include both green algal and cyanobacterial symbionts the cyanobacteria may be held on the upper or lower surface in small pustules called cephalodia
pruinia is a whitish coating on top of an upper surface an epinecral layer is a layer of horny dead fungal hyphae with indistinct lumina in or near the cortex above the algal layer
== physiologyedit ==
=== symbiotic relationedit ===
lichens are fungi that have discovered agriculture trevor goward
a lichen is a composite organism that emerges from algae or cyanobacteria living among the filaments (hyphae) of a fungus in a mutually beneficial (symbiotic) relationship the fungus benefits from the algae or cyanobacteria because they produce food by photosynthesis the algae or cyanobacteria benefit by being protected from the environment by the filaments of the fungus which also gather moisture and nutrients from the environment and (usually) provide an anchor to it although some photosynthetic partners in a lichen can survive outside the lichen the lichen symbiotic association extends the ecological range of both partners whereby most descriptions of lichen associations describe them as symbiotic both partners gain water and mineral nutrients mainly from the atmosphere through rain and dust the fungal partner protects the alga by retaining water serving as a larger capture area for mineral nutrients and in some cases provides minerals obtained from the substrate if a cyanobacterium is present as a primary partner or another symbiont in addition to a green alga as in certain tripartite lichens they can fix atmospheric nitrogen complementing the activities of the green alga
the algal or cyanobacterial cells are photosynthetic and as in plants they reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic carbon sugars to feed both symbionts phycobionts (algae) produce sugar alcohols (ribitol sorbitol and erythritol) which are absorbed by the mycobiont (fungus) cyanobionts produce glucose lichenized fungal cells can make the photobiont leak out the products of photosynthesis where they can then be absorbed by the fungus
the lichen combination of alga and/or cyanobacterium with a fungus has a very different form (morphology) physiology and biochemistry than the component fungus alga or cyanobacterium growing by itself naturally or in culture the body (thallus) of most lichens is different from those of either the fungus or alga growing separately when grown in the laboratory in the absence of its photobiont a lichen fungus develops as a structureless undifferentiated mass of fungal filaments (hyphae) if combined with its photobiont under appropriate conditions its characteristic form associated with the photobiont emerges in the process called morphogenesis in a few remarkable cases a single lichen fungus can develop into two very different lichen forms when associating with either a green algal or a cyanobacterial symbiont quite naturally these alternative forms were at first considered to be different species until they were found growing in a conjoined manner
evidence that lichens are examples of successful symbiosis is the fact that lichens can be found in almost every habitat and geographic area on the planet two species in two genera of green algae are found in over 35% of all lichens but can only rarely be found living on their own outside of a lichen
in a case where one fungal partner simultaneously had two green algae partners that outperform each other in different climates this might indicate having more than one photosynthetic partner at the same time might enable the lichen to exist in a wider range of habitats and geographic locations
phycobionts can have a net output of sugars with only water vapor the thallus must be saturated with liquid water for cyanobionts to photosynthesize
algae produce sugars that are absorbed by the fungus by diffusion into special fungal hyphae called appressoria or haustoria in contact with the wall of the algal cells the appressoria or haustoria may produce a substance that increases permeability of the algal cell walls and may penetrate the walls the algae may lose up to 80% of their sugar production to the fungus
==== debate over mutualism vs commensalism and/or parasitismedit ====
lichen associations may be examples of mutualism commensalism or even parasitism depending on the species there is evidence to suggest that the lichen symbiosis is parasitic or commensalistic rather than mutualistic the photosynthetic partner can exist in nature independently of the fungal partner but not vice versa photobiont cells are routinely destroyed in the course of nutrient exchange the association is able to continue because reproduction of the photobiont cells matches the rate at which they are destroyed the fungus surrounds the algal cells often enclosing them within complex fungal tissues unique to lichen associations in many species the fungus penetrates the algal cell wall forming penetration pegs (haustoria) similar to those produced by fungi that feed on a host (pathogenic fungi) cyanobacteria in laboratory settings can grow faster when they are alone rather than when they are part of a lichen
==== miniature ecosystem and holobiont theoryedit ====
symbiosis in lichens is so well-balanced that lichens have been considered to be relatively self-contained miniature ecosystems in and of themselves it is thought that lichens may be even more complex symbiotic systems that include non-photosynthetic bacterial communities performing other functions as partners in a holobiont
==== lichenicolous fungiedit ====
some fungi can only be found living on lichens and some only on those lichens (obligate parasites) these are referred to as lichenicolous fungi which are a different species from the fungus living inside the lichen and are not considered to be part of the lichen
=== reaction to wateredit ===
moisture makes the cortex become more transparent this way the algae can conduct photosynthesis when moisture is available and is protected at other times when the cortex is more transparent the algae shows more clearly and the lichen looks greener
=== metabolites metabolite structures and bioactivityedit ===
lichens can show intense antioxidant activity secondary metabolites are often deposited as crystals in the apoplast
sometimes lichens contain structures made from fungal metabolites for example crustose lichens sometimes have a polysaccharide layer in the cortex
=== substrate preferenceedit ===
secondary metabolites are thought to play a role in preference for some substrates over others
=== growth rateedit ===
lichens often have a regular but very slow growth rate of less than a millimeter per year different lichen species have been measured to grow as slowly as 0.5 mm and as fast as 0.5 meter per year
in crustose lichens the area along the margin is where the most active growth is taking place most crustose lichens grow only 12 mm in diameter per year
=== life spanedit ===
lichens may be long-lived (longevity) with some considered to be among the oldest living things lifespan is difficult to measure because the definition of what constitutes the same individual lichen is not precise lichens grow by vegetatively having a piece break off which may or may not be considered to be the same lichen and because two lichens can grow into each other and then become the same lichen
=== response to environmental stressedit ===
unlike simple dehydration in plants and animals lichens may experience a complete loss of body water in dry periods lichens are capable of surviving extremely low levels of water content (poikilohydric) they quickly absorb water when it becomes available again becoming soft and fleshy re-configuration of membranes following a period of dehydration requires several minutes or more
in tests lichen survived and showed remarkable results on the adaptation capacity of photosynthetic activity within the simulation time of 34 days under martian conditions in the mars simulation laboratory (msl) maintained by the german aerospace center (dlr)
the european space agency has discovered that lichens can survive unprotected in space in an experiment led by leopoldo sancho from the complutense university of madrid two species of lichenrhizocarpon geographicum and xanthoria eleganswere sealed in a capsule and launched on a russian soyuz rocket 31 may 2005 once in orbit the capsules were opened and the lichens were directly exposed to the vacuum of space with its widely fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation after 15 days the lichens were brought back to earth and were found to be in full health with no discernible damage from their time in orbit
== reproduction and dispersaledit ==
=== vegetative reproductionedit ===
many lichens reproduce asexually either by a piece breaking off and growing on its own (vegetative reproduction) or through the dispersal of diaspores containing a few algal cells surrounded by fungal cells because of the relative lack of differentiation in the thallus the line between diaspore formation and vegetative reproduction is often blurred fruticose lichens can easily fragment and new lichens can grow from the fragment (vegetative reproduction) many lichens break up into fragments when they dry dispersing themselves by wind action to resume growth when moisture returns soredia (singular soredium") are small groups of algal cells surrounded by fungal filaments that form in structures called soralia from which the soredia can be dispersed by wind isidia (singular isidium") are branched spiny elongated outgrowths from the thallus that break off for mechanical dispersal lichen propagules (diaspores) typically contain cells from both partners although the fungal components of so-called fringe species rely instead on algal cells dispersed by the core species
=== sexual reproductionedit ===
structures involved in reproduction often appear as discs bumps or squiggly lines on the surface of the thallus only the fungal partner in a lichen reproduces sexually many lichen fungi reproduce sexually like other fungi producing spores formed by meiosis and fusion of gametes following dispersal such fungal spores must meet with a compatible algal partner before a functional lichen can form this may be a common form of reproduction in basidiolichens which form fruiting bodies resembling their nonlichenized relatives
lichens that are in basidiomycetes produce mushroom-like reproductive structures
most lichen fungi belong to ascomycetes (ascolichens) among the ascolichens spores are produced in spore-producing structures called ascomata the most common types of ascomata are the apothecium (plural apothecia) and perithecium (plural perithecia) apothecia are usually cups or plate-like discs located on the top surface of the lichen thallus when apothecia are shaped like squiggly line segments instead of like discs they are called lirellae perithecia are shaped like flasks that are immersed in the lichen thallus tissue which has a small hole for the spores to escape the flask and appear like black dots on the lichen surface
the three most common spore body types being raised discs called apothecia (singular apothecium) bottle-like cups with a small hole at the top called perithecia (singular perithecium) and pycnidia (singular pycnidium) shaped like perithecia but without asci (an ascus is the structure that contains and releases the sexual spores in fungi of the ascomycota)
the apothecium has a layer of exposed spore-producing cells called asci (singular ascus) and is usually a different color from the thallus tissue when the apothecium has an outer margin the margin is called the exciple when the exciple has a color similar to colored thallus tissue the apothecium or lichen is called lecanorine meaning similar to members of the genus lecanora when the exciple is blackened like carbon it is called lecideine meaning similar to members of the genus lecidea when the margin is pale or colorless it is called biatorine
a podetium (plural podetia) is a lichenized rm linkstem-like structure of an the fruiting body rising from the thallus associated with some fungi that produce a fungal apothecium since it is part of the reproductive tissue podetia are not considered part of the main body (thallus) but may be visually prominent the podetium may be branched and sometimes cup-like they usually bear the fungal pycnidia or apothecia or both many lichens have apothecia that are visible to the naked eye
most lichens produce abundant sexual structures many species appear to disperse only by sexual spores for example the crustose lichens graphis scripta and ochrolechia parella produce no symbiotic vegetative propagules instead the lichen-forming fungi of these species reproduce sexually by self-fertilization (i.e they are homothallic) this breeding system may enable successful reproduction in harsh environments
mazaedia (singular mazaedium) are apothecia shaped like a dressmaker's pin in (pin lichen)s where the fruiting body is a brown or black mass of loose ascospores enclosed by a cup-shaped exciple which sits on top of a tiny stalk
== taxonomy and classificationedit ==
lichens are classified by the fungal component lichen species are given the same scientific name (binomial name) as the fungus species in the lichen lichens are being integrated into the classification schemes for fungi the alga bears its own scientific name which bears no relationship to that of the lichen or fungi there are about 13,50017,000 identified lichen species nearly 20% of known fungal species are associated with lichens
lichenized fungus may refer to the entire lichen or to just the fungus this may cause confusion without context a particular fungus species may form lichens with different algae species giving rise to what appear to be different lichen species but which are still classified (as of 2014) as the same lichen species
formerly some lichen taxonomists placed lichens in their own division the mycophycophyta but this practice is no longer accepted because the components belong to separate lineages neither the ascolichens nor the basidiolichens form monophyletic lineages in their respective fungal phyla but they do form several major solely or primarily lichen-forming groups within each phylum even more unusual than basidiolichens is the fungus geosiphon pyriforme a member of the glomeromycota that is unique in that it encloses a cyanobacterial symbiont inside its cells geosiphon is not usually considered to be a lichen and its peculiar symbiosis was not recognized for many years the genus is more closely allied to endomycorrhizal genera
lichens independently emerged from fungi associating with algae and cyanobacteria at least twice in history
=== fungiedit ===
the fungal component of a lichen is called the mycobiont the mycobiont may be an ascomycete or basidiomycete the associated lichens are called either ascolichens or basidiolichens respectively living as a symbiont in a lichen appears to be a successful way for a fungus to derive essential nutrients since about 20% of all fungal species have acquired this mode of life
thalli produced by a given fungal symbiont with its differing partners may be similar and the secondary metabolites identical indicating that the fungus has the dominant role in determining the morphology of the lichen but the same mycobiont with different photobionts may also produce very different growth forms lichens are known in which there is one fungus associated with two or even three algal species
although each lichen thallus generally appears homogeneous some evidence seems to suggest that the fungal component may consist of more than one genetic individual of that species
the following table lists the orders and families of fungi that include lichen-forming species
two or more fungal species can interact to form the same lichen
=== photobiontsedit ===
the photosynthetic partner in a lichen is called a photobiont the photobiont in lichens come from a wide variety of simple prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms the majority of the lichens contain eukaryotic photobionts that are green algae (chlorophyta) or yellow-green algae (xanthophyta) the prokaryotes are blue green algae (cyanobacteria) algal photobionts are called phycobionts cyanobacterium photobionts are called cyanobionts about 90% of all known lichens have phycobionts and about 10 have cyanobionts sometimes the photobiont is a green alga (chlorophyta) or other eukaryote sometimes a blue-green alga (cyanobacteria and sometimes both approximately 100 species of photosynthetic partners from 40 genera and five distinct classes (prokaryotic cyanophyceae eukaryotic trebouxiophyceae phaeophyceae chlorophyceae) have been found to associate with the lichen-forming fungi
common algal photobionts are from the genus trebouxia trentepohlia pseudotrebouxia or myrmecia (algae) trebouxia is the most common genus of green algae in lichens occurring in about 40% of all lichens trebouxioid means either a photobiont that is in the genus trebouxia or resembles a member of that genus and is therefore presumably a member of the class trebouxiophyceae the second most commonly represented green alga genus is trentepohlia overall about 100 species of eukaryotes are known to occur as photobionts in lichens all the algae are probably able to exist independently in nature as well as in the lichen
a cyanolichen is a lichen with a cyanobacterium as its main photosynthetic component (photobiont) the most commonly occurring cyanobacteria genus is nostoc other common cyanobacterium photobionts are from scytonema many cyanolichens are small and black and have limestone as the substrate another cyanolichen group the jelly lichens (e.g. from the genera collema or leptogium) are large and foliose (e.g. species of peltigera lobaria and degelia these lichen species are grey-blue especially when dampend or wet many of these characterize the lobarion communities of higher rainfall areas in western britain e.g. in the celtic rainforest strains of cyanobacteria found in various cyanolichens are often closely related to one another they differ from the most closely related free-living strains
the lichen association is a close symbiosis it extends the ecological range of both partners but is not always obligatory for their growth and reproduction in natural environments since many of the algal symbionts can live independently a prominent example is the alga trentepohlia which forms orange-coloured populations on tree trunks and suitable rock faces lichen propagules (diaspores) typically contain cells from both partners although the fungal components of so-called fringe species rely instead on algal cells dispersed by the core species
the same cyanobiont species can occur in association with different fungal species as lichen partners the same phycobiont species can occur in association with different fungal species as lichen partners more than one phycobiont may be present in a single thallus
although each lichen thallus generally appears homogeneous some evidence seems to suggest that the photobiont component may consist of more than one genetic individual of that species a single lichen may contain several algal genotypes these multiple genotypes may better enable response to adaptation to environmental changes and enable the lichen to inhabit a wider range of environments
=== controversy over classification method and species namesedit ===
there are about 20,000 known lichen species but what is meant by species is different from what is meant by biological species in plants animals or fungi where being the same species implies that there is a common ancestral lineage because lichens are combinations of members of two or even three different biological kingdoms these components must have a different ancestral lineage from each other by convention lichens are still called species anyway and are classified according to the species of their fungus not the species of the algae or cyanobacteria lichens are given the same scientific name (binomial name) as the fungus in them which may cause some confusion the algae bears its own scientific name which has no relationship to the name of the lichen or fungi
depending on context lichenized fungus may refer to the entire lichen or to the fungus when it is in the lichen which can be grown in culture in isolation from the algae or cyanobacteria some algae and cyanobacteria are found naturally living outside of the lichen the fungal algal or cyanobacterial component of a lichen can be grown by itself in culture when growing by themselves the fungus algae or cyanobacteria have very different properties than those of the lichen lichen properties such as growth form physiology and biochemistry are very different from the combination of the properties of the fungus and the algae and/or cyanobacteria
the same fungus growing in combination with different algae and/or cyanobacteria can produce lichens that are very different in most properties meeting non-dna criteria for being different species historically these different combinations were classified as different species when the fungus is identified as being the same using modern dna methods these apparently different species get reclassified as the same species under the current (2014) convention for classification by fungal component this has led to debate about this classification convention these apparently different species have their own independent evolutionary history
there is also debate as to the appropriateness of giving the same binomial name to the fungus and to the lichen that combines that fungus with an alga or cyanobacterium (synecdoche) this is especially the case when combining the same fungus with different algae or cyanobacteria produces dramatically different lichen organisms which would be considered different species by any measure other than the dna of the fungal component if the whole lichen produced by the same fungus growing in association with different algae or cyanobacteria were to be classified as different species the number of lichen species would be greater
=== diversityedit ===
the largest number of lichenized fungi occur in the ascomycota with about 40% of species forming such an association some of these lichenized fungi occur in orders with nonlichenized fungi that live as saprotrophs or plant parasites (for example the leotiales dothideales and pezizales) other lichen fungi occur in only five orders in which all members are engaged in this habit (orders graphidales gyalectales peltigerales pertusariales and teloschistales) lichenized and nonlichenized fungi can even be found in the same genus or species overall about 98% of lichens have an ascomycetous mycobiont next to the ascomycota the largest number of lichenized fungi occur in the unassigned fungi imperfecti a catch-all category for fungi whose sexual form of reproduction has never been observed comparatively few basidiomycetes are lichenized but these include agarics such as species of lichenomphalia clavarioid fungi such as species of multiclavula and corticioid fungi such as species of dictyonema
=== identification methodsedit ===
lichen identification uses growth form and reactions to chemical tests
pd refers to the outcome of the pd test or is used as an abbreviation for the chemical used in the test para-phenylenediamine if putting a drop on a lichen turns an area bright yellow to orange this helps identify it as belonging to either the genus cladonia or lecanora
=== evolution and paleontologyedit ===
the evolution of lichens and the phylum ascomycota is complex and not well understood but because there are fifteen different classes of ascomycetes scientists generally believe that different lichens have evolved independently from one another through analogous evolution lichenized fungi have continued to evolve developing differently from those that do not form lichens
lichenization is an ancient nutritional strategy for fungi
the fossil record for lichens is poor the extreme habitats that lichens dominate such as tundra mountains and deserts are not ordinarily conducive to producing fossils the oldest fossil lichens in which both symbiotic partners have been recovered date to the early devonian rhynie chert about 400 million years old the slightly older fossil spongiophyton has also been interpreted as a lichen on morphological and isotopic grounds although the isotopic basis is decidedly shaky it has been suggestedalthough not yet proventhat the even older fossil nematothallus was a lichen
it has also been claimed that ediacaran fossils were lichens though this claim is controversial additional evidence has been marshalled for a lichen interpretation of dickinsonia lichen-like fossils consisting of coccoid cells and thin filaments preserved in marine phosphorite of the doushantuo formation in southern china these fossils are thought to be 551 to 635 million years old (belonging to the neoproterozoic era) discovery of these fossils suggest that fungi developed symbiotic partnerships with photoautotrophs long before the evolution of vascular plants winfrenatia an early zygomycetous lichen symbiosis that may have involved controlled parasitism is an impression found in scotland belonging to the early devonian times there are also several examples of fossilized lichens embedded in amber the fossilized anzia is found in pieces of amber in northern europe and dates back approximately 40 million years fossilized lobaria comes from trinity county in northern california usa and dates back to the early to middle miocene
in 1995 gargas and colleagues proposed that there were at least five independent origins of lichenization three in the basidiomycetes and at least two in the ascomycetes however lutzoni et al (2000) indicate that lichenization probably evolved earlier and was followed by multiple independent losses some non-lichen-forming fungi may have secondarily lost the ability to form a lichen association as a result lichenization has been viewed as a highly successful nutritional strategy
lichens were a component of the early terrestrial ecosystems and the estimated age of the oldest terrestrial lichen fossil is 400 ma recent (2009) studies suggest that the ancestral ecological state of the ascomycota was saprobism and that independent lichenization events have occurred multiple times
== ecology and interactions with environmentedit ==
=== substrates and habitatsedit ===
lichens grow in a wide range of substrates and habitats including some of the most extreme conditions on earth they are abundant growing on bark leaves and hanging from branches living on thin air (epiphytes) in rain forests and in temperate woodland they grow on bare rock walls gravestones roofs exposed soil surfaces they can survive in some of the most extreme environments on earth arctic tundra hot dry deserts rocky coasts and toxic slag heaps they can even live inside solid rock growing between the grains and in the soil as part of a biological soil crust in arid habitats such as deserts some lichens do not grow on anything living out their lives blowing about the environment
when growing on mineral surfaces some lichens slowly decompose their substrate by chemically degrading and physically disrupting the minerals contributing to the process of weathering by which rocks are gradually turned into soil while this contribution to weathering is usually benign it can cause problems for artificial stone structures for example there is an ongoing lichen growth problem on mount rushmore national memorial that requires the employment of mountain-climbing conservators to clean the monument
lichens are not parasites on the plants they grow on but only use them as a substrate to grow on the fungi of some lichen species may take over the algae of other lichen species lichens make their own food from their photosynthetic parts and by absorbing minerals from the environment lichens growing on leaves may have the appearance of being parasites on the leaves but they are not however some lichens notably those of the genus diploschistes are known to parasitise other lichens diploschistes muscorum starts its development in the tissue of a host cladonia species
in the arctic tundra lichens together with mosses and liverworts make up the majority of the ground cover which helps insulate the ground and may provide forage for grazing animals an example is reindeer moss which is a lichen not a moss
a crustose lichen that grows on rock is called a saxicolous lichen crustose lichens that grow on the rock are epilithic and those that grow immersed inside rock growing between the crystals with only their fruiting bodies exposed to the air are called endolithic lichens a crustose lichen that grows on bark is called a corticolous lichen a lichen that grows on wood from which the bark has been stripped is called a lignicolous lichen lichens that grow immersed inside plant tissues are called endophloidic lichens or endophloidal lichens lichens that use leaves as substrates whether the leaf is still on the tree or on the ground are called epiphyllous or foliicolous a terricolous lichen grows on the soil as a substrate many squamulous lichens are terricolous umbillicate lichens are foliose lichens that are attached to the substrate at only one point a vagrant lichen is not attached to a substrate at all and lives its life being blown around by the wind
=== lichens and soilsedit ===
in addition to distinct physical mechanisms by which lichens break down raw stone recent studies indicate lichens attack stone chemically entering newly chelated minerals into the ecology
the lichen exudates which have powerful chelating capacity the widespread occurrence of mineral neoformation particularly metal oxalates together with the characteristics of weathered substrates all confirm the significance of lichens as chemical weathering agents
over time this activity creates new fertile soil from lifeless stone
lichens may be important in contributing nitrogen to soils in some deserts through being eaten along with their rock substrate by snails which then defecate putting the nitrogen into the soils lichens help bind and stabilize soil sand in dunes in deserts and semi-arid areas lichens are part of extensive living biological soil crusts essential for maintaining the soil structure
=== ecological interactionsedit ===
lichens are pioneer species among the first living things to grow on bare rock or areas denuded of life by a disaster lichens may have to compete with plants for access to sunlight but because of their small size and slow growth they thrive in places where higher plants have difficulty growing lichens are often the first to settle in places lacking soil constituting the sole vegetation in some extreme environments such as those found at high mountain elevations and at high latitudes some survive in the tough conditions of deserts and others on frozen soil of the arctic regions
a major ecophysiological advantage of lichens is that they are poikilohydric (poikilo- variable hydric- relating to water) meaning that though they have little control over the status of their hydration they can tolerate irregular and extended periods of severe desiccation like some mosses liverworts ferns and a few resurrection plants upon desiccation lichens enter a metabolic suspension or stasis (known as cryptobiosis) in which the cells of the lichen symbionts are dehydrated to a degree that halts most biochemical activity in this cryptobiotic state lichens can survive wider extremes of temperature radiation and drought in the harsh environments they often inhabit
lichens do not have roots and do not need to tap continuous reservoirs of water like most higher plants thus they can grow in locations impossible for most plants such as bare rock sterile soil or sand and various artificial structures such as walls roofs and monuments many lichens also grow as epiphytes (epi- on the surface phyte- plant) on plants particularly on the trunks and branches of trees when growing on plants lichens are not parasites they do not consume any part of the plant nor poison it some ground-dwelling lichens such as members of the subgenus cladina (reindeer lichens) however produce allelopathic chemicals that leach into the soil and inhibit the germination of plant seeds and growth of young plants stability (that is longevity) of their substrate is a major factor of lichen habitats most lichens grow on stable rock surfaces or the bark of old trees but many others grow on soil and sand in these latter cases lichens are often an important part of soil stabilization indeed in some desert ecosystems vascular (higher) plant seeds cannot become established except in places where lichen crusts stabilize the sand and help retain water
lichens may be eaten by some animals such as reindeer living in arctic regions the larvae of a number of lepidoptera species feed exclusively on lichens these include common footman and marbled beauty however lichens are very low in protein and high in carbohydrates making them unsuitable for some animals lichens are also used by the northern flying squirrel for nesting food and a water source during winter
=== effects of air pollutionedit ===
if lichens are exposed to air pollutants at all times without any deciduous parts they are unable to avoid the accumulation of pollutants also lacking stomata and a cuticle lichens may absorb aerosols and gases over the entire thallus surface from which they may readily diffuse to the photobiont layer because lichens do not possess roots their primary source of most elements is the air and therefore elemental levels in lichens often reflect the accumulated composition of ambient air the processes by which atmospheric deposition occurs include fog and dew gaseous absorption and dry deposition consequently many environmental studies with lichens emphasize their feasibility as effective biomonitors of atmospheric quality
not all lichens are equally sensitive to air pollutants so different lichen species show different levels of sensitivity to specific atmospheric pollutants the sensitivity of a lichen to air pollution is directly related to the energy needs of the mycobiont so that the stronger the dependency of the mycobiont on the photobiont the more sensitive the lichen is to air pollution upon exposure to air pollution the photobiont may use metabolic energy for repair of its cellular structures that would otherwise be used for maintenance of its photosynthetic activity therefore leaving less metabolic energy available for the mycobiont the alteration of the balance between the photobiont and mycobiont can lead to the breakdown of the symbiotic association therefore lichen decline may result not only from the accumulation of toxic substances but also from altered nutrient supplies that favor one symbiont over the other
this interaction between lichens and air pollution has been used as a means of monitoring air quality since 1859 with more systematic methods developed by william nylander in 1866
== human useedit ==
=== foodedit ===
lichens are eaten by many different cultures across the world although some lichens are only eaten in times of famine others are a staple food or even a delicacy two obstacles are often encountered when eating lichens lichen polysaccharides are generally indigestible to humans and lichens usually contain mildly toxic secondary compounds that should be removed before eating very few lichens are poisonous but those high in vulpinic acid or usnic acid are toxic most poisonous lichens are yellow
in the past iceland moss (cetraria islandica) was an important human food in northern europe and was cooked as a bread porridge pudding soup or salad wila (bryoria fremontii) was an important food in parts of north america where it was usually pitcooked northern peoples in north america and siberia traditionally eat the partially digested reindeer lichen (cladina spp.) after they remove it from the rumen of caribou or reindeer that have been killed rock tripe (umbilicaria spp and lasalia spp.) is a lichen that has frequently been used as an emergency food in north america and one species umbilicaria esculenta is used in a variety of traditional korean and japanese foods
=== lichenometryedit ===
lichenometry is a technique used to determine the age of exposed rock surfaces based on the size of lichen thalli introduced by beschel in the 1950s the technique has found many applications it is used in archaeology palaeontology and geomorphology it uses the presumed regular but slow rate of lichen growth to determine the age of exposed rock measuring the diameter (or other size measurement) of the largest lichen of a species on a rock surface indicates the length of time since the rock surface was first exposed lichen can be preserved on old rock faces for up to 10,000 years providing the maximum age limit of the technique though it is most accurate (within 10% error) when applied to surfaces that have been exposed for less than 1,000 years lichenometry is especially useful for dating surfaces less than 500 years old as radiocarbon dating techniques are less accurate over this period the lichens most commonly used for lichenometry are those of the genera rhizocarpon (e.g the species rhizocarpon geographicum) and xanthoria
=== biodegradationedit ===
lichens have been shown to degrade polyester resins as can be seen in archaeological sites in the roman city of baelo claudia spain lichens can accumulate several environmental pollutants such as lead copper and radionuclides
=== as dyesedit ===
many lichens produce secondary compounds including pigments that reduce harmful amounts of sunlight and powerful toxins that reduce herbivory or kill bacteria these compounds are very useful for lichen identification and have had economic importance as dyes such as cudbear or primitive antibiotics
the ph indicator (indicated acidic or basic) in the litmus test is a dye extracted from the lichen roccella tinctoria by boiling
in the highlands of scotland traditional dyes for harris tweed and other traditional cloths were made from lichens including the orange xanthoria parietina and the grey foliaceous parmelia saxatilis common on rocks known as crottle
there are reports dating almost 2000 years old of lichens being used to make purple and red dyes of great historical and commercial significance are lichens belonging to the family roccellaceae commonly called orchella weed or orchil orcein and other lichen dyes have largely been replaced by synthetic versions
=== antibiotic metabolitesedit ===
lichens produce metabolites proven useful in the medical community most metabolites produced by lichens are structurally and functionally similar to broad-spectrum antibiotics while few are associated respectively to antiseptic similarities these organic acids are the metabolic byproducts of crassulacean acid metabolism the means of photosynthesis by lichens
usnic acid is the most commonly studied metabolite produced by lichens and has been associated with the suppression of tuberculosis it has also proven bactericidal against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus and is considered an antimicrobial agent it is still unclear if the antimicrobial processes derived from lichens are strictly due to their metabolites or their symbiotic relationship with the fungi that grows on it
=== aesthetic appealedit ===
colonies of lichens may be spectacular in appearance dominating the surface of the visual landscape as part of the aesthetic appeal to paying visitors of yosemite national park and sequoia national park orange and yellow lichens add to the ambience of desert trees rock faces tundras and rocky seashores intricate webs of lichens hanging from tree branches add a mysterious aspect to forests fruticose lichens are used in model railroading and other modeling hobbies as a material for making miniature trees and shrubs
=== traditional medicineedit ===
lichens have been used in nonscientific traditional medicine practices of many cultures historically in europe lobaria pulmonaria was collected in large quantities as lungwort due to its lung-like appearance (see doctrine of signatures) similarly peltigera leucophlebia was used as a supposed cure for thrush due to the resemblance of its cephalodia to the appearance of the disease
=== in literatureedit ===
the talmud (sanhedrin 19b) translates the hebrew word vayilafeth in ruth 3:8 as referring to ruth entwining herself around boaz like lichen
the plot of john wyndham's novel trouble with lichen revolves around an anti-ageing chemical extracted from a lichen
=== potential application in treating mad cow diseaseedit ===
an article published in plos one indicates that a serine protease isolated from certain species of lichen degrades prions
== historyedit ==
although lichens had been recognized as organisms for quite some time it was not until 1867 when swiss botanist simon schwendener proposed his dual theory of lichens that lichens are a combination of fungi with algae or cyanobacteria whereby the true nature of the lichen association began to emerge schwendener's hypothesis which at the time lacked experimental evidence arose from his extensive analysis of the anatomy and development in lichens algae and fungi using a light microscope many of the leading lichenologists at the time such as james crombie and nylander rejected schwendener's hypothesis because the common consensus was that all living organisms were autonomous
other prominent biologists such as heinrich anton de bary albert bernhard frank melchior treub and hermann hellriegel were not so quick to reject schwendener's ideas and the concept soon spread into other areas of study such as microbial plant animal and human pathogens when the complex relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and their hosts were finally identified schwendener's hypothesis began to gain popularity further experimental proof of the dual nature of lichens was obtained when eugen thomas published his results in 1939 on the first successful re-synthesis experiment
