endocrine system
endocrine systems found varieties animals endocrine system consists glands secrete hormones receptors detect react hormones
hormones travel throughout body act chemical messengers hormones interface cells contain matching receptors surfaces hormone binds receptor much like key would fit lock endocrine system regulates adjustments slower internal processes using hormones messengers endocrine system secretes hormones response environmental stimuli orchestrate developmental reproductive changes adjustments brought endocrine system biochemical changing cells internal external chemistry bring long term change body systems work together maintain proper functioning body entire life cycle sex steroids estrogens androgens well thyroid hormones subject feedback regulation tends limit sensitivity glands
hormones work small doses part per billion ranges endocrine disruption thereby also occur lowdose exposure exogenous hormones hormonally active chemicals interfere receptors hormonally mediated processes furthermore since endogenous hormones already present body biologically active concentrations additional exposure relatively small amounts exogenous hormonally active substances disrupt proper functioning bodys endocrine system thus endocrine disruptor elicit adverse effects much lower doses toxicity acting different mechanism
timing exposure also critical critical stages development occur utero fertilized egg divides rapidly developing every structure fully formed baby including much wiring brain interfering hormonal communication utero profound effects structurally toward brain development depending stage reproductive development interference hormonal signaling result irreversible effects seen adults exposed dose length time experiments animals identified critical developmental time points utero days birth exposure chemicals interfere mimic hormones adverse effects persist adulthood disruption thyroid function early development may cause abnormal sexual development males females early motor development impairment learning disabilities
studies cell cultures laboratory animals wildlife accidentally exposed humans show environmental chemicals cause wide range reproductive developmental growth behavior effects endocrine disruption humans pollutant chemicals remains largely undemonstrated underlying science sound potential effects real compounds produce estrogenic androgenic antiandrogenic antithyroid actions studied less known interactions hormones

doseresponse controversy
one major objection theory endocrine disruptors dosage effect large gap high exposures seen laboratory experiment versus relatively low levels found environment critics argue doseresponse relationship data suggest amounts chemicals actually environment low cause effect consensus statement learning developmental disabilities initiative rebuts criticism arguing lowdose effects endocrine disruptors cannot predicted highdose studies contradicts standard dose makes poison rule toxicology nontraditional doseresponse curves referred nonmonotonic dose response curves furthermore endocrine disrupting effects noted animals exposed environmentally relevant levels chemicals example researchers found common flame retardant bde affects reproductive system thyroid gland female rats doses order humans exposed
dosage objection could also overcome low concentrations different endocrine disruptors synergistic asserted paper arnold paper published science june one reason passage food quality protection act results could confirmed alternative methodologies original paper retracted arnold found committed scientific misconduct united states office research integrity subsequent papers authors demonstrated low concentrations endocrine disruptors synergistic effects amphibians clear effect mediated endocrine system
