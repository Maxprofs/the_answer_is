a sinkhole also known as a cenote sink sink-hole shakehole swallet swallow hole or doline (the different terms for sinkholes are often used interchangeably) is a depression or hole in the ground caused by some form of collapse of the surface layer some are caused by karst processesfor example the chemical dissolution of carbonate rocks or suffosion processes sinkholes may vary in size from 1 to 600 m (3.3 to 2,000 ft) both in diameter and depth and vary in form from soil-lined bowls to bedrock-edged chasms sinkholes may be formed gradually or suddenly and are found worldwide on 2 july 2015 scientists reported that active pits related to sinkhole collapses and possibly associated with outbursts have been found on the comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko by the rosetta space probe
== formationedit ==
=== natural processesedit ===
sinkholes may capture surface drainage from running or standing water but may also form in high and dry places in specific locations
the formation of sinkholes involves natural processes of erosion or gradual removal of slightly soluble bedrock (such as limestone) by percolating water the collapse of a cave roof or a lowering of the water table sinkholes often form through the process of suffosion for example groundwater may dissolve the carbonate cement holding the sandstone particles together and then carry away the lax particles gradually forming a void
occasionally a sinkhole may exhibit a visible opening into a cave below in the case of exceptionally large sinkholes such as the miny sinkhole in papua new guinea or cedar sink at mammoth cave national park in kentucky an underground stream or river may be visible across its bottom flowing from one side to the other
sinkholes are common where the rock below the land surface is limestone or other carbonate rock salt beds or in other rocks such as gypsum that can be dissolved naturally by circulating ground water sinkholes also occur in sandstone and quartzite terrains
as the rock dissolves spaces and caverns develop underground these sinkholes can be dramatic because the surface land usually stays intact until there is not enough support then a sudden collapse of the land surface can occur
=== artificial processesedit ===
sinkholes also form from human activity such as the collapse of abandoned mines and salt cavern storage in salt domes in places like louisiana mississippi and texas more commonly sinkholes occur in urban areas due to water main breaks or sewer collapses when old pipes give way they can also occur from the overpumping and extraction of groundwater and subsurface fluids
sinkholes can also form when natural water-drainage patterns are changed and new water-diversion systems are developed some sinkholes form when the land surface is changed such as when industrial and runoff-storage ponds are created the substantial weight of the new material can trigger an underground collapse of supporting material thus causing a sinkhole

sinkholes are frequently linked with karst landscapes in such regions there may be hundreds or even thousands of sinkholes in a small area so that the surface as seen from the air looks pock-marked and there are no surface streams because all drainage occurs subsurface examples of karst landscapes dotted with numerous enormous sinkholes are the khammouan mountains (laos) and mamo plateau (papua new guinea) the largest known sinkholes formed in sandstone are sima humboldt and sima martel in venezuela
some sinkholes form in thick layers of homogenous limestone their formation is facilitated by high groundwater flow often caused by high rainfall such rainfall causes formation of the giant sinkholes in the nakana mountains on the new britain island in papua new guinea on the contact of limestone and insoluble rock below it powerful underground rivers may form creating large underground voids
in such conditions the largest known sinkholes of the world have formed like the 662-metre (2,172 ft) deep xiaozhai tiankeng (chongqing china) giant stanos in quertaro and san luis potos states in mexico and others
unusual processes have formed the enormous sinkholes of sistema zacatn in tamaulipas (mexico) where more than 20 sinkholes and other karst formations have been shaped by volcanically heated acidic groundwater this has produced not only the formation of the deepest water-filled sinkhole in the worldzacatnbut also unique processes of travertine sedimentation in upper parts of sinkholes leading to sealing of these sinkholes with travertine lids
the state of florida in the united states is known for having frequent sinkhole collapses especially in the central part of the state the murge area in southern italy also has numerous sinkholes sinkholes can be formed in retention ponds from large amounts of rain
== human usesedit ==
sinkholes have been used for centuries as disposal sites for various forms of waste a consequence of this is the pollution of groundwater resources with serious health implications in such areas the maya civilization sometimes used sinkholes in the yucatn peninsula (known as cenotes) as places to deposit precious items and human sacrifices
when sinkholes are very deep or connected to caves they may offer challenges for experienced cavers or when water-filled divers some of the most spectacular are the zacatn cenote in mexico (the world's deepest water-filled sinkhole) the boesmansgat sinkhole in south africa sarisariama tepuy in venezuela the stano del barro in mexico and in the town of mount gambier south australia sinkholes that form in coral reefs and islands that collapse to enormous depths are known as blue holes and often become popular diving spots
== local namesedit ==
large and visually unusual sinkholes have been well-known to local people since ancient times nowadays sinkholes are grouped and named in site-specific or generic names some examples of such names are listed below
black holes this term refers to a group of unique round water-filled pits in the bahamas these formations seem to be dissolved in carbonate mud from above by the sea water the dark color of the water is caused by a layer of phototropic microorganisms concentrated in a dense purple colored layer at 15 to 20 m (49 to 66 ft) depth this layer swallows the light metabolism in the layer of microorganisms causes heating of the water the only known case in the natural world where microorganisms create significant thermal effects one of them is the black hole of andros
blue holes this name was initially given to the deep underwater sinkholes of the bahamas but is often used for any deep water-filled pits formed in carbonate rocks the name originates from the deep blue color of water in these sinkholes which is created by the high clarity of the water and the great depth of the sinkholes only the deep blue color of the visible spectrum can penetrate such depth and return after reflection
cenotes this refers to the characteristic water-filled sinkholes in the yucatn peninsula belize and some other regions many cenotes have formed in limestone deposited in shallow seas created by the chicxulub meteorite's impact
stanos this name is given to several giant pits in several states of mexico
tiankengs these are extremely large sinkholes typically deeper and wider than 250 m (820 ft) with mostly vertical walls most often created by the collapse of underground caverns the term means sky hole in chinese many of this largest type of sinkhole are located in china
tomo this term is used in new zealand karst country to describe pot holes

the 2010 guatemala city sinkhole formed suddenly in may of that year torrential rains from tropical storm agatha and a bad drainage system were blamed for its creation it swallowed a three-story building and a house it measured approximately 20 m (66 ft) wide and 30 m (98 ft) deep a similar hole had formed nearby in february 2007
this large vertical hole is not a true sinkhole as it did not form via the dissolution of limestone dolomite marble or any other water-soluble rock guatemala city is not underlain by any carbonate rock instead thick deposits of volcanic ash unwelded ash flow tuffs and other pyroclastic debris underlie all of guatemala city the dissolution of rock did not form the large vertical holes that swallowed up parts of guatemala city in 2007 and 2010
the guatemala city holes are instead an example of piping pseudokarst created by the collapse of large cavities that had developed in the weak crumbly quaternary volcanic deposits underlying the city although weak and crumbly these volcanic deposits have enough cohesion to allow them to stand in vertical faces and to develop large subterranean voids within them a process called soil piping first created large underground voids as water from leaking water mains flowed through these volcanic deposits and mechanically washed fine volcanic materials out of them then progressively eroded and removed coarser materials eventually these underground voids became large enough that their roofs collapsed to create large holes
