a woman is a female human the term woman is usually reserved for an adult with the term girl being the usual term for a female child or adolescent however the term woman is also sometimes used to identify a female human regardless of age as in phrases such as women's rights woman may also refer to a person's gender identity instead of their sex women are typically capable of giving birth from puberty until menopause although some sterile intersex and/or transgender women cannot throughout history women have assumed or been assigned various social roles
== etymology ==
the spelling of woman in english has progressed over the past millennium from wfmann to wmmann to wumman and finally the modern spelling woman in old english wfmann meant female human whereas wr meant male human mann or monn had a gender-neutral meaning of human corresponding to modern english person or someone however subsequent to the norman conquest man began to be used more in reference to male human and by the late 13th century had begun to eclipse usage of the older term wr the medial labial consonants f and m in wfmann coalesced into the modern form woman while the initial element which meant female underwent semantic narrowing to the sense of a married woman ("wife") it is a popular misconception that the term woman is etymologically connected with womb which is from a separate old english word wambe meaning stomach (of male or female modern german retains the colloquial term wampe from middle high german for potbelly") nevertheless such a false derivation of woman has appeared in print
=== biological symbol ===
the symbol for the planet venus is the sign also used in biology for the female sex it is a stylized representation of the goddess venus's hand-mirror or an abstract symbol for the goddess a circle with a small equilateral cross underneath the venus symbol also represented femininity and in ancient alchemy stood for copper alchemists constructed the symbol from a circle (representing spirit) above an equilateral cross (representing matter)
== terminology ==
womanhood is the period in a female's life after she has passed through childhood and adolescence generally around the age 18
the word woman can be used generally to mean any female human or specifically to mean an adult female human as contrasted with girl the word girl originally meant young person of either sex in english it was only around the beginning of the 16th century that it came to mean specifically a female child the term girl is sometimes used colloquially to refer to a young or unmarried woman however during the early 1970s feminists challenged such use because the use of the word to refer to a fully grown woman may cause offence in particular previously common terms such as office girl are no longer widely used conversely in certain cultures which link family honor with female virginity the word girl is still used to refer to a never-married woman in this sense it is used in a fashion roughly analogous to the obsolete english maid or maiden referring to an unmarried female human as a woman may in such a culture imply that she is sexually experienced which would be an insult to her family
there are various words used to refer to the quality of being a woman the term womanhood merely means the state of being a woman having passed the menarche femininity is used to refer to a set of typical female qualities associated with a certain attitude to gender roles womanliness is like femininity but is usually associated with a different view of gender roles femaleness is a general term but is often used as shorthand for human femaleness distaff is an archaic adjective derived from women's conventional role as a spinner now used only as a deliberate archaism muliebrity is a neologism (derived from the latin) meant to provide a female counterpart of virility but used very loosely sometimes to mean merely womanhood sometimes femininity and sometimes even as a collective term for women
menarche the onset of menstruation occurs on average at age 12-13 many cultures have rites of passage to symbolize a girl's coming of age such as confirmation in some branches of christianity bat mitzvah in judaism or even just the custom of a special celebration for a certain birthday (generally between 12 and 21) like the quinceaera of latin america
== history ==

merit-ptah (c 2700 bce) also lived in egypt and is the earliest known female physician and scientist
peseshet (c 2600 bce) a physician in ancient egypt
puabi (c 2600 bce) or shubad queen of ur whose tomb was discovered with many expensive artifacts other known pre-sargonic queens of ur (royal wives) include ashusikildigir ninbanda and gansamannu
kugbau (circa 2,500 bce) a taverness from kish chosen by the nippur priesthood to become hegemonic ruler of sumer and in later ages deified as kubaba
tashlultum (c 2400 bce) akkadian queen wife of sargon of akkad and mother of enheduanna

enheduanna (c 2285 bce) the high priestess of the temple of the moon god in the sumerian city-state of ur and possibly the first poet and first named author of either gender
== biology and gender ==
in terms of biology the female sex organs are involved in the reproductive system whereas the secondary sex characteristics are involved in nurturing children or in some cultures attracting a mate the ovaries in addition to their regulatory function producing hormones produce female gametes called eggs which when fertilized by male gametes (sperm) form new genetic individuals the uterus is an organ with tissue to protect and nurture the developing fetus and muscle to expel it when giving birth the vagina is used in copulation and birthing although the term vagina is often colloquially and incorrectly used in the english language for the vulva or external female genitalia which consists of (in addition to the vagina) the labia the clitoris and the female urethra the breast evolved from the sweat gland to produce milk a nutritious secretion that is the most distinctive characteristic of mammals along with live birth in mature women the breast is generally more prominent than in most other mammals this prominence not necessary for milk production is probably at least partially the result of sexual selection (for other ways in which men commonly differ physically from women see man.)
during early fetal development embryos of both sexes appear gender-neutral as in cases without two sexes such as species that reproduce asexually the gender-neutral appearance is closer to female than to male a fetus usually develops into a male if it is exposed to a significant amount of testosterone (typically because the fetus has a y chromosome from the father) otherwise the fetus usually develops into a female typically when the fetus has an x chromosome from the father but also when the father contributed neither an x nor y chromosome later at puberty estrogen feminizes a young woman giving her adult sexual characteristics
an imbalance of maternal hormonal levels and some chemicals (or drugs) may alter the secondary sexual characteristics of fetuses most women have the karyotype 46,xx but around one in a thousand will be 47,xxx and one in 2500 will be 45,x this contrasts with the typical male karotype of 46,xy thus the x and y chromosomes are known as female and male respectively because humans inherit mitochondrial dna only from the mother's ovum genetic studies of the female line tend to focus on mitochondrial dna
whether or not a child is considered female does not always determine whether or not the child later will identify themselves that way (see gender identity) for instance intersex individuals who have mixed physical and/or genetic features may use other criteria in making a clear determination at birth babies may be assigned a gender based on their genitalia in some cases even if a child had xx chromosomes if they were born with a penis they were raised as a male there are also transgender and transsexual women who were assigned as male at birth but identify as women there are varying social legal and individual definitions with regard to these issues (see trans woman)
although fewer females than males are born (the ratio is around 1:1.05) due to a longer life expectancy there are only 81 men aged 60 or over for every 100 women of the same age women typically have a longer life expectancy than men this is due to a combination of factors genetics (redundant and varied genes present on sex chromosomes in women) sociology (such as the fact that women are not expected in most modern nations to perform military service) health-impacting choices (such as suicide or the use of cigarettes and alcohol) the presence of the female hormone estrogen which has a cardioprotective effect in premenopausal women and the effect of high levels of androgens in men out of the total human population there are 101.3 men for every 100 women (source 2001 world almanac)
girls bodies undergo gradual changes during puberty analogous to but distinct from those experienced by boys puberty is the process of physical changes by which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction to enable fertilisation it is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads-either the ovaries or the testes in response to the signals the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth function and transformation of the brain bones muscle blood skin hair breasts and sexual organs physical growthheight and weightaccelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when the child has developed an adult body until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the genitalia the penis and the vagina puberty is a process that usually takes place between the ages 1016 but these ages differ from girl to girl the major landmark of girls puberty is menarche the onset of menstruation which occurs on average between ages 1213
most girls go through menarche and are then able to become pregnant and bear children this generally requires internal fertilization of her eggs with the sperm of a man through sexual intercourse though artificial insemination or the surgical implantation of an existing embryo is also possible (see reproductive technology) the study of female reproduction and reproductive organs is called gynaecology
== health ==
women's health refers to health issues specific to human female anatomy there are some diseases that primarily affect women such as lupus also there are some gender-related illnesses that are found more frequently or exclusively in women e.g. breast cancer cervical cancer or ovarian cancer women and men may have different symptoms of an illness and may also respond to medical treatment differently this area of medical research is studied by gender-based medicine
the issue of women's health has been taken up by many feminists especially where reproductive health is concerned women's health is positioned within a wider body of knowledge cited by amongst others the world health organisation which places importance on gender as a social determinant of health
maternal mortality or maternal death is defined by who as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes. about 99% of maternal deaths occur in developing countries more than half of them occur in sub-saharan africa and almost one third in south asia the main causes of maternal mortality are severe bleeding (mostly bleeding after childbirth) infections (usually after childbirth) pre-eclampsia and eclampsia unsafe abortion and pregnancy complications from malaria and hiv/aids most european countries australia as well as japan and singapore are very safe in regard to childbirth while sub-saharan countries are the most dangerous
== reproductive rights and freedom ==
reproductive rights are legal rights and freedoms relating to reproduction and reproductive health the international federation of gynecology and obstetrics has stated that
(...) the human rights of women include their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality including sexual and reproductive health free of coercion discrimination and violence equal relationships between women and men in matters of sexual relations and reproduction including full respect for the integrity of the person require mutual respect consent and shared responsibility for sexual behavior and its consequences
violations of reproductive rights include forced pregnancy forced sterilization and forced abortion
forced sterilization was practiced during the first half of the 20th century by many western countries forced sterilization and forced abortion are reported to be currently practiced in countries such as uzbekistan and china
the lack of adequate laws on sexual violence combined with the lack of access to contraception and/or abortion are a cause of enforced pregnancy (see pregnancy from rape)
== culture and gender roles ==
in many prehistoric cultures women assumed a particular cultural role in hunter-gatherer societies women were generally the gatherers of plant foods small animal foods and fish while men hunted meat from large animals
in more recent history gender roles have changed greatly originally starting at a young age aspirations occupationally are typically veered towards specific directions according to gender traditionally middle class women were involved in domestic tasks emphasizing child care for poorer women especially working class women although this often remained an ideal economic necessity compelled them to seek employment outside the home many of the occupations that were available to them were lower in pay than those available to men
as changes in the labor market for women came about availability of employment changed from only dirty long hour factory jobs to cleaner more respectable office jobs where more education was demanded women's participation in the u.s labor force rose from 6% in 1900 to 23% in 1923 these shifts in the labor force led to changes in the attitudes of women at work allowing for the revolution which resulted in women becoming career and education oriented
in the 1970s many female academics including scientists avoided having children however throughout the 1980s institutions tried to equalize conditions for men and women in the workplace however the inequalities at home stumped women's opportunities to succeed as far as men professional women are still responsible for domestic labor and child care as people would say they have a double burden which does not allow then the time and energy to succeed in their careers furthermore though there has been an increase in the endorsement of egalitarian gender roles in the home by both women and men a recent research study showed that women focused on issues of morality fairness and well-being while men focused on social conventions until the early 20th century u.s women's colleges required their women faculty members to remain single on the grounds that a woman could not carry on two full-time professions at once according to schiebinger being a scientist and a wife and a mother is a burden in society that expects women more often than men to put family ahead of career. (pg 93)
movements advocate equality of opportunity for both sexes and equal rights irrespective of gender through a combination of economic changes and the efforts of the feminist movement in recent decades women in many societies now have access to careers beyond the traditional homemaker
although a greater number of women are seeking higher education salaries are often less than those of men cbs news claimed in 2005 that in the united states women who are ages 30 to 44 and hold a university degree make 62 percent of what similarly qualified men do a lower rate than in all but three of the 19 countries for which numbers are available some western nations with greater inequity in pay are germany new zealand and switzerland
=== violence against women ===
the un declaration on the elimination of violence against women defines violence against women as
any act of gender-based violence that results in or is likely to result in physical sexual or mental harm or suffering to women including threats of such acts coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty whether occurring in public or in private life
and identifies three forms of such violence that which occurs in the family that which occurs within the general community and that which is perpetrated or condoned by the state it also states that violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women
violence against women remains a widespread problem fueled especially outside the west by patriarchal social values lack of adequate laws and lack of enforcement of existing laws social norms that exist in many parts of the world hinder progress towards protecting women from violence for example according to surveys by unicef the percentage of women aged 1549 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is as high as 90% in afghanistan and jordan 87% in mali 86% in guinea and timor-leste 81% in laos and 80% in the central african republic a 2010 survey conducted by the pew research center found that stoning as a punishment for adultery was supported by 82% of respondents in egypt and pakistan 70% in jordan 56% nigeria 42% in indonesia
specific forms of violence that affect women include female genital mutilation sex trafficking forced prostitution forced marriage rape sexual harassment honor killings acid throwing and dowry related violence governments can be complicit in violence against women for instance through practices such as stoning (as punishment for adultery)
there have also been many forms of violence against women which have been prevalent historically notably the burning of witches the sacrifice of widows (such as sati) and foot binding the prosecution of women accused of witchcraft has a long tradition for example witch trials in the early modern period (between the 15th and 18th centuries) were common in europe and in the european colonies in north america today there remain regions of the world (such as parts of sub-saharan africa rural north india and papua new guinea) where belief in witchcraft is held by many people and women accused of being witches are subjected to serious violence in addition there are also countries which have criminal legislation against the practice of witchcraft in saudi arabia witchcraft remains a crime punishable by death and in 2011 the country beheaded a woman for witchcraft and sorcery
it is also the case that certain forms of violence against women have been recognized as criminal offenses only during recent decades and are not universally prohibited in that many countries continue to allow them this is especially the case with marital rape in the western world there has been a trend towards ensuring gender equality within marriage and prosecuting domestic violence but in many parts of the world women still lose significant legal rights when entering a marriage
sexual violence against women greatly increases during times of war and armed conflict during military occupation or ethnic conflicts most often in the form of war rape and sexual slavery contemporary examples of sexual violence during war include rape during the bangladesh liberation war rape in the bosnian war rape during the rwandan genocide and rape during second congo war in colombia the armed conflict has also resulted in increased sexual violence against women
laws and policies on violence against women vary by jurisdiction in the european union sexual harassment and human trafficking are subject to directives
== clothing fashion and dress codes ==
women in different parts of the world dress in different ways with their choices of clothing being influenced by local culture religious tenets traditions social norms and fashion trends amongst other factors different societies have different ideas about modesty however in many jurisdictions women's choices in regard to dress are not always free with laws limiting what they may or may not wear this is especially the case in regard to islamic dress while certain jurisdictions legally mandate such clothing (the wearing of the headscarf) other countries forbid or restrict the wearing of certain hijab attire (such as burqa/covering the face) in public places (one such country is france - see french ban on face covering) these laws are highly controversial
== fertility and family life ==
the total fertility rate (tfr) - the average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime - differs significantly between different regions of the world in 2013 the highest estimated tfr was in niger (7.03 children born per woman) and the lowest in singapore (0.79 children/woman) while most sub-saharan african countries have a high tfr which creates problems due to lack of resources and contributes to overpopulation most western countries currently experience a sub replacement fertility rate which may lead to population ageing and population decline
in many parts of the world there has been a change in family structure over the past few decades for instance in the west there has been a trend of moving away from living arrangements that include the extended family to those which only consist of the nuclear family there has also been a trend to move from marital fertility to non-marital fertility children born outside marriage may be born to cohabiting couples or to single women while births outside marriage are common and fully accepted in some parts of the world in other places they are highly stigmatized with unmarried mothers facing ostracism including violence from family members and in extreme cases even honor killings in addition sex outside marriage remains illegal in many countries (such as saudi arabia pakistan afghanistan iran kuwait maldives morocco oman mauritania united arab emirates sudan yemen,)
the social role of the mother differs between cultures in many parts of the world women with dependent children are expected to stay at home and dedicate all their energy to child raising while in other places (mostly in western countries) mothers most often return to paid work (see working mother and stay at home mother)
== religion ==
particular religious doctrines have specific stipulations relating to gender roles social and private interaction between the sexes appropriate dressing attire for women and various other issues affecting women and their position in society in many countries these religious teachings influence the criminal law or the family law of those jurisdictions (see for example sharia law) the relation between religion law and gender equality has been discussed by international organizations
== education ==
=== literacy ===
world literacy is lower for females than for males the cia world factbook presents an estimate from 2010 which shows that 80% of women are literate compared to 88.6% of men (aged 15 and over) literacy rates are lowest in south and west asia and in parts of sub-saharan africa
=== oecd countries ===
==== education ====
the educational gender gap in organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) countries has been reduced over the last 30 years younger women today are far more likely to have completed a tertiary qualification in 19 of the 30 oecd countries more than twice as many women aged 25 to 34 have completed tertiary education than have women aged 55 to 64 in 21 of 27 oecd countries with comparable data the number of women graduating from university-level programmes is equal to or exceeds that of men 15-year-old girls tend to show much higher expectations for their careers than boys of the same age while women account for more than half of university graduates in several oecd countries they receive only 30% of tertiary degrees granted in science and engineering fields and women account for only 25% to 35% of researchers in most oecd countries
there is a common misconception that women have still not advanced in achieving academic degrees according to margaret rossiter a historian of science women now earn 54 percent of all bachelor's degrees in the united states however although there are more women holding bachelor's degrees than men as the level of education increases the more men tend to fit the statistics instead of women at the graduate level women fill 40 percent of the doctorate degrees (31 percent of them being in engineering)
while to this day women are studying at prestigious universities at the same rate as men they are not being given the same chance to join faculty sociologist harriet zuckerman has observed that the more prestigious an institute is the more difficult and time consuming it will be for women to obtain a faculty position there in 1989 harvard university tenured its first woman in chemistry cynthia friend and in 1992 its first woman in physics melissa franklin she also observed that women were more likely to hold their first professional positions as instructors and lecturers while men are more likely to work first in tenure positions according to smith and tang as of 1989 65 percent of men and only 40 percent of women held tenured positions and only 29 percent of all scientists and engineers employed as assistant professors in four-year colleges and universities were women
==== jobs ====
in 1992 women earned 9 percent of the ph.d.'s awarded in engineering but only one percent of those women became a professor in 1995 11 percent of professors in science and engineering were women in relation only 311 deans of engineering schools were women which is less than 1 percent of the total even in psychology a degree in which women earn the majority of ph.d.'s they hold a significant amount of fewer tenured positions roughly 19 percent in 1994
== women in politics ==
women are underrepresented in government in most countries in october 2013 the global average of women in national assemblies was 22% suffrage is the civil right to vote women's suffrage in the united states was achieved gradually first at state and local levels starting in the late 19th century and early 20th century and in 1920 women in the us received universal vote with the passage of the nineteenth amendment to the united states constitution some western countries were slow to allow women to vote notably switzerland where women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971 and in the canton of appenzell innerrhoden women were granted the right to vote on local issues only in 1991 when the canton was forced to do so by the federal supreme court of switzerland and liechtenstein in 1984 through the liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum 1984
== science literature and art ==
women have throughout history made contributions to science literature and art one area where women have been permitted most access historically was that of obstetrics and gynecology (prior to the 18th century caring for pregnant women in europe was undertaken by women from the mid 18th century onwards medical monitoring of pregnant women started to require rigorous formal education to which women did not generally have access therefore the practice was largely transferred to men)
writing was generally also considered acceptable for upper class women although achieving success as a female writer in a male dominated world could be very difficult as a result several women writers adopted a male pen-name (e.g george sand george eliot)
