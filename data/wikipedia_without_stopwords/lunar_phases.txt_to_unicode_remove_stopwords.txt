lunar phase phase moon shape illuminated sunlit portion moon seen observer earth lunar phases change cyclically moon orbits earth according changing positions moon sun relative earth moon earth tidally locked therefore lunar surface always faces earth face variously sunlit depending position moon orbit therefore portion hemisphere visible observer earth vary full moon new moon lunar terminator boundary illuminated darkened hemispheres lunar phases roughly days days varies slightly due lunar apogee perigee aside craters near lunar poles shoemaker parts moon see around days sunlight followed days night dark side moon reference radio communication darkness visible light darkness
phases moon
western culture four principal lunar phases first quarter full moon third quarter also known last quarter new moon instants moons apparent geocentric celestial longitude minus suns apparent geocentric celestial longitude respectively phases roughly days long durations vary slightly moons orbit slightly elliptical thus speed orbit constant
eight principal intermediate phases given following names sequential order

descriptions lunar phases apply observers temperate high latitudes earth observers tropical latitudes see moon terminator apparently horizontal morning evening crescent moon open upward downward horns crescent pointing respectively sun appears moon sky crescent opens downward moon sun crescent opens upward crescent moon clearly brightly visible sun horizon implies moon must sun crescent must open upward therefore orientation crescent moon often seen earths tropics waxing waning crescents look similar waxing crescent appears western sky evening waning crescent east morning
moon seen earth narrow crescent earth seen moon almost fully lit sun often part moon directly lit sun sufficiently brightly lit light reflected earth easily visible earth phenomenon called earthshine sometimes picturesquely described old moon new moons arms
nonwestern cultures may use different number moon phases example traditional hawaiian culture total different moon phases
calendar
average calendrical month solar year days moons phase synodic cycle repeats average every days therefore timing moons phases shifts average almost one day successive month lunar year days
photographing moons phase every day month starting evening sunset repeating approximately minutes later successive day ending morning sunrise would create composite image like example calendar may june left picture may since picture would taken midnight may midnight may similarly calendar listing moon rise set times days appear skipped moon rises midnight one night rise midnight next setting skipped day calendar artifact moon behaving strangely moon predictable orbit every month
calculating phase
lunar phases lasts approximately days days varies slightly due lunar apogee perigee
approximate age moon hence approximate phase calculated date calculating number days since known new moon january august reducing modulo length synodic month difference two dates calculated subtracting julian day number one simpler formulae giving instance number days since december however calculation assumes perfectly circular orbit therefore may incorrect several hours also becomes less accurate larger difference required date reference date accurate enough use novelty clock application showing moon phase specialist usage taking account lunar apogee perigee requires elaborate calculation
effect parallax
earth subtends angle two degrees seen moon means observer earth sees moon close eastern horizon sees angle two degrees different line sight observer sees moon western horizon moon moves degrees around orbit per day observers stationary would see phases moon times differ onesixth day four hours reality observers surface rotating earth someone sees moon eastern horizon one moment sees western horizon hours later adds oscillation apparent progression lunar phases appear occur slowly moon high sky horizon moon appears move jerkily phases amplitude oscillation never four hours small fraction month obvious effect appearance moon however affect accurate calculations times lunar phases
misconceptions
might expected every month moon passes earth sun new moon shadow would fall earth causing solar eclipse happen every month true every full moon earths shadow falls moon causing lunar eclipse solar lunar eclipses observed every month plane moons orbit around earth tilted five degrees respect plane earths orbit around sun plane ecliptic thus new full moons occur moon usually lies north south direct line earth sun although eclipse occur moon either new solar full lunar must also positioned near intersection earths orbit plane sun moons orbit plane earth one nodes happens twice per year four seven eclipses calendar year events quite insignificant major eclipses moon sun less frequent
