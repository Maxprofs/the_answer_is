chemistry concentration abundance constituent divided total volume mixture several types mathematical description distinguished mass concentration molar concentration number concentration volume concentration term concentration applied kind chemical mixture frequently refers solutes solvents solutions molar amount concentration variants normal concentration osmotic concentration
qualitative descriptionedit
often informal nontechnical language concentration described qualitative way use adjectives dilute solutions relatively low concentration concentrated solutions relatively high concentration concentrate solution one must add solute example alcohol reduce amount solvent example water contrast dilute solution one must add solvent reduce amount solute unless two substances fully miscible exists concentration solute dissolve solution point solution said saturated additional solute added saturated solution dissolve except certain circumstances supersaturation may occur instead phase separation occur leading coexisting phases either completely separated mixed suspension point saturation depends many variables ambient temperature precise chemical nature solvent solute
quantitative notationedit
four quantities describe concentration
mass concentrationedit
mass concentration defined mass constituent divided volume mixture
si unit kgm equal gl
molar concentrationedit
molar concentration defined amount constituent moles divided volume mixture
si unit molm however commonly unit moll moldm used
number concentrationedit
number concentration defined number entities constituent mixture divided volume mixture
si unit m
volume concentrationedit
volume concentration confuse volume fraction defined volume constituent divided volume mixture
dimensionless expressed number eg unit
related quantitiesedit
several quantities used describe composition mixture note called concentrations
normalityedit
normality defined molar concentration divided equivalence factor since definition equivalence factor depends context reaction studied iupac nist discourage use normality
molalityedit
confused molarity
molality solution defined amount constituent moles divided mass solvent mass solution
si unit molality molkg
mole fractionedit
mole fraction defined amount constituent moles divided total amount constituents mixture
si unit molmol however deprecated partsper notation often used describe small mole fractions
mole ratioedit
mole ratio defined amount constituent divided total amount constituents mixture
much smaller mole ratio almost identical mole fraction
si unit molmol however deprecated partsper notation often used describe small mole ratios
mass fractionedit
mass fraction fraction one substance mass mass total mixture defined
si unit kgkg however deprecated partsper notation often used describe small mass fractions
mass ratioedit
mass ratio defined mass constituent divided total mass constituents mixture
much smaller mass ratio almost identical mass fraction
si unit kgkg however deprecated partsper notation often used describe small mass ratios
dependence volumeedit
concentration depends variation volume solution due mainly thermal expansion
