evaluating earthquake predictions
predictions deemed significant shown successful beyond random chance therefore methods statistical hypothesis testing used determine probability earthquake predicted would happen anyway null hypothesis predictions evaluated testing whether correlate actual earthquakes better null hypothesis
many instances however statistical nature earthquake occurrence simply homogeneous clustering occurs space time southern california m earthquakes followed earthquake larger magnitude within days km central italy m earthquakes followed larger event within km hours statistics satisfactory purposes prediction giving ten twenty false alarms successful prediction skew results analysis assumes earthquakes occur randomly time example realized poisson process shown naive method based solely clustering successfully predict earthquakes slightly better chance
purpose shortterm prediction enable emergency measures reduce death destruction failure give warning major earthquake occur least adequate evaluation hazard result legal liability even political purging warning earthquake occur also incurs cost cost emergency measures civil economic disruption false alarms including alarms cancelled also undermine credibility thereby effectiveness future warnings acceptable tradeoff missed quakes false alarms depends societal valuation outcomes rate occurrence must considered evaluating prediction method
difficulty impossibility
earthquake prediction may intrinsically impossible argued earth state selforganized criticality small earthquake probability cascading large event also argued decisiontheoretic grounds prediction major earthquakes impossible however theories implication earthquake prediction intrinsically impossible still disputed
prediction methods
earthquake prediction immature scienceit yet lead successful prediction earthquake first physical principles therefore research focuses empirical analysis either identifying distinctive precursors earthquakes identifying kind geophysical trend pattern seismicity might precede large earthquake
precursors
earthquake precursor anomalous phenomenon might give effective warning impending earthquake reports though generally recognized event number thousands dating back antiquity around reports possible precursors scientific literature roughly twenty different types running gamut aeronomy zoology none found reliable purposes earthquake prediction
