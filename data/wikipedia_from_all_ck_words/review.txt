=== recording reviews ===
music critics and music writers also review recordings of music including individual songs or pieces or entire albums in the case of a review of an entire album the reviewer will not only judge the individual songs or pieces they will also judge how well all of the songs or pieces work together or go together
the age of digital downloads may considerably change the album review where previously albums were purchased as collections of songs often with a common theme the rise of individual song downloads may have significant impact on consumers exposure to an artist's music die-hard fans will most likely continue to explore an artist's complete work but individuals will most likely make significantly different choices and cherry-pick songs they have been exposed to the concept of singles or individual hits marked for retail has been around for long time however the price for a single in the days of cds or 45's was much closer to the complete album price when you consider that each song on an artist's album is often priced at the same amount the odds of the average consumer purchase the entire album instead of selecting the hit songs decreases significantly

== bought review ==
a bought review is the system where the creator (usually a company) of a new product pays a reviewer to review his new product primarily used in the car movie and game industry this system creates a kind of undercover advertising bought reviews tend to be biased due to the informative value of reviews in some cases a bought review may be independent if the person that is hired to do the review has a strong reputation for independence and integrity even if a bought review from a respected critic is actually independent the perception of potential bias will remain due to the financial relationship between the company and the critic
a similar type of review that may be biased is the so-called puff piece a review of [a product] film or event that is written by a sympathetic reviewer or by an individual who has a connection to the product or event in question either in terms of an employment relationship or other links for example a major media conglomerate that owns both print media and record companies may instruct one of its employees in one of its newspapers to do a review of an album which is being released by the conglomerate's record company although some journalists may assert their professional independence and integrity and insist on producing an unbiased review in other cases writers may succumb to the pressure and pen a biased puff piece which praises the product or event while omitting any discussion of any shortcomings in some cases puff pieces purport to provide a review of the product or event but instead merely provide peacock words ("an amazing recording") weasel words ("probably one of the most important albums of the 2000s") and tabloid-style filler which is peripheral or irrelevant to assessing the qualities of the product or event ("during the filming there were rumors that romantic sparks flew between the two co-leads who were often seen talking together on the set")
