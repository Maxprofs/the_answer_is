in chemistry a solution is a homogeneous mixture composed of two or more substances in such a mixture a solute is a substance dissolved in another substance known as a solvent the solution more or less takes on the characteristics of the solvent including its phase and the solvent is commonly the major fraction of the mixture the concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of how much of that solute is dissolved in the solvent with regard to how much solvent is present
== characteristics ==
a solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances
the particles of solute in a solution cannot be seen by naked eye
a solution does not allow beams of light to scatter
a solution is stable
the solute from a solution cannot be separated by filtration (or mechanically)
it is composed only one phase
== types ==
homogeneous means that the components of the mixture form a single phase the properties of the mixture (such as concentration temperature and density) can be uniformly distributed through the volume but only in absence of diffusion phenomena or after their completion usually the substance present in the greatest amount is considered the solvent solvents can be gases liquids or solids one or more components present in the solution other than the solvent are called solutes the solution has the same physical state as the solvent
=== gaseous solutions ===
if the solvent is a gas only gases are dissolved under a given set of conditions an example of a gaseous solution is air (oxygen and other gases dissolved in nitrogen) since interactions between molecules play almost no role dilute gases form rather trivial solutions in part of the literature they are not even classified as solutions but addressed as mixtures
=== liquid solutions ===
if the solvent is a liquid then gases liquids and solids can be dissolved here are some examples
gas in liquid
oxygen in water
carbon dioxide in water a less simple example because the solution is accompanied by a chemical reaction (formation of ions) note also that the visible bubbles in carbonated water are not the dissolved gas but only an effervescence of carbon dioxide that has come out of solution the dissolved gas itself is not visible since it is dissolved on a molecular level
liquid in liquid
the mixing of two or more substances of the same chemistry but different concentrations to form a constant (homogenization of solutions)
alcoholic beverages are basically solutions of ethanol in water
solid in liquid
sucrose (table sugar) in water
sodium chloride (nacl) (table salt) or any other salt in water which forms an electrolyte when dissolving salt dissociates into ions
counterexamples are provided by liquid mixtures that are not homogeneous colloids suspensions emulsions are not considered solutions
body fluids are examples for complex liquid solutions containing many solutes many of these are electrolytes since they contain solute ions such as potassium furthermore they contain solute molecules like sugar and urea oxygen and carbon dioxide are also essential components of blood chemistry where significant changes in their concentrations may be a sign of severe illness or injury
=== solid solutions ===
if the solvent is a solid then gases liquids and solids can be dissolved
gas in solids
hydrogen dissolves rather well in metals especially in palladium this is studied as a means of hydrogen storage
liquid in solid
mercury in gold forming an amalgam
water in solid salt or sugar forming moist solids
hexane in paraffin wax
solid in solid
steel basically a solution of carbon atoms in a crystalline matrix of iron atoms
alloys like bronze and many others
polymers containing plasticizers
== solubility ==
the ability of one compound to dissolve in another compound is called solubility when a liquid can completely dissolve in another liquid the two liquids are miscible two substances that can never mix to form a solution are called immiscible
all solutions have a positive entropy of mixing the interactions between different molecules or ions may be energetically favored or not if interactions are unfavorable then the free energy decreases with increasing solute concentration at some point the energy loss outweighs the entropy gain and no more solute particles can be dissolved the solution is said to be saturated however the point at which a solution can become saturated can change significantly with different environmental factors such as temperature pressure and contamination for some solute-solvent combinations a supersaturated solution can be prepared by raising the solubility (for example by increasing the temperature) to dissolve more solute and then lowering it (for example by cooling)
usually the greater the temperature of the solvent the more of a given solid solute it can dissolve however most gases and some compounds exhibit solubilities that decrease with increased temperature such behavior is a result of an exothermic enthalpy of solution some surfactants exhibit this behaviour the solubility of liquids in liquids is generally less temperature-sensitive than that of solids or gases
== properties ==
the physical properties of compounds such as melting point and boiling point change when other compounds are added together they are called colligative properties there are several ways to quantify the amount of one compound dissolved in the other compounds collectively called concentration examples include molarity volume fraction and mole fraction
the properties of ideal solutions can be calculated by the linear combination of the properties of its components if both solute and solvent exist in equal quantities (such as in a 50% ethanol 50% water solution) the concepts of solute and solvent become less relevant but the substance that is more often used as a solvent is normally designated as the solvent (in this example water)
== liquid ==
in principle all types of liquids can behave as solvents liquid noble gases molten metals molten salts molten covalent networks and molecular liquids in the practice of chemistry and biochemistry most solvents are molecular liquids they can be classified into polar and non-polar according to whether their molecules possess a permanent electric dipole moment another distinction is whether their molecules can form hydrogen bonds (protic and aprotic solvents) water the most commonly used solvent is both polar and sustains hydrogen bonds
salts dissolve in polar solvents forming positive and negative ions that are attracted to the negative and positive ends of the solvent molecule respectively if the solvent is water hydration occurs when the charged solute ions become surrounded by water molecules a standard example is aqueous saltwater such solutions are called electrolytes
for non-ionic solutes the general rule is like dissolves like
polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents forming polar bonds or hydrogen bonds as an example all alcoholic beverages are aqueous solutions of ethanol on the other hand non-polar solutes dissolve better in non-polar solvents examples are hydrocarbons such as oil and grease that easily mix with each other while being incompatible with water
an example for the immiscibility of oil and water is a leak of petroleum from a damaged tanker that does not dissolve in the ocean water but rather floats on the surface
=== preparation from constituent ingredients ===
it is common practice in laboratories to make a solution directly from its constituent ingredients there are three cases in practical calculation
case 1 amount of solvent volume is given
case 2 amount of solute mass is given
case 3 amount of final solution volume is given
in the following equations a is solvent b is solute and c is concentration solute volume contribution is considered through ideal solution model
case 1 amount (ml) of solvent volume va is given solute mass mb = c va da /(100-c/db)
case 2 amount of solute mass mb is given solvent volume va = mb (100/c-1/ db )
case 3 amount (ml) of final solution volume vt is given solute mass mb = c vt /100 solvent volume va=(100/c-1/ db) mb
case 2 solute mass is known va = mb 100/c
case 3 total solution volume is known same equation as case 1 va=vt mb = c va /100
example make 2 g/100ml of nacl solution with 1 l water water (properties) the density of resulting solution is considered to be equal to that of water statement holding especially for dilute solutions so the density information is not required
mb = c va =( 2 / 100 ) x 1000 =20 g
