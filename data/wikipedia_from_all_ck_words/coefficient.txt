in mathematics a coefficient is a multiplicative factor in some term of a polynomial a series or any expression it is usually a number but in any case does not involve any variables of the expression for instance in
the first two terms respectively have the coefficients 7 and 3 the third term 1.5 is a constant the final term does not have any explicitly written coefficient but is considered to have coefficient 1 since multiplying by that factor would not change the term often coefficients are numbers as in this example although they could be parameters of the problem as a b and c where c is a constant in
when it is understood that these are not considered variables thus a polynomial in one variable x can be written as
for some integer  where are coefficients to allow this kind of expression in all cases one must allow introducing terms with 0 as coefficient for the largest with (if any) is called the leading coefficient of the polynomial so for example the leading coefficient of the polynomial
is 4
specific coefficients arise in mathematical identities such as the binomial theorem which involves binomial coefficients these particular coefficients are tabulated in pascal's triangle

in linear algebra the leading coefficient of a row in a matrix is the first nonzero entry in that row so for example given
the leading coefficient of the first row is 1 2 is the leading coefficient of the second row 4 is the leading coefficient of the third row and the last row does not have a leading coefficient
though coefficients are frequently viewed as constants in elementary algebra they can be variables more generally for example the coordinates of a vector in a vector space with basis  are the coefficients of the basis vectors in the expression
== examples of physical coefficientsedit ==
coefficient of thermal expansion (thermodynamics) (dimensionless) - relates the change in temperature to the change in a material's dimensions
partition coefficient (kd) (chemistry) - the ratio of concentrations of a compound in two phases of a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium h2o is a coefficient
hall coefficient (electrical physics) - relates a magnetic field applied to an element to the voltage created the amount of current and the element thickness it is a characteristic of the material from which the conductor is made
lift coefficient (cl or cz) (aerodynamics) (dimensionless) - relates the lift generated by an airfoil with the dynamic pressure of the fluid flow around the airfoil and the plan-form area of the airfoil
ballistic coefficient (bc) (aerodynamics) (units of kg/m2) - a measure of a body's ability to overcome air resistance in flight bc is a function of mass diameter and drag coefficient
transmission coefficient (quantum mechanics) (dimensionless) - represents the probability flux of a transmitted wave relative to that of an incident wave it is often used to describe the probability of a particle tunnelling through a barrier
damping factor a.k.a viscous damping coefficient (physical engineering) (units of newton-seconds per meter) - relates a damping force with the velocity of the object whose motion is being damped
a coefficient is a number placed in front of a term in a chemical equation to indicate how many molecules (or atoms) take part in the reaction for example in the formula
the number 2's in front of and are stoichiometric coefficients
