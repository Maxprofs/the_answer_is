compositionedit
chemical composition troposphere essentially uniform notable exception water vapor source water vapour surface processes evaporation transpiration furthermore temperature troposphere decreases height saturation vapor pressure decreases strongly temperature drops amount water vapor exist atmosphere decreases strongly height thus proportion water vapor normally greatest near surface decreases height
pressureedit
pressure atmosphere maximum sea level decreases higher altitude atmosphere nearly hydrostatic equilibrium pressure equal weight air given point change pressure height therefore equated density hydrostatic equation

r gas constant
thermodynamic absolute temperature
m molar mass
since temperature principle also depends altitude one needs second equation determine pressure function height discussed next section
temperatureedit
temperature troposphere generally decreases altitude increases rate temperature decreases called environmental lapse rate elr elr nothing difference temperature surface tropopause divided height reason temperature difference absorption suns energy occurs ground heats lower levels atmosphere radiation heat occurs top atmosphere cooling earth process maintaining overall heat balance earth
parcels air atmosphere rise fall also undergo changes temperature reasons described rate change temperature parcel may less elr parcel air rises expands pressure lower higher altitudes air parcel expands pushes air around work generally gain heat exchange environment thermal conductivity low process called adiabatic since parcel work gains heat loses energy temperature decreases reverse course true sinking parcel air

atmospheric flowedit
flow atmosphere generally moves west east direction however often become interrupted creating north south south north flow scenarios often described meteorology zonal meridional terms however tend used reference localised areas atmosphere synoptic scale fuller explanation flow atmosphere around earth whole found threecell model
zonal flowedit
zonal flow regime meteorological term meaning general flow pattern west east along earths latitude lines weak shortwaves embedded flow use word zone refers flow along earths latitudinal zones pattern buckle thus become meridional flow
meridional flowedit
zonal flow buckles atmosphere flow longitudinal meridional direction thus term meridional flow arises meridional flow patterns feature strong amplified troughs ridges northsouth flow general pattern westtoeast flow
