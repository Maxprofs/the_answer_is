regions polar climate characterized lack warm summers every month polar climate average temperature less c f regions polar climate cover earth sun shines long hours summer many fewer hours winter polar climate results treeless tundra glaciers permanent semipermanent layer ice
subtypes
two types polar climate et tundra climate ef ice cap climate tundra climate characterized least one month whose average temperature c f ice cap climate months c f tundra climate trees cannot grow specialized plants grow ice cap climate plants grow ice gradually accumulates flows elsewhere many high altitude locations earth climate month average temperature c f higher due elevation climate referred alpine climate alpine climate mimic either tundra ice cap climate

arctic consists ocean nearly surrounded land climate much arctic moderated ocean water never temperature c f winter relatively warm water even though covered polar ice pack keeps north pole coldest place northern hemisphere also part reason antarctica much colder arctic summer presence nearby water keeps coastal areas warming much might otherwise temperate regions maritime climates
antarctica
climate antarctica coldest whole earth antarctica lowest temperature ever recorded c f vostok station also extremely dry technically desert averaging millimetres precipitation per year even parts continent snow rarely melts eventually compressed become glacial ice makes ice sheet weather fronts rarely penetrate far continent
quantifying polar climate
several attempts quantifying constitutes polar climate
climatologist wladimir kppen demonstrated relationship arctic antarctic tree lines c f summer isotherm ie places average temperature warmest calendar month year c f cannot support forests see kppen climate classification information
otto nordenskild theorized winter conditions also play role formula w c w average temperature warmest month c average coldest month degrees celsius would mean example particular location average temperature c f coldest month warmest month would need average c f higher trees able survive nordenskilds line tends run north kppens near west coasts northern hemisphere continents south interior sections latitude along east coasts asia north america southern hemisphere tierra del fuego lies outside polar region nordenskilds system part island including ushuaia argentina reckoned within antarctic kppens
