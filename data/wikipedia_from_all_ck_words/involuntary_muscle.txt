a solar cell or photovoltaic cell is an electrical device that converts the energy of light directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect which is a physical and chemical phenomenon it is a form of photoelectric cell defined as a device whose electrical characteristics such as current voltage or resistance vary when exposed to light solar cells are the building blocks of photovoltaic modules otherwise known as solar panels
solar cells are described as being photovoltaic irrespective of whether the source is sunlight or an artificial light they are used as a photodetector (for example infrared detectors) detecting light or other electromagnetic radiation near the visible range or measuring light intensity
the operation of a photovoltaic (pv) cell requires 3 basic attributes
the absorption of light generating either electron-hole pairs or excitons
the separation of charge carriers of opposite types
the separate extraction of those carriers to an external circuit
in contrast a solar thermal collector supplies heat by absorbing sunlight for the purpose of either direct heating or indirect electrical power generation from heat a photoelectrolytic cell (photoelectrochemical cell) on the other hand refers either to a type of photovoltaic cell (like that developed by edmond becquerel and modern dye-sensitized solar cells) or to a device that splits water directly into hydrogen and oxygen using only solar illumination

assemblies of solar cells are used to make solar modules which generate electrical power from sunlight as distinguished from a solar thermal module or solar hot water panel a solar array generates solar power using solar energy
=== cells modules panels and systemsedit ===
multiple solar cells in an integrated group all oriented in one plane constitute a solar photovoltaic panel or solar photovoltaic module photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor wafers solar cells are usually connected in series in modules creating an additive voltage connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current however problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel though (as of 2014) individual power boxes are often supplied for each module and are connected in parallel although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak dc voltage and loading current capacity using independent mppts (maximum power point trackers) is preferable otherwise shunt diodes can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells
== historyedit ==
the photovoltaic effect was experimentally demonstrated first by french physicist edmond becquerel in 1839 at age 19 he built the world's first photovoltaic cell in his father's laboratory willoughby smith first described the effect of light on selenium during the passage of an electric current in a 20 february 1873 issue of nature in 1883 charles fritts built the first solid state photovoltaic cell by coating the semiconductor selenium with a thin layer of gold to form the junctions the device was only around 1% efficient
in 1888 russian physicist aleksandr stoletov built the first cell based on the outer photoelectric effect discovered by heinrich hertz in 1887
in 1905 albert einstein proposed a new quantum theory of light and explained the photoelectric effect in a landmark paper for which he received the nobel prize in physics in 1921
vadim lashkaryov discovered p-n-junctions in cuo and silver sulphide protocells in 1941
russell ohl patented the modern junction semiconductor solar cell in 1946 while working on the series of advances that would lead to the transistor
the first practical photovoltaic cell was publicly demonstrated on 25 april 1954 at bell laboratories the inventors were daryl chapin calvin souther fuller and gerald pearson
solar cells gained prominence with their incorporation onto the 1958 vanguard i satellite
improvements were gradual over the next two decades however this success was also the reason that costs remained high because space users were willing to pay for the best possible cells leaving no reason to invest in lower-cost less-efficient solutions the price was determined largely by the semiconductor industry their move to integrated circuits in the 1960s led to the availability of larger boules at lower relative prices as their price fell the price of the resulting cells did as well these effects lowered 1971 cell costs to some $100 per watt
=== space applicationsedit ===
solar cells were first used in a prominent application when they were proposed and flown on the vanguard satellite in 1958 as an alternative power source to the primary battery power source by adding cells to the outside of the body the mission time could be extended with no major changes to the spacecraft or its power systems in 1959 the united states launched explorer 6 featuring large wing-shaped solar arrays which became a common feature in satellites these arrays consisted of 9600 hoffman solar cells
by the 1960s solar cells were (and still are) the main power source for most earth orbiting satellites and a number of probes into the solar system since they offered the best power-to-weight ratio however this success was possible because in the space application power system costs could be high because space users had few other power options and were willing to pay for the best possible cells the space power market drove the development of higher efficiencies in solar cells up until the national science foundation research applied to national needs program began to push development of solar cells for terrestrial applications
in the early 1990s the technology used for space solar cells diverged from the silicon technology used for terrestrial panels with the spacecraft application shifting to gallium arsenide-based iii-v semiconductor materials which then evolved into the modern iii-v multijunction photovoltaic cell used on spacecraft
=== price reductionsedit ===
in late 1969 elliot berman founded solar power corporation with backing from esso who were looking for projects 30 years in the future the group had concluded that electrical power would be much more expensive by 2000 and felt that this increase in price would make alternative energy sources more attractive he conducted a market study and concluded that a price per watt of about $20/watt would create significant demand the team eliminated the steps of polishing the wafers and coating them with an anti-reflective layer relying on the rough-sawn wafer surface the team also replaced the expensive materials and hand wiring used in space applications with a printed circuit board on the back acrylic plastic on the front and silicone glue between the two potting the cells solar cells could be made using cast-off material from the electronics market by 1973 they announced a product and spc convinced tideland signal to use its panels to power navigational buoys initially for the u.s coast guard
research into solar power for terrestrial applications became prominent with the u.s national science foundation's advanced solar energy research and development division within the research applied to national needs program which ran from 1969 to 1977 and funded research on developing solar power for ground electrical power systems a 1973 conference the cherry hill conference set forth the technology goals required to achieve this goal and outlined an ambitious project for achieving them kicking off an applied research program that would be ongoing for several decades the program was eventually taken over by the energy research and development administration (erda) which was later merged into the u.s department of energy
following the 1973 oil crisis oil companies used their higher profits to start (or buy) solar firms and were for decades the largest producers exxon arco shell amoco (later purchased by bp) and mobil all had major solar divisions during the 1970s and 1980s technology companies also participated including general electric motorola ibm tyco and rca
== declining costs and exponential growthedit ==
swanson's law is an observation similar to moore's law that states that solar cell prices fall 20% for every doubling of industry capacity it was featured in an article in the british weekly newspaper the economist
further improvements reduced production cost to under $1 per watt with wholesale costs well under $2 balance of system costs were then higher than the panels large commercial arrays could be built as of 2010 at below $3.40 a watt fully commissioned
as the semiconductor industry moved to ever-larger boules older equipment became inexpensive cell sizes grew as equipment became available on the surplus market arco solar's original panels used cells 2 to 4 inches (50 to 100 mm) in diameter panels in the 1990s and early 2000s generally used 125 mm wafers since 2008 almost all new panels use 150 mm cells the widespread introduction of flat screen televisions in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to the wide availability of large high-quality glass sheets to cover the panels
during the 1990s polysilicon ("poly") cells became increasingly popular these cells offer less efficiency than their monosilicon ("mono") counterparts but they are grown in large vats that reduce cost by the mid-2000s poly was dominant in the low-cost panel market but more recently the mono returned to widespread use
manufacturers of wafer-based cells responded to high silicon prices in 20042008 with rapid reductions in silicon consumption in 2008 according to jef poortmans director of imec's organic and solar department current cells use 89 grams (0.280.32 oz) of silicon per watt of power generation with wafer thicknesses in the neighborhood of 200 microns
first solar is the largest thin film manufacturer in the world using a cdte-cell sandwiched between two layers of glass crystalline silicon panels dominate worldwide markets and are mostly manufactured in china and taiwan by late 2011 a drop in european demand due to budgetary turmoil dropped prices for crystalline solar modules to about $1.09 per watt down sharply from 2010 prices continued to fall in 2012 reaching $0.62/watt by 4q2012
global installed pv capacity reached at least 177 gigawatts in 2014 enough to supply 1 percent of the world's total electricity consumption solar pv is growing fastest in asia with china and japan currently accounting for half of worldwide deployment
subsidies and grid parity
solar-specific feed-in tariffs vary by country and within countries such tariffs encourage the development of solar power projects widespread grid parity the point at which photovoltaic electricity is equal to or cheaper than grid power without subsidies likely requires advances on all three fronts proponents of solar hope to achieve grid parity first in areas with abundant sun and high electricity costs such as in california and japan in 2007 bp claimed grid parity for hawaii and other islands that otherwise use diesel fuel to produce electricity george w bush set 2015 as the date for grid parity in the us the photovoltaic association reported in 2012 that australia had reached grid parity (ignoring feed in tariffs)
the price of solar panels fell steadily for 40 years interrupted in 2004 when high subsidies in germany drastically increased demand there and greatly increased the price of purified silicon (which is used in computer chips as well as solar panels) the recession of 2008 and the onset of chinese manufacturing caused prices to resume their decline in the four years after january 2008 prices for solar modules in germany dropped from 3 to 1 per peak watt during that same time production capacity surged with an annual growth of more than 50% china increased market share from 8% in 2008 to over 55% in the last quarter of 2010 in december 2012 the price of chinese solar panels had dropped to $0.60/wp (crystalline modules)
== theoryedit ==
the solar cell works in several steps
photons in sunlight hit the solar panel and are absorbed by semiconducting materials such as silicon
electrons and protons are excited from their current molecular/atomic orbital once excited an electron can either dissipate the energy as heat and return to its orbital or travel through the cell until it reaches an electrode current flows through the material to cancel the potential and this electricity is captured the chemical bonds of the material are vital for this process to work and usually silicon is used in two layers one layer being bonded with boron the other phosphorus these layers have different chemical electric charges and subsequently both drive and direct the current of electrons
an array of solar cells converts solar energy into a usable amount of direct current (dc) electricity
an inverter can convert the power to alternating current (ac)
the most commonly known solar cell is configured as a large-area p-n junction made from silicon
== efficiencyedit ==
solar cell efficiency may be broken down into reflectance efficiency thermodynamic efficiency charge carrier separation efficiency and conductive efficiency the overall efficiency is the product of these individual metrics
a solar cell has a voltage dependent efficiency curve temperature coefficients and allowable shadow angles
due to the difficulty in measuring these parameters directly other parameters are substituted thermodynamic efficiency quantum efficiency integrated quantum efficiency voc ratio and fill factor reflectance losses are a portion of quantum efficiency under external quantum efficiency recombination losses make up another portion of quantum efficiency voc ratio and fill factor resistive losses are predominantly categorized under fill factor but also make up minor portions of quantum efficiency voc ratio
the fill factor is the ratio of the actual maximum obtainable power to the product of the open circuit voltage and short circuit current this is a key parameter in evaluating performance in 2009 typical commercial solar cells had a fill factor > 0.70 grade b cells were usually between 0.4 to 0.7 cells with a high fill factor have a low equivalent series resistance and a high equivalent shunt resistance so less of the current produced by the cell is dissipated in internal losses
single pn junction crystalline silicon devices are now approaching the theoretical limiting power efficiency of 33.7% noted as the shockleyqueisser limit in 1961 in the extreme with an infinite number of layers the corresponding limit is 86% using concentrated sunlight
in december 2014 a solar cell achieved a new laboratory record with 46 percent efficiency in a french-german collaboration
in 2014 three companies broke the record of 25.6% for a silicon solar cell panasonic's was the most efficient the company moved the front contacts to the rear of the panel eliminating shaded areas in addition they applied thin silicon films to the (high quality silicon) wafer's front and back to eliminate defects at or near the wafer surface
in september 2015 the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems (fraunhofer ise) announced the achievement of an efficiency above 20% for epitaxial wafer cells the work on optimizing the atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition (apcvd) in-line production chain was done in collaboration with nexwafe gmbh a company spun off from fraunhofer ise to commercialize production
for triple-junction thin-film solar cells the world record is 13.6% set in june 2015
== materialsedit ==
solar cells are typically named after the semiconducting material they are made of these materials must have certain characteristics in order to absorb sunlight some cells are designed to handle sunlight that reaches the earth's surface while others are optimized for use in space solar cells can be made of only one single layer of light-absorbing material (single-junction) or use multiple physical configurations (multi-junctions) to take advantage of various absorption and charge separation mechanisms
solar cells can be classified into first second and third generation cells the first generation cellsalso called conventional traditional or wafer-based cellsare made of crystalline silicon the commercially predominant pv technology that includes materials such as polysilicon and monocrystalline silicon second generation cells are thin film solar cells that include amorphous silicon cdte and cigs cells and are commercially significant in utility-scale photovoltaic power stations building integrated photovoltaics or in small stand-alone power system the third generation of solar cells includes a number of thin-film technologies often described as emerging photovoltaicsmost of them have not yet been commercially applied and are still in the research or development phase many use organic materials often organometallic compounds as well as inorganic substances despite the fact that their efficiencies had been low and the stability of the absorber material was often too short for commercial applications there is a lot of research invested into these technologies as they promise to achieve the goal of producing low-cost high-efficiency solar cells
=== crystalline siliconedit ===
by far the most prevalent bulk material for solar cells is crystalline silicon (c-si) also known as solar grade silicon bulk silicon is separated into multiple categories according to crystallinity and crystal size in the resulting ingot ribbon or wafer these cells are entirely based around the concept of a p-n junction solar cells made of c-si are made from wafers between 160 to 240 micrometers thick
==== monocrystalline siliconedit ====
monocrystalline silicon (mono-si) solar cells are more efficient and more expensive than most other types of cells the corners of the cells look clipped like an octagon because the wafer material is cut from cylindrical ingots that are typically grown by the czochralski process solar panels using mono-si cells display a distinctive pattern of small white diamonds
==== epitaxial siliconedit ====
epitaxial wafers can be grown on a monocrystalline silicon seed wafer by atmospheric-pressure cvd in a high-throughput inline process and then detached as self-supporting wafers of some standard thickness (e.g. 250 m) that can be manipulated by hand and directly substituted for wafer cells cut from monocrystalline silicon ingots solar cells made with this technique can have efficiencies approaching those of wafer-cut cells but at appreciably lower cost
==== polycrystalline siliconedit ====
polycrystalline silicon or multicrystalline silicon (multi-si) cells are made from cast square ingotslarge blocks of molten silicon carefully cooled and solidified they consist of small crystals giving the material its typical metal flake effect polysilicon cells are the most common type used in photovoltaics and are less expensive but also less efficient than those made from monocrystalline silicon
==== ribbon siliconedit ====
ribbon silicon is a type of polycrystalline siliconit is formed by drawing flat thin films from molten silicon and results in a polycrystalline structure these cells are cheaper to make than multi-si due to a great reduction in silicon waste as this approach does not require sawing from ingots however they are also less efficient
==== mono-like-multi silicon (mlm)edit ====
this form was developed in the 2000s and introduced commercially around 2009 also called cast-mono this design uses polycrystalline casting chambers with small seeds of mono material the result is a bulk mono-like material that is polycrystalline around the outsides when sliced for processing the inner sections are high-efficiency mono-like cells (but square instead of clipped") while the outer edges are sold as conventional poly this production method results in mono-like cells at poly-like prices
=== thin filmedit ===
thin-film technologies reduce the amount of active material in a cell most designs sandwich active material between two panes of glass since silicon solar panels only use one pane of glass thin film panels are approximately twice as heavy as crystalline silicon panels although they have a smaller ecological impact (determined from life cycle analysis) the majority of film panels have 2-3 percentage points lower conversion efficiencies than crystalline silicon cadmium telluride (cdte) copper indium gallium selenide (cigs) and amorphous silicon (a-si) are three thin-film technologies often used for outdoor applications as of december 2013 cdte cost per installed watt was $0.59 as reported by first solar cigs technology laboratory demonstrations reached 20.4% conversion efficiency as of december 2013 the lab efficiency of gaas thin film technology topped 28% the quantum efficiency of thin film solar cells is also lower due to reduced number of collected charge carriers per incident photon most recently czts solar cell emerge as the less-toxic thin film solar cell technology which achieved ~12% efficiency thin film solar cells are increasing due to it being silent renewable and solar energy being the most abundant energy source on earth
==== cadmium tellurideedit ====
cadmium telluride is the only thin film material so far to rival crystalline silicon in cost/watt however cadmium is highly toxic and tellurium (anion telluride") supplies are limited the cadmium present in the cells would be toxic if released however release is impossible during normal operation of the cells and is unlikely during res in residential roofs a square meter of cdte contains approximately the same amount of cd as a single c cell nickel-cadmium battery in a more stable and less soluble form
==== copper indium gallium selenideedit ====
copper indium gallium selenide (cigs) is a direct band gap material it has the highest efficiency (~20%) among all commercially significant thin film materials (see cigs solar cell) traditional methods of fabrication involve vacuum processes including co-evaporation and sputtering recent developments at ibm and nanosolar attempt to lower the cost by using non-vacuum solution processes
==== silicon thin filmedit ====
silicon thin-film cells are mainly deposited by chemical vapor deposition (typically plasma-enhanced pe-cvd) from silane gas and hydrogen gas depending on the deposition parameters this can yield amorphous silicon (a-si or a-si:h) protocrystalline silicon or nanocrystalline silicon (nc-si or nc-si:h) also called microcrystalline silicon
amorphous silicon is the most well-developed thin film technology to-date an amorphous silicon (a-si) solar cell is made of non-crystalline or microcrystalline silicon amorphous silicon has a higher bandgap (1.7 ev) than crystalline silicon (c-si) (1.1 ev) which means it absorbs the visible part of the solar spectrum more strongly than the higher power density infrared portion of the spectrum the production of a-si thin film solar cells uses glass as a substrate and deposits a very thin layer of silicon by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (pecvd)
protocrystalline silicon with a low volume fraction of nanocrystalline silicon is optimal for high open circuit voltage nc-si has about the same bandgap as c-si and nc-si and a-si can advantageously be combined in thin layers creating a layered cell called a tandem cell the top cell in a-si absorbs the visible light and leaves the infrared part of the spectrum for the bottom cell in nc-si
==== gallium arsenide thin filmedit ====
the semiconductor material gallium arsenide (gaas) is also used for single-crystalline thin film solar cells although gaas cells are very expensive they hold the world's record in efficiency for a single-junction solar cell at 28.8% gaas is more commonly used in multijunction photovoltaic cells for concentrated photovoltaics (cpv hcpv) and for solar panels on spacecrafts as the industry favours efficiency over cost for space-based solar power
=== multijunction cellsedit ===
multi-junction cells consist of multiple thin films each essentially a solar cell grown on top of each other typically using metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy each layers has a different band gap energy to allow it to absorb electromagnetic radiation over a different portion of the spectrum multi-junction cells were originally developed for special applications such as satellites and space exploration but are now used increasingly in terrestrial concentrator photovoltaics (cpv) an emerging technology that uses lenses and curved mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto small but highly efficient multi-junction solar cells by concentrating sunlight up to a thousand times high concentrated photovoltaics (hcpv) has the potential to outcompete conventional solar pv in the future
tandem solar cells based on monolithic series connected gallium indium phosphide (gainp) gallium arsenide (gaas) and germanium (ge) pn junctions are increasing sales despite cost pressures between december 2006 and december 2007 the cost of 4n gallium metal rose from about $350 per kg to $680 per kg additionally germanium metal prices have risen substantially to $10001200 per kg this year those materials include gallium (4n 6n and 7n ga) arsenic (4n 6n and 7n) and germanium pyrolitic boron nitride (pbn) crucibles for growing crystals and boron oxide these products are critical to the entire substrate manufacturing industry
a triple-junction cell for example may consist of the semiconductors gaas ge and gainp
2 triple-junction gaas solar cells were used as the power source of the dutch four-time world solar challenge winners nuna in 2003 2005 and 2007 and by the dutch solar cars solutra (2005) twente one (2007) and 21revolution (2009) gaas based multi-junction devices are the most efficient solar cells to date on 15 october 2012 triple junction metamorphic cells reached a record high of 44%

=== perovskite solar cellsedit ===
perovskite solar cells are solar cells that include a perovskite-structured material as the active layer most commonly this is a solution-processed hybrid organic-inorganic tin or lead halide based material efficiencies have increased from below 10% at their first usage in 2009 to over 20% in 2014 making them a very rapidly advancing technology and a hot topic in the solar cell field perovskite solar cells are also forecast to be extremely cheap to scale up making them a very attractive option for commercialisation
=== liquid inksedit ===
in 2014 researchers at california nanosystems institute discovered using kesterite and perovskite improved electric power conversion efficiency for solar cells
=== upconversion and downconversionedit ===
photon upconversion is the process of using two low-energy (e.g. infrared) photons to produce one higher energy photon downconversion is the process of using one high energy photon (e.g. ultraviolet) to produce two lower energy photons either of these techniques could be used to produce higher efficiency solar cells by allowing solar photons to be more efficiently used the difficulty however is that the conversion efficiency of existing phosphors exhibiting up- or down-conversion is low and is typically narrow band
one upconversion technique is to incorporate lanthanide-doped materials (er3+ yb3+ ho3+ or a combination) taking advantage of their luminescence to convert infrared radiation to visible light upconversion process occurs when two infrared photons are absorbed by rare-earth ions to generate a (high-energy) absorbable photon as example the energy transfer upconversion process (etu) consists in successive transfer processes between excited ions in the near infrared the upconverter material could be placed below the solar cell to absorb the infrared light that passes through the silicon useful ions are most commonly found in the trivalent state er+ ions have been the most used er3+ ions absorb solar radiation around 1.54 m two er3+ ions that have absorbed this radiation can interact with each other through an upconversion process the excited ion emits light above the si bandgap that is absorbed by the solar cell and creates an additional electronhole pair that can generate current however the increased efficiency was small in addition fluoroindate glasses have low phonon energy and have been proposed as suitable matrix doped with ho3+ ions
=== light-absorbing dyesedit ===
dye-sensitized solar cells (dsscs) are made of low-cost materials and do not need elaborate manufacturing equipment so they can be made in a diy fashion in bulk it should be significantly less expensive than older solid-state cell designs dssc's can be engineered into flexible sheets and although its conversion efficiency is less than the best thin film cells its price/performance ratio may be high enough to allow them to compete with fossil fuel electrical generation
typically a ruthenium metalorganic dye (ru-centered) is used as a monolayer of light-absorbing material the dye-sensitized solar cell depends on a mesoporous layer of nanoparticulate titanium dioxide to greatly amplify the surface area (200300 m2/g tio
2 as compared to approximately 10 m2/g of flat single crystal) the photogenerated electrons from the light absorbing dye are passed on to the n-type tio
2 and the holes are absorbed by an electrolyte on the other side of the dye the circuit is completed by a redox couple in the electrolyte which can be liquid or solid this type of cell allows more flexible use of materials and is typically manufactured by screen printing or ultrasonic nozzles with the potential for lower processing costs than those used for bulk solar cells however the dyes in these cells also suffer from degradation under heat and uv light and the cell casing is difficult to seal due to the solvents used in assembly the first commercial shipment of dssc solar modules occurred in july 2009 from g24i innovations
=== quantum dotsedit ===
quantum dot solar cells (qdscs) are based on the gratzel cell or dye-sensitized solar cell architecture but employ low band gap semiconductor nanoparticles fabricated with crystallite sizes small enough to form quantum dots (such as cds cdse sb
2s
3 pbs etc.) instead of organic or organometallic dyes as light absorbers qd's size quantization allows for the band gap to be tuned by simply changing particle size they also have high extinction coefficients and have shown the possibility of multiple exciton generation
in a qdsc a mesoporous layer of titanium dioxide nanoparticles forms the backbone of the cell much like in a dssc this tio
2 layer can then be made photoactive by coating with semiconductor quantum dots using chemical bath deposition electrophoretic deposition or successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction the electrical circuit is then completed through the use of a liquid or solid redox couple the efficiency of qdscs has increased to over 5% shown for both liquid-junction and solid state cells in an effort to decrease production costs the prashant kamat research group demonstrated a solar paint made with tio
2 and cdse that can be applied using a one-step method to any conductive surface with efficiencies over 1%
=== organic/polymer solar cellsedit ===
organic solar cells and polymer solar cells are built from thin films (typically 100 nm) of organic semiconductors including polymers such as polyphenylene vinylene and small-molecule compounds like copper phthalocyanine (a blue or green organic pigment) and carbon fullerenes and fullerene derivatives such as pcbm
they can be processed from liquid solution offering the possibility of a simple roll-to-roll printing process potentially leading to inexpensive large scale production in addition these cells could be beneficial for some applications where mechanical flexibility and disposability are important current cell efficiencies are however very low and practical devices are essentially non-existent
energy conversion efficiencies achieved to date using conductive polymers are very low compared to inorganic materials however konarka power plastic reached efficiency of 8.3% and organic tandem cells in 2012 reached 11.1%
the active region of an organic device consists of two materials one electron donor and one electron acceptor when a photon is converted into an electron hole pair typically in the donor material the charges tend to remain bound in the form of an exciton separating when the exciton diffuses to the donor-acceptor interface unlike most other solar cell types the short exciton diffusion lengths of most polymer systems tend to limit the efficiency of such devices nanostructured interfaces sometimes in the form of bulk heterojunctions can improve performance
in 2011 mit and michigan state researchers developed solar cells with a power efficiency close to 2% with a transparency to the human eye greater than 65% achieved by selectively absorbing the ultraviolet and near-infrared parts of the spectrum with small-molecule compounds researchers at ucla more recently developed an analogous polymer solar cell following the same approach that is 70% transparent and has a 4% power conversion efficiency these lightweight flexible cells can be produced in bulk at a low cost and could be used to create power generating windows
in 2013 researchers announced polymer cells with some 3% efficiency they used block copolymers self-assembling organic materials that arrange themselves into distinct layers the research focused on p3ht-b-pftbt that separates into bands some 16 nanometers wide
=== adaptive cellsedit ===
adaptive cells change their absorption/reflection characteristics depending to respond to environmental conditions an adaptive material responds to the intensity and angle of incident light at the part of the cell where the light is most intense the cell surface changes from reflective to adaptive allowing the light to penetrate the cell the other parts of the cell remain reflective increasing the retention of the absorbed light within the cell
in 2014 a system that combined an adaptive surface with a glass substrate that redirect the absorbed to a light absorber on the edges of the sheet the system also included an array of fixed lenses/mirrors to concentrate light onto the adaptive surface as the day continues the concentrated light moves along the surface of the cell that surface switches from reflective to adaptive when the light is most concentrated and back to reflective after the light moves along
== manufactureedit ==
solar cells share some of the same processing and manufacturing techniques as other semiconductor devices however the stringent requirements for cleanliness and quality control of semiconductor fabrication are more relaxed for solar cells lowering costs
polycrystalline silicon wafers are made by wire-sawing block-cast silicon ingots into 180 to 350 micrometer wafers the wafers are usually lightly p-type-doped a surface diffusion of n-type dopants is performed on the front side of the wafer this forms a pn junction a few hundred nanometers below the surface
anti-reflection coatings are then typically applied to increase the amount of light coupled into the solar cell silicon nitride has gradually replaced titanium dioxide as the preferred material because of its excellent surface passivation qualities it prevents carrier recombination at the cell surface a layer several hundred nanometers thick is applied using pecvd some solar cells have textured front surfaces that like anti-reflection coatings increase the amount of light reaching the wafer such surfaces were first applied to single-crystal silicon followed by multicrystalline silicon somewhat later
a full area metal contact is made on the back surface and a grid-like metal contact made up of fine fingers and larger bus bars are screen-printed onto the front surface using a silver paste this is an evolution of the so-called wet process for applying electrodes first described in a us patent filed in 1981 by bayer ag the rear contact is formed by screen-printing a metal paste typically aluminium usually this contact covers the entire rear though some designs employ a grid pattern the paste is then fired at several hundred degrees celsius to form metal electrodes in ohmic contact with the silicon some companies use an additional electro-plating step to increase efficiency after the metal contacts are made the solar cells are interconnected by flat wires or metal ribbons and assembled into modules or solar panels solar panels have a sheet of tempered glass on the front and a polymer encapsulation on the back
== manufacturers and certificationedit ==
national renewable energy laboratory tests and validates solar technologies three reliable groups certify solar equipment ul and ieee (both u.s standards) and iec
solar cells are manufactured in volume in japan germany china taiwan malaysia and the united states whereas europe china the u.s. and japan have dominated (94% or more as of 2013) in installed systems other nations are acquiring significant solar cell production capacity
global pv cell/module production increased by 10% in 2012 despite a 9% decline in solar energy investments according to the annual pv status report released by the european commission's joint research centre between 2009 and 2013 cell production has quadrupled
=== chinaedit ===
due to heavy government investment china has become the dominant force in solar cell manufacturing chinese companies produced solar cells/modules with a capacity of ~23 gw in 2013 (60% of global production)
=== malaysiaedit ===
in 2014 malaysia was the world's third largest manufacturer of photovoltaics equipment behind china and the european union
=== united statesedit ===
solar cell production in the u.s has suffered due to the global financial crisis but recovered partly due to the falling price of quality silicon
