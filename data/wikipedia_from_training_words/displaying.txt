display is a form of animal behaviour linked to sexual selection and survival of the species in various ways one example of display used by some species can be found in the form of courtship with the male usually having a striking feature that is distinguished by colour shape or size used to attract a female in other instances species may exhibit territorial display behaviour in order to preserve a foraging or hunting territory for its family or group a third form is exhibited by tournament species in which males will fight in order to gain the right to breed

animals use display behaviors and markings as signals to other animals usually of the same species although there is a great variety in the manner of display in animals they are usually meant as honest advertisements of the health vigor and/or toxicity of the possessor within a species these are typically seen in the competition for mates this can be either through intimidation of same-sex rivals or wooing of the females or both an example of wooing-style courtship display is the nest a male bowerbird builds to attract females other animals such as fiddler crabs advertise the size of their enlarged claw to intimidate their rivals as mentioned animals may also use display behavior during direct competition between them for a resource other than mates in animals that are so well-armed by the nature of their ecological niches a physical confrontation may equal death for one or all of those involved in these cases using a display behavior that allows the animal to estimate the opponent's fighting ability may save the costs and risks of fighting an unnecessary battle examples of this behavior may be found in the world of beetles birds mammals and more

humans typically advertise their suitability as mates in acquiring wealth or fame the papuan big men would stage elaborate feasts to show the extent of their influence and power the potlatches of the pacific northwest were held for much of the same effect
== tournament speciesedit ==
tournament species in zoology are those species in which members of one sex (usually males) compete in order to mate in tournament species most members of the competing sex never win the competitions and never mate but almost all members of the other sex do mate with the small group of winners
tournament species are characterized by fierce same-sex fighting significantly larger or better-armed individuals in these species have an advantage but only to the competing sex thus most tournament species have high sexual dimorphism examples of tournament species include grouse peafowl lions mountain gorillas and elephant seals
in some species members of the competing sex come together in special display areas called leks in other species competition is more direct in the form of fighting between males
in a small number of species females compete for males these include species of jacana species of phalarope and the spotted hyena in all these cases the female of the species shows traits that help in same-sex battles larger bodies aggressiveness territorialism even maintenance of a multiple-male harem is sometimes seen in these animals
most species fall on a continuum between tournament species and pair-bonding species
