la vie is a weekly french christian magazine edited by malesherbes publications a member of the groupe la vie-le monde
== historyedit ==
founded in 1924 by francisque gay as la vie catholique (catholic life) the magazine was renamed la vie in 1977 in 1945 the magazine appeared as la vie catholique illustre as the postwar period placed a great importance on visual magazines (compare life magazine in the us) the magazine was originally targeted at active laity through parish promotions before eventually being sold on newsstands from 1976
its editors in chief were georges hourdin jos de broucker jean-claude petit max armanet and jean-pierre denis 
since 1945 the magazine was published by le groupe de presse la vie catholique which in 2003 became a part of the larger groupe la vie-le monde
in 2001 la vie created a charitable association which as of 2006 had around three thousand members based in fifty-odd regional centres across france called les amis de la vie (friends of la vie) this organisation gave deeper meaning to the magazine's tagline a paper written with its readers by organising meetings debates and summer programmes
the publication is independent of the catholic hierarchy because the group to which the paper belongs was bought by pierre berg an lgbt advocate and media tycoon the publication expressed support or neutrality over gay marriage in france amidst pressure from the said owner
== objectivesedit ==
