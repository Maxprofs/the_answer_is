latent heat energy released absorbed body thermodynamic system constanttemperature process specified way example latent heat fusion phase change melting specified temperature pressure term introduced around scottish chemist joseph black derived latin latere lie hidden black used term context calorimetry heat transfer caused volume change thermodynamic systems temperature constant
contrast latent heat sensible heat involves energy transfer results temperature change system
usage
terms sensible heat latent heat special forms energy instead measure two kinds change material thermodynamic system sensible heat measures change bodys internal energy may sensed thermometer latent heat measures change internal energy seems hidden thermometer temperature reading doesnt change heat energy process transferring system surroundings work transfer matter
sensible latent heats observed many processes transport energy nature latent heat associated phase changes atmospheric water vapor mostly vaporization condensation whereas sensible heat energy transferred affects temperature atmosphere
original usage term introduced black applied systems intentionally held constant temperature usage referred latent heat expansion several related latent heats latent heats defined independently conceptual framework thermodynamics
body heated constant temperature thermal radiation microwave field example may expand amount described latent heat respect volume latent heat expansion increase pressure amount described latent heat respect pressure
two common forms latent heat latent heat fusion melting latent heat vaporization boiling names describe direction energy flow changing one phase next solid liquid liquid gas
cases change endothermic meaning system absorbs energy change exothermic energy released example water evaporates energy transferred water molecule air molecule contains less water vapor surroundings energy required water molecule overcome forces attraction water particles transition water vapor requires input energy causes temperature drop water molecules surroundings
vapor condenses liquid surface vapors latent energy absorbed evaporation released liquids sensible heat onto surface
large value enthalpy condensation water vapor reason steam far effective heating medium boiling water hazardous
meteorology
