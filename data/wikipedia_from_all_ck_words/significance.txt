a toxin (from ancient greek toxikon) is a poisonous substance produced within living cells or organisms synthetic toxicants created by artificial processes are thus excluded the term was first used by organic chemist ludwig brieger (18491919)
toxins can be small molecules peptides or proteins that are capable of causing disease on contact with or absorption by body tissues interacting with biological macromolecules such as enzymes or cellular receptors toxins vary greatly in their severity ranging from usually minor (such as a bee sting) to almost immediately deadly (such as botulinum toxin)
== terminologyedit ==
toxins are often distinguished from other chemical agents by their method of productionthe word toxin does not specify method of delivery (compare with venom and the narrower meaning of poisonall substances that can also cause disturbances to organisms) it simply means it is a biologically produced poison there was an ongoing terminological dispute between nato and the warsaw pact over whether to call a toxin a biological or chemical agent in which the nato opted for biological agent and the warsaw pact like most other countries in the world for chemical agent
according to an international committee of the red cross review of the biological weapons convention toxins are poisonous products of organisms unlike biological agents they are inanimate and not capable of reproducing themselves and since the signing of the convention there have been no disputes among the parties regarding the definition of biological agents or toxins
according to title 18 of the united states code  the term toxin means the toxic material or product of plants animals microorganisms (including but not limited to bacteria viruses fungi rickettsiae or protozoa) or infectious substances or a recombinant or synthesized molecule whatever their origin and method of production...
a rather informal terminology of individual toxins relates them to the anatomical location where their effects are most notable
hemotoxin causes destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis)
phototoxin causes dangerous photosensitivity
on a broader scale toxins may be classified as either exotoxins being excreted by an organism or endotoxins that are released mainly when bacteria are lysed
related terms are
toxoid weakened or suppressed toxin
venom toxins in the sense of use by certain types of animals
== biotoxinsedit ==
the term biotoxin is sometimes used to explicitly confirm the biological origin biotoxins are further classified into fungal biotoxins or short mycotoxins microbial biotoxins plant biotoxins short phytotoxins and animal biotoxins
toxins produced by microorganisms are important virulence determinants responsible for microbial pathogenicity and/or evasion of the host immune response
biotoxins vary greatly in purpose and mechanism and can be highly complex (the venom of the cone snail contains dozens of small proteins each targeting a specific nerve channel or receptor) or relatively small protein
biotoxins in nature have two primary functions
predation in the spider snake scorpion jellyfish wasp
defense in the bee ant termite honeybee wasp poison dart frog
some of the more well known types of biotoxins include
cyanotoxins produced by cyanobacteria
dinotoxins produced by dinoflagellates
necrotoxins cause necrosis (i.e. death) in the cells they encounter and destroy all types of tissue necrotoxins spread through the bloodstream in humans skin and muscle tissues are most sensitive to necrotoxins organisms that possess necrotoxins include
the brown recluse or fiddle back spider
most rattlesnakes and vipers produce phospholipase and various trypsin-like serine proteases
puff adder
necrotizing fasciitis (the flesh eating bacteria) - produces a pore forming toxin
neurotoxins primarily affect the nervous systems of animals the group neurotoxins generally consists of ion channel toxins that disrupt ion channel conductance organisms that possess neurotoxins include
the black widow spider
most scorpions
the box jellyfish
elapid snakes
the cone snail
the blue-ringed octopus
venomous fish
frogs
palythoa coral
various different types of algae cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates
myotoxins are small basic peptides found in snake and lizard venoms,they cause muscle tissue damage by a non enzymatic receptor based mechanism organisms that possess myotoxins include
rattlesnakes
eastern bearded dragon
cytotoxins are toxic at the level of individual cells either in a non-specific fashion or only in certain types of living cells
ricin from castor beans
apitoxin from honey bees
t-2 mycotoxin from certain toxic mushrooms
== environmental toxinsedit ==
the term environmental toxin can sometimes explicitly include synthetic contaminants such as industrial pollutants and other artificially made toxic substances as this contradicts most formal definitions of the term toxin it is important to confirm what the researcher means when encountering the term outside of microbiological contexts
environmental toxins from food chains that may be dangerous to human health include
paralytic shellfish poisoning (psp)
amnesic shellfish poisoning (asp)
diarrheal shellfish poisoning (dsp)
neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (nsp)
=== finding information about toxinsedit ===
the toxicology and environmental health information program (tehip) at the united states national library of medicine (nlm) maintains a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site that includes access to toxins-related resources produced by tehip and by other government agencies and organizations this web site includes links to databases bibliographies tutorials and other scientific and consumer-oriented resources tehip also is responsible for the toxicology data network (toxnet) an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases that are available free of charge on the web
toxmap is a geographic information system (gis) that is part of toxnet toxmap uses maps of the united states to help users visually explore data from the united states environmental protection agency's (epa) toxics release inventory and superfund basic research programs
=== computational resources for prediction of toxic peptides and proteinsedit ===
one of the bottlenecks in peptide/protein-based therapy is their toxicity recently in silico models for predicting toxicity of peptides and proteins developed by gajendra pal singh raghava's group predict toxicity with reasonably good accuracy the prediction models are based on machine learning technique and quantitative matrix using various properties of peptides the prediction tool is freely accessible to public in the form of web server - toxinpred at http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/
== misuse of the termedit ==
when used non-technically the term toxin is often applied to any toxic substance even though the term toxicant would be more appropriate toxic substances not directly of biological origin are also termed poisons and many non-technical and lifestyle journalists follow this usage to refer to toxic substances in general
in the context of quack and alternative medicine the term toxin is used to refer to any substance supposed to cause ill health this could range anywhere from trace amounts of potentially dangerous pesticides to safe food ingredients such as table sugar or controversial food additives such as monosodium glutamate splenda and aspartame
