prescientific forms medicine known traditional medicine folk medicine remain commonly used instead scientific medicine thus called alternative medicine example evidence effectiveness acupuncture variable inconsistent condition generally safe done appropriately trained practitioner contrast treatments outside bounds safety efficacy termed quackery
clinical practice
medical availability clinical practice varies across world due regional differences culture technology modern scientific medicine highly developed western world developing countries parts africa asia population may rely heavily traditional medicine limited evidence efficacy required formal training practitioners even developed world however evidencebased medicine universally used clinical practice example survey literature reviews found interventions lacked sufficient evidence support either benefit harm
modern clinical practice doctors personally assess patients order diagnose treat prevent disease using clinical judgment doctorpatient relationship typically begins interaction examination patients medical history medical record followed medical interview physical examination basic diagnostic medical devices eg stethoscope tongue depressor typically used examination signs interviewing symptoms doctor may order medical tests eg blood tests take biopsy prescribe pharmaceutical drugs therapies differential diagnosis methods help rule conditions based information provided encounter properly informing patient relevant facts important part relationship development trust medical encounter documented medical record legal document many jurisdictions followups may shorter follow general procedure specialists follow similar process diagnosis treatment may take minutes weeks depending upon complexity issue
components medical interview encounter
chief complaint cc reason current medical visit symptoms patients words recorded along duration one also called presenting complaint
history present illnesscomplaint hpi chronological order events symptoms clarification symptom
current activity occupation hobbies patient actually
medications rx drugs patient takes including prescribed overthecounter home remedies well alternative herbal medicinesherbal remedies allergies also recorded
past medical history pmhpmhx concurrent medical problems past hospitalizations operations injuries past infectious diseases andor vaccinations history known allergies
social history sh birthplace residences marital history social economic status habits including diet medications tobacco alcohol
family history fh listing diseases family may impact patient family tree sometimes used
review systems ros systems inquiry set additional questions ask may missed hpi general enquiry noticed weight loss change sleep quality fevers lumps bumps etc followed questions bodys main organ systems heart lungs digestive tract urinary tract etc

institutions
contemporary medicine general conducted within health care systems legal credentialing financing frameworks established individual governments augmented occasion international organizations churches characteristics given health care system significant impact way medical care provided
ancient times christian emphasis practical charity gave rise development systematic nursing hospitals catholic church today remains largest nongovernment provider medical services world advanced industrial countries exception united states many developing countries provide medical services system universal health care aims guarantee care singlepayer health care system compulsory private cooperative health insurance intended ensure entire population access medical care basis need rather ability pay delivery may via private medical practices stateowned hospitals clinics charities commonly combination three
tribal societies provide guarantee healthcare population whole societies healthcare available afford pay selfinsured either directly part employment contract may covered care financed government tribe directly
transparency information another factor defining delivery system access information conditions treatments quality pricing greatly affects choice patientsconsumers therefore incentives medical professionals us healthcare system come fire lack openness new legislation may encourage greater openness perceived tension need transparency one hand issues patient confidentiality possible exploitation information commercial gain
delivery
