evolution
fossilized spores suggest higher plants embryophytes lived land least million years early land plants reproduced sexually flagellated swimming sperm like green algae evolved adaptation terrestrialization development upright meiosporangia dispersal spores new habitats feature lacking descendants nearest algal relatives charophycean green algae later terrestrial adaptation took place retention delicate avascular sexual stage gametophyte within tissues vascular sporophyte occurred spore germination within sporangia rather spore release nonseed plants current example might happened seen precocious spore germination selaginella spikemoss result ancestors angiosperms enclosing case seed first seed bearing plants like ginkgo conifers pines firs produce flowers pollen grains males ginkgo cycads produce pair flagellated mobile sperm cells swim developing pollen tube female eggs
apparently sudden appearance nearly modern flowers fossil record initially posed problem theory evolution called abominable mystery charles darwin however fossil record considerably grown since time darwin recently discovered angiosperm fossils archaefructus along discoveries fossil gymnosperms suggest angiosperm characteristics may acquired series steps several groups extinct gymnosperms particular seed ferns proposed ancestors flowering plants continuous fossil evidence showing exactly flowers evolved older fossils upper triassic sanmiguelia suggested based current evidence propose ancestors angiosperms diverged unknown group gymnosperms late triassic million years ago fossil angiospermlike pollen middle triassic ma suggests older date origin close relationship angiosperms gnetophytes proposed basis morphological evidence recently disputed basis molecular evidence suggest gnetophytes instead closely related gymnosperms
evolution seed plants later angiosperms appears result two distinct rounds whole genome duplication events occurred million years ago million years ago another possible whole genome duplication event million years ago perhaps created ancestral line led modern flowering plants event studied sequencing genome ancient flowering plant amborella trichopoda directly addresses darwins abominable mystery
earliest known macrofossil confidently identified angiosperm archaefructus liaoningensis dated million years bp cretaceous period whereas pollen considered angiosperm origin takes fossil record back million years bp however one study suggested earlymiddle jurassic plant schmeissneria traditionally considered type ginkgo may earliest known angiosperm least close relative addition circumstantial chemical evidence found existence angiosperms early million years ago oleanane secondary metabolite produced many flowering plants found permian deposits age together fossils gigantopterids gigantopterids group extinct seed plants share many morphological traits flowering plants although known flowering plants
flowers encased amber found dated million years present amber frozen act sexual reproduction process taking place microscopic images showed tubes growing pollen penetrating flowers stigma pollen sticky suggesting carried insects
recent dna analysis based molecular systematics showed amborella trichopoda found pacific island new caledonia belongs sister group flowering plants morphological studies suggest features may characteristic earliest flowering plants
orders amborellales nymphaeales austrobaileyales diverged separate lineages remaining angiosperm clade early stage flowering plant evolution
great angiosperm radiation great diversity angiosperms appears fossil record occurred midcretaceous approximately million years ago however study estimated division five recent genus ceratophyllum family chloranthaceae eudicots magnoliids monocots eight main groups occurred around million years ago late cretaceous angiosperms appear dominated environments formerly occupied ferns cycadophytes large canopyforming trees replaced conifers dominant trees close end cretaceous million years ago even later beginning tertiary radiation herbaceous angiosperms occurred much later yet many fossil plants recognizable belonging modern families including beech oak maple magnolia already appeared late cretaceous
generally assumed function flowers start involve mobile animals reproduction processes pollen scattered even flower brightly colored oddly shaped way attracts animals however expending energy required create traits angiosperms enlist aid animals thus reproduce efficiently
island genetics provides one proposed explanation sudden fully developed appearance flowering plants island genetics believed common source speciation general especially comes radical adaptations seem required inferior transitional forms flowering plants may evolved isolated setting like island island chain plants bearing able develop highly specialized relationship specific animal wasp example relationship hypothetical wasp carrying pollen one plant another much way fig wasps today could result development high degree specialization plants partners note wasp example incidental bees postulated evolved specifically due mutualistic plant relationships descended wasps
animals also involved distribution seeds fruit formed enlargement flower parts frequently seeddispersal tool attracts animals eat otherwise disturb incidentally scattering seeds contains see frugivory although many mutualistic relationships remain fragile survive competition spread widely flowering proved unusually effective means reproduction spreading whatever origin become dominant form land plant life
flower ontogeny uses combination genes normally responsible forming new shoots primitive flowers probably variable number flower parts often separate contact flowers tended grow spiral pattern bisexual plants means male female parts flower dominated ovary female part flowers evolved variations developed parts fused together much specific number design either specific sexes per flower plant least ovaryinferior
flower evolution continues present day modern flowers profoundly influenced humans cannot pollinated nature many modern domesticated flower species formerly simple weeds sprouted ground disturbed tended grow human crops perhaps already symbiotic companion plant relationships prettiest get plucked beauty developing dependence upon special adaptation human affection
paleontologists also proposed flowering plants angiosperms might evolved due interactions dinosaurs one ideas strongest proponents robert bakker proposes herbivorous dinosaurs eating habits provided selective pressure plants adaptations either succeeded deterring coping predation herbivores
classification
eight groups living angiosperms
amborella single species shrub new caledonia
nymphaeales species water lilies hydatellaceae
austrobaileyales species woody plants various parts world
chloranthales several dozen species aromatic plants toothed leaves
magnoliids species characterized trimerous flowers pollen one pore usually branchingveined leavesfor example magnolias bay laurel black pepper
monocots species characterized trimerous flowers single cotyledon pollen one pore usually parallelveined leavesfor example grasses orchids palms
ceratophyllum species aquatic plants perhaps familiar aquarium plants
eudicots species characterized merous flowers pollen three pores usually branchingveined leavesfor example sunflowers petunia buttercup apples oaks
exact relationship eight groups yet clear although agreement first three groups diverge ancestral angiosperm amborellales nymphaeales austrobaileyales term basal angiosperms refers three groups among rest relationship three broadest groups magnoliids monocots eudicots remains unclear analyses make magnoliids first diverge others monocots ceratophyllum seems group eudicots rather monocots

fertilization embryogenesis
double fertilization refers process two sperm cells fertilize cells ovary process begins pollen grain adheres stigma pistil female reproductive structure germinates grows long pollen tube pollen tube growing haploid generative cell travels tube behind tube nucleus generative cell divides mitosis produce two haploid n sperm cells pollen tube grows makes way stigma style ovary pollen tube reaches micropyle ovule digests way one synergids releasing contents include sperm cells synergid cells released degenerates one sperm makes way fertilize egg cell producing diploid n zygote second sperm cell fuses central cell nuclei producing triploid n cell zygote develops embryo triploid cell develops endosperm serves embryos food supply ovary develop fruit ovule develop seed
fruit seed
development embryo endosperm proceeds within embryo sac sac wall enlarges combines nucellus likewise enlarging integument form seed coat ovary wall develops form fruit pericarp whose form closely associated manner distribution seed
frequently influence fertilization felt beyond ovary parts flower take part formation fruit eg floral receptacle apple strawberry others
character seed coat bears definite relation fruit protect embryo aid dissemination may also directly promote germination among plants indehiscent fruits general fruit provides protection embryo secures dissemination case seed coat slightly developed fruit dehiscent seed exposed general seedcoat well developed must discharge functions otherwise executed fruit
economic importance
agriculture almost entirely dependent angiosperms provide virtually plantbased food also provide significant amount livestock feed families plants poaceae grass family grains far important providing bulk feedstocks rice corn maize wheat barley rye oats pearl millet sugar cane sorghum fabaceae legume family comes second place also high importance solanaceae nightshade family potatoes tomatoes peppers among others cucurbitaceae gourd family also including pumpkins melons brassicaceae mustard plant family including rapeseed innumerable varieties cabbage species brassica oleracea apiaceae parsley family many fruits come rutaceae rue family including oranges lemons grapefruits etc rosaceae rose family including apples pears cherries apricots plums etc
parts world certain single species assume paramount importance variety uses example coconut cocos nucifera pacific atolls olive olea europaea mediterranean region
flowering plants also provide economic resources form wood paper fiber cotton flax hemp among others medicines digitalis camphor decorative landscaping plants many uses main area surpassed plants namely coniferous trees pinales nonflowering gymnosperms timber paper production
