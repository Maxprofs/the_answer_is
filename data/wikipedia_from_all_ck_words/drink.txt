a drink or beverage is a liquid intended for human consumption in addition to basic needs beverages form part of the culture of human society although all beverages including juice soft drinks and carbonated drinks have some form of water in them water itself is often not classified as a beverage and the word beverage has been recurrently defined as not referring to water
an alcoholic beverage is a drink containing ethanol commonly known as alcohol although in chemistry the definition of an alcohol includes many other compounds alcoholic beverages such as wine beer and liquor have been part of human culture and development for 8,000 years
non-alcoholic beverages often signify drinks that would normally contain alcohol such as beer and wine but are made with less than 5 percent alcohol by volume the category includes drinks that have undergone an alcohol removal process such as non-alcoholic beers and de-alcoholized wines
== biology ==
when the human body becomes dehydrated it experiences the sensation of thirst this craving of fluids results in an instinctive need to drink thirst is regulated by the hypothalamus in response to subtle changes in the body's electrolyte levels and also as a result of changes in the volume of blood circulating the complete elimination of beverages i.e water from the body will result in death faster than the removal of any other substance water and milk have been basic drinks throughout history as water is essential for life it has also been the carrier of many diseases
as mankind evolved new techniques were discovered to create drinks from the plants that were native to their areas the earliest archaeological evidence of wine production yet found has been at sites in georgia (c.6000 bc) and iran (c.5000 bc) beer may have been known in neolithic europe as far back as 3000 bc and was mainly brewed on a domestic scale the invention of beer (and bread) has been argued to be responsible for humanity's ability to develop technology and build civilization tea likely originated in yunnan china during the shang dynasty (1500 bc1046 bc) as a medicinal drink
== history ==
drinking has been a large part of socialising throughout the centuries in ancient greece a social gathering for the purpose of drinking was known as a symposium where watered down wine would be drunk the purpose of these gatherings could be anything from serious discussions to direct indulgence in ancient rome a similar concept of a convivium took place regularly
many early societies considered alcohol a gift from the gods leading to the creation of gods such as dionysus other religions forbid discourage or restrict the drinking of alcoholic beverages for various reasons in some regions with a dominant religion the production sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages is forbidden to everybody regardless of religion
toasting is a method of honouring a person or wishing good will by taking a drink another tradition is that of the loving cup at weddings or other celebrations such as sports victories a group will share a drink in a large receptacle shared by everyone until empty
in east africa and yemen coffee was used in native religious ceremonies as these ceremonies conflicted with the beliefs of the christian church the ethiopian church banned the secular consumption of coffee until the reign of emperor menelik ii the beverage was also banned in ottoman turkey during the 17th century for political reasons and was associated with rebellious political activities in europe
== production ==
a beverage or drink is a form of liquid which has been prepared for human consumption this can include a number of different steps some prior to transport others immediately prior to consumption
=== purification of water ===
water is the chief constituent in all drinks and the primary ingredient in most water is purified prior to drinking methods for purification include filtration and the addition of chemicals such as chlorination the importance of purified water is highlighted by the world health organisation who point out 94% of deaths from diarrhea - the third biggest cause of infectious death worldwide at 1.8 million annually - could be prevented by improving the quality of the victim's environment particularly safe water
=== pasteurisation ===
pasteurisation is the process of heating a liquid to for a period of time at a specified temperature then immediately cooling the process reduces the growth of micro-organisms within the liquid thereby increasing the time before spoilage it is primarily used on milk which prior to pasteurisation is commonly infected with pathogenic bacteria and therefore the more likely than any other part of the common diet in the developed world to cause illness
=== juicing ===
the process of extracting juice from fruits and vegetables can take a number of forms simple crushing of most fruits will provide a significant amount of liquid though a more intense pressure can be applied to get the maximum amount of juice from the fruit both crushing and pressing are processes used in the production of wine
=== infusion ===
infusion is the process of extracting flavours from plant material by allowing the material to remain suspended within water this process is used in the production of teas herbal teas and can be used to prepare coffee (when using a coffee press)
=== percolation ===
the name is derived from the word percolate which means to cause (a solvent) to pass through a permeable substance especially for extracting a soluble constituent in the case of coffee-brewing the solvent is water the permeable substance is the coffee grounds and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color taste aroma and stimulating properties
=== carbonation ===
carbonation is the process of dissolving carbon dioxide into a liquid such as water
=== fermentation ===
fermentation is a metabolic process that converts sugar to alcohol fermentation has been used by humans for the production of beverages since the neolithic age in winemaking grape juice is combined with yeast in an anaerobic environment to allow the fermentation the amount of sugar in the wine and the length of time given for fermentation determine the alcohol level and the sweetness of the wine
when brewing beer there are four primary ingredients - water grain yeast and hops the grain is encouraged to germinate by soaking and drying in heat a process known as malting it is then milled before soaking again to create the sugars needed for fermentation this process is known as mashing hops are added for flavouring then the yeast is added to the mixture (now called wort) to start the fermentation process
=== distillation ===
distillation is a method of separating mixtures based on differences in volatility of components in a boiling liquid mixture it is one of the methods used in the purification of water it is also a method of producing spirits from milder alcoholic beverages
=== mixing ===
an alcoholic mixed drink that contains two or more ingredients is referred to as a cocktail cocktails were originally a mixture of spirits sugar water and bitters the term is now often used for almost any mixed drink that contains alcohol including mixers mixed shots etc a cocktail today usually contains one or more kinds of spirit and one or more mixers such as soda or fruit juice additional ingredients may be sugar honey milk cream and various herbs
== types of drink ==
=== non-alcoholic drinks ===
a non-alcoholic drink is one that contains little or no alcohol this category includes low-alcohol beer non-alcoholic wine and apple cider if they contain less than 0.5% alcohol by volume the term soft drink specifies the absence of alcohol in contrast to hard drink and drink the term drink is theoretically neutral but often is used in a way that suggests alcoholic content beverages such as soda pop sparkling water iced tea lemonade root beer fruit punch milk hot chocolate tea coffee milkshakes and tap water and energy drinks are all soft drinks
==== water ====
water is the worlds most consumed drink however 97% of water on earth is non-drinkable salt water fresh water is found in rivers lakes wetlands groundwater frozen glaciers less than 1% of the earths fresh water supplies are accessible through surface water and underground sources - those which are cost-effect to retrieve
==== milk ====
regarded as one of the original drinks milk is the primary source of nutrition for babies in many cultures of the world especially the western world humans continue to consume dairy milk beyond infancy using the milk of other animals (especially cattle goats and sheep) as a beverage plant milk a general term for any milk-like product that is derived from a plant source also has a long history of consumption in various countries and cultures the most popular varieties internationally are soy milk almond milk rice milk and coconut milk
==== tea ====
tea the second most consumed drink in the world is produced from infusing dried leaves of the camellia sinensis shrub in boiling water there are many ways in which tea is prepared for consumption lemon or milk and sugar are among the most common additives worldwide other additions include butter and salt in bhutan nepal and tibet chewy tapioca balls in taiwan fresh ginger in indonesia malaysia and singapore mint in north africa and senegal cardamom in central asia rum to make jagertee in central europe and coffee to make yuanyang in hong kong tea is also served differently from country to country in china and japan tiny cups are used to serve tea in thailand and the united states tea is often served cold (as iced tea") or with a lot of sweetener indians boil tea with milk and a blend of spices as masala chai tea is brewed with a samovar in iran kashmir russia and turkey and in the australian outback it is traditionally brewed in a billycan tea leaves can be processed in different ways resulting in a drink which appears and tastes different chinese yellow and green tea are steamed roasted and dried oolong tea is semi-fermented and appears green-black and black teas are fully fermented
around the world people refer to other herbal infusions as teas it is also argued that these were popular long before the camellia sinensis shrub was used for tea making leaves flowers roots or bark can be used to make a herbal infusion and can be bought fresh dried or powered
==== coffee ====
coffee is a brewed beverage prepared from the roasted seeds of several species of an evergreen shrub of the genus coffea the two most common sources of coffee beans are the highly regarded coffea arabica and the robusta form of the hardier coffea canephora coffee plants are cultivated in more than 70 countries once ripe coffee berries are picked processed and dried to yield the seeds inside the seeds are then roasted to varying degrees depending on the desired flavor before being ground and brewed to create coffee
coffee is slightly acidic (ph 5.05.1) and can have a stimulating effect on humans because of its caffeine content it is one of the most popular drinks in the world it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways the effect of coffee on human health has been a subject of many studies however results have varied in terms of coffee's relative benefit
coffee cultivation first took place in southern arabia the earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in the middle of the 15th century in the sufi shrines of yemen
==== carbonated drinks ====
carbonated drinks refer to drinks which have carbon dioxide dissolved into them this can happen naturally through fermenting and in natural water spas or artificially by the dissolution of carbon dioxide under pressure the first commercially available artificially carbonated drink is believed to have been produced by thomas henry in the late 1770s cola orange various roots ginger and lemon/lime are commonly used to create non-alcoholic carbonated drinks sugars and preservatives may be added later
the most consumed carbonated soft drinks are produced by three major global brands coca-cola pepsico and the dr pepper snapple group
==== juice and juice drinks ====
fruit juice is a natural product that contains few or no additives citrus products such as orange juice and tangerine juice are familiar breakfast drinks while grapefruit juice pineapple apple grape lime and lemon juice are also common coconut water is a highly nutritious and refreshing juice many kinds of berries are crushed their juices are mixed with water and sometimes sweetened raspberry blackberry and currants are popular juices drinks but the percentage of water also determines their nutritive value grape juice allowed to ferment produces wine
fruits are highly perishable so the ability to extract juices and store them was of significant value some fruits are highly acidic and mixing them with water and sugars or honey was often necessary to make them palatable early storage of fruit juices was labor-intensive requiring the crushing of the fruits and the mixing of the resulting pure juices with sugars before bottling
vegetable juices are usually served warm or cold different types of vegetables can be used to make vegetable juice such as carrots tomatoes cucumbers celery and many more some vegetable juices are mixed with some fruit juice to make the vegetable juice taste better many popular vegetable juices particularly ones with high tomato content are high in sodium and therefore consumption of them for health must be carefully considered some vegetable juices provide the same health benefits as whole vegetables in terms of reducing risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer
=== alcoholic drinks ===
an alcoholic beverage is a drink that contains ethanol commonly known as alcohol (although in chemistry the definition of alcohol includes many other compounds) beer has been a part of human culture for 8,000 years
in many countries drinking alcoholic beverages in a local bar or pub is a cultural tradition
==== beer ====
beer is an alcoholic beverage produced by the saccharification of starch and fermentation of the resulting sugar the starch and saccharification enzymes are often derived from malted cereal grains most commonly malted barley and malted wheat most beer is also flavoured with hops which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included the preparation of beer is called brewing beer is the world's most widely consumed alcoholic beverage and is the third-most popular drink overall after water and tea it is thought by some to be the oldest fermented beverage
some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer the code of hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours and the hymn to ninkasi a prayer to the mesopotamian goddess of beer served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people today the brewing industry is a global business consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries
==== cider ====
cider is a fermented alcoholic beverage made from fruit juice most commonly and traditionally apple juice but also the juice of peaches pears ("perry cider) or other fruit cider may be made from any variety of apple but certain cultivars grown solely for use in cider are known as cider apples the united kingdom has the highest per capita consumption of cider as well as the largest cider-producing companies in the world as of 2006 the u.k produces 600 million litres of cider each year (130 million imperial gallons)
==== wine ====
wine is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes or other fruits the natural chemical balance of grapes lets them ferment without the addition of sugars acids enzymes water or other nutrients yeast consumes the sugars in the grapes and converts them into alcohol and carbon dioxide different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine the well-known variations result from the very complex interactions between the biochemical development of the fruit reactions involved in fermentation terroir and subsequent appellation along with human intervention in the overall process the final product may contain tens of thousands of chemical compounds in amounts varying from a few percent to a few parts per billion
wines made from produce besides grapes are usually named after the product from which they are produced (for example rice wine pomegranate wine apple wine and elderberry wine) and are generically called fruit wine the term wine can also refer to starch-fermented or fortified beverages having higher alcohol content such as barley wine huangjiu or sake
wine has a rich history dating back thousands of years with the earliest production so far discovered having occurred c.6000 bc in georgia it had reached the balkans by c.4500 bc and was consumed and celebrated in ancient greece and rome
from its earliest appearance in written records wine has also played an important role in religion red wine was closely associated with blood by the ancient egyptians who according to plutarch avoided its free consumption as late as the 7th-century bc saite dynasty thinking it to be the blood of those who had once battled against the gods the greek cult and mysteries of dionysus carried on by the romans in their bacchanalia were the origins of western theater judaism incorporates it in the kiddush and christianity in its eucharist while alcohol consumption was forbidden in islam

=== places to drink ===
throughout history people have come together in establishments to socialise whilst drinking this includes cafs and coffeehouses focus on providing hot drinks as well as light snacks many coffee houses in the middle east and in west asian immigrant districts in the western world offer shisha (nargile in turkish and greek) flavored tobacco smoked through a hookah espresso bars such as starbucks and costa coffee are a type of coffeehouse that specialize in serving espresso and espresso-based drinks
in china and japan the establishment would be a tea house were people would socialise whilst drinking tea chinese scholars have used the teahouse for places of sharing ideas
alcoholic drinks are served in drinking establishments which have different cultural connotations for example pubs are fundamental to the culture of britain ireland australia atlantic canada new england metro detroit south africa and new zealand in many places especially in villages a pub can be the focal point of the community the writings of samuel pepys describe the pub as the heart of england many pubs are controlled by breweries so cask ale or keg beer may be a better value than wines and spirits
in contrast types of bars range from seedy bars or nightclubs sometimes termed dive bars to elegant places of entertainment for the elite bars provide stools or chairs that are placed at tables or counters for their patrons the term bar is derived from the specialized counter on which drinks are served some bars have entertainment on a stage such as a live band comedians go-go dancers or strippers patrons may sit or stand at the bar and be served by the bartender or they may sit at tables and be served by cocktail servers
=== matching with food ===
food and drink are often paired together to enhance the taste experience this primarily happens with wine and a culture has grown up around the process weight flavors and textures can either be contrasted or complemented in recent years food magazines began to suggest particular wines with recipes and restaurants would offer multi-course dinners matched with a specific wine for each course
=== presentation ===
different drinks have unique receptacles for their consumption this is sometimes purely for presentations purposes such as for cocktails in other situations the drinkware has practical application such as coffee cups which are designed for insulation or brandy snifters which are designed to encourage evaporation but trap the aroma within the glass
many glasses include a stem which allows the drinker to hold the glass without affecting the temperature of the drink in champagne glasses the bowl is designed to retain champagne's signature carbonation by reducing the surface area at the opening of the bowl historically champagne has been served in a champagne coupe the shape of which allowed carbonation to dissipate even more rapidly than from a standard wine glass
== commercial trade ==
=== international exports and imports ===
an important export commodity coffee was the top agricultural export for twelve countries in 2004 and it was the world's seventh-largest legal agricultural export by value in 2005 green (unroasted) coffee is one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world
=== investment ===
some drinks such as wine can be used as an alternative investment this can be achieved by either purchasing and reselling individual bottles or cases of particular wines or purchasing shares in an investment wine fund that pools investors capital
