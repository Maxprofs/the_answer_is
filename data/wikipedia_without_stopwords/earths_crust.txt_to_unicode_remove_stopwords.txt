earths crustedit
crust earth composed great variety igneous metamorphic sedimentary rocks crust underlain mantle upper part mantle composed mostly peridotite rock denser rocks common overlying crust boundary crust mantle conventionally placed mohorovii discontinuity boundary defined contrast seismic velocity crust occupies less earths volume
oceanic crust sheet different continental crust
oceanic crust km mi km mi thick composed primarily basalt diabase gabbro
continental crust typically km mi km mi thick mostly composed slightly less dense rocks oceanic crust less dense rocks granite common continental crust rare absent oceanic crust
continental oceanic crust float mantle continental crust thicker extends greater elevations greater depth oceanic crust slightly lower density felsic continental rock compared basaltic oceanic rock contributes higher relative elevation top continental crust top continental crust reaches elevations higher oceanic water runs continents collects oceanic crust change velocity seismic waves believed beneath continents certain depth continental crust sial becomes close physical properties oceanic crust sima transition zone referred conrad discontinuity
