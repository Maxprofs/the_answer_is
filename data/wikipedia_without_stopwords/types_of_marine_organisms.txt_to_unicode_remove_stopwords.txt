bay mud consists thick deposits soft unconsolidated silty clay saturated water soil layers situated bottom certain estuaries normally temperate regions experienced cyclical glacial cycles example locations cape cod bay chongming dongtan reserve shanghai china banc darguinpreserve mauritania bristol channel united kingdom mand island wadden sea denmark florida bay san francisco bay bay fundy casco bay penobscot bay morro bay bay mud manifests low shear strength high compressibility low permeability making hazardous build upon seismically active regions like san francisco bay area
typical bulk density bay mud approximately grams per cubic centimetre bay muds often high organic content consisting decayed organisms lower depths may also contain living creatures occur upper soil layer become exposed low tides called mudflats important ecological zone shorebirds many types marine organisms great attention given incidence deeper bay muds development encroachment certain north american bays intensified requiring geotechnical design foundations
bay mud official geological abbreviation designation quaternary older bay mud qobm acronym quaternary younger bay mud qybm alluvial layer often found overlying older bay mud

depositional scenarios
bay muds originate two generalized sources first alluvial deposits clays silts sand occur streams tributary given bay extent unconsolidated interglacial deposits typically ranges throughout given bay extent historical perimeter marshlands second periods high glaciation deposits silts sands organic plus inorganic detritus eg decomposition estuarine diatoms may form separate distinct layer thus bay muds important time records glacial activity streamflow throughout quaternary period
depositional formation quite recent case florida bay much bay mud accumulated since bc consists primarily decayed organic material case florida bay bay muds accrete much centimeters per annum although dynamic equilibrium erosion wave action redistribution deposition complicate net rate layer growth case bristol channel united kingdom bay mud formation occurring least since eemian stage known sangamonian stage north america years ago cases san francisco bay deposition interrupted sealevel changes strata vastly different vintages found san francisco bay area called young bay mud older bay mud geologists human activities also affect deposition close half young bay mud san francisco bay placed period result placer mining sierra nevada foothills
geotechnical factors
construction bay mud sites difficult soils low strength high compressibility lightweight buildings constructed bay mud sites thick enough layer nonbaymud soil bay mud buildings impose significant loads must supported deep foundations bearing stiffer layers bay mud obtaining support friction bay mud even deep foundations difficulties arise surrounding ground likely settle time potentially damaging utility connections building causing entryway sink street level
number notable buildings constructed bay muds typically employing special mitigation designs withstand seismic risks settlement issues complicating design issues fill beginning ad sometimes found deposited surface level example dakin building brisbane california designed sit piles feet deep anchoring franciscan formation bay muds upper fill layer furthermore structures entrance ramp set giant hinge allow surrounding land settle building absolute height remains constant crowne plaza highrise hotel burlingame california also designed sit bay muds westin hotel millbrae california trinity church bostons copley square indeed bostons entire back bay district named tidal bay covers logan international airport san francisco international airport also constructed bay mud
mudflats
mud layer exposed tidal fringe mudflats result affording unique ecotone affords numerous shorebird species safe feeding resting habitat muds function much like quicksand heavier mammalian predators cannot gain traction pursuit would actually become trapped sinking muds muds also important substrate primary marsh productivity including eelgrass cordgrass pickleweed furthermore home large variety molluscs estuarine arthropods richardson bay example exposes one third areal extent mudflat low tide hosts productive eelgrass expanse also large shorebird community
mammals harbor seal may use mudflats haul estuary waters however larger mammals humpback whales may become accidentally stranded low tides note normally humpback whales frequent estuaries containing mudflats least one errant whale publicized media humphrey humpback whale became stuck mudflat san francisco bay sierra point brisbane california

regulatory issues
building top bay mud layers dredging estuary bottoms variety regulatory frameworks may arise normally united states environmental impact report well geotechnical investigation conducted precedent major construction bay mud combined reports developed much data base extant bay mud characteristics frequently yielding original field data soil borings data demonstrated many locations shallower bay muds contain concentrations mercury lead chromium petroleum hydrocarbons pcbs pesticides chemicals exceed toxic limits geological record human activities last century data particularly important consider dredging bay muds contemplated part development project dredging impacts receiving lands soil contamination also water column impacts sediment disturbance
case dredging within united states permit almost always required united states army corps engineers submittal extensive data project limits chemical properties bay muds disturbed dredge disposal plan often complete environmental impact statement pursuant national environmental policy act review united states coast guard would normally required within individual state jurisdictions california environmental impact report must filed dredging significance furthermore agency reviews california coastal commission regional water quality control board would normally mandated
buildings proposed bay mud layers typically municipality involved addition usual engineering design review issues common building projects complicated site conditions require environmental impact report process would include reviews citys building department well applicable regional state agencies cited dredging projects except coast guard agencies would typically concerned
