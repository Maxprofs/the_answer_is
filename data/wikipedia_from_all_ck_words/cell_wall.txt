the cell wall is a tough flexible and sometimes rigid layer that surrounds some types of cells it surrounds the cell membrane and provides these cells with structural support and protection in addition the cell wall acts as a filtering mechanism a major function of the cell wall is to act as a pressure vessel preventing over-expansion when water enters the cell cell walls are found in plants fungi and prokaryotic cells but not in mycoplasmas
the composition of the cell wall varies between species and may depend on cell type and developmental stage the primary cell wall of land plants is composed of the polysaccharides cellulose hemicellulose and pectin in bacteria peptidoglycan forms the cell wall archaean cell walls have various compositions and may be formed of glycoprotein s-layers pseudopeptidoglycan or polysaccharides fungi possess cell walls made of the glucosamine polymer chitin and algae typically possess walls made of glycoproteins and polysaccharides unusually diatoms have a cell wall composed of biogenic silica often other accessory molecules are found anchored to the cell wall
== properties ==
the cell wall serves a similar purpose in organisms that possess them the wall gives cells rigidity and strength offering protection against mechanical stress in multicellular organisms it permits the organism to build and hold its shape (morphogenesis) the cell wall also limits the entry of large molecules that may be toxic to the cell it further permits the creation of a stable osmotic environment by preventing osmotic lysis and helping to retain water the composition properties and form of the cell wall may change during the cell cycle and depend on growth conditions
=== rigidity of cell walls ===
in most cells the cell wall is flexible meaning that it will bend rather than holding a fixed shape but has considerable tensile strength the apparent rigidity of primary plant tissues is enabled by cell walls but is not due to the walls stiffness hydraulic turgor pressure creates this rigidity along with the wall structure the flexibility of the cell walls is seen when plants wilt so that the stems and leaves begin to droop or in seaweeds that bend in water currents as john howland states it
think of the cell wall as a wicker basket in which a balloon has been inflated so that it exerts pressure from the inside such a basket is very rigid and resistant to mechanical damage thus does the prokaryote cell (and eukaryotic cell that possesses a cell wall) gain strength from a flexible plasma membrane pressing against a rigid cell wall
the apparent rigidity of the cell wall thus results from inflation of the cell contained within this inflation is a result of the passive uptake of water
in plants a secondary cell wall is a thicker additional layer of cellulose which increases wall rigidity additional layers may be formed containing lignin in xylem cell walls or containing suberin in cork cell walls these compounds are rigid and waterproof making the secondary wall stiff both wood and bark cells of trees have secondary walls other parts of plants such as the leaf stalk may acquire similar reinforcement to resist the strain of physical forces
=== permeability ===
the primary cell wall of most plant cells is freely permeable and permits the passage of small molecules and small proteins with size exclusion estimated to be 30-60 kda key nutrients especially water and carbon dioxide are distributed throughout the plant from cell wall to cell wall in apoplastic flow the ph is an important factor governing the transport of molecules through cell walls
== cell wall evolution ==
cell walls evolved independently in many groups even in the photosynthetic eukaryotes in these lineages the cell wall is involved in the evolution of the multicellularity terrestrialization and vascularization
== plant cell walls ==
the walls of plant cells must have sufficient tensile strength to withstand internal osmotic pressures of several times atmospheric pressure that result from the difference in solute concentration between the cell interior and external water plant cell walls vary from 0.1 to several m in thickness
=== layers ===
up to three strata or layers may be found in plant cell walls
the middle lamella a layer rich in pectins this outermost layer forms the interface between adjacent plant cells and glues them together
the primary cell wall generally a thin flexible and extensible layer formed while the cell is growing
the secondary cell wall a thick layer formed inside the primary cell wall after the cell is fully grown it is not found in all cell types some cells such as the conducting cells in xylem possess a secondary wall containing lignin which strengthens and waterproofs the wall
=== composition ===
in the primary (growing) plant cell wall the major carbohydrates are cellulose hemicellulose and pectin the cellulose microfibrils are linked via hemicellulosic tethers to form the cellulose-hemicellulose network which is embedded in the pectin matrix the most common hemicellulose in the primary cell wall is xyloglucan in grass cell walls xyloglucan and pectin are reduced in abundance and partially replaced by glucuronarabinoxylan another type of hemicellulose primary cell walls characteristically extend (grow) by a mechanism called acid growth which involves turgor-driven movement of the strong cellulose microfibrils within the weaker hemicellulose/pectin matrix catalyzed by expansin proteins the outer part of the primary cell wall of the plant epidermis is usually impregnated with cutin and wax forming a permeability barrier known as the plant cuticle
secondary cell walls contain a wide range of additional compounds that modify their mechanical properties and permeability the major polymers that make up wood (largely secondary cell walls) include
cellulose 35-50%
xylan 20-35% a type of hemicellulose
lignin 10-25% a complex phenolic polymer that penetrates the spaces in the cell wall between cellulose hemicellulose and pectin components driving out water and strengthening the wall
additionally structural proteins (1-5%) are found in most plant cell walls they are classified as hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (hrgp) arabinogalactan proteins (agp) glycine-rich proteins (grps) and proline-rich proteins (prps) each class of glycoprotein is defined by a characteristic highly repetitive protein sequence most are glycosylated contain hydroxyproline (hyp) and become cross-linked in the cell wall these proteins are often concentrated in specialized cells and in cell corners cell walls of the epidermis and endodermis may also contain suberin or cutin two polyester polymers that function as permeability barriers the relative composition of carbohydrates secondary compounds and protein varies between plants and between the cell type and age
plant cells walls also contain numerous enzymes such as hydrolases esterases peroxidases and transglycosylases that cut trim and cross-link wall polymers
the walls of cork cells in the bark of trees are impregnated with suberin and suberin also forms the permeability barrier in primary roots known as the casparian strip secondary walls - especially in grasses - may also contain microscopic silica crystals which may strengthen the wall and protect it from herbivores
cell walls in some plant tissues also function as storage depots for carbohydrates that can be broken down and resorbed to supply the metabolic and growth needs of the plant for example endosperm cell walls in the seeds of cereal grasses nasturtium and other species are rich in glucans and other polysaccharides that are readily digested by enzymes during seed germination to form simple sugars that nourish the growing embryo cellulose microfibrils are not readily digested by plants however
=== formation ===
the middle lamella is laid down first formed from the cell plate during cytokinesis and the primary cell wall is then deposited inside the middle lamella the actual structure of the cell wall is not clearly defined and several models exist - the covalently linked cross model the tether model the diffuse layer model and the stratified layer model however the primary cell wall can be defined as composed of cellulose microfibrils aligned at all angles microfibrils are held together by hydrogen bonds to provide a high tensile strength the cells are held together and share the gelatinous membrane called the middle lamella which contains magnesium and calcium pectates (salts of pectic acid) cells interact though plasmodesma(ta) which are inter-connecting channels of cytoplasm that connect to the protoplasts of adjacent cells across the cell wall
in some plants and cell types after a maximum size or point in development has been reached a secondary wall is constructed between the plasma membrane and primary wall unlike the primary wall the microfibrils are aligned mostly in the same direction and with each additional layer the orientation changes slightly cells with secondary cell walls are rigid cell to cell communication is possible through pits in the secondary cell wall that allow plasmodesma to connect cells through the secondary cell walls
== fungal cell walls ==
there are several groups of organisms that may be called fungi some of these groups have been transferred out of the kingdom fungi in part because of fundamental biochemical differences in the composition of the cell wall most true fungi have a cell wall consisting largely of chitin and other polysaccharides true fungi do not have cellulose in their cell walls
=== true fungi ===
in fungi the cell wall is the outer-most layer external to the plasma membrane the fungal cell wall is a matrix of three main components
chitin polymers consisting mainly of unbranched chains of -(1,4)-linked-n-acetylglucosamine in the ascomycota and basidiomycota or poly--(1,4)-linked-n-acetylglucosamine (chitosan) in the zygomycota both chitin and chitosan are synthesized and extruded at the plasma membrane
glucans glucose polymers that function to cross-link chitin or chitosan polymers -glucans are glucose molecules linked via -(1,3)- or -(1,6)- bonds and provide rigidity to the cell wall while -glucans are defined by -(1,3)- and/or -(1,4) bonds and function as part of the matrix
proteins enzymes necessary for cell wall synthesis and lysis in addition to structural proteins are all present in the cell wall most of the structural proteins found in the cell wall are glycosylated and contain mannose thus these proteins are called mannoproteins or mannans
== other eukaryotic cell walls ==
=== algae ===
like plants algae have cell walls algal cell walls contain either polysaccharides (such as cellulose (a glucan)) or a variety of glycoproteins (volvocales) or both the inclusion of additional polysaccharides in algal cells walls is used as a feature for algal taxonomy
mannans they form microfibrils in the cell walls of a number of marine green algae including those from the genera codium dasycladus and acetabularia as well as in the walls of some red algae like porphyra and bangia
xylans
alginic acid it is a common polysaccharide in the cell walls of brown algae
sulfonated polysaccharides they occur in the cell walls of most algae those common in red algae include agarose carrageenan porphyran furcelleran and funoran
other compounds that may accumulate in algal cell walls include sporopollenin and calcium ions
the group of algae known as the diatoms synthesize their cell walls (also known as frustules or valves) from silicic acid (specifically orthosilicic acid h4sio4) the acid is polymerised intra-cellularly then the wall is extruded to protect the cell significantly relative to the organic cell walls produced by other groups silica frustules require less energy to synthesize (approximately 8%) potentially a major saving on the overall cell energy budget and possibly an explanation for higher growth rates in diatoms
in brown algae phlorotannins may be a constituent of the cell walls
=== water molds ===
the group oomycetes also known as water molds are saprotrophic plant pathogens like fungi until recently they were widely believed to be fungi but structural and molecular evidence has led to their reclassification as heterokonts related to autotrophic brown algae and diatoms unlike fungi oomycetes typically possess cell walls of cellulose and glucans rather than chitin although some genera (such as achlya and saprolegnia) do have chitin in their walls the fraction of cellulose in the walls is no more than 4 to 20% far less than the fraction of glucans oomycete cell walls also contain the amino acid hydroxyproline which is not found in fungal cell walls
=== slime molds ===
the dictyostelids are another group formerly classified among the fungi they are slime molds that feed as unicellular amoebae but aggregate into a reproductive stalk and sporangium under certain conditions cells of the reproductive stalk as well as the spores formed at the apex possess a cellulose wall the spore wall has been shown to possess three layers the middle of which is composed primarily of cellulose and the innermost is sensitive to cellulase and pronase
== prokaryotic cell walls ==
=== bacterial cell walls ===
around the outside of the cell membrane is the bacterial cell wall bacterial cell walls are made of peptidoglycan (also called murein) which is made from polysaccharide chains cross-linked by unusual peptides containing d-amino acids bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fungi which are made of cellulose and chitin respectively the cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of archaea which do not contain peptidoglycan the cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria although l-form bacteria can be produced in the laboratory that lack a cell wall the antibiotic penicillin is able to kill bacteria by preventing the cross-linking of peptidoglycan and this causes the cell wall to weaken and lyse the lysozyme enzyme can also damage bacterial cell walls
there are broadly speaking two different types of cell wall in bacteria called gram-positive and gram-negative the names originate from the reaction of cells to the gram stain a test long-employed for the classification of bacterial species
gram-positive bacteria possess a thick cell wall containing many layers of peptidoglycan and teichoic acids in contrast gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall and only the firmicutes and actinobacteria (previously known as the low g+c and high g+c gram-positive bacteria respectively) have the alternative gram-positive arrangement these differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility for instance vancomycin can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae or pseudomonas aeruginosa
=== archaeal cell walls ===
although not truly unique the cell walls of archaea are unusual whereas peptidoglycan is a standard component of all bacterial cell walls all archaeal cell walls lack peptidoglycan with the exception of one group of methanogens in that group the peptidoglycan is a modified form very different from the kind found in bacteria there are four types of cell wall currently known among the archaea
one type of archaeal cell wall is that composed of pseudopeptidoglycan (also called pseudomurein) this type of wall is found in some methanogens such as methanobacterium and methanothermus while the overall structure of archaeal pseudopeptidoglycan superficially resembles that of bacterial peptidoglycan there are a number of significant chemical differences like the peptidoglycan found in bacterial cell walls pseudopeptidoglycan consists of polymer chains of glycan cross-linked by short peptide connections however unlike peptidoglycan the sugar n-acetylmuramic acid is replaced by n-acetyltalosaminuronic acid and the two sugars are bonded with a 1-3 glycosidic linkage instead of 1-4 additionally the cross-linking peptides are l-amino acids rather than d-amino acids as they are in bacteria
a second type of archaeal cell wall is found in methanosarcina and halococcus this type of cell wall is composed entirely of a thick layer of polysaccharides which may be sulfated in the case of halococcus structure in this type of wall is complex and as yet is not fully investigated
a third type of wall among the archaea consists of glycoprotein and occurs in the hyperthermophiles halobacterium and some methanogens in halobacterium the proteins in the wall have a high content of acidic amino acids giving the wall an overall negative charge the result is an unstable structure that is stabilized by the presence of large quantities of positive sodium ions that neutralize the charge consequently halobacterium thrives only under conditions with high salinity
in other archaea such as methanomicrobium and desulfurococcus the wall may be composed only of surface-layer proteins known as an s-layer s-layers are common in bacteria where they serve as either the sole cell-wall component or an outer layer in conjunction with polysaccharides most archaea are gram-negative though at least one gram-positive member is known
== other cell coverings ==
many protists and bacteria produce other cell surface structures apart from cell walls external (extracellular matrix) or internal many algae have a sheath or envelope of mucilage outside the cell made of exopolysaccharides diatoms build a frustule from silica extracted from the surrounding water radiolarians foraminiferans testate amoebae and silicoflagellates also produce a skeleton from minerals called test in some groups many green algae such as halimeda and the dasycladales and some red algae the corallinales encase their cells in a secreted skeleton of calcium carbonate in each case the wall is rigid and essentially inorganic it is the non-living component of cell some golden algae ciliates and choanoflagellates produces a shell-like protective outer covering called lorica some dinoflagellates have a theca of cellulose plates and coccolithophorids have coccoliths
an extracellular matrix is also present in metazoans its composition varies between cells but collagens are the most abundant protein in the ecm
