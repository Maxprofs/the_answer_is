== common elements across culturesedit ==
a number of cultures have adopted the traditional western custom of the white wedding in which a bride wears a white wedding dress and veil this tradition was popularized through the wedding of queen victoria some say victoria's choice of a white gown may have simply been a sign of extravagance but may have also been influenced by the values she held which emphasized sexual purity within the modern white wedding tradition a white dress and veil are unusual choices for a woman's second or subsequent wedding
the use of a wedding ring has long been part of religious weddings in europe and america but the origin of the tradition is unclear one possibility is the roman belief in the vena amoris which was believed to be a blood vessel that ran from the fourth finger (ring finger) directly to the heart thus when a couple wore rings on this finger their hearts were connected historian vicki howard points out that the belief in the ancient quality of the practice is most likely a modern invention double ring ceremonies are also a modern practice a groom's wedding band not appearing in the united states until the early 20th century
the wedding ceremony is often followed by wedding reception or a wedding breakfast in which the rituals may include speeches from the groom best man father of the bride and possibly the bride the newlyweds first dance as a couple and the cutting of an elegant wedding cake

the bridal chorus from lohengrin by richard wagner often used as the processional and commonly known as here comes the bride richard wagner is said to have been anti-semitic and as a result the bridal chorus is often not used at jewish weddings

== religious aspects of weddingsedit ==
most religions recognize a lifelong union with established ceremonies and rituals some religions permit polygamous marriages or same-sex marriages
many christian faiths emphasize the raising of children as a priority in a marriage in judaism marriage is so important that remaining unmarried is deemed unnatural islam also recommends marriage highly among other things it helps in the pursuit of spiritual perfection the bah faith sees marriage as a foundation of the structure of society and considers it both a physical and spiritual bond that endures into the afterlife hinduism sees marriage as a sacred duty that entails both religious and social obligations by contrast buddhism does not encourage or discourage marriage although it does teach how one might live a happily married life and emphasizes that marital vows are not to be taken lightly
different religions have different beliefs as regards the breakup of marriage for example the roman catholic church believes that marriage is a sacrament and a valid marriage between two baptized persons cannot be broken by any other means than death this means that civil divorcs cannot remarry in a catholic marriage while their spouse is alive in the area of nullity religions and the state often apply different rules a couple for example may begin the process to have their marriage annulled by the catholic church only after they are no longer married in the eyes of the civil authority

hindu ceremonies are usually conducted totally or at least partially in sanskrit the language of the hindu scriptures the wedding celebrations may last for several days and they can be extremely diverse depending upon the region denomination and caste mehendi ceremony is a traditional ritual in hindu weddings where henna application takes place on bride's hands and legs before the wedding on the wedding day the bride and the bridegroom garland each other in front of the guests most guests witness only this short ceremony and then socialize have food and leave the religious part (if applicable) comes hours later witnessed by close friends and relatives in cases where a religious ceremony is present a brahmin (hindu priest) arranges a sacred yajna (fire-sacrifice) and the sacred fire (agni) is considered the prime witness (sksh) of the marriage he chants mantras from the vedas and subsidiary texts while the couple are seated before the fire the most important step is saptapadi or saat phere wherein the bride and the groom hand-in-hand encircle the sacred fire seven times each circle representing a matrimonial vow then the groom marks the bride's hair parting with vermilion (sindoor) and puts a gold necklace (mangalsutra) around her neck several other rituals may precede or follow these afore-mentioned rites then the bride formally departs from her blood-relatives to join the groom's family
==== jewish customsedit ====
a traditional jewish wedding usually follows this format
before the ceremony the couple formalize a written ketubah (marriage contract) specifying the obligations of husband to the wife and contingencies in case of divorce the ketubah is signed by two witnesses and later read under the chuppah
the couple is married under a wedding canopy (chuppah) signifying their new home together the chuppah can be made from a piece of cloth or other material attached to four poles or a prayer shawl (tallit) held over the couple by four family members or friends
the couple is accompanied to the chuppah by both sets of parents and stands under the chuppah along with other family members if desired
seven blessings are recited blessing the bride and groom and their new home
the couple sip from a glass of wine
the groom will step on the glass to crush it usually with his right foot ostensibly in remembrance of the destruction of the second temple
at some weddings the couple may declare that each is sanctified to the other and/or repeat other vows and exchange rings
in orthodox and traditional jewish weddings the bride does not speak under the chuppah and only she receives a ring the groom recites harei at mekudeshet li k'dat moshe v'yisrael"- behold you are [thus] sanctified to me by the law of moses and israel as he places the ring on the bride's right index finger the bride's silence and acceptance of the ring signify her agreement to the marriage this part of the ceremony is called kiddushin the groom's giving an object of value to the bride is necessary for the wedding to be valid
in more egalitarian weddings the bride responds verbally often giving the groom a ring in return a common response is ani l'dodi v'dodi li (i am my beloved's my beloved is mine)
in some orthodox weddings the groom then says
if i forget you o jerusalem may my right hand forget its skill
may my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth
if i do not remember you
if i do not consider jerusalem in my highest joy.
the ceremony ends with the groom breaking a glass underfoot
the couple spend their first moments as man and wife in seclusion (apart from the wedding guests and with no other person present) this cheder yichud - the room of seclusion (or oneness') halachically strengthens the marriage bond since jews are traditionally forbidden to be secluded with an unrelated person of the opposite sex
the ceremony is followed by a seudat mitzvah the wedding meal as well as music and dancing
at the conclusion of the wedding meal birkat hamazon (grace after meals) is recited as well as the seven wedding blessings
in more observant communities the couple will celebrate for seven more days called the sheva brachot (seven blessings) during which the seven wedding blessings are recited at every large gathering during this time
