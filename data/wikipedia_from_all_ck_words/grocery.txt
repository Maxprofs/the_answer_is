a grocery store is a retail store that primarily sells food a grocer is a bulk seller of food grocery stores often offer non-perishable food that is packaged in cans bottles and boxes with some also having fresh produce butchers delis and bakeries large grocery stores that stock significant amounts of non-food products such as clothing and household items are called supermarkets some large supermarkets also include a pharmacy and an electronics section
in the united states canada and united kingdom supermarkets and convenience stores are sometimes described as grocery businesses or simply grocers small grocery stores that mainly sell fruits and vegetables are known as produce markets (u.s.) or greengrocers (britain) and small grocery stores that predominantly sell prepared food such as candy and snacks are known as convenience stores or delicatessens
some grocery stores (especially large ones) form the centerpiece of a larger complex that includes other facilities such as gas stations which will often operate under the store's name this setup is especially common in the united kingdom with major chains such as tesco and sainsbury's having many locations operating under this format
some groceries specialize in the foods of a certain nationality or culture such as italian polish oriental or middle-eastern these stores are known as ethnic markets and may also serve as gathering places for immigrants in many cases the wide range of products carried by larger supermarkets has reduced the need for such speciality stores the variety and availability of food is no longer restricted by the diversity of locally grown food or the limitations of the local growing season
== historyedit ==
=== early historyedit ===
beginning as early as the 14th century a grocer (or purveyor") was a dealer in comestible dry goods such as spices peppers sugar and (later) cocoa tea and coffee these items were bought in bulk hence the term grocer from the french grossier meaning wholesaler this term derived from medieval latin grossarius from which we also derive the word gross (meaning a quantity of twelve dozen or 144)
as increasing numbers of staple foodstuffs became available in cans and other less-perishable packaging the trade expanded its province today grocers deal in a wide range of staple food-stuffs including such perishables as meats produce and dairy products such goods are hence groceries
in some countries such as the united states grocery stores descended from trading posts which sold not only food but clothing household items tools furniture and other miscellaneous merchandise these trading posts evolved into larger retail businesses known as general stores these facilities generally dealt only in dry goods such as flour dry beans baking soda and canned foods perishable foods were instead obtained from specialty markets fresh meat was obtained from a butcher milk from a local dairy eggs and vegetables were either produced by families themselves bartered for with neighbours or purchased at a farmers market or a local greengrocer
many rural areas still contain general stores that sell goods ranging from cigars to imported napkins traditionally general stores have offered credit to their customers a system of payment that works on trust rather than modern credit cards this allowed farm families to buy staples until their harvest could be sold
=== modernisationedit ===
the first self-service grocery store piggly wiggly was opened in 1916 in memphis tennessee by clarence saunders an inventor and entrepreneur prior to this innovation the customer of a grocer would walk up to a counter or display and ask for the food items they wanted to purchase or hand over a grocery list as an order that the grocer or other clerks would then fill and charge the customer for saunder's invention allowed a much smaller number of clerks to service the customers proving successful (according to a 1929 issue of time) partly because of its novelty partly because neat packages and large advertising appropriations have made retail grocery selling almost an automatic procedure.
the early supermarkets began as chains of grocer's shops the development of supermarkets and other large grocery stores has meant that smaller grocery stores often must create a niche market by selling unique premium quality or ethnic foods that are not easily found in supermarkets a small grocery store may also compete by locating in a mixed commercial-residential area close to and convenient for its customers organic foods are also becoming a more popular niche market for the smaller stores
grocery stores operate in many different styles ranging from rural family-owned operations such as igas boutique chains such as whole foods market and trader joe's to larger supermarket chain stores in some places food cooperatives or co-op markets owned by their own shoppers have been popular however there has recently been a trend towards larger stores serving larger geographic areas very large all-in-one hypermarkets such as walmart and target have recently forced consolidation of the grocery businesses in some areas the global buying power of such very efficient companies has put an increased financial burden on traditional local grocery stores as well as the national supermarket chains
however many european cities (rome for example) are already so dense in population and buildings large supermarkets in the american sense may not replace the neighborhood grocery store however metro stores have been appearing in town and city centres in many countries leading to the decline of independent smaller stores large out-of-town supermarkets and hypermarkets such as tesco and sainsbury's in the united kingdom have been steadily weakening trade from smaller stores many grocery shop chains like spar or mace are taking over the regular family business model however traditional stores throughout europe have been preserved because of their history and their classic appearance they are sometimes still found in rural areas although they are rapidly disappearing

grocery stores in latin america have been growing fast since the early 1980s a large percentage of food sales and other articles take place in grocery stores today some examples are the chilean chains cencosud (jumbo and santa isabel covering chile argentina brazil and peru) walmart (lider and ekono) as well as falabella (tottus in chile and peru and supermercados san francisco in chile) these three chains are subsidiaries of large retail companies which also have other kinds of business units such as department stores and home improvement outlets all three also operate their own credit cards which are a key driver for sales and they also sell insurance and operate travel agencies these companies also run some malls in countries such as argentina chile peru and colombia
two other chains started in 2008 unimarc which bought several small local chains and has over 20% of the grocery segment in chile and southern cross a chilean investment fund that has around 8.6% of the supermarket segment mainly oriented to the southern areas of the country in puerto rico popular grocery stores include pueblo supermarkets and amigo

== food marketingedit ==
food marketing brings together the producer and the consumer it is the chain of activities that brings food from farm gate to plate the marketing of even a single food product can be a complicated process involving many producers and companies for example fifty-six companies are involved in making one can of chicken noodle soup these businesses include not only chicken and vegetable processors but also the companies that transport the ingredients and those who print labels and manufacture cans the food marketing system is the largest direct and indirect non-government employer in the united states
in the pre-modern era the sale of surplus food took place once a week when farmers took their wares on market day into the local village marketplace here food was sold to grocers for sale in their local shops for purchase by local consumers with the onset of industrialization and the development of the food processing industry a wider range of food could be sold and distributed in distant locations typically early grocery shops would be counter-based shops in which purchasers told the shop-keeper what they wanted so that the shop-keeper could get it for them
in the 20th century supermarkets were born supermarkets brought with them a self service approach to shopping using shopping carts and were able to offer quality food at lower cost through economies of scale and reduced staffing costs in the latter part of the 20th century this has been further revolutionized by the development of vast warehouse-sized out-of-town supermarkets selling a wide range of food from around the world
unlike food processors food retailing is a two-tier market in which a small number of very large companies control a large proportion of supermarkets the supermarket giants wield great purchasing power over farmers and processors and strong influence over consumers nevertheless less than 10% of consumer spending on food goes to farmers with larger percentages going to advertising transportation and intermediate corporations
=== pricesedit ===
it was reported on march 24 2008 that consumers worldwide faced rising food prices reasons for this development include changes in the weather and dramatic changes in the global economy including higher oil prices lower food reserves and growing consumer demand in china and india in the long term prices are expected to stabilize farmers will grow more grain for both fuel and food and eventually bring prices down already this is happening with wheat with more crops to be planted in the united states canada and europe in 2009 however the food and agriculture organization projects that consumers still have to deal with more expensive food until at least 2018
it is rare for the spikes to hit all major foods in most countries at once food prices rose 4% in the united states in 2007 the highest increase since 1990 and are expected to climb as much again in 2008 as of december 2007 37 countries faced food crises and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls in china the price of pork jumped 58% in 2007 in the 1980s and 1990s farm subsidies and support programs allowed major grain exporting countries to hold large surpluses which could be tapped during food shortages to keep prices down however new trade policies have made agricultural production much more responsive to market demands putting global food reserves at their lowest since 1983
food prices are rising wealthier asian consumers are westernizing their diets and farmers and nations of the third world are struggling to keep up the pace the past five years have seen rapid growth in the contribution of asian nations to the global fluid and powdered milk manufacturing industry which in 2008 accounted for more than 30% of production while china alone accounts for more than 10% of both production and consumption in the global fruit and vegetable processing and preserving industry the trend is similarly evident in industries such as soft drink and bottled water manufacturing as well as global cocoa chocolate and sugar confectionery manufacturing forecast to grow by 5.7% and 10.0% respectively during 2008 in response to soaring demand in chinese and southeast asian markets
rising food prices over recent years have been linked with social unrest around the world including rioting in bangladesh and mexico and the arab spring
in 2013 overseas development institute researchers showed that rice has more than doubled in price since 2000 rising by 120% in real terms this was as a result of shifts in trade policy and restocking by major producers more fundamental drivers of increased prices are the higher costs of fertiliser diesel and labour parts of asia see rural wages rise with potential large benefits for the 1.3 billion (2008 estimate) of asia's poor in reducing the poverty they face however this negatively impacts more vulnerable groups who don't share in the economic boom especially in asian and african coastal cities the researchers said the threat means social-protection policies are needed to guard against price shocks the research proposed that in the longer run the rises present opportunities to export for western african farmers with high potential for rice production to replace imports with domestic production
the us labor department has calculated that food purchased at home and in restaurants is 13% of household purchases behind 32% for housing and 18% for transportation the average us family spent $280 per month or $3,305 per year at grocery stores in 2004 the newsletter dollar stretcher survey estimated $149 a month for a single person $257 for a couple and $396 for a family of four
== food wasteedit ==
as of 2011 1.3 billion tons of food about one third of the global food production are lost or wasted annually the usda estimates that 27% of food is lost annually in developing and developed countries which operate either commercial or industrial agriculture food waste can occur at most stages of the food industry and in significant amounts
packaging protects food from damage during its transportation from farms and factories via warehouses to retailing as well as preserving its freshness upon arrival although it avoids considerable food waste packaging can compromise efforts to reduce food waste in other ways such as by contaminating waste that could be used for animal feedstocks
retail stores can throw away large quantities of food usually this consists of items that have reached either their best before sell-by or use-by dates food that passed the best before and sell-by date and even some food that passed the use-by date is still edible at the time of disposal but stores have widely varying policies to handle the excess food some stores put effort into preventing access to poor or homeless people while others work with charitable organizations to distribute food
retailers also contribute to waste as a result of their contractual arrangements with suppliers failure to supply agreed quantities renders farmers or processors liable to have their contracts cancelled as a consequence they plan to produce more than actually required to meet the contract to have a margin of error surplus production is often simply disposed some grocery stores donate leftover food (for example deli foods and bread past their expiration date) to homeless shelters or charity kitchens
