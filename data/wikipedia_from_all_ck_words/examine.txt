a general officer is an officer of high rank in the army and in some nations air forces or marines
the term general is used in two ways as the generic title for all grades of general officer and as a specific rank it originates in the 16th century as a shortening of captain general which rank was taken from middle french capitaine gnral the adjective general had been affixed to officer designations since the late medieval period to indicate relative superiority or an extended jurisdiction
== general officer ranksedit ==
the various grades of general officer are at the top of the military rank structure lower-ranking officers in land-centric military forces are typically known as field officers or field-grade officers and below them are company-grade officers
=== common systemsedit ===
there are two common systems of general ranks used worldwide in addition there is a third common international system the arab system of ranks which is used throughout the middle east and north africa but is not used elsewhere in the world
variations of one form the old european system were once used throughout europe it is used in the united kingdom (although it did not originate there) from which it eventually spread to the commonwealth and the united states of america the general officer ranks are named by prefixing general as an adjective with field officer ranks although in some countries the highest general officers are titled field marshal marshal or captain general
the other is derived from the french revolution where generals ranks are named according to the unit they (theoretically) command
==== old european systemedit ====
the system used either a brigadier general or a colonel general rank
the rank of field marshal was used by some countries as the highest rank while in other countries it was used as a divisional or brigade rank many countries (notably pre-revolutionary france and eventually much of latin america) actually used two brigade command ranks which is why some countries now use two stars as their brigade general insignia mexico and argentina still use two brigade command ranks
in some nations (particularly in the commonwealth since the 1920s) the equivalent to brigadier general is brigadier which is not always considered by these armies to be a general officer rank although it is always treated as equivalent to the rank of brigadier general for comparative purposes
as a lieutenant outranks a sergeant major confusion often arises because a lieutenant is outranked by a major originally the serjeant major was exclusively the commander of the infantry junior only to the captain general and lieutenant general the distinction of serjeant major general only applied after serjeant majors were introduced as a rank of field officer serjeant was eventually dropped from both rank titles creating the modern rank titles serjeant major (later spelled sergeant major) as a senior rank of non-commissioned officer was a later creation
==== french (revolutionary) systemedit ====
==== arab systemedit ====
the armies of arab countries use traditional arabic titles these were formalized in their current system to replace the turkish system that was formerly in use in the arab world and the turco-egyptian ranks in egypt

== specific rank of generaledit ==
in the old european system a general without prefix or suffix (and sometimes referred to informally as a full general") is usually the most senior type of general above lieutenant general and directly below field marshal usually it is the most senior peacetime rank with more senior ranks (for example field marshal marshal of the air force fleet admiral) being used only in wartime or as honorary titles
in some armies however the rank of captain general general of the army army general or colonel general occupied or occupies this position depending on circumstances and the army in question these ranks may be considered to be equivalent to a full general or to a field marshal
the rank of general came about as a captain-general the captain of an army in general (i.e. the whole army) the rank of captain-general began appearing around the time of the organisation of professional armies in the 17th century in most countries captain-general contracted to just general

== air force and naval equivalentsedit ==
some countries (such as the united states) use the general officer ranks for both the army and the air force as well as their marine corps other nations only use the general officer ranks for the army while in the air force they use air officers as the equivalent of general officers they use the air force rank of air chief marshal as the equivalent of the specific army rank of general this latter group includes the british royal air force and many current and former commonwealth air forcese.g royal australian air force indian air force royal new zealand air force nigerian air force pakistan air force etc
in most navies flag officers are the equivalent of general officers and the naval rank of admiral is equivalent to the specific army rank of general a noteworthy historical exception was the cromwellian naval rank general at sea in recent years in the american service there is a tendency to use flag officer and flag rank to refer to generals and admirals of the services collectively
