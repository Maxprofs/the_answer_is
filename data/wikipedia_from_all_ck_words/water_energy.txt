the water-energy nexus is the relationship between how much water is evaporated to generate and transmit energy and how much energy it takes to collect clean move store and dispose of water

all types of electricity generation consume water either to process the raw materials used in the facility or fuel constructing and maintaining the plant or to just generate the electricity itself renewable power sources as photovoltaic solar and wind power which require little water to produce energy require water in processing the raw materials to build the turbines and solar panels if a wind turbine is mounted on a concrete or steel tower additional tonnes of water are required in the tower's construction
in the us about 2 us gallons (7.6 l) of water is evaporated to create one kilowatt hour (kwh) of energy this water is consumed in thermoelectric plants which are power plants converting waste heat into electrical power and evaporated in reservoirs for hydroelectric plants an average of 18 gal (68 l) of fresh water is evaporated to generate 1 kwh of electricity at a hydroelectric plants the production of electricity to power one 60w incandescent light bulb over the course of a year would evaporate about 3,000 to 6,300 us gallons (24,000 l) of water
thermal power plants require large amounts of cooling water 39% of all freshwater withdrawals in the usa are used for thermoelectric energy production most of the cooling water is returned but at a higher temperature and only around 3% is actually consumed mostly by evaporation the demand for cooling water can be in competition with agriculture and municipal demands in some areas with the demand for water for irrigation around 40% overall as a result of climate change some rivers are running lower in the summer putting additional strain on power production

as energy requires water water supply and sewage disposal needs energy drinking water must be pumped to the treatment plant pre-treated and then pumped to consumers in areas where fresh water is scarce and drinking water must be brought in from a long distance the energy footprint for this drinking water is extremely high the energy consumed for pumping groundwater is typically between 537 kwh and 2,270 kwh per million gallons depending on pumping depth but as an example southern california receives potable water from the sacramento-san joaquin delta which travels over low-lying mountains and requires 9,200 kwh per million gallons
treatment of wastewater and stormwater can also consume significant energy combined sewer systems use the same pipes for conveying stormwater and wastewater during precipitation events stormwater can swell and even overwhelm the shared pipe resulting in sewer overflows extra wastewater treatment and flooding there are nearly 800 cities with combined sewer systems in the us many municipalities are in the process of installing storage tunnels and high rate treatment facilities to store and treat the large volume of storm/sewer water during precipitation events the overflow captured and treated at these new facilities is projected to be in the billions of gallons annually per city and will only increase the water-related energy consumption in these communities even areas with newer separate stormwater systems still experience infiltration and inflow of runoff in sanitary sewers and must treat stormwater at wastewater treatment facilities
according to the river network the u.s consumes at least 521 million mwh a year for water-related purposes which is the equivalent to 13% of the nations electricity consumption the energy required to heat water is even higher fuel oil propane electricity and natural gas are used to heat water in the us all together consuming the kwh equivalent of 304.2 billion kwh each year water related energy use in california alone including the conveyance storage treatment distribution wastewater collection treatment and discharge sectors consumes 19 percent of the states electricity 30 percent of its natural gas and 88 billion us gallons (330,000,000 m3) of diesel fuel annually
== water/runoff footprints ==
water-energy nexus is a term for the interrelationship of both water and energy excessive consumption of both can lead to resource depletion pollution and an overall increase in the price for each by conserving water and reducing runoff the negative impacts of the water-energy nexus can be mitigated a water footprint is an assessment of the amount of potable water used by an individual community business or nation for outdoors irrigation and indoors through a water footprint one can learn how much water is consumed and by what action can then be taken to reduce water consumption from the activities with the highest impact low-flow aerators toilets and showerheads can be installed inside while sustainable landscaping can be planted outside to reduce the need for irrigation a runoff footprint can be completed to assess how to sustainably reduce stormwater runoff on a site preventing it from entering the local stormwater system and being treated at a waste water treatment plant
