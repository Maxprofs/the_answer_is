poaching has traditionally been defined as the illegal hunting killing or capturing of wild animals usually associated with land use rights
until the 20th century mostly impoverished peasants poached for subsistence purposes thus supplementing meager diets by contrast stealing domestic animals (as in cattle raiding for example) classifies as theft not as poaching
since the 1980s the term poaching has also referred to the illegal harvesting of wild plant species
in 1998 environmental scientists from the university of massachusetts amherst proposed the concept of poaching as an environmental crime defining any activity as illegal that contravenes the laws and regulations established to protect renewable natural resources including the illegal harvest of wildlife with the intention of possessing transporting consuming or selling it and using its body parts they considered poaching as one of the most serious threats to the survival of plant and animal populations wildlife biologists and conservationists consider poaching to have a detrimental effect on biodiversity both within and outside protected areas as wildlife populations decline species are depleted locally and the functionality of ecosystems is disturbed
== acts of poachingedit ==
violations of hunting laws and regulations concerning wildlife management local or international wildlife conservation schemes constitute wildlife crimes that are typically punishable the following violations and offenses are considered acts of poaching in the usa
hunting killing or collecting wildlife that is listed as endangered by iucn and protected by law such as the endangered species act the migratory bird treaty act of 1918 and international treaties such as cites
fishing and hunting without a license
capturing wildlife outside legal hours and outside the hunting season usually the breeding season is declared as the closed season during which wildlife is protected by law
prohibited use of machine guns poison explosives snare traps nets and pitfall traps

hunting from a moving vehicle or aircraft
canned hunting is a particularly inhumane type of poaching wildlife as it often involves illegal activities such as trapping caging drugging animals or cutting their feet with razor blades

== motivesedit ==
sociological and criminological research on poaching indicates that in north america people poach for commercial gain home consumption trophies pleasure and thrill in killing wildlife or because they disagree with certain hunting regulations claim a traditional right to hunt or have negative dispositions toward legal authority in rural areas of the united states the key motives for poaching are poverty interviews conducted with 41 poachers in the atchafalaya river basin in louisiana revealed that 37 of them hunt to provide food for themselves and their families 11 stated that poaching is part of their personal or cultural history nine earn money from the sale of poached game to support their families eight feel exhilarated and thrilled by outsmarting game wardens
in african rural areas the key motives for poaching are the lack of employment opportunities and a limited potential for agriculture and livestock production poor people rely on natural resources for their survival and generate cash income through the sale of bushmeat which attracts high prices in urban centres body parts of wildlife are also in demand for traditional medicine and ceremonies
the existence of an international market for poached wildlife implies that well-organised gangs of professional poachers enter vulnerable areas to hunt and crime syndicates organise the trafficking of wildlife body parts through a complex interlinking network to markets outside the respective countries of origin
== effects of poachingedit ==
the detrimental effects of poaching can include
defaunation of forests predators herbivores and fruit-eating vertebrates cannot recover as fast as they are removed from a forest as their populations decline the pattern of seed predation and dispersal is altered tree species with large seeds progressively dominate a forest while small-seeded plant species become locally extinct
reduction of animal populations in the wild and possible extinction
the effective size of protected areas is reduced as poachers use the edges of these areas as open-access resources
wildlife tourism destinations face a negative publicity those holding a permit for wildlife-based land uses tourism-based tour and lodging operators lose income employment opportunities are reduced
emergence of zoonotic diseases caused by transmission of highly variable retrovirus chains
outbreaks of the ebola virus in the congo basin and in gabon in the 1990s have been associated with the butchering of apes and consumption of their meat
the outbreak of sars in hong kong is attributed to contact with and consumption of meat from masked palm civets raccoon dogs chinese ferret-badgers and other small carnivores that are available in southern chinese wildlife markets
bushmeat hunters in central africa infected with the human t-lymphotropic virus were closely exposed to wild primates
results of research on wild chimpanzees in cameroon indicate that they are naturally infected with the simian foamy virus and constitute a reservoir of hiv-1 a precursor of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in humans
many tribal people in africa brazil and india rely on hunting for food and have become victims of the fallout from poaching in the indian kanha tiger reserve they are prevented from hunting and were illegally evicted from their lands following the creation of nature reserves aimed to protect animals tribal people are often falsely accused of contributing to the decline of wildlife in india for example they bear the brunt of anti-tiger poaching measures despite the main reason for the tiger population crash in the 20th century being due to hunting by european colonists and indian royalties stephen corry director of the human-rights group survival international argues that indigenous peoples have shaped landscapes and managed animal populations for millennia he asserts that conservation organizations such as the world wildlife fund apply the term poaching unfairly to tribal people engaging in subsistence hunting while supporting trophy hunting by tourists for a fee

traditional chinese medicine often incorporates ingredients from all parts of plants the leaf stem flower root and also ingredients from animals and minerals the use of parts of endangered species (such as seahorses rhinoceros horns binturong and tiger bones and claws) has created controversy and resulted in a black market of poachers deep-seated cultural beliefs in the potency of tiger parts are so prevalent across china and other east asian countries that laws protecting even critically endangered species such as the sumatran tiger fail to stop the display and sale of these items in open markets according to a 2008 report from traffic popular medicinal tiger parts from poached animals include tiger genitals culturally believed to improve virility and tiger eyes
rhino populations face extinction because of demand in asia (for traditional medicine and as a luxury item) and in the middle east (where horns are used for decoration) a sharp surge in demand for rhino horn in vietnam was attributed to rumors that the horn cured cancer even though the rumor has no basis in science recent prices for a kilo of crushed rhino horn have gone for as much as $60,000 more expensive than a kilo of gold vietnam is the only nation which mass-produces bowls made for grinding rhino horn
