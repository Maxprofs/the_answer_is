in biology a pathogen (greek pathos suffering passion and - -gens producer of) in the oldest and broadest sense is anything that can produce disease a term which came into use in the 1880s typically the term is used to describe an infectious agent such as a virus bacterium prion fungus viroid or parasite that causes disease in its host the host may be an animal a plant a fungus or even another micro-organism
there are several substrates including pathways where the pathogens can invade a host the principal pathways have different episodic time frames but soil contamination has the longest or most persistent potential for harboring a pathogen diseases caused by organisms in humans are known as pathogenic diseases
== pathogenicity ==
pathogenicity is the potential disease-causing capacity of pathogens pathogenicity is related to virulence in meaning but some authorities have come to distinguish it as a qualitative term whereas the latter is quantitative by this standard an organism may be said to be pathogenic or non-pathogenic in a particular context but not more pathogenic than another such comparisons are described instead in terms of relative virulence pathogenicity is also distinct from the transmissibility of the virus which quantifies the risk of infection
a pathogen is may be described in terms of its ability to produce toxins enter tissue colonize hijack nutrients and its ability to immunosuppress the host
=== context-dependent pathogenicity ===
it is common to speak of an entire species of bacteria as pathogenic when it is identified as the cause of a disease (cf koch's postulates) however the modern view is that pathogenicity depends on the microbial ecosystem as a whole a bacterium may participate in opportunistic infections in immunocompromised hosts acquire virulence factors by plasmid infection become transferred to a different site within the host or respond to changes in the overall numbers of other bacteria present for example infection of mesenteric lymph glands of mice with yersinia can clear the way for continuing infection of these sites by lactobacillus possibly by a mechanism of immunological scarring

==== virulence ====
virulence (the tendency of a turtle pathogen to cause damage to a host's fitness) evolves when that pathogen can spread from a diseased host despite that host being very debilitated horizontal transmission occurs between hosts of the same species in contrast to vertical transmission which tends to evolve symbiosis (after a period of high morbidity and mortality in the population) by linking the pathogen's evolutionary success to the evolutionary success of the host organism
evolutionary medicine has found that under horizontal transmission the host population might never develop tolerance to the pathogen
==== transmission ====
transmission of pathogens occurs through many different routes including airborne direct or indirect contact sexual contact through blood breast milk or other body fluids and through the fecal-oral route
== types of pathogen ==
=== bacterial ===
although the vast majority of bacteria are harmless or beneficial a few pathogenic bacteria can cause infectious diseases one of the bacterial diseases with the highest disease burden is tuberculosis caused by the bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis which kills about 2 million people a year mostly in sub-saharan africa pathogenic bacteria contribute to other globally important diseases such as pneumonia which can be caused by bacteria such as streptococcus and pseudomonas and foodborne illnesses which can be caused by bacteria such as shigella campylobacter and salmonella pathogenic bacteria also cause infections such as tetanus typhoid fever diphtheria syphilis and leprosy
bacteria can often be killed by antibiotics because the cell wall on the outside is destroyed expelling the dna out of the body of the pathogen therefore making the pathogen incapable of producing proteins and dies they typically range between 1 and 5 micrometers in length
=== viral ===
some of the diseases that are caused by viral pathogens include smallpox influenza mumps measles chickenpox ebola and rubella
pathogenic viruses are diseases mainly those of the families of adenoviridae picornaviridae herpesviridae hepadnaviridae flaviviridae retroviridae orthomyxoviridae paramyxoviridae papovaviridae polyomavirus rhabdoviridae togaviridae viruses typically range between 20-300 nanometers in length
=== fungal ===
fungi comprise a eukaryotic kingdom of microbes that are usually saprophytes (consume dead organisms) but can cause diseases in humans animals and plants fungi are the most common cause of diseases in crops and other plants the typical fungal spore size is 1-40 micrometers in length
=== prionic ===
according to the prion theory prions are infectious pathogens that do not contain nucleic acids these abnormally folded proteins are found characteristically in some diseases such as scrapie bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) and creutzfeldtjakob disease
=== other parasites ===
some eukaryotic organisms such as protists and helminths cause disease
== treatment and health care ==
bacteria are usually treated with antibiotics while viruses are treated with antiviral compounds eukaryotic pathogens are typically not susceptible to antibiotics and thus need specific drugs infection with many pathogens can be prevented by immunization a small amount of pathogens are used in vaccines to make immunity stay alert and strengthen defense on the insides to prepare for a larger quantity of the virus ever getting inside hygiene is critical for the prevention of infection by pathogens
