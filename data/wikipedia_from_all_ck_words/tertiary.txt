tertiary is the former term for the geologic period from 66 million to 2.58 million years ago a time span that lies between the superseded secondary period and the quaternary the tertiary is no longer recognized as a formal unit by the international commission on stratigraphy but the word is still widely used the traditional span of the tertiary has been divided between the paleogene and neogene periods and extends to the first stage of the pleistocene epoch the gelasian age
the period began with the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs in the cretaceouspaleogene extinction event at the start of the cenozoic era and extended to the beginning of the quaternary glaciation at the end of the pliocene epoch
== historical use of the term ==
the term tertiary was first used by giovanni arduino during the mid-18th century he classified geologic time into primitive (or primary) secondary and tertiary periods based on observations of geology in northern italy later a fourth period the quaternary was applied
in the early development of the study of geology the periods were thought to correspond to the biblical narrative the rocks of the tertiary being thought to be associated with the great flood
in 1828 charles lyell incorporated a tertiary period into his own far more detailed system of classification he subdivided the tertiary period into four epochs according to the percentage of fossil mollusks resembling modern species found in those strata he used greek names eocene miocene older pliocene and newer pliocene
although these divisions seemed adequate for the region to which the designations were originally applied (parts of the alps and plains of italy) when the same system was later extended to other parts of europe and to america it proved to be inapplicable therefore the use of mollusks was abandoned from the definition and the epochs were renamed and redefined
== geological events ==
tectonic activity continued as gondwana finally split completely apart and india collided with the eurasian plate
south america was connected to north america toward the end of the tertiary and this resulted in climate changes in the mid to late tertiary
antarctica which was already separate drifted to its current position over the south pole during this era widespread volcanic activity was prevalent
== climate ==
climates during the tertiary slowly cooled starting off in the paleocene with tropical-to-moderate worldwide temperatures and ending before the first extensive glaciation at the start of the quaternary
