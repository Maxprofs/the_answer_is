a bottle is a rigid container with a neck that is narrower than the body and a mouth by contrast a jar has a relatively large mouth or opening which may be as wide as the overall container bottles are often made of glass clay plastic aluminium or other impervious materials and typically used to store liquids such as water milk soft drinks beer wine cooking oil medicine shampoo ink and chemicals a device applied in the bottling line to seal the mouth of a bottle is termed an external bottle cap closure or internal stopper a bottle can also be sealed by a conductive innerseal by using induction sealing
the bottle has developed over millennia of use with some of the earliest examples appearing in china phoenicia rome and crete bottles are often recycled according to the spi recycling code for the material some regions have a legally mandated deposit which is refunded after returning the bottle to the retailer
== etymology ==
first attested in english in the 14th century the word bottle derives from old french boteille which comes from vulgar latin butticula itself from late latin buttis meaning cask which is perhaps the latinisation of the greek (bouttis) vessel

==== wine bottles ====
the glass bottle was an important development in the history of wine because when combined with a high-quality stopper such as a cork it allowed long-term aging of wine glass has all the qualities required for long-term storage it eventually gave rise to chteau bottling the practice where an estate's wine is put in a bottle at the source rather than by a merchant prior to this wine would be sold by the barrel (and before that the amphora) and put into bottles only at the merchant's shop if at all this left a large and often abused opportunity for fraud and adulteration as the consumer had to trust the merchant as to the contents it is thought that most wine consumed outside of wine-producing regions had been tampered with in some way also not all merchants were careful to avoid oxidation or contamination while bottling leading to large bottle variation particularly in the case of port certain conscientious merchants bottling of old ports fetch higher prices even today to avoid these problems most fine wine is bottled at the place of production (including all port since 1974)
there are many sizes and shapes of bottles used for wine some of the known shapes
bordeaux this bottle is roughly straight sided with a curved shoulder that is useful for catching sediment and is also the easiest to stack traditionally used in bordeaux but now worldwide this is probably the most common type
burgundy traditionally used in burgundy this has sides that taper down about 2/3 of the height to a short cylindrical section and does not have a shoulder
champagne traditionally used for champagne it is similar to a burgundy bottle but with a wider base and heavier due to the pressurization
==== codd-neck bottles ====
in 1872 british soft drink maker hiram codd of camberwell london designed and patented a bottle designed specifically for carbonated drinks the codd-neck bottle was designed and manufactured to enclose a marble and a rubber washer/gasket in the neck the bottles were filled upside down and pressure of the gas in the bottle forced the marble against the washer sealing in the carbonation the bottle was pinched into a special shape as can be seen in the photo to the left to provide a chamber into which the marble was pushed to open the bottle this prevented the marble from blocking the neck as the drink was poured
soon after its introduction the bottle became extremely popular with the soft drink and brewing industries mainly in europe asia and australasia though some alcohol drinkers disdained the use of the bottle one etymology of the term codswallop originates from beer sold in codd bottles though this is generally dismissed as a folk etymology
the bottles were regularly produced for many decades but gradually declined in usage since children smashed the bottles to retrieve the marbles they are relatively scarce and have become collector items particularly in the uk a cobalt-coloured codd bottle today fetches hundreds of british pounds at auction.the codd-neck design is still used for the japanese soft drink ramune and in the indian drink called banta
=== plastic bottles ===
plastic bottles range from very small sample bottles to large carboys the plastic is strain oriented in the stretch blow molding manufacturing process plastic bottles are typically used to store liquids such as water soft drinks motor oil cooking oil medicine shampoo milk and ink the size ranges from very small sample bottles to large carboys the main advantage that plastic bottles have over glass is their superior resistance to breakage in both production and transportation
