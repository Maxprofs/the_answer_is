an import is a good brought into a jurisdiction especially across a national border from an external source the party bringing in the good is called an importer an import in the receiving country is an export from the sending country importation and exportation are the defining financial transactions of international trade
in international trade the importation and exportation of goods are limited by import quotas and mandates from the customs authority the importing and exporting jurisdictions may impose a tariff (tax) on the goods in addition the importation and exportation of goods are subject to trade agreements between the importing and exporting jurisdictions
== definitionedit ==
imports consist of transactions in goods and services to a resident of a jurisdiction (such as a nation) from non-residents the exact definition of imports in national accounts includes and excludes specific borderline cases a general delimitation of imports in national accounts is given below
an import of a good occurs when there is a change of ownership from a non-resident to a resident this does not necessarily imply that the good in question physically crosses the frontier however in specific cases national accounts impute changes of ownership even though in legal terms no change of ownership takes place (e.g cross border financial leasing cross border deliveries between affiliates of the same enterprise goods crossing the border for significant processing to order or repair) also smuggled goods must be included in the import measurement
imports of services consist of all services rendered by non-residents to residents in national accounts any direct purchases by residents outside the economic territory of a country are recorded as imports of services therefore all expenditure by tourists in the economic territory of another country are considered part of the imports of services also international flows of illegal services must be included
basic trade statistics often differ in terms of definition and coverage from the requirements in the national accounts
data on international trade in goods are mostly obtained through declarations to custom services if a country applies the general trade system all goods entering the country are recorded as imports if the special trade system (e.g extra-eu trade statistics) is applied goods which are received into customs warehouses are not recorded in external trade statistics unless they subsequently go into free circulation of the importing country
a special case is the intra-eu trade statistics since goods move freely between the member states of the eu without customs controls statistics on trade in goods between the member states must be obtained through surveys to reduce the statistical burden on the respondents small scale traders are excluded from the reporting obligation
statistical recording of trade in services is based on declarations by banks to their central banks or by surveys of the main operators in a globalized economy where services can be rendered via electronic means (e.g internet) the related international flows of services are difficult to identify
basic statistics on international trade normally do not record smuggled goods or international flows of illegal services a small fraction of the smuggled goods and illegal services may nevertheless be included in official trade statistics through dummy shipments or dummy declarations that serve to conceal the illegal nature of the activities
== balance of tradeedit ==
balance of trade represents a difference in value for import and export for a country a country has demand for an import when domestic quantity demanded exceeds domestic quantity supplied or when the price of the good (or service) on the world market is less than the price on the domestic market
the balance of trade usually denoted  is the difference between the value of the goods (and services) a country exports and the value of the goods the country imports
 or equivalently
a trade deficit occurs when imports are large relative to exports imports are impacted principally by a country's income and its productive resources for example the us imports oil from canada even though the us has oil and canada uses oil however consumers in the us are willing to pay more for the marginal barrel of oil than canadian consumers are because there is more oil demanded in the us than there is oil produced
in macroeconomic theory the value of imports can be modeled as a function of the domestic absorption and the real exchange rate  these are the two largest factors of imports and they both affect imports positively
== types of importedit ==
there are two basic types of import
industrial and consumer goods
intermediate goods and services
companies import goods and services to supply to the domestic market at a cheaper price and better quality than competing goods manufactured in the domestic market companies import products that are not available in the local market
there are three broad types of importers
looking for any product around the world to import and sell
looking for foreign sourcing to get their products at the cheapest price
using foreign sourcing as part of their global supply chain
direct-import refers to a type of business importation involving a major retailer (e.g wal-mart) and an overseas manufacturer a retailer typically purchases products designed by local companies that can be manufactured overseas in a direct-import program the retailer bypasses the local supplier (colloquial middle-man) and buys the final product directly from the manufacturer possibly saving in added cost data on the value of imports and their quantities often broken down by detailed lists of products are available in statistical collections on international trade published by the statistical services of intergovernmental organisations (e.g unstat faostat oecd) supranational statistical institutes (e.g eurostat) and national statistical institutes industrial and consumer goods
