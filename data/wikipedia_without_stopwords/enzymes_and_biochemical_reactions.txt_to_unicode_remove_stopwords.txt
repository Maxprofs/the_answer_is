groundwater pollution also called groundwater contamination occurs pollutants released ground make way groundwater also occur naturally due presence minor unwanted constituent contaminant impurity groundwater case likely referred contamination rather pollution
pollutant creates contaminant plume within aquifer movement water dispersion within aquifer spreads pollutant wider area advancing boundary often called plume edge intersect groundwater wells daylight surface water seeps spring making water supplies unsafe humans wildlife movement plume called plume front may analyzed hydrological transport model groundwater model analysis groundwater pollution may focus soil characteristics site geology hydrogeology hydrology nature contaminants
pollution occur onsite sanitation systems landfills effluent wastewater treatment plants leaking sewers petrol stations application fertilizers agriculture pollution contamination also occur naturally occurring contaminants arsenic fluoride using polluted groundwater causes hazards public health poisoning spread disease
different mechanisms influence transport pollutants eg diffusion adsorption precipitation decay groundwater interaction groundwater contamination surface waters analyzed use hydrology transport models
pollutant types
contaminants found groundwater cover broad range physical inorganic chemical organic chemical bacteriological radioactive parameters principally many pollutants play role surface water pollution may also found polluted groundwater although respective importance may differ
pathogens
pathogens contained human animal feces lead groundwater pollution given opportunity reach groundwater making unsafe drinking four pathogen types present feces bacteria viruses protozoa helminths helminth eggs first three commonly found polluted groundwater whereas relatively large helminth eggs usually filtered soil matrix
groundwater contaminated pathogens lead fatal fecaloral transmission diseases eg cholera diarrhoea
local hydrogeological conditions vary within space square kilometres ignored pit latrines cause significant public health risks via contaminated groundwater
nitrate
addition issue pathogens also issue nitrate pollution groundwater pit latrines led numerous cases blue baby syndrome children notably rural countries romania bulgaria nitrate levels mgl ppm groundwater cause blue baby syndrome acquired methemoglobinemia
nitrate also enter groundwater via excessive use fertilizers including manure fraction nitrogenbased fertilizers converted produce plant matter remainder accumulates soil lost runoff high application rates nitrogencontaining fertilizers combined high watersolubility nitrate leads increased runoff surface water well leaching groundwater thereby causing groundwater pollution excessive use nitrogencontaining fertilizers synthetic natural particularly damaging much nitrogen taken plants transformed nitrate easily leached
nutrients especially nitrates fertilizers cause problems natural habitats human health washed soil watercourses leached soil groundwater
volatile organic compounds
volatile organic compounds vocs dangerous contaminant groundwater generally introduced environment careless industrial practices many compounds known harmful late time regular testing groundwater identified substances drinking water sources
others
organic pollutants also found groundwater insecticides herbicides range organohalides chemical compounds petroleum hydrocarbons various chemical compounds found personal hygiene cosmetic products drug pollution involving pharmaceutical drugs metabolites inorganic pollutans might include ammonia nitrate phosphate heavy metals radionuclides
naturally occurring
arsenic
ganges plain northern india bangladesh severe contamination groundwater naturally occurring arsenic affects water wells shallower two regional aquifers pollution occurs aquifer sediments contain organic matter generates anaerobic conditions aquifer conditions result microbial dissolution iron oxides sediment thus release arsenic normally strongly bound iron oxides water consequence arsenicrich groundwater often ironrich although secondary processes often obscure association dissolved arsenic dissolved iron
fluoride
areas naturally occurring high levels fluoride groundwater used drinking water dental skeletal fluorosis prevalent severe
causes
landfill leachate
leachate sanitary landfills lead groundwater pollution
love canal one widely known examples groundwater pollution residents love canal neighborhood upstate new york noticed high rates cancer alarming number birth defects eventually traced organic solvents dioxins industrial landfill neighborhood built around infiltrated water supply evaporated basements contaminate air eight hundred families reimbursed homes moved extensive legal battles media coverage
onsite sanitation systems
groundwater pollution pathogens nitrate also occur liquids infiltrating ground onsite sanitation systems pit latrines septic tanks depending population density hydrogeological conditions
liquids leach pit pass unsaturated soil zone completely filled water subsequently liquids pit enter groundwater may lead groundwater pollution problem nearby water well used supply groundwater drinking water purposes passage soil pathogens die adsorbed significantly mostly depending travel time pit well pathogens die within days travel subsurface
degree pathogen removal strongly varies soil type aquifer type distance environmental factors reason difficult estimate safe distance pit latrine septic tank water source case recommendations safe distance mostly ignored building pit latrines addition household plots limited size therefore pit latrines often built much closer groundwater wells regarded safe results groundwater pollution household members falling sick using groundwater source drinking water
sewage treatment plants
treated effluent sewage treatment plants may also reach aquifer effluent infiltrated discharged local surface water bodies therefore substances removed conventional sewage treatment plants may reach groundwater well
example detected concentrations pharmaceutical residues groundwater order ngl several locations germany conventional sewage treatment plants micropollutants hormones pharmaceutical residues micropollutants contained urine feces partially removed remainder discharged surface water may also reach groundwater
others
causes groundwater pollution excessive application fertilizer pesticides chemical spills commercial industrial operations chemical spills occurring transport eg spillage diesel fuels illegal waste dumping infiltration urban runoff mining operations road salts deicing chemicals airports even atmospheric contaminants since groundwater part hydrologic cycle application animal manure may also result groundwater pollution pharmaceutical residues
groundwater pollution also occur leaking sewers observed example germany
large concern potential risk groundwater pollution hydraulic fracturing relatively cases contamination could confirmed
mechanisms
passage water subsurface provide reliable natural barrier contamination works favorable conditions
stratigraphy area plays important role transport pollutants area layers sandy soil fractured bedrock clay hardpan areas karst topography limestone bedrock sometimes vulnerable surface pollution groundwater earthquake faults also entry routes downward contaminant entry water table conditions great importance drinking water supplies agricultural irrigation waste disposal including nuclear waste wildlife habitat ecological issues
interactions surface water
although interrelated surface water groundwater often studied managed separate resources surface water seeps soil becomes groundwater conversely groundwater also feed surface water sources sources surface water pollution generally grouped two categories based origin
interactions groundwater surface water complex consequently groundwater pollution sometimes referred groundwater contamination easily classified surface water pollution nature groundwater aquifers susceptible contamination sources may directly affect surface water bodies distinction point vs nonpoint source may irrelevant spill ongoing release chemical radionuclide contaminants soil located away surface water body may create point nonpoint source pollution contaminate aquifer creating toxic plume
prevention
locating onsite sanitation systems
onsite sanitation systems designed way groundwater pollution sanitation systems prevented occurring detailed guidelines developed estimate safe distances protect groundwater sources pollution onsite sanitation following criteria proposed safe siting ie deciding location onsite sanitation systems
horizontal distance drinking water source sanitation system
guideline values horizontal separation distances onsite sanitation systems water sources vary widely eg m horizontal distance pit latrine groundwater wells
vertical distance drinking water well sanitation system
aquifer type
groundwater flow direction
impermeable layers
slope surface drainage
volume leaking wastewater
superposition ie need consider larger planning area
general guideline recommended bottom pit least m groundwater level minimum horizontal distance m pit water source normally recommended limit exposure microbial contamination however general statement made regarding minimum lateral separation distances required prevent contamination well pit latrine example even m lateral separation distance might sufficient strongly karstified system downgradient supply well spring m lateral separation distance completely sufficient well developed clay cover layer annular space groundwater well well sealed
