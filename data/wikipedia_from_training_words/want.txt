after operating under a construction permit as wjfm the station's owners petitioned the fcc to change the call letters to want (reflecting the original slogan you'll want to listen!") the station first signed on the air on october 1 1993 and the same day revived sister station wcor (then on 900 am) as a simulcast after it had been off-the-air for over a year the station was originally branded as fm 99 and was later tweaked to fm 98.9 to represent the station's actual frequency
