igneous rock derived latin word ignis meaning fire one three main rock types others sedimentary metamorphic igneous rock formed cooling solidification magma lava igneous rock may form without crystallization either surface intrusive plutonic rocks surface extrusive volcanic rocks magma derived partial melts preexisting rocks either planets mantle crust typically melting caused one three processes increase temperature decrease pressure change composition types igneous rocks described formed beneath surface earths crust
geological significanceedit
igneous metamorphic rocks make top km earths crust volume
igneous rocks geologically important
minerals global chemistry give information composition mantle igneous rocks extracted temperature pressure conditions allowed extraction andor preexisting rock melted
absolute ages obtained various forms radiometric dating thus compared adjacent geological strata allowing time sequence events
features usually characteristic specific tectonic environment allowing tectonic reconstitutions see plate tectonics
special circumstances host important mineral deposits ores example tungsten tin uranium commonly associated granites diorites whereas ores chromium platinum commonly associated gabbros
morphology settingedit
terms modes occurrence igneous rocks either intrusive plutonic extrusive volcanic hypabyssal
intrusiveedit
intrusive igneous rocks formed magma cools solidifies within crust planet surrounded preexisting rock called country rock magma cools slowly result rocks coarse grained mineral grains rocks generally identified naked eye intrusive rocks also classified according shape size intrusive body relation formations intrudes typical intrusive formations batholiths stocks laccoliths sills dikes magma solidifies within earths crust cools slowly forming coarse textured rocks granite gabbro diorite
central cores major mountain ranges consist intrusive igneous rocks usually granite exposed erosion cores called batholiths may occupy huge areas earths surface
coarse grained intrusive igneous rocks form depth within crust termed abyssal intrusive igneous rocks form near surface termed hypabyssal
extrusiveedit
extrusive igneous rocks also known volcanic rocks formed crusts surface result partial melting rocks within mantle crust extrusive igneous rocks cool solidify quicker intrusive igneous rocks formed cooling molten magma earths surface magma brought surface fissures volcanic eruptions solidifies faster rate hence rocks smooth crystalline fine grained basalt common extrusive igneous rock forms lava flows lava sheets lava plateaus kinds basalt solidify form long polygonal columns giants causeway found antrim northern ireland example
molten rock without suspended crystals gas bubbles called magma rises less dense rock created magma reaches surface beneath water air called lava eruptions volcanoes air termed subaerial whereas occurring underneath ocean termed submarine black smokers midocean ridge basalt examples submarine volcanic activity

igneous rocks crystals large enough seen naked eye called phaneritic crystals small seen called aphanitic generally speaking phaneritic implies intrusive origin aphanitic extrusive one
igneous rock larger clearly discernible crystals embedded finergrained matrix termed porphyry porphyritic texture develops crystals grow considerable size main mass magma crystallizes finergrained uniform material
igneous rocks classified basis texture composition texture refers size shape arrangement mineral grains crystals rock composed
textureedit
texture important criterion naming volcanic rocks texture volcanic rocks including size shape orientation distribution mineral grains intergrain relationships determine whether rock termed tuff pyroclastic lava simple lava
however texture subordinate part classifying volcanic rocks often needs chemical information gleaned rocks extremely finegrained groundmass airfall tuffs may formed volcanic ash
textural criteria less critical classifying intrusive rocks majority minerals visible naked eye least using hand lens magnifying glass microscope plutonic rocks also tend less texturally varied less prone gaining structural fabrics textural terms used differentiate different intrusive phases large plutons instance porphyritic margins large intrusive bodies porphyry stocks subvolcanic dikes apophyses mineralogical classification often used classify plutonic rocks chemical classifications preferred classify volcanic rocks phenocryst species used prefix eg olivinebearing picrite orthoclasephyric rhyolite
