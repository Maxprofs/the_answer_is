sandstone sometimes known arenite clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly sandsized minerals rock grains
sandstone composed quartz andor feldspar common minerals earths crust like sand sandstone may color common colors tan brown yellow red grey pink white black since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs topographic features certain colors sandstone strongly identified certain regions
rock formations primarily composed sandstone usually allow percolation water fluids porous enough store large quantities making valuable aquifers petroleum reservoirs finegrained aquifers sandstones better able filter pollutants surface rocks cracks crevices limestone rocks fractured seismic activity
quartzbearing sandstone converted quartzite heating pressure usually related tectonic compression within orogenic belts
origins
sandstones clastic origin opposed either organic like chalk coal chemical like gypsum jasper formed cemented grains may either fragments preexisting rock monominerallic crystals cements binding grains together typically calcite clays silica grain sizes sands defined geology within range mm mm inches clays sediments smaller grain sizes visible naked eye including siltstones shales typically called argillaceous sediments rocks greater grain sizes including breccias conglomerates termed rudaceous sediments
formation sandstone involves two principal stages first layer layers sand accumulates result sedimentation either water stream lake sea air desert typically sedimentation occurs sand settling suspension ie ceasing rolled bounced along bottom body water ground surface eg desert erg finally accumulated sand becomes sandstone compacted pressure overlying deposits cemented precipitation minerals within pore spaces sand grains
common cementing materials silica calcium carbonate often derived either dissolution alteration sand buried colours usually tan yellow blend clear quartz dark amber feldspar content sand predominant additional colourant southwestern united states iron oxide imparts reddish tints ranging pink dark red terracotta additional manganese imparting purplish hue red sandstones also seen southwest west britain well central europe mongolia regularity latter favours use source masonry either primary building material facing stone construction

components
framework grains
framework grains sandsized mm diameter detrital fragments make bulk sandstone grains classified several different categories based mineral composition
quartz framework grains dominate minerals clastic sedimentary rocks exceptional physical properties hardness chemical stability physical properties allow quartz grains survive multiple recycling events also allowing grains display degree rounding quartz grains evolve plutonic rock felsic origin also older sandstones recycled
feldspathic framework grains commonly second abundant mineral sandstones feldspar divided two smaller subdivisions alkali feldspars plagioclase feldspars different types feldspar distinguished petrographic microscope description different types feldspar
alkali feldspar group minerals chemical composition mineral range kalsio naalsio represents complete solid solution
plagioclase feldspar complex group solid solution minerals range composition naalsio caalsio
lithic framework grains pieces ancient source rock yet weather away individual mineral grains called lithic fragments clasts lithic fragments finegrained coarsegrained igneous metamorphic sedimentary rock although common lithic fragment found sedimentary rocks clasts volcanic rocks
accessory minerals mineral grains sandstone commonly minerals make small percentage grains sandstone common accessory minerals include micas muscovite biotite olivine pyroxene corundum many accessory grains dense silicates make bulk rock heavy minerals commonly resistant weathering used indicator sandstone maturity ztr index common heavy minerals include zircon tourmaline rutile hence ztr garnet magnetite dense resistant minerals derived source rock
matrix
matrix fine material present within interstitial pore space framework grains interstitial pore space classified two different varieties one call sandstone arenite call wacke definition differences two matrices
arenites texturally clean sandstones free little matrix
wackes texturally dirty sandstones significant amount matrix
cement
cement binds siliclastic framework grains together cement secondary mineral forms deposition burial sandstone cementing materials may either silicate minerals nonsilicate minerals calcite
silica cement consist either quartz opal minerals quartz common silicate mineral acts cement sandstone silica cement present quartz grains attached cement creates rim around quartz grain called overgrowth overgrowth retains crystallographic continuity quartz framework grain cemented opal cement found sandstones rich volcanogenic materials rarely sandstones
calcite cement common carbonate cement calcite cement assortment smaller calcite crystals cement adheres framework grains adhesion causes framework grains adhered together
minerals act cements include hematite limonite feldspars anhydrite gypsum barite clay minerals zeolite minerals
pore space
pore space includes open spaces within rock soil pore space rock direct relationship porosity permeability rock porosity permeability directly influenced way sand grains packed together
porosity percentage bulk volume inhabited interstices within given rock porosity directly influenced packing evensized spherical grains rearranged loosely packed tightest packed sandstones
permeability rate water fluids flow rock groundwater work permeability may measured gallons per day one square foot cross section unit hydraulic gradient
types sandstone
sandstones composed general minerals minerals make framework components sandstones components quartz feldspars lithic fragments matrix may also present interstitial spaces framework grains list several major groups sandstones groups divided based mineralogy texture even though sandstones simple compositions based framework grains geologists able agree specific right way classify sandstones sandstone classifications typically done pointcounting thin section using method like gazzidickinson method composition sandstone important information regarding genesis sediment used triangular quartz feldspar lithic fragment qfl diagrams many geologist however agree separate triangle parts single components framework grains plotted therefore many published ways classify sandstones similar general format
visual aids diagrams allow geologists interpret different characteristics sandstone following qfl chart sandstone provenance model correspond therefore qfl chart plotted points plotted sandstone provenance model stage textural maturity chart illustrates different stages sandstone goes
qfl chart representation framework grains matrix present sandstone chart similar used igneous petrology plotted correctly model analysis creates meaningful quantitative classification sandstones
sandstone provenance chart allows geologists visually interpret different types places sandstones originate
stage textural maturity chart shows different stages sandstones chart shows difference immature submature mature supermature sandstones sandstone becomes mature grains become rounded less clay makes matrix rock

arenites types sandstone less clay matrix framework grains
quartz arenites sandstones contain siliceous grains grains include quartz chert rock fragments quartz arenites texturally mature supermature sandstones pure quartz sands result extensive weathering occurred transport weathering removed everything quartz grains stable mineral commonly affiliated rocks deposited stable cratonic environment aeolian beaches shelf environments quartz arenites emanate multiple recycling quarts grains generally sedimentary source rocks less regularly firstcycle deposits derived primary igneous metamorphic rocks

uses
sandstone used domestic construction housewares since prehistoric times continues used
sandstone popular building material ancient times relatively soft making easy carve widely used around world constructing temples homes buildings also used artistic purposes create ornamental fountains statues
