cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-butterfat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization in un-homogenized milk the fat which is less dense will eventually rise to the top in the industrial production of cream this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called separators in many countries cream is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content cream can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets cream has high levels of saturated fat
cream skimmed from milk may be called sweet cream to distinguish it from whey cream skimmed from whey a by-product of cheese-making whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty tangy and cheesy in many countries cream is usually sold partially fermented sour cream crme frache and so on
cream has many culinary uses in both sweet and salty dishes
cream produced by cattle (particularly jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat this gives the cream a slight yellow tone hence the name of the yellowish-white color cream this is also the origin of butter's yellow color cream from goat's milk or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets is white

light (or lite') 1820% fat
pure cream 3556% fat without artificial thickeners
thickened cream 3536.5% fat with added gelatine and/or other thickeners to give the cream a creamier texture also possibly with stabilizers to aid the consistency of whipped cream (this would be the cream to use for whipped cream not necessarily for cooking)
