substitution reaction also known single displacement reaction single replacement reaction chemical reaction one functional group chemical compound replaced another functional group substitution reactions prime importance organic chemistry substitution reactions organic chemistry classified either electrophilic nucleophilic depending upon reagent involved classifications well mentioned
organic substitution reactions classified several main organic reaction types depending whether reagent brings substitution considered electrophile nucleophile whether reactive intermediate involved reaction carbocation carbanion free radical whether substrate aliphatic aromatic detailed understanding reaction type helps predict product outcome reaction also helpful optimizing reaction regard variables temperature choice solvent
good example substitution reaction halogenation chlorine gas clcl irradiated molecules split two chlorine radicals cl whose free electrons strongly nucleophilic one breaks weak ch covalent bond grabs liberated proton form electrically neutral hcl radical reforms covalent bond ch form chcl methyl chloride
nucleophilic substitution
organic inorganic chemistry nucleophilic substitution fundamental class reactions nucleophile selectively bonds attacks positive partially positive charge atom group atoms replaces weaker nucleophile become leaving group remaining positive partially positive atom becomes electrophile whole molecular entity electrophile leaving group part usually called substrate
general form reaction may given rlg indicates substrate
nuc rlg rnuc lg
electron pair nucleophile nuc attacks substrate rlg forming new covalent bond nucrlg prior state charge restored leaving group lg departs electron pair principal product case rnuc reactions nucleophile usually electrically neutral negatively charged whereas substrate typically neutral positively charged
example nucleophilic substitution hydrolysis alkyl bromide rbr basic conditions attacking nucleophile base oh leaving group br
rbr oh roh br
nucleophilic substitution reactions commonplace organic chemistry broadly categorized taking place carbon saturated aliphatic compound carbon less often aromatic unsaturated carbon center
mechanisms
substitutions produced two different mechanisms categorized unimolecular nucleophilic substitution sn bimolecular nucleophilic substitution sn
sn mechanism two steps first step leaving group departs forming carbocation c second step nucleophilic reagent nuc attaches carbocation forms covalent sigma bond substrate chiral carbon mechanism result either inversion stereochemistry retention configuration usually occur without preference result racemization
example diagrams see reaction tertbutyl bromide water shown sn reaction
sn mechanism one step attack reagent expulsion leaving group happen simultaneously mechanism always results inversion configuration
substrate nucleophilic attack chiral reaction lead inversion stereochemistry called walden inversion
example sn reaction chloroethane bromide ion see sn reaction
sn attack may occurs backside route attack sterically hindered substituents substrate therefore mechanism usually occurs unhindered primary carbon center steric crowding substrate near leaving group tertiary carbon center substitution involve sn rather sn mechanism sn would also likely case sufficiently stable carbocation intermediary could formed
substrate aromatic compound reaction type nucleophilic aromatic substitution carboxylic acid derivatives react nucleophiles nucleophilic acyl substitution kind reaction useful preparing compounds
electrophilic substitution
electrophiles involved electrophilic substitution reactions particularly electrophilic aromatic substitutions
example benzene rings electron resonance structure attacked electrophile e resonating bond broken carbocation resonating structure results finally proton kicked new aromatic compound formed
electrophilic reactions unsaturated compounds arenes generally lead electrophilic addition rather substitution
radical substitution
radical substitution reaction involves radicals example hunsdiecker reaction
organometallic substitution
coupling reactions class metalcatalyzed reactions involving organometallic compound rm organic halide rx together react form compound type rr formation new carboncarbon bond examples include heck reaction ullmann reaction wurtzfittig reaction many variations exist
substituted compounds

example benzene simple aromatic ring benzenes undergone substitution heterogeneous group chemicals wide spectrum uses properties
