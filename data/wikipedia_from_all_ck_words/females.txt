female () is the sex of an organism or a part of an organism that produces non-mobile ova (egg cells) most female mammals including female humans have two x chromosomes
== defining characteristics ==
the ova are defined as the larger gametes in a heterogamous reproduction system while the smaller usually motile gamete the spermatozoon is produced by the male a female individual cannot reproduce sexually without access to the gametes of a male (an exception is parthenogenesis) some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually
there is no single genetic mechanism behind sex differences in different species and the existence of two sexes seems to have evolved multiple times independently in different evolutionary lineages patterns of sexual reproduction include
isogamous species with two or more mating types with gametes of identical form and behavior (but different at the molecular level)
anisogamous species with gametes of male and female types
oogamous species which include humans in which the female gamete is very much larger than the male and has no ability to move oogamy is a form of anisogamy there is an argument that this pattern was driven by the physical constraints on the mechanisms by which two gametes get together as required for sexual reproduction
other than the defining difference in the type of gamete produced differences between males and females in one lineage cannot always be predicted by differences in another the concept is not limited to animals egg cells are produced by chytrids diatoms water moulds and land plants among others in land plants female and male designate not only the egg- and sperm-producing organisms and structures but also the structures of the sporophytes that give rise to male and female plants
== etymology and usage ==
the word female comes from the latin femella the diminutive form of femina meaning woman it is not etymologically related to the word male but in the late 14th century the spelling was altered in english to parallel the spelling of male
== mammalian female ==
a distinguishing characteristic of the class mammalia is the presence of mammary glands the mammary glands are modified sweat glands that produce milk which is used to feed the young for some time after birth only mammals produce milk mammary glands are most obvious in humans as the female human body stores large amounts of fatty tissue near the nipples resulting in prominent breasts mammary glands are present in all mammals although they are vestigial in the male of the species
most mammalian females have two copies of the x chromosome as opposed to the male which carries only one x and one smaller y chromosome (but some mammals such as the platypus have different combinations) to compensate for the difference in size one of the female's x chromosomes is randomly inactivated in each cell of placental mammals while the paternally derived x is inactived in marsupials in birds and some reptiles by contrast it is the female which is heterozygous and carries a z and a w chromosome whilst the male carries two z chromosomes intersex conditions can also give rise to other combinations but this usually results in sterility
mammalian females bear live young (with the rare exception of monotremes which lay eggs) some non-mammalian species such as guppies have analogous reproductive structures and some other non-mammals such as sharks whose eggs hatch inside their bodies also have the appearance of bearing live young
== symbol ==
a common symbol used to represent the female sex is (unicode u+2640 alt codes alt+12) a circle with a small cross underneath according to schott the most established view is that the male and female symbols are derived from contractions in greek script of the greek names of these planets namely thouros (mars) and phosphoros (venus) these derivations have been traced by renkama who illustrated how greek letters can be transformed into the graphic male and female symbols still recognised today. thouros was abbreviated by  and phosphoros by  both in the handwriting of alchemists so somewhat different from the greek symbols we know these abbreviations were contracted into the modern symbols
== sex determination ==
the sex of a particular organism may be determined by a number of factors these may be genetic or environmental or may naturally change during the course of an organism's life although most species with male and female sexes have individuals that are either male or female hermaphroditic animals have both male and female reproductive organs
=== genetic determination ===
the sex of most mammals including humans is genetically determined by the xy sex-determination system where males have x and y (as opposed to x and x) sex chromosomes during reproduction the male contributes either an x sperm or a y sperm while the female always contributes an x egg a y sperm and an x egg produce a male while an x sperm and an x egg produce a female the zw sex-determination system where males have zz (as opposed to zw) sex chromosomes is found in birds reptiles and some insects and other organisms members of hymenoptera such as ants and bees are determined by haplodiploidy where most males are haploid and females and some sterile males are diploid
=== environmental determination ===
the young of some species develop into one sex or the other depending on local environmental conditions e.g many crocodilians sex is influenced by the temperature of their eggs other species (such as the goby) can transform as adults from one sex to the other in response to local reproductive conditions (such as a shortage of males)
