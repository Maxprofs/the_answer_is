venera found venusian magnetic field much weaker earth magnetic field induced interaction ionosphere solar wind rather internal dynamo core like one inside earth venuss small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection atmosphere cosmic radiation radiation may result cloudtocloud lightning discharges

one possibility venus solid inner core core cooling entire liquid part core approximately temperature another possibility core already completely solidified state core highly dependent concentration sulfur unknown present
weak magnetosphere around venus means solar wind interacting directly outer atmosphere ions hydrogen oxygen created dissociation neutral molecules ultraviolet radiation solar wind supplies energy gives ions sufficient velocity escape venuss gravity field erosion process results steady loss lowmass hydrogen helium oxygen ions whereas highermass molecules carbon dioxide likely retained atmospheric erosion solar wind probably led loss venuss water first billion years formed erosion increased ratio highermass deuterium lowermass hydrogen upper atmosphere times compared ratio lower atmosphere
