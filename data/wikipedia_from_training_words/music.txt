music is an art form social activity or cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence the common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony) rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo meter and articulation) dynamics (loudness and softness) and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the color of a musical sound) different styles or types of music may emphasize de-emphasize or omit some of these elements music is performed with a vast range of instruments and with vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping and there are solely instrumental pieces solely vocal pieces and pieces that combine singing and instruments the word derives from greek (mousike art of the muses") in its most general form the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs tunes symphonies and so on) the criticism of music the study of the history of music and the aesthetic examination of music
the creation performance significance and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context indeed throughout history some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as not being music including beethoven's grosse fuge in 1825 and early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s there are many types of music including popular music traditional music art music music written for religious ceremonies and work songs such as chanteys music ranges from strictly organized compositions (and their recreation in performance) through improvisational music such as jazz and aleatoric (chance-based) 20th and 21st century forms of music music can be divided into genres (e.g. country music) and subgenres (e.g. country blues) although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle sometimes open to personal interpretation and occasionally controversial for example it can be hard to draw the line between 1980s hard rock and heavy metal from that same era within the arts music may be classified as a performing art a fine art or as an auditory art music may be played or sung and heard live heard live as part of a dramatic work (a music theater show or opera) or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio mp3 player or cd player or as part of a film or tv show
in many cultures music is an important part of people's way of life as it plays a key role in religious rituals ceremonies (e.g. graduation) social activities (e.g. dancing) and cultural activities ranging from amateur karaoke singing to playing in a funk band or singing in a choir people may make music as a hobby for example in a youth orchestra or as a professional musician or singer ancient greek and indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies common sayings such as the harmony of the spheres and it is music to my ears point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to however 20th-century composer john cage thought that any sound can be music saying for example there is no noise only sound.
== etymology ==
the word derives from greek (mousike art of the muses") according to the online etymological dictionary the term is derived from mid-13c. musike from old french musique (12c.) and directly from latin musica the art of music, also including poetry (also source of spanish musica italian musica old high german mosica german musik dutch muziek danish musik). this is derived from the ...greek mousike (techne) (art) of the muses, from fem of mousikos pertaining to the muses, from mousa muse (see muse (n.)) modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s in classical greece any art in which the muses presided but especially music and lyric poetry.
== as a form of art ==
music is composed and performed for many purposes ranging from aesthetic pleasure religious or ceremonial purposes or as an entertainment product for the marketplace when music was only available through sheet music scores such as during the classical and romantic eras music lovers would buy the sheet music of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano with the advent of sound recording records of popular songs rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs with the advent of home tape recorders in the 1980s and digital music in the 1990s music lovers could make tapes or playlists of their favourite songs and take them with them on a portable cassette player or mp3 player some music lovers create mix tapes of their favorite songs which serve as a self-portrait a gesture of friendship prescription for an ideal party [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved.
amateur musicians compose and/or perform music for their own pleasure and derive their income elsewhere professional musicians are employed by a range of institutions and organisations including armed forces (in marching bands concert bands and popular music groups) churches and synagogues symphony orchestras broadcasting or film production companies and music schools professional musicians sometimes work as freelancers or session musicians seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings there are often many links between amateur and professional musicians beginning amateur musicians take lessons with professional musicians in community settings advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles such as community concert bands and community orchestras
a distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system however there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded and distributed live concert recordings are popular in both classical music and in popular music forms such as rock where illegally taped live concerts are prized by music lovers in the jam band scene live improvised jam sessions are preferred to studio recordings
=== composition ===
composition is the act or practice of creating a work of music in many cultures including western classical music the act of composing also includes the creation of an object such as a score which is then performed by the composer or others in popular music and traditional music the act of composing which is typically called songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song called the lead sheet which sets out the melody lyrics and chord progression in classical music the composer typically orchestrates her own compositions but in musical theatre and in pop music songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration in some cases a songwriter may not use notation at all and instead compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory in jazz and popular music notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music
even when music is notated relatively precisely there are many decisions that a performer has to make because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely the process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed interpretation different performers interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or phrasing of the melodies composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting just as much as those who perform the music of others the standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as performance practice whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer
although a musical composition often uses musical notation and has a single author this is not always the case a work of music can have multiple composers and it can also be composed with words images or computer programs that form a process for creating musical sounds examples of this range from wind chimes to graphic notation to text compositions such as aus den sieben tagen to computer programs that select sounds music that makes heavy use of randomness is called aleatoric music and is associated with such composers as john cage morton feldman and witold lutosawski
study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of western classical music but the definition of composition is broad enough to include spontaneously improvised works like those of free jazz performers and african drummers such as the ewe drummers
=== notation ===
notation is the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols when music is written down the pitches and rhythm of the music is notated along with instructions on how to perform the music (e.g. regarding the tempo) the study of how to read notation involves music theory harmony the study of performance practice and in some cases an understanding of historical performance methods written notation varies with style and period of music notated music is produced as sheet music to perform music from notation requires an understanding of both the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre in improvisation the performer often plays from music where only the chord changes and form of the song are written requiring a great understanding of the music's structure harmony and the styles of a particular genre (e.g. jazz or country music)
in western art music the most common types of written notation are scores which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece and parts which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers in popular music jazz and blues the standard musical notation is the lead sheet which notates the melody chords lyrics (if it is a vocal piece) and structure of the music fake books are also used in jazz they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts which permit rhythm section members to improvise an accompaniment part to jazz songs scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz particularly in large ensembles such as jazz big bands. in popular music guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated in tablature (often abbreviated as tab") which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard tabulature was also used in the baroque era to notate music for the lute a stringed fretted instrument
=== improvisation ===
musical improvisation is the creation of spontaneous music often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic framework or chord progression improvisation is the act of instantaneous composition by performers where compositional techniques are employed with or without preparation improvisation is a major part of some types of music such as blues jazz and jazz fusion in which instrumental performers improvise solos melody lines and accompaniment parts in the western art music tradition improvisation was an important skill during the baroque era and during the classical era in the baroque era performers improvised ornaments and basso continuo keyboard players improvised chord voicings based on figured bass notation in the classical era solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso cadenzas during concerts however in the 20th and early 21st century as common practice western art music performance became institutionalized in symphony orchestras opera houses and ballets improvisation has played a smaller role at the same time some modern composers have increasingly included improvisation in their creative work in indian classical music improvisation is a core component and an essential criterion of performances
=== theory ===
music theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music it often involves identifying patterns that govern composers techniques and examining the language and notation of music in a grand sense music theory distills and analyzes the parameters or elements of music rhythm harmony (harmonic function) melody structure form and texture broadly music theory may include any statement belief or conception of or about music people who study these properties are known as music theorists some have applied acoustics human physiology and psychology to the explanation of how and why music is perceived
=== elements of music ===
music has many different fundamentals or elements these are but are not limited to pitch beat or pulse rhythm melody harmony texture allocation of voices timbre or color expressive qualities (dynamics and articulation) and form or structure some styles of music place an emphasis on certain of these fundamentals while others place less emphasis on certain elements to give one example while bebop era jazz makes use of very complex chords including altered dominants and challenging chord progressions with chords changing two or more times per bar and keys changing several times in a tune funk places most of its emphasis on rhythm and groove with entire songs based around a vamp on a single chord to give another example while romantic era classical music from the 1800s makes great use of dramatic changes of dynamics from whispering pianissimo sections to thunderous fortissimo sections some entire baroque dance suites for harpsichord from the early 1700s may use a single dynamic
pitch is a subjective sensation reflecting generally the lowness or highness of a note the lowest pitches are played by bass instruments such as the double bass and the rumbling huge bass pipes of the pipe organ the highest pitches are played by the piccolo rhythm is the arrangement of sounds and silences in time meter animates time in regular pulse groupings called measures or bars which often group notes in two three or four note groupings a melody is a series of notes sounding in succession often in a rising and falling pattern the notes of a melody are typically created with respect to pitch systems such as scales or modes the simplest melodies in folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale on the other hand bebop-era jazz from the 1940s may use melodies with many chromatic notes and unusual scales
harmony is the study of vertical sonorities in music vertical sonority refers to considering the relationships between pitches that occur together usually this means at the same time although harmony can also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure notes can be arranged into different scales and modes western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of 12 notes that might be included in a piece of music in music written using the system of major-minor tonality the key of a piece determines the scale used which centres around the home note or tonic of the key musical texture is the overall sound of a piece of music commonly described according to the number of and relationship between parts or lines of music monophony heterophony polyphony homophony or monody music that contains a large number of parts (e.g. a solo instrument accompanied by 100 orchestral instruments)is generally said to have a thicker texture than a work with few parts (e.g. a solo instrument accompanied by a cello and harpsichord)
timbre sometimes called color or tone color is the quality or sound of a voice or instrument expressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music that are not related to pitch rhythm or timbre they include dynamics and articulation form is a facet of music theory that explores the concept of musical syntax on a local and global level examples of common forms of western music include the fugue the invention sonata-allegro canon strophic theme and variations and rondo popular music often makes use of strophic form often in conjunction with twelve bar blues
== history ==
=== prehistoric eras ===
prehistoric music can only be theorized based on findings from paleolithic archaeology sites flutes are often discovered carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced these are thought to have been blown at one end like the japanese shakuhachi the divje babe flute carved from a cave bear femur is thought to be at least 40,000 years old instruments such as the seven-holed flute and various types of stringed instruments such as the ravanahatha have been recovered from the indus valley civilization archaeological sites india has one of the oldest musical traditions in the worldreferences to indian classical music (marga) are found in the vedas ancient scriptures of the hindu tradition the earliest and largest collection of prehistoric musical instruments was found in china and dates back to between 7000 and 6600 bc the hurrian song found on clay tablets that date back to approximately 1400 bc is the oldest surviving notated work of music
=== ancient egypt ===
the ancient egyptians credited one of their gods thoth with the invention of music with osiris in turn used as part of his effort to civilize the world the earliest material and representational evidence of egyptian musical instruments dates to the predynastic period but the evidence is more securely attested in the old kingdom when harps flutes and double clarinets were played percussion instruments lyres and lutes were added to orchestras by the middle kingdom cymbals frequently accompanied music and dance much as they still do in egypt today egyptian folk music including the traditional sufi dhikr rituals are the closest contemporary music genre to ancient egyptian music having preserved many of its features rhythms and instruments
=== asian cultures ===
indian classical music is one of the oldest musical traditions in the world the indus valley civilization has sculptures that show dance and old musical instruments like the seven holed flute various types of stringed instruments and drums have been recovered from harappa and mohenjo daro by excavations carried out by sir mortimer wheeler the rigveda has elements of present indian music with a musical notation to denote the metre and the mode of chanting indian classical music (marga) is monophonic and based on a single melody line or raga rhythmically organized through talas silappadhikaram by ilango adigal provides information about how new scales can be formed by modal shifting of the tonic from an existing scale hindustani music was influenced by the persian performance practices of the afghan mughals carnatic music popular in the southern states is largely devotional the majority of the songs are addressed to the hindu deities there are also many songs emphasising love and other social issues
asian music covers the music cultures of arabia central asia east asia south asia and southeast asia chinese classical music the traditional art or court music of china has a history stretching over around three thousand years it has its own unique systems of musical notation as well as musical tuning and pitch musical instruments and styles or musical genres chinese music is pentatonic-diatonic having a scale of twelve notes to an octave (5 + 7 = 12) as does european-influenced music persian music is the music of persia and persian language countries musiqi the science and art of music and muzik the sound and performance of music (sakata 1983)
=== references in the bible ===
music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of semitic and early judeo-christian culture have discovered common links in theatrical and musical activity between the classical cultures of the hebrews and those of later greeks and romans the common area of performance is found in a social phenomenon called litany, a form of prayer consisting of a series of invocations or supplications the journal of religion and theatre notes that among the earliest forms of litany hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:
while genesis 4.21 identifies jubal as the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe, the pentateuch is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of israel then in i samuel 10 and the texts that follow a curious thing happens one finds in the biblical text, writes alfred sendrey a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large choirs and orchestras consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy methodical preparation. this has led some scholars to believe that the prophet samuel was the patriarch of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men but also sacred-rite musicians this public music school perhaps the earliest in recorded history was not restricted to a priestly classwhich is how the shepherd boy david appears on the scene as a minstrel to king saul.
=== antiquity ===
western cultures have had a major influence on the development of music the history of the music of the western cultures can be traced back to ancient greece times
==== ancient greece ====
music was an important part of social and cultural life in ancient greece musicians and singers played a prominent role in greek theater mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment celebration and spiritual ceremonies instruments included the double-reed aulos and a plucked string instrument the lyre principally the special kind called a kithara music was an important part of education and boys were taught music starting at age six greek musical literacy created a flowering of music development greek music theory included the greek musical modes that eventually became the basis for western religious and classical music later influences from the roman empire eastern europe and the byzantine empire changed greek music the seikilos epitaph is the oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition including musical notation from anywhere in the world
the first work written on the subject of music theory is harmonika stoicheia
=== the middle ages ===
the medieval era (476 to 1400) started with the introduction of chanting into roman catholic church services western music then started becoming more of an art form with the advances in music notation the only european medieval repertory that survives from before about 800 is the monophonic liturgical plainsong of the roman catholic church the central tradition of which was called gregorian chant alongside these traditions of sacred and church music there existed a vibrant tradition of secular song examples of composers from this period are lonin protin and guillaume de machaut
=== the renaissance ===
renaissance music (c 1400 to 1600) was more focused on secular themes around 1450 the printing press was invented and that helped to disseminate musical styles more quickly and across a larger area thus music could play an increasingly important role in daily life musicians worked for the church courts and towns church choirs grew in size and the church remained an important patron of music by the middle of the 15th century composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music prominent composers from this era are guillaume dufay giovanni pierluigi da palestrina thomas morley and orlande de lassus however musical activity shifted to the courts kings and princes competed for the finest composers
many leading important composers came from the netherlands belgium and northern france and are called the franco-flemish composers they held important positions throughout europe especially in italy other countries with vibrant musical lives include germany england and spain
=== the baroque ===
the baroque era of music took place from 1600 to 1750 as the baroque artistic style flourished across europe and during this time music expanded in its range and complexity baroque music began when the first operas were written and when contrapuntal music became prevalent german baroque composers wrote for small ensembles including strings brass and woodwinds as well as choirs pipe organ harpsichord and clavichord during this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further including the fugue the invention the sonata and the concerto the late baroque style was polyphonically complex and ornamental and rich in its melodies composers from the baroque era include johann sebastian bach george frideric handel and georg philipp telemann
=== classicism ===
the music of the classical period (1750 to 1830) looked to the art and philosophy of ancient greece and rome to the ideals of balance proportion and disciplined expression it has a lighter clearer and considerably simpler texture and instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable new genres were developed the main style was homophony where a prominent melody and a subordinate chordal accompaniment part are clearly distinct
importance was given to instrumental music it was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the baroque period the sonata the concerto and the symphony others main kinds were the trio string quartet serenade and divertimento the sonata was the most important and developed form although baroque composers also wrote sonatas the classical style of sonata is completely distinct all of the main instrumental forms of the classical era from string quartets to symphonies and concertos were based on the structure of the sonata
one of the most important changes made in the classical period was the development of public concerts the aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions but it was now possible for composers to survive without being permanent employees of queens or princes the increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras the expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces symphonic music including symphonies musical accompaniment to ballet and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as opera and oratorio became more popular
the best known composers of classicism are carl philipp emanuel bach christoph willibald gluck johann christian bach joseph haydn wolfgang amadeus mozart ludwig van beethoven and franz schubert beethoven and schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the classical era as it began to move towards romanticism
=== romanticism ===
romantic music (c 1810 to 1900) turned the rigid styles and forms of the classical era into more passionate and expressive pieces it attempted to increase emotional expression and power to describe deeper truths or human feelings the emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over tradition romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy and went further in the syncretism of different art-forms (such as literature) history (historical figures) or nature itself with music romantic love or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period in some cases the formal structures from the classical period were preserved but in many others existing genres forms and functions were expanded also new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter opera and ballet continued to develop
in 1800 the music developed by ludwig van beethoven and franz schubert introduced a more dramatic expressive style in beethoven's case motifs developed organically came to replace melody as the most significant compositional unit later romantic composers such as pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky antonn dvok and gustav mahler used more elaborated chords and more dissonance to create dramatic tension they generated complex and often much longer musical works during romantic period tonality was at its peak the late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra and in the role of concerts as part of urban society it also saw a new diversity in theatre music including operetta and musical comedy and other forms of musical theatre
=== 20th- and 21st-century music ===
in the 19th century one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of sheet music which amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other instruments with 20th-century music there was a vast increase in music listening as the radio gained popularity and phonographs were used to replay and distribute music the focus of art music was characterized by exploration of new rhythms styles and sounds igor stravinsky arnold schoenberg and john cage were all influential composers in 20th-century art music the invention of sound recording and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music including the acousmatic and musique concrte schools of electronic composition sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed the introduction of the multitrack recording system had a major influence on rock music because it could do much more than record a band's performance using a multitrack system a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance
jazz evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the 20th century and during the second half of that century rock music did the same jazz is an american musical artform that originated in the beginning of the 20th century in african american communities in the southern united states from a confluence of african and european music traditions the style's west african pedigree is evident in its use of blue notes improvisation polyrhythms syncopation and the swung note from its early development until the present jazz has also incorporated music from 19th- and 20th-century american popular music jazz has from its early-20th-century inception spawned a variety of subgenres ranging from new orleans dixieland (1910s) to 1970s and 1980s-era jazz-rock fusion
rock music is a genre of popular music that developed in the 1960s from 1950s rock and roll rockabilly blues and country music the sound of rock often revolves around the electric guitar or acoustic guitar and it uses a strong back beat laid down by a rhythm section of electric bass guitar drums and keyboard instruments such as organ piano or since the 1970s analog synthesizers and digital ones and computers since the 1990s along with the guitar or keyboards saxophone and blues-style harmonica are used as soloing instruments in its purest form, it has three chords a strong insistent back beat and a catchy melody. in the late 1960s and early 1970s it branched out into different subgenres ranging from blues rock and jazz-rock fusion to heavy metal and punk rock as well as the more classical influenced genre of progressive rock and several types of experimental rock genres
== performance ==
performance is the physical expression of music often a musical work is performed once its structure and instrumentation are satisfactory to its creators however as it gets performed it can evolve and change a performance can either be rehearsed or improvised improvisation is a musical idea created without premeditation while rehearsal is vigorous repetition of an idea until it has achieved cohesion musicians will sometimes add improvisation to a well-rehearsed idea to create a unique performance
many cultures include strong traditions of solo and performance such as in indian classical music and in the western art-music tradition other cultures such as in bali include strong traditions of group performance all cultures include a mixture of both and performance may range from improvised solo playing for one's enjoyment to highly planned and organised performance rituals such as the modern classical concert religious processions music festivals or music competitions chamber music which is music for a small ensemble with only a few of each type of instrument is often seen as more intimate than symphonic works
=== aural tradition ===
many types of music such as traditional blues and folk music were originally preserved in the memory of performers and the songs were handed down orally or aurally (by ear) when the composer of music is no longer known this music is often classified as traditional. different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material from quite strict to those that demand improvisation or modification to the music a culture's history may also be passed by ear through song
=== ornamentation ===
the detail included explicitly in the music notation varies between genres and historical periods in general art music notation from the 17th through the 19th century required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles for example in the 17th and 18th century music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple unadorned melody however performers were expected to know how to add stylistically appropriate ornaments such as trills and turns
in the 19th century art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively without describing in detail how the performer should do this the performer was expected to know how to use tempo changes accentuation and pauses (among other devices) to obtain this expressive performance style in the 20th century art music notation often became more explicit and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece
in popular music and jazz music notation almost always indicates only the basic framework of the melody harmony or performance approach musicians and singers are expected to know the performance conventions and styles associated with specific genres and pieces for example the lead sheet for a jazz tune may only indicate the melody and the chord changes the performers in the jazz ensemble are expected to know how to flesh out this basic structure by adding ornaments improvised music and chordal accompaniment
== philosophy and aesthetics ==
philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music the philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in metaphysics and aesthetics some basic questions in the philosophy of music are
what is the definition of music (what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for classifying something as music?)
what is the relationship between music and mind
what does musical history reveal to us about the world
what is the connection between music and emotions
what is meaning in relation to music
traditionally the aesthetics of music explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization in the eighteenth century focus shifted to the experience of hearing music and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (plaisir and jouissance) of music the origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to baumgarten in the 18th century followed by kant through their writing the ancient term aesthetics meaning sensory perception received its present-day connotation in recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment for example music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue
in the 20th century important contributions were made by peter kivy jerrold levinson roger scruton and stephen davies however many musicians music critics and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music in the 19th century a significant debate arose between eduard hanslick a music critic and musicologist and composer richard wagner harry partch and some other musicologists such as kyle gann have studied and tried to popularize microtonal music and the usage of alternate musical scales also many modern composers like la monte young rhys chatham and glenn branca paid much attention to a scale called just intonation
it is often thought that music has the ability to affect our emotions intellect and psychology it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions the philosopher plato suggests in the republic that music has a direct effect on the soul therefore he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (book vii)
there has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure however other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include lyricism harmony hypnotism emotiveness temporal dynamics resonance playfulness and color (see also musical development)
== psychology ==
modern music psychology aims to explain and understand musical behavior and experience research in this field and its subfields are primarily empirical their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic observation of and interaction with human participants in addition to its focus on fundamental perceptions and cognitive processes music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas including music performance composition education criticism and therapy as well as investigations of human aptitude skill intelligence creativity and social behavior
=== cognitive neuroscience of music ===
cognitive neuroscience of music is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music these behaviours include music listening performing composing reading writing and ancillary activities it also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion the field is distinguished by its reliance on direct observations of the brain using such techniques as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) magnetoencephalography (meg) electroencephalography (eeg) and positron emission tomography (pet)
=== cognitive musicology ===
cognitive musicology is a branch of cognitive science concerned with computationally modeling musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition the use of computer models provides an exacting interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories and has roots in artificial intelligence and cognitive science
this interdisciplinary field investigates topics such as the parallels between language and music in the brain biologically inspired models of computation are often included in research such as neural networks and evolutionary programs this field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented stored perceived performed and generated by using a well-structured computer environment the systematic structures of these cognitive phenomena can be investigated
=== psychoacoustics ===
psychoacoustics is the scientific study of sound perception more specifically it is the branch of science studying the psychological and physiological responses associated with sound (including speech and music) it can be further categorized as a branch of psychophysics
=== evolutionary musicology ===
evolutionary musicology concerns the origins of music the question of animal song selection pressures underlying music evolution and music evolution and human evolution it seeks to understand music perception and activity in the context of evolutionary theory charles darwin speculated that music may have held an adaptive advantage and functioned as a protolanguage a view which has spawned several competing theories of music evolution an alternate view sees music as a by-product of linguistic evolution a type of auditory cheesecake that pleases the senses without providing any adaptive function this view has been directly countered by numerous music researchers
=== culture in music cognition ===
an individual's culture or ethnicity plays a role in their music cognition including their preferences emotional reaction and musical memory musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning in infancy and adults classification of the emotion of a musical piece depends on both culturally specific and universal structural features additionally individuals musical memory abilities are greater for culturally familiar music than for culturally unfamiliar music
== sociology ==
many ethnographic studies demonstrate that music is a participatory community-based activity music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings ranging from being alone to attending a large concert forming a music community which cannot be understood as a function of individual will or accident it includes both commercial and non-commercial participants with a shared set of common values musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus in europe and north america there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a high culture and low culture. high culture types of music typically include western art music such as baroque classical romantic and modern-era symphonies concertos and solo works and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches with the audience sitting quietly in seats
other types of musicincluding but not limited to jazz blues soul and countryare often performed in bars nightclubs and theatres where the audience may be able to drink dance and express themselves by cheering until the later 20th century the division between high and low musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality more advanced art music from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls
however in the 1980s and 1990s musicologists studying this perceived divide between high and low musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music rather they argued that this distinction was based largely on the socioeconomics standing or social class of the performers or audience of the different types of music for example whereas the audience for classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes the audience for a rap concert in an inner-city area may have below-average incomes even though the performers audience or venue where non-"art music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status the music that is performed such as blues rap punk funk or ska may be very complex and sophisticated
when composers introduce styles of music that break with convention there can be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture late-period beethoven string quartets stravinsky ballet scores serialism bebop-era jazz hip hop punk rock and electronica have all been considered non-music by some critics when they were first introduced such themes are examined in the sociology of music the sociological study of music sometimes called sociomusicology is often pursued in departments of sociology media studies or music and is closely related to the field of ethnomusicology

the music that composers make can be heard through several media the most traditional way is to hear it live in the presence of the musicians (or as one of the musicians) in an outdoor or indoor space such as an amphitheatre concert hall cabaret room or theatre live music can also be broadcast over the radio television or the internet some musical styles focus on producing a sound for a performance while others focus on producing a recording that mixes together sounds that were never played live. recording even of essentially live styles often uses the ability to edit and splice to produce recordings considered better than the actual performance
as talking pictures emerged in the early 20th century with their prerecorded musical tracks an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work during the 1920s live musical performances by orchestras pianists and theater organists were common at first-run theaters with the coming of the talking motion pictures those featured performances were largely eliminated the american federation of musicians (afm) took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices one 1929 ad that appeared in the pittsburgh press features an image of a can labeled canned music / big noise brand / guaranteed to produce no intellectual or emotional reaction whatever
since legislation introduced to help protect performers composers publishers and producers including the audio home recording act of 1992 in the united states and the 1979 revised berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works in the united kingdom recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through computers devices and internet in a form that is commonly known as music-on-demand
in many cultures there is less distinction between performing and listening to music since virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity often communal in industrialized countries listening to music through a recorded form such as sound recording or watching a music video became more common than experiencing live performance roughly in the middle of the 20th century
sometimes live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds for example a disc jockey uses disc records for scratching and some 20th-century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape computers and many keyboards can be programmed to produce and play musical instrument digital interface (midi) music audiences can also become performers by participating in karaoke an activity of japanese origin centered on a device that plays voice-eliminated versions of well-known songs most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks
=== internet ===
the advent of the internet has transformed the experience of music partly through the increased ease of access to music and the increased choice chris anderson in his book the long tail why the future of business is selling less of more suggests that while the economic model of supply and demand describes scarcity the internet retail model is based on abundance digital storage costs are low so a company can afford to make its whole inventory available online giving customers as much choice as possible it has thus become economically viable to offer products that very few people are interested in consumers growing awareness of their increased choice results in a closer association between listening tastes and social identity and the creation of thousands of niche markets
another effect of the internet arises with online communities like youtube and facebook a social networking service such sites simplify connecting with other musicians and greatly facilitate the distribution of music professional musicians also use youtube as a free publisher of promotional material youtube users for example no longer only download and listen to mp3s but also actively create their own according to don tapscott and anthony d williams in their book wikinomics there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a prosumer role a consumer who both creates and consumes manifestations of this in music include the production of mashes remixes and music videos by fans
== business ==
the music industry refers to the business industry connected with the creation and sale of music it consists of record companies labels and publishers that distribute recorded music products internationally and that often control the rights to those products some music labels are independent, while others are subsidiaries of larger corporate entities or international media groups in the 2000s the increasing popularity of listening to music as digital music files on mp3 players ipods or computers and of trading music on file sharing sites or buying it online in the form of digital files had a major impact on the traditional music business many smaller independent cd stores went out of business as music buyers decreased their purchases of cds and many labels had lower cd sales some companies did well with the change to a digital format though such as apple's itunes an online store that sells digital files of songs over the internet

=== non-professional ===
the incorporation of music training from preschool to post secondary education is common in north america and europe involvement in music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration counting listening and cooperation while also promoting understanding of language improving the ability to recall information and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas in elementary schools children often learn to play instruments such as the recorder sing in small choirs and learn about the history of western art music in secondary schools students may have the opportunity to perform some type of musical ensembles such as choirs marching bands concert bands jazz bands or orchestras and in some school systems music classes may be available some students also take private music lessons with a teacher amateur musicians typically take lessons to learn musical rudiments and beginner- to intermediate-level musical techniques
at the university level students in most arts and humanities programs can receive credit for taking music courses which typically take the form of an overview course on the history of music or a music appreciation course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles in addition most north american and european universities have some type of musical ensembles that non-music students are able to participate in such as choirs marching bands concert bands or orchestras the study of western art music is increasingly common outside of north america and europe such as the indonesian institute of the arts in yogyakarta indonesia or the classical music programs that are available in asian countries such as south korea japan and china at the same time western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-western cultures such as the music of africa or bali (e.g gamelan music)
=== academia ===
musicology is the study of the subject of music the earliest definitions defined three sub-disciplines systematic musicology historical musicology and comparative musicology or ethnomusicology in contemporary scholarship one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into music theory music history and ethnomusicology research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work for example in the field of psychoacoustics the study of music of non-western cultures and the cultural study of music is called ethnomusicology students can pursue the undergraduate study of musicology ethnomusicology music history and music theory through several different types of degrees including a b.mus a b.a with concentration in music a b.a with honors in music or a b.a in music history and literature graduates of undergraduate music programs can go on to further study in music graduate programs
graduate degrees include the master of music the master of arts the doctor of philosophy (ph.d.) (e.g. in musicology or music theory) and more recently the doctor of musical arts or dma the master of music degree which takes one to two years to complete is typically awarded to students studying the performance of an instrument education voice or composition the master of arts degree which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a thesis is typically awarded to students studying musicology music history or music theory undergraduate university degrees in music including the bachelor of music the bachelor of music education and the bachelor of arts (with a major in music) typically take three to five years to complete these degrees provide students with a grounding in music theory and music history and many students also study an instrument or learn singing technique as part of their program
the phd which is required for students who want to work as university professors in musicology music history or music theory takes three to five years of study after the master's degree during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation the dma is a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors in musical performance or composition the dma takes three to five years after a master's degree and includes advanced courses projects and performances in medieval times the study of music was one of the quadrivium of the seven liberal arts and considered vital to higher learning within the quantitative quadrivium music or more accurately harmonics was the study of rational proportions
zoomusicology is the study of the music of non-human animals or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals as george herzog (1941) asked do animals have music? franois-bernard mche's musique mythe nature ou les dauphins d'arion (1983) a study of ornitho-musicology using a technique of nicolas ruwet's langage musique posie (1972) paradigmatic segmentation analysis shows that bird songs are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle jean-jacques nattiez (1990) argues that in the last analysis it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical even when the sound is not of human origin if we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is made to form music) merely by its producer but by the mind that perceives it then music is uniquely human.
music theory is the study of music generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines more broadly it refers to any study of music usually related in some form with compositional concerns and may include mathematics physics and anthropology what is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the common practice period or tonal music theory even of music of the common practice period may take many other forms musical set theory is the application of mathematical set theory to music first applied to atonal music speculative music theory contrasted with analytic music theory is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials for example tuning systems generally as preparation for composition
=== ethnomusicology ===
in the west much of the history of music that is taught deals with the western civilization's art music the history of music in other cultures ("world music or the field of ethnomusicology") is also taught in western universities this includes the documented classical traditions of asian countries outside the influence of western europe as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures popular styles of music varied widely from culture to culture and from period to period different cultures emphasised different instruments or techniques or uses for music music has been used not only for entertainment for ceremonies and for practical and artistic communication but also for propaganda
there is a host of music classifications many of which are caught up in the argument over the definition of music among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or art music) and popular music (or commercial music including rock music country music and pop music) some genres do not fit neatly into one of these big two classifications (such as folk music world music or jazz music)
as world cultures have come into greater contact their indigenous musical styles have often merged into new styles for example the united states bluegrass style contains elements from anglo-irish scottish irish german and african instrumental and vocal traditions which were able to fuse in the united states multi-ethnic society genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music some works like george gershwin's rhapsody in blue are claimed by both jazz and classical music while gershwin's porgy and bess and leonard bernstein's west side story are claimed by both opera and the broadway musical tradition many current music festivals celebrate a particular musical genre
indian music for example is one of the oldest and longest living types of music and is still widely heard and performed in south asia as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s) indian music has mainly three forms of classical music hindustani carnatic and dhrupad styles it has also a large repertoire of styles which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in south india
