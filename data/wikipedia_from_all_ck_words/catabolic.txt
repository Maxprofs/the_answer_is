catholicism (from greek  katholikismos universal doctrine") and its adjectival form catholic are used as broad terms for describing specific traditions in the christian churches in theology doctrine liturgy ethics and spirituality
catholicism and catholic in this sense refer to the practices of several christian churches this sense is to be distinguished from the use of these words to refer to the roman catholic church that which is in full communion with the holy see as well as the orthodox catholic church (commonly called the orthodox church or the eastern orthodox church") which also considers itself the universal and apostolic church
in the sense of indicating historical continuity of faith and practice from the first millennium the term catholic is employed by many other historic churches which claim to be heirs of the apostolic faith these consider themselves to be catholic teaching that the term designates the historic orthodox mainstream of christianity whose doctrine was defined by the ecumenical councils and creeds and as such most reformers appealed to this catholic tradition and believed they were in continuity with it.
within the anglican communion the oxford movement promoted anglo-catholicism which reemphasized the importance of doctrines such as the real presence of christ in the eucharist and apostolic succession
the roman catholic church teaches that protestant churches are not in fact churches as they do not have apostolic tradition of ordinations and therefore do not have valid eucharist nor are they in full communion with the successor of saint peter the pope it does however recognise the shared apostolic tradition of the eastern orthodox church whilst it maintains that all salvation comes through the church this leaves scope for the salvation of other christians with an imperfect communion with the roman catholic church i.e protestants
== history of the term catholic ==
the earliest evidence of the use of the term catholic church is the letter to the smyrnaeans that ignatius of antioch wrote in about 108 to christians in smyrna exhorting christians to remain closely united with their bishop he wrote wherever the bishop shall appear there let the multitude [of the people] also be even as wherever jesus christ is there is the catholic church.
from the second half of the second century the word began to be used to mean orthodox (non-heretical) because catholics claimed to teach the whole truth and to represent the whole church while heresy arose out of the exaggeration of some one truth and was essentially partial and local in 380 emperor theodosius i limited use of the term catholic christian exclusively to those who followed the same faith as pope damasus i of rome and pope peter of alexandria numerous other early writers including cyril of jerusalem (c 315386) augustine of hippo (354430) further developed the use of the term catholic in relation to christianity
== divergent interpretations ==
many individual christians and christian denominations consider themselves catholic on the basis in particular of apostolic succession they fall into five groups
the roman catholic church which sees full communion with the bishop of rome as an essential element of catholicism its constituent particular churches (western and eastern) have distinct and separate jurisdictions while still being in union with rome
those like the eastern orthodox and oriental orthodox that claim unbroken apostolic succession from the early church and identify themselves as the catholic church
those such as the old catholic anglican and some lutheran and other denominations that claim unbroken apostolic succession from the early church and see themselves as a constituent part of the church
those who claim to be spiritual descendants of the apostles but have no discernible institutional descent from the historic church and normally do not refer to themselves as catholic
those who have acknowledged a break in apostolic succession but have restored it in order to be in full communion with bodies that have maintained the practice examples in this category include the evangelical lutheran church in america and the evangelical lutheran church in canada vis--vis their anglican and old catholic counterparts
for some confessions listed under category 3 the self-affirmation refers to the belief in the ultimate unity of the universal church under one god and one saviour rather than in one visibly unified institution (as with category 1 above) in this usage catholic is sometimes written with a lower-case c the western apostles creed and the nicene creed stating i believe in  one holy catholic  church are recited in worship services among some denominations in category 3 christian is substituted for catholic in order to denote the doctrine that the christian church is at least ideally undivided
=== roman catholic church ===
in its letter on some aspects of the church understood as communion the congregation for the doctrine of the faith stressed that the idea of the universal church as a communion of churches must not be presented as meaning that every particular church is a subject complete in itself and that the universal church is the result of a reciprocal recognition on the part of the particular churches it insisted that the universal church cannot be conceived as the sum of the particular churches or as a federation of particular churches
the roman catholic church considers protestant and anglican christians who are not in communion with the see of rome to be non-catholics it does not consider their churches to be genuine churches and so uses the term ecclesial communities to refer to them it considers a valid episcopate and eucharist as necessary prerequisites for being a church because the roman catholic church does not consider these church bodies to have valid episcopal orders capable of celebrating a valid eucharist it does not classify them as churches in the proper sense the roman catholic church's doctrine of infallibility derives from the belief the authority that jesus gave peter as head of the church on earth has been passed on to his successors the popes relevant bible verses include [matthew 16:18] and i tell you that you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades will not overcome it i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
==== latin and eastern catholic churches ====
the latin and eastern catholic churches together form the catholic church or roman catholic church the world's largest single religious body and the largest christian church as well as its largest catholic church comprising over half of all christians (1.22 billion christians of 2.1 billion) and nearly one-sixth of the world's population richard mcbrien would put the proportion even higher extending it to those who are in communion with the bishop of rome only in degrees it comprises 24 component particular churches (also called rites in the second vatican council's decree on the eastern catholic churches and in the code of canon law) all of which acknowledge a primacy of jurisdiction of the bishop of rome and are in full communion with the holy see and each other
these particular churches or component parts are the latin rite or western church (which uses a number of different liturgical rites of which the roman rite is the best known) and 23 eastern catholic churches of the latter particular churches 14 use the byzantine liturgical rite within the church as a whole each particular church whether eastern or western is of equal dignity finally in its official documents the church though made up of several particular churches continues to refer to itself as the catholic church or less frequently but consistently as the roman catholic church owing to its essential link with the bishop of rome
mcbrien in his book catholicism disagrees with the church's usage of referring to itself as roman catholic saying but is catholic synonymous with roman catholic and is it accurate to refer to the roman catholic church as simply the roman church the answer to both questions is no the adjective roman applies more properly to the diocese or see of rome than to the worldwide communion of catholic churches that is in union with the bishop of rome indeed it strikes some catholics as contradictory to call the church catholic and roman at one and the same time eastern-rite catholics of whom there are more than twenty million also find the adjective roman objectionable in addition to the latin or roman tradition there are seven non-latin non-roman ecclesial traditions armenian byzantine coptic ethiopian east syrian (chaldean) west syrian and maronite each to the churches with these non-latin traditions is as catholic as the roman catholic church thus not all catholics are roman catholic. thus to be catholicwhether roman or non-romanin the ecclesiological sense is to be in full communion with the bishop of rome and as such to be an integral part of the catholic communion of churches.
in spite of mcbrien's affirmation that on an official level what he calls the communion of catholic churches always refers to itself as the catholic church the term roman catholic church is in fact as seen above used by popes and departments of the holy see the latin-rite archdiocese of detroit lists eight eastern (catholic) churches each with its own bishop as having one or more parishes in what is also the territory of the latin archdiocese yet each is designated as being in full communion with the roman church.
=== eastern orthodoxy ===
the eastern orthodox church also maintains that it is the one holy catholic and apostolic church regarding rome as a schismatic see that has violated the essential catholicity of the christian faith by introducing innovations of doctrine orthodox christians consider themselves the heirs of the first-millennium patriarchal structure that developed in the eastern church into the model of the five patriarchal sees recognized by ecumenical councils a theory that continues to hold sway in official greek circles to the present day, but not in the western church which preferred the theory of the primacy of the bishop of rome ultramontanism to conciliarism the title patriarch of the west was rarely used by the popes until the 16th and 17th centuries and was included in the annuario pontificio from 1863 to 2005 being dropped in the following year as never very clear and having become over history obsolete and practically unusable
=== other traditions ===
within western christianity the churches of the anglican communion continuing anglicanism the old catholics the liberal catholic church the augustana catholic church the apostolic catholic church (acc) the aglipayans (philippine independent church) the african orthodox church the polish national catholic church of america and many independent catholic churches which emerged directly or indirectly from and have beliefs and practices largely similar to latin rite catholicism regard themselves as catholic without full communion with the bishop of rome whose claimed status and authority they generally reject the chinese patriotic catholic association a division of the people's republic of china's religious affairs bureau exercising state supervision over mainland china's catholics holds a similar position while attempting as with buddhism and protestantism to indoctrinate and mobilize for communist party objectives
=== anglicanism ===
introductory works on anglicanism such as the study of anglicanism typically refer to the character of the anglican tradition as catholic and reformed which is in keeping with the understanding of anglicanism articulated in the elizabethan settlement of 1559 and in the works of the earliest standard anglican divines such as richard hooker and lancelot andrewes yet different strains in anglicanism dating back to the english reformation have emphasized either the reformed catholic or reformed catholic nature of the tradition
anglican theology and ecclesiology has thus come to be typically expressed in three distinct yet sometimes overlapping manifestations anglo-catholicism (often called high church") evangelicalism (often called low church") and latitudinarianism ("broad church") whose beliefs and practices fall somewhere between the two though all elements within the anglican communion recite the same creeds evangelical anglicans generally regard the word catholic in the ideal sense given above in contrast anglo-catholics regard the communion as a component of the whole catholic church in spiritual and historical union with the roman catholic old catholic and several eastern churches broad church anglicans tend to maintain a mediating view or consider the matter one of adiaphora these anglicans for example have agreed in the porvoo agreement to interchangeable ministries and full eucharistic communion with lutherans
the catholic nature or strain of the anglican tradition is expressed doctrinally ecumenically (chiefly through organisations such as the anglicanroman catholic international commission) ecclesiologically (through its episcopal governance and maintenance of the historical episcopate) and in liturgy and piety some anglo-catholics maintain belief in the seven sacraments though the 39 articles hold that there are but two many anglo-catholics practice marian devotion recite the rosary and the angelus practice eucharistic adoration and seek the intercession of saints in terms of liturgy most anglicans use candles on the altar or communion table and many churches use incense and bells in the eucharist which is amongst the most pronounced anglo-catholics referred to by the latin-derived word mass used in the first prayer book and in the american prayer book of 1979 in numerous churches the eucharist is celebrated facing the altar (often with a tabernacle) by a priest assisted by a deacon and subdeacon some anglicans believe in the real presence of christ in the eucharist however different eucharistic rites or orders contain different if not necessarily contradictory understandings of salvation for this reason no single strain or manifestation of anglicanism can speak for the whole even in ecumenical statements (as issued for example by the anglican - roman catholic international commission)
the growth of anglo-catholicism is strongly associated with the oxford movement of the 19th century two of its leading lights john henry newman and henry edward manning both priests ended up joining the roman catholic church becoming cardinals others like john keble edward bouverie pusey and charles gore became influential figures in anglicanism the previous archbishop of canterbury rowan williams is a patron of the anglican organisation affirming catholicism a more liberal movement within catholic anglicanism conservative catholic groups also exist within the tradition such as forward in faith there are about 80 million anglicans in the anglican communion comprising 3.6% of global christianity
=== protestantism ===
within protestantism the word catholic is generally taken in the sense of universal and in this sense many leading protestant denominations identify themselves as part of the catholic church the puritan westminster confession of faith adopted in 1646 (which remains the confession of the church of scotland) states for example that
the catholic or universal church which is invisible consists of the whole number of the elect that have been are or shall be gathered into one under christ the head thereof and is the spouse the body the fulness of him that fills all in all
the london confession of the baptists repeats this with the emendation which (with respect to the internal work of the spirit and truth of grace) may be called invisible the church of scotland's articles declaratory begin the church of scotland is part of the holy catholic or universal church
certain lutheran churches including the church of sweden and several small american churches of recent origin such as the lutheran orthodox church and the anglo-lutheran catholic church- consider themselves to be catholic
there are more high church groups among the traditional protestant churches with a broader attachment to older ideas for example the 20th century high church lutheranism movement developed an evangelical catholicity combining justification by faith with roman doctrine on sacraments in some cases also restoring lacking apostolic succession especially in germany
in reformed churches there is a scoto-catholic grouping within the presbyterian church of scotland such groups point to their churches continuing adherence to the catholic doctrine of the early church councils the articles declaratory of the constitution of the church of scotland of 1921 defines that church legally as part of the holy catholic or universal church
=== views of individual scholars ===
richard mcbrien considers that the term catholicism refers exclusively and specifically to that communion of catholic churches in communion with the bishop of rome according to mcbrien catholicism is distinguished from other forms of christianity in its particular understanding and commitment to tradition the sacraments the mediation between god communion and the see of rome according to bishop kallistos ware the orthodox church has these things as well though the primacy of the see of rome is only honorific showing non-jurisdictional respect for the bishop of rome as the first among equals and patriarch of the west catholicism according to mcbrien's paradigm includes a monastic life religious institutes a religious appreciation of the arts a communal understanding of sin and redemption and missionary activity
henry mills alden in harper's new monthly magazine writes that
the various protestant sects can not constitute one church because they have no intercommunion...each protestant church whether methodist or baptist or whatever is in perfect communion with itself everywhere as the roman catholic and in this respect consequently the roman catholic has no advantage or superiority except in the point of numbers as a further necessary consequence it is plain that the roman church is no more catholic in any sense than a methodist or a baptist
as such according to this viewpoint for those who belong to the church, the term methodist catholic or presbyterian catholic or baptist catholic is as proper as the term roman catholic it simply means that body of christian believers over the world who agree in their religious views and accept the same ecclesiastical forms
== brief organisational history of catholicism ==
a common belief in catholicism is institutional continuity with the early christian church founded by jesus christ many churches or communions of churches identify singularly or collectively as the authentic church the following summarizes the major schisms and conflicts within christianity particularly within groups that identify as catholic there are several competing historical interpretations as to which groups entered into schism with the original early church
according to the theory of pentarchy the early undivided church came to be organised under the three patriarchs of rome alexandria and antioch to which later were added the patriarchs of constantinople and jerusalem the bishop of rome was at that time recognized as first among them as is stated for instance in canon 3 of the first council of constantinople (381)many interpret first as meaning here first among equalsand doctrinal or procedural disputes were often referred to rome as when on appeal by st athanasius against the decision of the council of tyre (335) pope julius i who spoke of such appeals as customary annulled the action of that council and restored athanasius and marcellus of ancyra to their sees the bishop of rome was also considered to have the right to convene ecumenical councils when the imperial capital moved to constantinople rome's influence was sometimes challenged nonetheless rome claimed special authority because of its connection to saint peter and saint paul who all agreed were martyred and buried in rome and because the bishop of rome saw himself as the successor of saint peter
the 431 council of ephesus the third ecumenical council was chiefly concerned with nestorianism which emphasised the distinction between the humanity and divinity of jesus and taught that in giving birth to jesus christ the virgin mary could not be spoken of as giving birth to god this council rejected nestorianism and affirmed that as humanity and divinity are inseparable in the one person of jesus christ his mother the virgin mary is thus theotokos god-bearer mother of god the first great rupture in the church followed this council those who refused to accept the council's ruling were largely persian and are represented today by the assyrian church of the east and related churches which however do not now hold a nestorian theology they are often called ancient oriental churches
the next major break was after the council of chalcedon (451) this council repudiated eutychian monophysitism which stated that the divine nature completely subsumed the human nature in christ this council declared that christ though one person exhibited two natures without confusion without change without division without separation and thus is both fully god and fully human the alexandrian church rejected the terms adopted by this council and the christian churches that follow the tradition of non-acceptance of the councilthey are not monophysite in doctrineare referred to as pre-chalcedonian or oriental orthodox churches
the next great rift within christianity was in the 11th century longstanding doctrinal disputes as well as conflicts between methods of church government and the evolution of separate rites and practices precipitated a split in 1054 that divided the church this time between a west and an east england france the holy roman empire poland bohemia slovakia scandinavia the baltic states and western europe in general were in the western camp and greece romania russia and many other slavic lands anatolia and the christians in syria and egypt who accepted the council of chalcedon made up the eastern camp this division between the western church and the eastern church is called the eastwest schism
in 1438 the council of florence convened which featured a strong dialogue focussed on understanding the theological differences between the east and west with the hope of reuniting the catholic and orthodox churches several eastern churches reunited constituting some of the eastern catholic churches
another major division in the church occurred in the 16th century with the protestant reformation after which many parts of the western church either entirely rejected the teachings and structure of the western church at that time and became known as reformed or protestant
a much less extensive rupture occurred when after the roman catholic church's first vatican council in which it officially proclaimed the dogma of papal infallibility small clusters of catholics in the netherlands and in german-speaking countries formed the old-catholic (altkatholische) church
== distinctive beliefs and practices ==
due to the divergent interpretations of the word catholicism any listing of beliefs and practices that distinguish catholicism from other forms of christianity must be preceded by an indication of the sense employed if catholicism is understood as the roman catholic church understands it identification of beliefs is relatively easy though preferred expressions of the beliefs vary especially between the latin church the eastern catholic churches of greek tradition and the other eastern catholic churches liturgical and canonical practices vary between all these particular churches constituting the roman and eastern catholic churches (or as richard mcbrien calls them the communion of catholic churches")
in the understanding of another church that identifies catholicism with itself such as the eastern orthodox and oriental orthodox churches clear identification of certain beliefs may sometimes be more difficult because of the lack of a central authority like that of the roman and eastern catholic churches on the other hand practices are more uniform as indicated for instance in the single liturgical rite employed in various languages within the eastern orthodox church in contrast to the variety of liturgical rites in the roman catholic church in all these cases the beliefs and practices of catholicism would be identical with the beliefs and practices of the church in question
if catholicism is extended to cover all who consider themselves spiritual descendants of the apostles a search for beliefs and practices that distinguish it from other forms of christianity would be meaningless
if catholicism is understood in the sense given to the word by those who use it to distinguish their position from a calvinistic or puritan form of protestantism it is then meaningful to attempt to draw up a list of common characteristic beliefs and practices of catholicism not commonly held by those merely claiming spiritual descent catholicism could include the roman catholic church the various churches of eastern christianity the old catholic church anglicanism and at least some of the independent catholic churches and again in this interpretation the beliefs and practices of catholicism include
direct and continuous organizational descent from the original church founded by jesus[matthew 16:18] who according to tradition designated the apostle peter as its first leader
belief that jesus christ is divine a doctrine officially clarified in the first council of nicaea and expressed in the nicene creed
transubstantiation the belief that the elements in the eucharist become really truly the body blood soul and divinity of christ at consecration resulting in the real presence of christ and that because christ himself is present in the sacrament he is to be honoured in it with the worship known as eucharistic adoration
possession of the threefold ordained ministry of bishops priests and deacons
all ministers are ordained by and subject to bishops who pass down sacramental authority by the laying-on of hands having themselves been ordained in a direct line of succession from the apostles (see apostolic succession)
belief that the church is the vessel and deposit of the fullness of the teachings of jesus and the apostles from which the scriptures were formed this teaching is preserved in both written scripture and in unwritten tradition neither being independent of the other
a belief in the necessity and efficacy of sacraments
the use of sacred images candles vestments and music and often incense and water in worship
veneration of mary the mother of jesus as the blessed virgin mary or theotokos (i.e. god-bearer or mother of god") and veneration of the saints
a distinction between adoration (latria) for god and veneration (dulia) for saints the term hyperdulia is used for a special veneration accorded to the virgin mary among the saints
the use of prayer for the dead
the acceptance of canonizations
requests to the departed saints for intercessory prayers
=== sacraments or sacred mysteries ===
churches in the catholic tradition administer seven sacraments or sacred mysteries baptism confirmation or chrismation eucharist penance also known as reconciliation anointing of the sick holy orders and matrimony in some catholic churches this number is regarded as a convention only
in catholicism a sacrament is considered to be an efficacious visible sign of god's invisible grace while the word mystery is used not only of these rites but also with other meanings with reference to revelations of and about god and to god's mystical interaction with creation the word sacrament (latin a solemn pledge) the usual term in the west refers specifically to these rites
baptism - the first sacrament of christian initiation the basis for all the other sacraments churches in the catholic tradition consider baptism conferred in most christian denominations in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit (cf matthew 28:19) to be valid since the effect is produced through the sacrament independently of the faith of the minister though not of the minister's intention this is not necessarily the case in other churches as stated in the nicene creed baptism is for the forgiveness of sins not only personal sins but also of original sin which it remits even in infants who have committed no actual sins expressed positively forgiveness of sins means bestowal of the sanctifying grace by which the baptized person shares the life of god the initiate puts on christ (galatians 3:27) and is buried with him in baptism  also raised with him through faith in the working of god (colossians 2:12)
confirmation or chrismation - the second sacrament of christian initiation the means by which the gift of the holy spirit conferred in baptism is strengthened and deepened (see for example catechism of the catholic church 1303) by a sealing in the western tradition it is usually a separate rite from baptism bestowed following a period of education called catechesis on those who have at least reached the age of discretion (about 7) and sometimes postponed until an age when the person is considered capable of making a mature independent profession of faith it is considered to be of a nature distinct from the anointing with chrism (also called myrrh) that is usually part of the rite of baptism and that is not seen as a separate sacrament in the eastern tradition it is usually conferred in conjunction with baptism as its completion but is sometimes administered separately to converts or those who return to orthodoxy some theologies consider this to be the outward sign of the inner baptism of the holy spirit the special gifts (or charismata) of which may remain latent or become manifest over time according to god's will its originating minister is a validly consecrated bishop if a priest (a presbyter") confers the sacrament (as is permitted in some catholic churches) the link with the higher order is indicated by the use of chrism blessed by a bishop (in an eastern orthodox church this is customarily although not necessarily done by the primate of the local autocephalous church.)
eucharist - the sacrament (the third of christian initiation) by which the faithful receive their ultimate daily bread or bread for the journey by partaking of and in the body and blood of jesus christ and being participants in christ's one eternal sacrifice the bread and wine used in the rite are according to catholic faith in the mystical action of the holy spirit transformed to be christ's body and bloodhis real presence this transformation is interpreted by some as transubstantiation or metousiosis by others as consubstantiation or sacramental union
penance (also called confession and reconciliation) - the first of the two sacraments of healing it is also called the sacrament of conversion of forgiveness and of absolution it is the sacrament of spiritual healing of a baptized person from the distancing from god involved in actual sins committed it involves the penitent's contrition for sin (without which the rite does not have its effect) confession (which in highly exceptional circumstances can take the form of a corporate general confession) to a minister who has the faculty to exercise the power to absolve the penitent and absolution by the minister in some traditions (such as the roman catholic) the rite involves a fourth element satisfaction which is defined as signs of repentance imposed by the minister in early christian centuries the fourth element was quite onerous and generally preceded absolution but now it usually involves a simple task (in some traditions called a penance") for the penitent to perform to make some reparation and as a medicinal means of strengthening against further sinning
anointing of the sick (or unction) - the second sacrament of healing in it those who are suffering an illness are anointed by a priest with oil consecrated by a bishop specifically for that purpose in past centuries when such a restrictive interpretation was customary the sacrament came to be known as extreme unction i.e final anointing as it still is among traditionalist catholics it was then conferred only as one of the last rites the other last rites are penance (if the dying person is physically unable to confess at least absolution conditional on the existence of contrition is given) and the eucharist which when administered to the dying is known as viaticum a word whose original meaning in latin was provision for a journey
holy orders - the sacrament which integrates someone into the holy orders of bishops priests (presbyters) and deacons the threefold order of administrators of the mysteries of god (1 corinthians 4:1) giving the person the mission to teach sanctify and govern only a bishop may administer this sacrament as only a bishop holds the fullness of the apostolic ministry ordination as a bishop makes one a member of the body that has succeeded to that of the apostles ordination as a priest configures a person to christ the head of the church and the one essential priest empowering that person as the bishops assistant and vicar to preside at the celebration of divine worship and in particular to confect the sacrament of the eucharist acting in persona christi (in the person of christ) ordination as a deacon configures the person to christ the servant of all placing the deacon at the service of the church especially in the fields of the ministry of the word service in divine worship pastoral guidance and charity deacons may later be further ordained to the priesthood but only if they do not have a wife in some traditions (such as those of the roman catholic church) while married men may be ordained ordained men may not marry in others (such as the anglican) clerical marriage is permitted as is the ordination of women moreover some sectors of anglicanism in isolation of the whole have approved the ordination of openly active homosexuals to the priesthood and episcopacy in spite of the support that rowan williams the archbishop of canterbury voiced for the anglican church's teaching on homosexuality which he said the church could not change simply because of a shift in society's attitude noting also that those churches blessing same-sex unions and consecrating openingly gay bishops would not be able to take part as a whole in ecumenical and interfaith dialogue. thus in ecumenical matters only if the roman catholic as well as orthodox churches come to an understanding with first tier or primary bishops of the anglican communion can those churches (representing 95% of global catholicism) implement an agreement with second tier or secondary anglican bishops and their respective anglican communities
holy matrimony (or marriage) - is the sacrament of joining a man and a woman (according to the churches doctrines) for mutual help and love (the unitive purpose) consecrating them for their particular mission of building up the church and the world and providing grace for accomplishing that mission western tradition sees the sacrament as conferred by the canonically expressed mutual consent of the partners in marriage eastern and some recent western theologians not in communion with the see of rome view the blessing by a priest as constituting the sacramental action
