in english orthography l usually represents the phoneme /l/ which can have several sound values depending on whether it occurs before or after a vowel the alveolar lateral approximant (the sound represented in ipa by lowercase [l]) occurs before a vowel as in lip or blend while the velarized alveolar lateral approximant (ipa []) occurs in bell and milk this velarization does not occur in many european languages that use l it is also a factor making the pronunciation of l difficult for users of languages that lack l or have different values for it such as japanese or some southern dialects of chinese a medical condition or speech impediment restricting the pronunciation of l is known as lambdacism
in english orthography l is often silent in such words as walk or could (though its presence can modify the preceding vowel letter's sound) and it is usually silent in such words as palm and psalm however there is some regional variation
=== other languages ===
l usually represents the sound [l] or some other lateral consonant
common digraphs include ll which has a value identical to l in english but has the separate value voiceless alveolar lateral fricative (ipa []) in welsh where it can appear in an initial position
a palatal lateral approximant or palatal l (ipa []) occurs in many languages and is represented by gli in italian ll in spanish and catalan lh in portuguese and in latvian
