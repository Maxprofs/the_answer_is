== historyedit ==
=== origin of the nameedit ===
the word york (from old norse jrvk from the 9th century ad) derives from the latinised name for the city variously rendered as eboracum eburacum or eburaci the first mention of york by this name is dated to circa 95104 ad as an address on a wooden stylus tablet from the roman fortress of vindolanda in northumberland
the toponymy of eboracum is uncertain because the language of the pre-roman indigenous population was never recorded they are thought to have spoken a celtic language related to modern welsh it is thought that eboracum is derived from the brythonic word eborakon a combination of eburos yew-tree (cf old irish ibar yew-tree welsh efwr alder buckthorn breton evor alder buckthorn") and suffix *-ko(n) place (cf welsh -og) meaning either place of the yew trees (cf efrog in welsh eabhrac in irish gaelic and eabhraig in scottish gaelic by which names the city is known in those languages) or less probably eburos property which is a personal celtic name mentioned in different documents as e eburus and eburius and which combined with the same suffix *-ko(n) could denote a property
the name eboracum became the anglian eoforwic in the 7th century a compound of eofor- from the old name and -wic a village probably by conflation of the element ebor- with a germanic root *eburaz (boar) by the 7th century the old english for boar had become eofor alternatively the word eofor already existed as an old saxon word for wild swine which is a cognate of the current low saxon word eaver and dutch ever the anglo-saxon newcomers probably interpreted the ebor part as eofor and -rac as ric (meaning rich) while -um was (and is) a common abbreviation of the saxon -heem meaning home to them it sounded as a home rich in boar as is common in saxon place names the -um part gradually faded eoforic when the danish army conquered the city in 866 its name became jrvk
jrvk gradually reduced to york in the centuries following the norman conquest moving from the middle english yerk in the 14th century through yourke in the 16th century to yarke in the 17th century the form york was first recorded in the 13th century many company and place names such as the ebor race meeting refer to the roman name the archbishop of york uses ebor as his surname in his signature
=== early historyedit ===
archaeological evidence suggests that mesolithic people settled in the region of york between 8000 and 7000 bc although it is not known whether their settlements were permanent or temporary by the time of the roman conquest of britain the area was occupied by a tribe known to the romans as the brigantes the brigantian tribal area initially became a roman client state but later its leaders became more hostile and the roman ninth legion was sent north of the humber into brigantian territory
the city was founded in ad 71 when the ninth legion conquered the brigantes and constructed a wooden military fortress on flat ground above the river ouse close to its confluence with the river foss the fortress which was later rebuilt in stone covered an area of 50 acres (20 ha) and was inhabited by 6,000 soldiers the site of the roman fortress lies under the foundations of york minster and excavations in the undercroft have revealed some of the original walls
the emperors hadrian septimius severus and constantius i all held court in york during their various campaigns during his stay the emperor severus proclaimed york capital of the province of britannia inferior and it is likely that it was he who granted york the privileges of a colonia or city constantius i died in ad 306 during his stay in york and his son constantine the great was proclaimed emperor by the troops based in the fortress
while the roman colonia and fortress were located on high ground by ad 400 the town was victim to periodic flooding from the rivers ouse and foss and was abandoned york declined in the post-roman era and was taken and settled by the angles in the 5th century
reclamation of the flooded parts of the town was initiated in the 7th century under king edwin of northumbria and york became his chief city the first minster church was built in york for the baptism of edwin in 627 edwin ordered the small wooden church be rebuilt in stone but was killed in 633 and the task of completing the stone minster fell to his successor oswald in the following century alcuin of york came to the cathedral school of york he had a long career as a teacher and scholar first at the school at york now known as st peter's school founded in 627 ad and later as charlemagne's leading advisor on ecclesiastical and educational affairs
in 866 northumbria was in the midst of internecine struggles when the vikings raided and captured york under viking rule the city became a major river port part of the extensive viking trading routes throughout northern europe the last ruler of an independent jrvk eric bloodaxe was driven from the city in ad 954 by king edred in his successful attempt to complete the unification of england
=== post conquestedit ===
in 1068 two years after the norman conquest of england the people of york rebelled initially the rebellion was successful but upon the arrival of william the conqueror the rebellion was put down william at once built a wooden fortress on a motte in 1069 after another rebellion william built another timbered castle across the river ouse these were destroyed in 1069 and rebuilt by william about the time of his ravaging northumbria in what is called the harrying of the north where he destroyed everything from york to durham the remains of the rebuilt castles now in stone are visible on either side of the river ouse see peter rex's the english resistance the underground war against the normans 2006
the first stone minster church was badly damaged by fire in the uprising and the normans built a minster on a new site around the year 1080 archbishop thomas started building the cathedral that in time became the current minster in the 12th century york started to prosper in 1190 york castle was the site of an infamous massacre of its jewish inhabitants in which at least 150 jews died (although some authorities put the figure as high as 500)
the city through its location on the river ouse and its proximity to the great north road became a major trading centre king john granted the city's first charter in 1212 confirming trading rights in england and europe during the later middle ages york merchants imported wine from france cloth wax canvas and oats from the low countries timber and furs from the baltic and exported grain to gascony and grain and wool to the low countries york became a major cloth manufacturing and trading centre edward i further stimulated the city's economy by using the city as a base for his war in scotland the city was the location of significant unrest during the so-called peasants revolt in 1381 the city acquired an increasing degree of autonomy from central government including the privileges granted by a charter of richard ii in 1396

guy fawkes who was born and educated in york was a member of a group of roman catholic restorationists that planned the gunpowder plot its aim was to displace protestant rule by blowing up the houses of parliament while king james i the entire protestant and even most of the catholic aristocracy and nobility were inside
in 1644 during the civil war the parliamentarians besieged york and many medieval houses outside the city walls were lost the barbican at walmgate bar was undermined and explosives laid but the plot was discovered on the arrival of prince rupert with an army of 15,000 men the siege was lifted the parliamentarians retreated some 6 miles (10 km) from york with rupert in pursuit before turning on his army and soundly defeating it at the battle of marston moor of rupert's 15,000 troops no fewer than 4,000 were killed and 1,500 captured the siege was renewed but the city could not hold out for long and on 15 july surrendered to sir thomas fairfax
following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the removal of the garrison from york in 1688 the city was dominated by the gentry and merchants although the clergy were still important competition from leeds and hull together with silting of the river ouse resulted in york losing its pre-eminent position as a trading centre but the city's role as the social and cultural centre for wealthy northerners was on the rise york's many elegant townhouses such as the lord mayor's mansion house and fairfax house date from this period as do the assembly rooms the theatre royal and the racecourse
