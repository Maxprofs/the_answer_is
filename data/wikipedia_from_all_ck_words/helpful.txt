in social psychology the everyday concept of helpfulness is the property of providing useful assistance or friendliness evidenced by a kindly and helpful disposition
for many years social psychologists have been searching for answers to these questions
why and when will people help
who will help
what can be done to lessen indifference and increase helping
== introduction ==
rewards rewards can be internal or external internal rewards are rewards that increase our sense of self-worth there are many different negative emotions that people try to reduce by performing good deeds for example people will do whatever can be done to expunge guilt relieve their bad feelings and restore their self-image (meyers 446) being helpful helps to achieve these goals and can even offset other negative moods
feel bad-do good scenario this effect states that those who feel bad for another person in a situation will be more likely to help compared to a person who feels bad for themselves in that situation for example a study was performed that had people imagine that their best friend had cancer in this study the researchers examined people's attention to grief those that were focused on the worries of the best friend were those that were more helpful compared to the people who had more selfish worries such as  i will have to act happy when really i am sad about my friends situation (meyers 447)
feel good do good scenario this scenario states that people who are in a good mood are more helpful thus helping people enhances that positive feeling which creates positive thoughts and positive self-esteem
== why do people help ==
several theories of helping agree that in the long run helping behavior benefits the giver as well as the receiver one explanation involves actions guided by social economics this action is called the social exchange theory it states that human interactions are transactions that aim to maximize one's rewards and minimize one's costs we exchange not only material goods and money but also social goods - love services information status (foa & foa 1975)
arousal cost-reward model the arousal cost-reward model suggests that people feel upset when they see a person in need and are motivated to do something to reduce the unpleasant arousal people then weigh the costs of helping versus not helping the clearer the need for help the more likely people are to help the presence of others inhibits helping behavior due to diffusion of responsibility a belief that someone else will help environmental and personality characteristics also influence helping
empathy-altruism theory according to the empathy-altruism theory helpfulness is seen in those who have empathy with the person in need
evolutionary theory evolutionary theories propose that people help others to ensure the survival of their genes at the risk of endangering themselves there are two specific types of helping in the evolutionary theory one is kin protection which claims that devotion goes to one's children before themselves the other is reciprocity which has the same components of the reciprocity norm basically if you help someone they will return the favor
the reciprocity norm an expectation that people will help not hurt those who have helped them
social responsibility norm an expectation that people will help those needing help
== when will people help ==
circumstances that inhibit or enhance helpfulness include
number of bystanders the bystander effect states that victims are less likely to get help when many people are around (latane & darley 1975)
helping when someone else does people are more likely to help others if they have just observed someone else modeling that specific helping behavior e.g los angeles drivers offering help to a female driver with a flat tire (bryan & test 1967) new jersey christmas shoppers dropping money in a salvation army kettle (bryan & test 1967) british adults donating blood (rushton & campbell 1977)
time pressures people leisurely on their way to an unimportant appointment usually stopped to help but those late for an important date seldom stopped (batson et al. 1978)
similarity people are more empathetic and helpful toward those similar to them (miller et al. 2001) e.g in dress (emswiller et al. 1971 gary et al. 1991) in race (benson et al. 1976 clark 1974 sissons 1981) in beliefs (myers 2005)
== who will help ==
personality traits people high in positive emotionality empathy and self-efficacy are most likely to be concerned and helpful (bierhoff et al. 1991 eisenberg et al. 1991 krueger et al. 2001) those high in self-monitoring are attuned to others expectations and are therefore helpful if they think helpfulness will be socially rewarded (white & gerstein 1987)
religious faith people who rate religion as important are more likely to report working among the needy (colasanto 1989 wuthnow 1994 deuser & deneve 1995) to campaign for social justice (benson et al. 1980 hansen et al. 1995 penner 2002) and to give away higher percent of their incomes (hodgkinson et al. 1990 1992) especially over the long-term (myers 2005) furthermore they are likely to give money to missionary causes rather than secular objective organizations that have no motive of religious conversion
== whom to help ==
victims of disaster crime and poverty
people who are worse-off than the helper (to varying degree)
== how to increase helping ==
research studies by social scientists have suggested that the following factors can help to increase helping
reduce ambiguity increasing responsibility personal appeals for help are much more effective than posters and media announcements (jason et al. 1984) nonverbal appeals can also be effective when they are personalized (snder et al. 1974 omoto & snyder 2002) so does reduction of anonymity (solomon & solomon 1978 solomon et al. 1981)
guilt and concern for self-image people who have been reprimanded for their transgressions are more likely to offer help than those who have not been reprimanded (katzev 1978) people who have given door-in-the-face responses are likely to agree to a smaller and more reasonable request (cialdini et al. 1975) labeling people as helpful can also increase helpful contributions (kraut 1973)
teaching moral inclusion broadening the range of people whose well-being concerns us (batson 1983) and inviting advantaged people to put themselves in others shoes to imagine how they feel (batson et al. 2003) helps
modeling altruism it's better not to publicize rampant tax cheating littering and teen drinking and instead to emphasize - to define a norm of - people's widespread honesty cleanliness and abstinence (cialdini et al. 2003) norms for generosity could perhaps be cultivated by simply including a new line on tax forms that requires people to compute - and thus to know - their annual donations as a percentage of income (ayres & nalebuff 2003) modeling effects were also apparent within the families of european christians who risked their lives to rescue jews in the 1930s and 1940s and of 1950s (london 1970 oliner & oliner 1988 rosenhan 1970 staub 1989,1991,1992)
