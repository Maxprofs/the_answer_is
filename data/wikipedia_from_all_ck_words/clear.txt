microsoft windows (or simply windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed marketed and sold by microsoft it consists of several families of operating systems each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry active windows families include windows nt windows embedded and windows phone these may encompass subfamilies e.g windows embedded compact (windows ce) or windows server defunct windows families include windows 9x and windows mobile
microsoft introduced an operating environment named windows on november 20 1985 as a graphical operating system shell for ms-dos in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (guis) microsoft windows came to dominate the world's personal computer market with over 90% market share overtaking mac os which had been introduced in 1984 however since 2012 thanks to the massive growth of smartphones windows sells less than android which became the most popular operating system in 2014 when counting all of the computing platforms each operating system runs on in 2014 the number of windows devices sold were less than 25% of android devices sold however comparisons across different markets are not fully relevant and for personal computers windows is still the most popular operating system
as of july 2015 the most recent version of windows for personal computers tablets and smartphones is windows 10 the most recent versions for server computers and embedded devices are respectively windows server 2012 r2 and windows embedded 8 a specialized version of windows runs on the xbox one game console
the next server version of windows is windows server 2016 which is expected to be released in early 2016
== genealogy ==
=== by marketing role ===
microsoft the developer of windows has registered several trademarks each of which denote a family of windows operating systems that target a specific sector of the computing industry as of 2014 the following windows families are being actively developed
windows nt started as a family of operating system with windows nt 3.1 an operating system for server computers and workstations it now consists of three operating system subfamilies that are released almost at the same time and share the same kernel
windows the operating system for mainstream personal computers the latest version is windows 10 it is almost impossible for someone unfamiliar with the subject to identify the members of this family by name because they do not adhere to any specific rule e.g windows vista windows 7 windows 8/8.1 and windows rt are members of this family but windows 3.1 is not the main competitor of this family is os x by apple inc (c.f usage share of operating systems market share by category)
windows server the operating system for server computers the latest version is windows server 2012 r2 unlike its clients sibling it has adopted a strong naming scheme the main competitor of this family is linux (c.f usage share of operating systems market share by category)
windows pe a lightweight version of its windows sibling meant to operate as a live operating system used for installing windows on bare-metal computers (especially on many computers at once) recovery or troubleshooting purposes the latest version is windows pe 5.1
windows phone an operating system sold only to manufacturers of smartphones the first version was windows phone 7 the latest version is windows phone 8.1 the main competitor of this family is android by google (c.f usage share of operating systems market share by category)
windows embedded initially microsoft developed windows ce as a general-purpose operating system for every device that was too resource-limited to be called a full-fledged computer eventually however windows ce was renamed windows embedded compact and was folded under windows compact trademark which also consists of windows embedded industry windows embedded professional windows embedded standard windows embedded handheld and windows embedded automotive
the following windows families are no longer being developed
windows 9x an operating system that targeted consumers market discontinued because of suboptimal performance (pc world called its last version windows me one of the worst products of all times.) microsoft now caters to the consumers market with windows nt
windows mobile the predecessor to windows phone it was a mobile phone operating system the first version was called pocket pc 2000 the third version windows mobile 2003 is the first version to adopt the windows mobile trademark the last version is windows mobile 6.5
== version history ==
the term windows collectively describes any or all of several generations of microsoft operating system products these products are generally categorized as follows
=== early versions ===
the history of windows dates back to september 1981 when chase bishop a computer scientist designed the first model of an electronic device and project interface manager was started it was announced in november 1983 (after the apple lisa but before the macintosh) under the name windows but windows 1.0 was not released until november 1985 windows 1.0 was to compete with apple's operating system but achieved little popularity windows 1.0 is not a complete operating system rather it extends ms-dos the shell of windows 1.0 is a program known as the ms-dos executive components included calculator calendar cardfile clipboard viewer clock control panel notepad paint reversi terminal and write windows 1.0 does not allow overlapping windows instead all windows are tiled only modal dialog boxes may appear over other windows
windows 2.0 was released in december 1987 and was more popular than its predecessor it features several improvements to the user interface and memory management windows 2.03 changed the os from tiled windows to overlapping windows the result of this change led to apple computer filing a suit against microsoft alleging infringement on apple's copyrights windows 2.0 also introduced more sophisticated keyboard shortcuts and could make use of expanded memory
windows 2.1 was released in two different versions windows/286 and windows/386 windows/386 uses the virtual 8086 mode of the intel 80386 to multitask several dos programs and the paged memory model to emulate expanded memory using available extended memory windows/286 in spite of its name runs on both intel 8086 and intel 80286 processors it runs in real mode but can make use of the high memory area
in addition to full windows-packages there were runtime-only versions that shipped with early windows software from third parties and made it possible to run their windows software on ms-dos and without the full windows feature set
the early versions of windows are often thought of as graphical shells mostly because they ran on top of ms-dos and use it for file system services however even the earliest windows versions already assumed many typical operating system functions notably having their own executable file format and providing their own device drivers (timer graphics printer mouse keyboard and sound) unlike ms-dos windows allowed users to execute multiple graphical applications at the same time through cooperative multitasking windows implemented an elaborate segment-based software virtual memory scheme which allows it to run applications larger than available memory code segments and resources are swapped in and thrown away when memory became scarce data segments moved in memory when a given application had relinquished processor control
=== windows 3.x ===
windows 3.0 released in 1990 improved the design mostly because of virtual memory and loadable virtual device drivers (vxds) that allow windows to share arbitrary devices between multi-tasked dos applications windows 3.0 applications can run in protected mode which gives them access to several megabytes of memory without the obligation to participate in the software virtual memory scheme they run inside the same address space where the segmented memory provides a degree of protection windows 3.0 also featured improvements to the user interface microsoft rewrote critical operations from c into assembly windows 3.0 is the first microsoft windows version to achieve broad commercial success selling 2 million copies in the first six months
windows 3.1 made generally available on march 1 1992 featured a facelift in august 1993 windows for workgroups a special version with integrated peer-to-peer networking features and a version number of 3.11 was released it was sold along windows 3.1 support for windows 3.1 ended on december 31 2001
windows 3.2 released 1994 is an updated version of the chinese version of windows 3.1 the update was limited to this language version as it fixed only issues related to the complex writing system of the chinese language windows 3.2 was generally sold by computer manufacturers with a ten-disk version of ms-dos that also had simplified chinese characters in basic output and some translated utilities
=== windows 9x ===
the next major consumer-oriented release of windows windows 95 was released on august 24 1995 while still remaining ms-dos-based windows 95 introduced support for native 32-bit applications plug and play hardware preemptive multitasking long file names of up to 255 characters and provided increased stability over its predecessors windows 95 also introduced a redesigned object oriented user interface replacing the previous program manager with the start menu taskbar and windows explorer shell windows 95 was a major commercial success for microsoft ina fried of cnet remarked that by the time windows 95 was finally ushered off the market in 2001 it had become a fixture on computer desktops around the world. microsoft published four oem service releases (osr) of windows 95 each of which was roughly equivalent to a service pack the first osr of windows 95 was also the first version of windows to be bundled with microsoft's web browser internet explorer mainstream support for windows 95 ended on december 31 2000 and extended support for windows 95 ended on december 31 2001
windows 95 was followed up with the release of windows 98 on june 25 1998 which introduced the windows driver model support for usb composite devices support for acpi hibernation and support for multi-monitor configurations windows 98 also included integration with internet explorer 4 through active desktop and other aspects of the windows desktop update (a series of enhancements to the explorer shell which were also made available for windows 95) in may 1999 microsoft released windows 98 second edition an updated version of windows 98 windows 98 se added internet explorer 5.0 and windows media player 6.2 amongst other upgrades mainstream support for windows 98 ended on june 30 2002 and extended support for windows 98 ended on july 11 2006
on september 14 2000 microsoft released windows me (millennium edition) the last dos-based version of windows windows me incorporated visual interface enhancements from its windows nt-based counterpart windows 2000 had faster boot times than previous versions (which however required the removal of the ability to access a real mode dos environment removing compatibility with some older programs) expanded multimedia functionality (including windows media player 7 windows movie maker and the windows image acquisition framework for retrieving images from scanners and digital cameras) additional system utilities such as system file protection and system restore and updated home networking tools however windows me was faced with criticism for its speed and instability along with hardware compatibility issues and its removal of real mode dos support pc world considered windows me to be one of the worst operating systems microsoft had ever released and the 4th worst tech product of all time
=== windows nt ===
==== early versions ====
in november 1988 a new development team within microsoft (which included former digital equipment corporation developers dave cutler and mark lucovsky) began work on a revamped version of ibm and microsoft's os/2 operating system known as nt os/2 nt os/2 was intended to be a secure multi-user operating system with posix compatibility and a modular portable kernel with preemptive multitasking and support for multiple processor architectures however following the successful release of windows 3.0 the nt development team decided to rework the project to use an extended 32-bit port of the windows api known as win32 instead of those of os/2 win32 maintained a similar structure to the windows apis (allowing existing windows applications to easily be ported to the platform) but also supported the capabilities of the existing nt kernel following its approval by microsoft's staff development continued on what was now windows nt the first 32-bit version of windows however ibm objected to the changes and ultimately continued os/2 development on its own
the first release of the resulting operating system windows nt 3.1 (named to associate it with windows 3.1) was released in july 1993 with versions for desktop workstations and servers windows nt 3.5 was released in september 1994 focusing on performance improvements and support for novell's netware and was followed up by windows nt 3.51 in may 1995 which included additional improvements and support for the powerpc architecture windows nt 4.0 was released in june 1996 introducing the redesigned interface of windows 95 to the nt series on february 17 2000 microsoft released windows 2000 a successor to nt 4.0 the windows nt name was dropped at this point in order to put a greater focus on the windows brand
===== home versions of windows nt =====
the next major version of windows nt windows xp was released on october 25 2001 the introduction of windows xp aimed to unify the consumer-oriented windows 9x series with the architecture introduced by windows nt a change which microsoft promised would provide better performance over its dos-based predecessors windows xp would also introduce a redesigned user interface (including an updated start menu and a task-oriented windows explorer) streamlined multimedia and networking features internet explorer 6 integration with microsoft's net passport services modes to help provide compatibility with software designed for previous versions of windows and remote assistance functionality
at retail windows xp was now marketed in two main editions the home edition was targeted towards consumers while the professional edition was targeted towards business environments and power users and included additional security and networking features home and professional were later accompanied by the media center edition (designed for home theater pcs with an emphasis on support for dvd playback tv tuner cards dvr functionality and remote controls) and the tablet pc edition (designed for mobile devices meeting its specifications for a tablet computer with support for stylus pen input and additional pen-enabled applications) mainstream support for windows xp ended on april 14 2009 extended support ended on april 8 2014
after windows 2000 microsoft also changed its release schedules for server operating systems the server counterpart of windows xp windows server 2003 was released in april 2003 it was followed in december 2005 by windows server 2003 r2
==== windows vista ====
after a lengthy development process windows vista was released on november 30 2006 for volume licensing and january 30 2007 for consumers it contained a number of new features from a redesigned shell and user interface to significant technical changes with a particular focus on security features it was available in a number of different editions and has been subject to some criticism such as drop of performance longer boot time criticism of new uac and stricter license agreement vista's server counterpart windows server 2008 was released in early 2008
==== windows 7 ====
on july 22 2009 windows 7 and windows server 2008 r2 were released as rtm (release to manufacturing) while the former was released to the public 3 months later on october 22 2009 unlike its predecessor windows vista which introduced a large number of new features windows 7 was intended to be a more focused incremental upgrade to the windows line with the goal of being compatible with applications and hardware with which windows vista was already compatible windows 7 has multi-touch support a redesigned windows shell with an updated taskbar a home networking system called homegroup and performance improvements
==== windows 8 and 8.1 ====
windows 8 the successor to windows 7 was released generally on october 26 2012 a number of significant changes were made on windows 8 including the introduction of a user interface based around microsoft's metro design language with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and all-in-one pcs these changes include the start screen which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually updated information and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch-based devices other changes include increased integration with cloud services and other online platforms (such as social networks and microsoft's own skydrive and xbox live services) the windows store service for software distribution and a new variant known as windows rt for use on devices that utilize the arm architecture an update to windows 8 called windows 8.1 was released on october 17 2013 and includes features such as new live tile sizes deeper skydrive integration and many other revisions windows 8 and windows 8.1 has been subject to some criticism such as removal of start menu
==== windows 10 ====
on september 30 2014 microsoft announced windows 10 as the successor to windows 8.1 it was released on july 29 2015 and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with windows 8 changes include the return of the start menu a virtual desktop system and the ability to run windows store apps within windows on the desktop rather than in full-screen mode windows 10 is said to be available to update from qualified windows 7 with sp1 and windows 8.1 computers from the get windows 10 application (for windows 7 windows 8.1) or windows update (windows 7)
==== multilingual support ====
multilingual support is built into windows the language for both the keyboard and the interface can be changed through the region and language control panel components for all supported input languages such as input method editors are automatically installed during windows installation (in windows xp and earlier files for east asian languages such as chinese and right-to-left scripts such as arabic may need to be installed separately also from the said control panel) third-party imes may also be installed if a user feels that the provided one is insufficient for their needs
interface languages for the operating system are free for download but some languages are limited to certain editions of windows language interface packs (lips) are redistributable and may be downloaded from microsoft's download center and installed for any edition of windows (xp or later) - they translate most but not all of the windows interface and require a certain base language (the language which windows originally shipped with) this is used for most languages in emerging markets full language packs which translates the complete operating system are only available for specific editions of windows (ultimate and enterprise editions of windows vista and 7 and all editions of windows 8 8.1 and rt except single language) they do not require a specific base language and are commonly used for more popular languages such as french or chinese these languages cannot be downloaded through the download center but available as optional updates through the windows update service (except windows 8)
the interface language of installed applications are not affected by changes in the windows interface language availability of languages depends on the application developers themselves
windows 8 and windows server 2012 introduces a new language control panel where both the interface and input languages can be simultaneously changed and language packs regardless of type can be downloaded from a central location the pc settings app in windows 8.1 and windows server 2012 r2 also includes a counterpart settings page for this changing the interface language also changes the language of preinstalled windows store apps (such as mail maps and news) and certain other microsoft-developed apps (such as remote desktop) the above limitations for language packs are however still in effect except that full language packs can be installed for any edition except single language which caters to emerging markets
==== platform support ====
windows nt included support for several different platforms before the x86-based personal computer became dominant in the professional world windows nt 4.0 and its predecessors supported powerpc dec alpha and mips r4000 (although some these platforms implement 64-bit computing the operating system treated them as 32-bit.) however windows 2000 the successor of windows nt 4.0 dropped support for all platforms except the third generation x86 (known as ia-32) or newer in 32-bit mode the client line of window nt family still runs on ia-32 although the windows server line has ceased supporting this platform with the release of windows server 2008 r2
with the introduction of the intel itanium architecture (ia-64) microsoft released new versions of windows to support it itanium versions of windows xp and windows server 2003 were released at the same time as their mainstream x86 counterparts windows xp 64-bit edition released in 2005 is the last windows client operating systems to support itanium windows server line continued to support this platform until windows server 2012 windows server 2008 r2 is the last windows operating system to support itanium architecture
on april 25 2005 microsoft released windows xp professional x64 edition and windows server 2003 x64 editions to support the x86-64 (or simply x64) the eighth generation of x86 architecture windows vista was the first client version of windows nt to be released simultaneously in ia-32 and x64 editions x64 is still supported
an edition of windows 8 known as windows rt was specifically created for computers with arm architecture and while arm is still used for windows smartphones with windows 10 tablets with windows rt will not be updated
=== windows ce ===
windows ce (officially known as windows embedded compact) is an edition of windows that runs on minimalistic computers like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones windows embedded compact is based on its own dedicated kernel dubbed windows ce kernel microsoft licenses windows ce to oems and device makers the oems and device makers can modify and create their own user interfaces and experiences while windows ce provides the technical foundation to do so
windows ce was used in the dreamcast along with sega's own proprietary os for the console windows ce was the core from which windows mobile was derived its successor windows phone 7 was based on components from both windows ce 6.0 r3 and windows ce 7.0 windows phone 8 however is based on the same nt-kernel as windows 8
windows embedded compact is not to be confused with windows xp embedded or windows nt 4.0 embedded modular editions of windows based on windows nt kernel
=== xbox os ===
xbox os is an unofficial name given to the version of windows that runs on the xbox one it is a more specific implementation with an emphasis on virtualization (using hyper-v) as it is three operating systems running at once consisting of the core operating system a second implemented for games and a more windows-like environment for applications
== timeline of releases ==
== usage share ==
== security ==
consumer versions of windows were originally designed for ease-of-use on a single-user pc without a network connection and did not have security features built in from the outset however windows nt and its successors are designed for security (including on a network) and multi-user pcs but were not initially designed with internet security in mind as much since when it was first developed in the early 1990s internet use was less prevalent
these design issues combined with programming errors (e.g buffer overflows) and the popularity of windows means that it is a frequent target of computer worm and virus writers in june 2005 bruce schneier's counterpane internet security reported that it had seen over 1,000 new viruses and worms in the previous six months in 2005 kaspersky lab found around 11,000 malicious programsviruses trojans back-doors and exploits written for windows
microsoft releases security patches through its windows update service approximately once a month (usually the second tuesday of the month) although critical updates are made available at shorter intervals when necessary in versions of windows after and including windows 2000 sp3 and windows xp updates can be automatically downloaded and installed if the user selects to do so as a result service pack 2 for windows xp as well as service pack 1 for windows server 2003 were installed by users more quickly than it otherwise might have been
while the windows 9x series offered the option of having profiles for multiple users they had no concept of access privileges and did not allow concurrent access and so were not true multi-user operating systems in addition they implemented only partial memory protection they were accordingly widely criticised for lack of security
the windows nt series of operating systems by contrast are true multi-user and implement absolute memory protection however a lot of the advantages of being a true multi-user operating system were nullified by the fact that prior to windows vista the first user account created during the setup process was an administrator account which was also the default for new accounts though windows xp did have limited accounts the majority of home users did not change to an account type with fewer rights partially due to the number of programs which unnecessarily required administrator rights and so most home users ran as administrator all the time
windows vista changes this by introducing a privilege elevation system called user account control when logging in as a standard user a logon session is created and a token containing only the most basic privileges is assigned in this way the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system when logging in as a user in the administrators group two separate tokens are assigned the first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator and the second is a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive user applications including the windows shell are then started with the restricted token resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an administrator account when an application requests higher privileges or run as administrator is clicked uac will prompt for confirmation and if consent is given (including administrator credentials if the account requesting the elevation is not a member of the administrators group) start the process using the unrestricted token
=== file permissions ===
all windows versions from windows nt 3 have been based on a file system permission system referred to as aglp (accounts global local permissions) agdlp which in essence where file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a local group which then has other global groups as members these global groups then hold other groups or users depending on different windows versions used this system varies from other vendor products such as linux and netware due to the static allocation of permission being applied directory to the file or folder however using this process of aglp/agdlp/agudlp allows a small number of static permissions to be applied and allows for easy changes to the account groups without reapplying the file permissions on the files and folders
=== windows defender ===
on january 6 2005 microsoft released a beta version of microsoft antispyware based upon the previously released giant antispyware on february 14 2006 microsoft antispyware became windows defender with the release of beta 2 windows defender is a freeware program designed to protect against spyware and other unwanted software windows xp and windows server 2003 users who have genuine copies of microsoft windows can freely download the program from microsoft's web site and windows defender ships as part of windows vista and 7 in windows 8 windows defender and microsoft security essentials have been combined into a single program named windows defender it is based on microsoft security essentials borrowing its features and user interface although it is enabled by default it can be turned off to use another anti-virus solution windows malicious software removal tool and the optional microsoft safety scanner are two other free security products offered by microsoft
=== third-party analysis ===
in an article based on a report by symantec internetnews.com has described microsoft windows as having the fewest number of patches and the shortest average patch development time of the five operating systems it monitored in the last six months of 2006.
a study conducted by kevin mitnick and marketing communications firm avantgarde in 2004 found that an unprotected and unpatched windows xp system with service pack 1 lasted only 4 minutes on the internet before it was compromised and an unprotected and also unpatched windows server 2003 system was compromised after being connected to the internet for 8 hours this study does not apply to windows xp systems running the service pack 2 update (released in late 2004) which vastly improved the security of windows xp the computer that was running windows xp service pack 2 was not compromised the aol national cyber security alliance online safety study of october 2004 determined that 80% of windows users were infected by at least one spyware/adware product much documentation is available describing how to increase the security of microsoft windows products typical suggestions include deploying microsoft windows behind a hardware or software firewall running anti-virus and anti-spyware software and installing patches as they become available through windows update
== alternative implementations ==
owing to the operating system's popularity a number of applications have been released that aim to provide compatibility with windows applications either as a compatibility layer for another operating system or as a standalone system that can run software written for windows out of the box these include
wine a free and open-source implementation of the windows api allowing one to run many windows applications on x86-based platforms including unix linux and os x wine developers refer to it as a compatibility layer and use windows-style apis to emulate windows environment
crossover a wine package with licensed fonts its developers are regular contributors to wine and focus on wine running officially supported applications
cedega proprietary fork of wine by transgaming technologies designed specifically for running microsoft windows games on linux a version of cedega known as cider allows windows games to run on os x since wine was licensed under the lgpl cedega has been unable to port the improvements made to wine to their proprietary codebase cedega ceased its service in february 2011
darwine a port of wine for os x and darwin operates by running wine on qemu
linux unified kernel a set of patches to the linux kernel allowing first-class windows executable files in linux (using wine dlls) to use windows drivers and be faster than interpreted wine
reactos an open-source os intended to run the same software as windows originally designed to simulate windows nt 4.0 now aiming at windows 7 compatibility it has been in the development stage since 1996
linspire formerly lindowsos a commercial linux distribution initially created with the goal of running major windows software changed its name to linspire after microsoft v lindows discontinued in favor of xandros desktop
freedows os an open-source attempt at creating a windows clone for x86 platforms intended to be released under the gnu general public license started in 1996 by reece k sellin the project was never completed getting only to the stage of design discussions which featured a number of novel concepts until it was suspended in 2002
