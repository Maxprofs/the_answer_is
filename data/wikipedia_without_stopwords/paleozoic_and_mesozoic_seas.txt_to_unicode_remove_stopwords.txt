tannuella
tannuella oldest fossil assigned cephalopods dating early cambrian atdababian botomian million years ago position group suggested based shape presence chambers hypothesis would precursor hypseloconids genera knightoconus eventually gave rise cephalopods
knightoconus
knightoconus late cambrian monoplacophoran thought represent ancestor cephalopods chambered conical shell lacked siphuncle although earlier molluscan fossils also septate knightoconus latest septate mollusc first sipunculate cephalopods point taken prove relevance cephalopoda absence siphuncle taken evidence cephalopod ancestry argued could siphuncle evolve penetrate existing septa prevailing argument suggests strand tissue remained attached previous septum mollusc moved forwards deposited next septum producing obstacle complete closure septum becoming mineralised septa found mature individuals occupying around third shell septa form early found specimens small mm length septa uniformly spaced inconsistent gastropod affinity unlike monoplacophoran fossils evidence muscle scarring knightoconus fossils

yochelcionellids given rise snorkel hypothesis fossils aseptate helcionellids snorkellike tube one surface snorkel seized upon characteristic cephalopodlike water circulatory system perhaps precursor siphuncle however neither theories borne
ellesmerocerida
earliest true cephalopod order emerge ellesmerocerida quite small shells slightly curved internal chambers closely spaced siphuncle penetrated septa meniscuslike holes marks important difference earlier cephalopods whose siphuncle edge septum shell wall basis muscle scars preserved genera paradakeoceras levisoceras animals reconstructed straight body dorsal shell head anterior concave surface shell funnel consisting pair folds foot rear juxtaposed head later oncoceridlike forms
early ordovician diversity
ellesmerocerids shelled cephalopods survived endcambrian extinction subsequent cephalopods diversified throughout ordovician period thus thought derived forms
early cephalopods fine shells could cope pressures deep water mid tremadoc supplemented larger shells around cm length larger forms included straight coiled shells fall orders endocerida wide siphuncles tarphycerida narrow siphuncles
mid ordovician orders joined orthocerids whose first chambers small spherical lituitids whose siphuncles thin oncocerids also appear time restricted shallow water short exogastric conchs mid ordovician saw first cephalopods septa strong enough cope pressures associated deeper water could inhabit depths greater m widesiphuncled actinocerida discocerida emerged darriwilian direction coiling would prove crucial future success lineages endogastric coiling would permit large size attained straight shell whereas exogastric coiling initially rather rare permitted spirals familiar fossil record develop corresponding large size diversity endogastric mean shell curved ventral lower side longitudinally concave belly exogastric means shell curved ventral side longitudinally convex belly allowing funnel pointed backwards beneath shell
curved shells brought number benefits firstly minerals required large quantities successive whorl builds one also organism stable centre mass coincides centre buoyancy manoeuvrable
early cephalopods likely predators near top food chain early palaeozoic range far restricted today mainly constrained sublittoral regions shallow shelves low latitudes usually occur association thrombolites pelagic habit gradually adopted ordovician progressed deepwater cephalopods whilst rare found lower ordovician highlatitude waters
