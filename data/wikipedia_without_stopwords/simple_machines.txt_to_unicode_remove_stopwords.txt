frictionless analysisedit
although machine works differently mechanically way function similar mathematically machine force applied device one point work moving load another point although machines change direction force stationary pulley machines multiply magnitude force factor mechanical advantage
calculated machines geometry friction
simple machines contain source energy cannot work receive input force simple machine friction elasticity called ideal machine due conservation energy ideal simple machine power output rate energy output time equal power input
power output equals velocity load multiplied load force similarly power input applied force equal velocity input point multiplied applied force therefore
therefore mechanical advantage frictionless machine equal velocity ratio ratio input velocity output velocity
velocity ratio machine also equal ratio distance output point moves corresponding distance input point moves
calculated geometry machine example velocity ratio lever equal ratio lever arms
mechanical advantage greater less one
output force greater input machine acts force amplifier distance moved load less distance moved input force
output force less input distance moved load greater distance moved input force
screw uses rotational motion input force replaced torque velocity angular velocity shaft turned
friction efficiencyedit
real machines friction causes input power dissipated heat power lost friction conservation energy
efficiency machine number defined ratio power power measure energy losses
power equal product force velocity
therefore
nonideal machines mechanical advantage always less velocity ratio product efficiency machine includes friction able move large load corresponding ideal machine using input force
compound machinesedit
compound machine machine formed set simple machines connected series output force one providing input force next example bench vise consists lever vises handle series screw simple gear train consists number gears wheels axles connected series
mechanical advantage compound machine ratio output force exerted last machine series divided input force applied first machine
output force machine input next mechanical advantage also given
thus mechanical advantage compound machine equal product mechanical advantages series simple machines form
similarly efficiency compound machine also product efficiencies series simple machines form
selflocking machinesedit
many simple machines load force fout machine high enough relation input force fin machine move backwards load force work input force machines used either direction driving force applied either input point example load force lever high enough lever move backwards moving input arm backwards input force called reversible nonlocking overhauling machines backward motion called overhauling however machines frictional forces high enough amount load force move backwards even input force zero called selflocking nonreversible nonoverhauling machine machines set motion force input input force removed remain motionless locked friction whatever position left
selflocking occurs mainly machines large areas sliding contact moving parts screw inclined plane wedge
common example screw screws applying torque shaft cause turn moving shaft linearly work load amount axial load force shaft cause turn backwards
inclined plane load pulled plane sideways input force plane steep enough friction load plane input force removed load remain motionless slide plane regardless weight
wedge driven block wood force end hitting sledge hammer forcing sides apart amount compression force wood walls cause pop back block
machine selflocking efficiency
whether machine selflocking depends friction forces coefficient static friction parts distance ratio dindout ideal mechanical advantage friction ideal mechanical advantage high enough selflock
proofedit
machine moves forward direction point point input force work load force conservation energy input work equal sum work done load force work lost friction
efficiency
machine moves backward point point load force work input force work lost friction
output work
thus machine selflocks work dissipated friction greater work done load force moving backwards even input force
