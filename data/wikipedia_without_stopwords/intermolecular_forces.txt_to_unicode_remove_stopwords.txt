dipoledipole interactions
dipoledipole interactions electrostatic interactions permanent dipoles molecules interactions tend align molecules increase attraction reducing potential energy example dipoledipole interaction seen hydrogen chloride hcl positive end polar molecule attract negative end molecule influence position polar molecules net attraction examples polar molecules include hydrogen chloride hcl chloroform chcl
often molecules contain dipolar groups overall dipole moment occurs symmetry within molecule causes dipoles cancel occurs molecules tetrachloromethane carbon dioxide note dipoledipole interaction two individual atoms usually zero since atoms rarely carry permanent dipole
