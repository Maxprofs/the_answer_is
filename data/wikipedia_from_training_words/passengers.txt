a passenger (also abbreviated as pax) is a person who travels in a vehicle but bears little or no responsibility for the tasks required for that vehicle to arrive at its destination or otherwise operate the vehicle
passengers are people who ride on buses passenger trains airliners ships ferryboats and other methods of transportation historically the concept of the passenger has existed for as long as man has been able to create means of transportation capable of carrying more people than were needed to operate the vessel
crew members (if any) as well as the driver or pilot of the vehicle are usually not considered to be passengers for example a flight attendant on an airline would not be considered a passenger while on duty but an employee riding in a company car being driven by another person would be considered a passenger even if the car was being driven on company business
