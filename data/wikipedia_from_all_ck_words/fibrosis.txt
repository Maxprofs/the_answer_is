fibrosis is the formation of excess fibrous connective tissue in an organ or tissue in a reparative or reactive process this can be a reactive benign or pathological state in response to injury this is called scarring and if fibrosis arises from a single cell line this is called a fibroma physiologically fibrosis acts to deposit connective tissue which can obliterate the architecture and function of the underlying organ or tissue fibrosis can be used to describe the pathological state of excess deposition of fibrous tissue as well as the process of connective tissue deposition in healing
== physiologyedit ==
fibrosis is similar to the process of scarring in that both involve stimulated cells laying down connective tissue including collagen and glycosaminoglycans immune cells called macrophages as well as any damaged tissue between surfaces called interstitium release tgf beta there are numerous reasons for this including inflammation of the nearby tissue or a generalised inflammatory state with increased circulating mediators tgf beta stimulates the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts which deposit connective tissue
== examples of fibrosisedit ==
fibrosis can occur in many tissues within the body typically as a result of inflammation or damage and examples include
lungs
pulmonary fibrosis
cystic fibrosis
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (idiopathic meaning the cause is unknown)
liver
cirrhosis
heart
atrial fibrosis
endomyocardial fibrosis
old myocardial infarction
brain
glial scar
other
arthrofibrosis (knee shoulder other joints)
crohn's disease (intestine)
dupuytren's contracture (hands,fingers)
keloid (skin)
mediastinal fibrosis (soft tissue of the mediastinum)
myelofibrosis (bone marrow)
peyronie's disease (penis)
nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (skin)
progressive massive fibrosis (lungs) a complication of coal workers pneumoconiosis
retroperitoneal fibrosis (soft tissue of the retroperitoneum)
scleroderma/systemic sclerosis (skin lungs)
some forms of adhesive capsulitis (shoulder)
