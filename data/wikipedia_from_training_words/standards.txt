a brother is the male offspring of one's parent
== overviewedit ==
the term brother comes from the proto-indo-european *brhtr which becomes latin frater of the same meaning sibling warmth or sibling affect between male siblings has been correlated to some more negative effects in pairs of brothers higher sibling warmth is related to more risk taking behaviour although risk taking behaviour is not related to sibling warmth in any other type of sibling pair the cause of this phenomenon in which sibling warmth is only correlated with risk taking behaviours in brother pairs still is unclear this finding does however suggest that although sibling conflict is a risk factor for risk taking behaviour sibling warmth does not serve as a protective factor

the book nicomachean ethics book viii written by aristotle in 350 b.c.e. offers a way in which people should view the relationships between biological brothers the relationship of brothers is laid out with the following quote the friendship of brothers has the characteristics found in that of comrades and in general between people who are like each other is as much as they belong more to each other and start with a lover for each other form their very birth and in as much as those born to the same parents and brought up together and similarly educated are more akin in character and the test of time has been applied most fully and convincingly in their case for these reasons it is the job of the older brother to influence the ethics of the younger brother by being a person of good action aristotle says by imitating and reenacting the acts of good people a child becomes habituated to good action over time the younger brother will develop the good actions of the older brother as well and be like him aristotle also adds this on the matter of retaining the action of doing good once imitated once the habits of ethics or immorality become entrenched they are difficult to break. the good habits that are created by the influence of the older brother become habit in the life of the younger brother and turn out to be seemingly permanent it is the role of the older brother to be a positive influence on the development of the younger brother's upbringing when it comes to the education of ethics and good actions when positive characteristics are properly displayed to the younger brother by the older brother these habits and characteristics are imitated and foster an influential understanding of good ethics and positive actions
