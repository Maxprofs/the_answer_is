limiting reagent limiting reactant chemical reaction substance totally consumed chemical reaction complete amount product formed limited reagent since reaction cannot proceed without one reagents present excess quantities required react limiting reagent described excess reagents excess reactants
limiting reagent must identified order calculate percentage yield reaction since theoretical yield defined amount product obtained limiting reagent reacts completely
given balanced chemical equation describes reaction several equivalent ways identify limiting reagent evaluate excess quantities reagents
method comparison reactant amounts
method useful two reactants one reactant chosen balanced chemical equation used determine amount reactant b necessary react amount b actually present exceeds amount required b excess limiting reagent amount b present less required b limiting reagent
example two reactants
consider combustion benzene represented following chemical equation
means moles molecular oxygen o required react moles benzene ch
amount oxygen required quantities benzene calculated using crossmultiplication rule three example mol ch present mol o required
fact mol o present excess mol unreacted oxygen benzene consumed benzene limiting reagent
conclusion verified comparing mole ratio o ch required balanced equation mole ratio actually present
since actual ratio larger required o reagent excess confirms benzene limiting reagent
method comparison product amounts formed reactant
method chemical equation used calculate amount one product formed reactant amount present limiting reactant one form smallest amount product considered method extended number reactants easily first method
example
g iron iii oxide feo reacted g aluminium al following thermite reaction
since reactant amounts given grams must first converted moles comparison chemical equation order determine many moles fe produced either reactant
moles produced fe reactant feo
moles produced fe reactant al
enough al produce mol fe enough feo produce mol fe means amount fe actually produced limited feo present therefore limiting reagent
shortcut
seen example amount product fe formed reagent x feo al proportional quantity
suggests shortcut works number reagents calculate formula reagent reagent lowest value formula limiting reagent
