since looking was announced it has been referred to by both the community and early critics as the gay version of girls and sex and the city after watching the pilot critics quickly dismissed these comments saying differences between the two series go beyond the surface and one of the show's lead actors jonathan groff went on to say that to be in the same breath as those shows is exciting [...] but the tone and writing and the style of the show is very different and people will notice that when they see it.
keith uhlich writing for the bbc opined that looking is one of the most revolutionary depictions of gay life ever on tv and thats because it makes it totally ordinary.
