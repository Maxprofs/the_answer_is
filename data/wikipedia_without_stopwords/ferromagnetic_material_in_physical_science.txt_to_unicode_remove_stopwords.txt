history distinction ferrimagnetism
historically term ferromagnetism used material could exhibit spontaneous magnetization net magnetic moment absence external magnetic field general definition still common use recently however different classes spontaneous magnetization identified one magnetic ion per primitive cell material leading stricter definition ferromagnetism often used distinguish ferrimagnetism particular
material ferromagnetic narrower sense magnetic ions add positive contribution net magnetization
magnetic ions subtract net magnetization partially antialigned material ferrimagnetic

explanation
bohrvan leeuwen theorem discovered showed classical physics theories unable account form magnetism including ferromagnetism magnetism regarded purely quantum mechanical effect ferromagnetism arises due two effects quantum mechanics spin pauli exclusion principle
origin magnetism
one fundamental properties electron besides carries charge magnetic dipole moment ie behaves like tiny magnet dipole moment comes fundamental property electron quantum mechanical spin due quantum nature spin electron one two states magnetic field either pointing choice spin electrons atoms main source ferromagnetism although also contribution orbital angular momentum electron nucleus magnetic dipoles piece matter aligned point direction individually tiny magnetic fields add together create much larger macroscopic field
however materials made atoms filled electron shells total dipole moment zero every electrons magnetic moment cancelled opposite moment second electron pair atoms partially filled shells ie unpaired spins net magnetic moment ferromagnetism occurs materials partially filled shells hunds rules first electrons shell tend spin thereby increasing total dipole moment
unpaired dipoles often called simply spins even though also generally include angular momentum tend align parallel external magnetic field effect called paramagnetism ferromagnetism involves additional phenomenon however dipoles tend align spontaneously giving rise spontaneous magnetization even applied field
exchange interaction
two nearby atoms unpaired electrons whether electron spins parallel antiparallel affects whether electrons share orbit result quantum mechanical effect called exchange interaction turn affects electron location coulomb electrostatic interaction thus energy difference states energy difference orders magnitude larger energy differences associated magnetic dipoledipole interaction due dipole orientation tends align dipoles antiparallel result ferromagnetic materials nearby spins tend align direction certain doped semiconductor oxides rkky interactions shown bring periodic longerrange magnetic interactions phenomenon significance study spintronic materials
exchange interaction related pauli exclusion principle says two electrons spin cannot also position therefore certain conditions orbitals unpaired outer valence electrons adjacent atoms overlap distributions electric charge space farther apart electrons parallel spins opposite spins reduces electrostatic energy electrons spins parallel compared energy spins antiparallel parallelspin state stable simple terms electrons repel one another move apart aligning spins spins electrons tend line difference energy called exchange energy
materials exchange interaction much stronger competing dipoledipole interaction frequently called magnetic materials instance iron fe exchange force times stronger dipole interaction therefore curie temperature virtually dipoles ferromagnetic material aligned exchange interaction also responsible types spontaneous ordering atomic magnetic moments occurring magnetic solids antiferromagnetism ferrimagnetism different exchange interaction mechanisms create magnetism different ferromagnetic ferrimagnetic antiferromagnetic substances mechanisms include direct exchange rkky exchange double exchange superexchange
magnetic anisotropy
although exchange interaction keeps spins aligned align particular direction without magnetic anisotropy spins magnet randomly change direction response thermal fluctuations magnet superparamagnetic several kinds magnetic anisotropy common magnetocrystalline anisotropy dependence energy direction magnetization relative crystallographic lattice another common source anisotropy inverse magnetostriction induced internal strains singledomain magnets also shape anisotropy due magnetostatic effects particle shape temperature magnet increases anisotropy tends decrease often blocking temperature transition superparamagnetism occurs
magnetic domains
would seem suggest every piece ferromagnetic material strong magnetic field since spins aligned yet iron ferromagnets often found unmagnetized state reason bulk piece ferromagnetic material divided tiny regions called magnetic domains also known weiss domains within domain spins aligned bulk material lowest energy configuration ie unmagnetized spins separate domains point different directions magnetic fields cancel object net large scale magnetic field
ferromagnetic materials spontaneously divide magnetic domains exchange interaction shortrange force long distances many atoms tendency magnetic dipoles reduce energy orienting opposite directions wins dipoles piece ferromagnetic material aligned parallel creates large magnetic field extending space around contains lot magnetostatic energy material reduce energy splitting many domains pointing different directions magnetic field confined small local fields material reducing volume field domains separated thin domain walls number molecules thick direction magnetization dipoles rotates smoothly one domains direction
magnetized materials
thus piece iron lowest energy state unmagnetized generally little net magnetic field however placed strong enough external magnetic field domain walls move reorienting domains dipoles aligned external field domains remain aligned external field removed creating magnetic field extending space around material thus creating permanent magnet domains go back original minimum energy configuration field removed domain walls tend become pinned snagged defects crystal lattice preserving parallel orientation shown barkhausen effect magnetizing field changed magnetization changes thousands tiny discontinuous jumps domain walls suddenly snap past defects
magnetization function external field described hysteresis curve although state aligned domains found piece magnetized ferromagnetic material minimalenergy configuration metastable persist long periods shown samples magnetite sea floor maintained magnetization millions years
heating cooling annealing magnetized material subjecting vibration hammering applying rapidly oscillating magnetic field degaussing coil tends release domain walls pinned state domain boundaries tend move back lower energy configuration less external magnetic field thus demagnetizing material
commercial magnets made hard magnetic materials large magnetic anisotropy alnico hard ferrites strong tendency magnetization pointed along one axis crystal easy axis manufacture materials subjected various metallurgical processes powerful magnetic field aligns crystal grains easy axes magnetization point direction thus magnetization resulting magnetic field built crystal structure material making difficult demagnetize
curie temperature
temperature increases thermal motion entropy competes ferromagnetic tendency dipoles align temperature rises beyond certain point called curie temperature secondorder phase transition system longer maintain spontaneous magnetization ability magnetized attracted magnet disappears although still responds paramagnetically external field temperature spontaneous symmetry breaking magnetic moments become aligned neighbors curie temperature critical point magnetic susceptibility theoretically infinite although net magnetization domainlike spin correlations fluctuate length scales
study ferromagnetic phase transitions especially via simplified ising spin model important impact development statistical physics first clearly shown mean field theory approaches failed predict correct behavior critical point found fall universality class includes many systems liquidgas transitions replaced renormalization group theory
