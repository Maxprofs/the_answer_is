a week is a time unit equal to seven days it is the standard time period used for cycles of work days and rest days in most parts of the world mostly alongside (but not strictly part of) the gregorian calendar
the days of the week were named in different languages after classical planets various deities (example thursday thor's day a variation after jupiter's day from roman times) and heavenly bodies (example sunday sun's day) and other sources in english the names are monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday and sunday
iso 8601 includes the iso week date system a numbering system for weeks within a given year each week begins on a monday and is associated with the year that contains that week's thursday (so that if a year starts in a long weekend fridaysunday week number one of the year will start after that)
the term week is sometimes expanded to refer to other time units comprising a few days such as the nundinal cycle of the ancient roman calendar
== definition and duration ==
a week is defined as an interval of exactly seven days so that technically except at daylight saving time transitions or leap seconds
1 week = 7 days = 168 hours = 10,080 minutes = 604,800 seconds
with respect to the gregorian calendar
1 gregorian calendar year = 52 weeks + 1 day (2 days in a leap year)
1 week = 16006957 22.9984% of an average gregorian month
in a gregorian mean year there are 365.2425 days and thus exactly 52 71400 or 52.1775 weeks (unlike the julian year of 365.25 days or 52 528 52.1786 weeks which cannot be represented by a finite decimal expansion) there are exactly 20,871 weeks in 400 gregorian years so 30 april 1611 was a saturday just like 30 april 2011 a system of dominical letters has been used to determine the day of week in the gregorian or the julian calendar
relative to the path of the moon a week is 23.659% of an average lunation or 94.637% of an average quarter lunation in antiquity days were measured either from sunset to sunset or from sunrise to sunrise so that the length of the week (and the day) would be subject to slight variations depending on the time of year and the observer's geographical latitude
adding one to the remainder after dividing by seven a date's julian day number (jd modulo 7 + 1) yields that date's iso 8601 day of the week
for example the julian day number of 7 december 2015 is 2457363 calculating (2457363 mod 7 + 1) yields 7 corresponding to monday
== name ==
the english word week comes from the old english wice ultimately from a common germanic *wikn- from a root *wik- turn move change the germanic word probably had a wider meaning prior to the adoption of the roman calendar perhaps succession series as suggested by gothic wik translating taxis order in luke 1:8
the seven-day week is named in many languages by a word derived from seven such as the latin septimana and its derivatives in romance languages in english there is the archaic term sennight (also sennight or se'night) an abbreviation of seven-night (comparable in structure to the word fortnight") still in use in the early 19th century to judge from jane austen's letters
== days of the week ==
the days of the week were originally named for the classical planets this naming system persisted alongside an ecclesiastical tradition of numbering the days in ecclesiastical latin beginning with dominica (the day of the lord) as the first day the greco-roman gods associated with the classical planets were rendered in their interpretatio germanica at some point during the late roman empire yielding the germanic tradition of names based on indigenous deities
the ordering of the weekday names are not that of the classical order of the planets (sorted by distance in the planetary spheres model or equivalently by their apparent speed of movement in the night sky) instead the planetary hours systems resulted in succeeding days being named for planets that are three places apart in their traditional listing this characteristic was apparently discussed in plutarch in a treatise written in c ad 100 which is reported to have addressed the question of why are the days named after the planets reckoned in a different order from the actual order (the text of plutarch's treatise has been lost)
an ecclesiastical non-astrological system of numbering the days of the week was adopted in late antiquity this model also seems to have influenced (presumably via gothic) the designation of wednesday as mid-week in old high german (mittawehha) and old church slavonic () old church slavonic may also modelled the name of monday  after the latin feria secunda the ecclesiastical system became prevalent in eastern christianity but in the latin west it remains extant only in modern icelandic and galician-portuguese
== history ==
while the seven-day cycle may have deep historical origins in the ancient near east the planetary theory of horoscopy is a development of babylonian astrology roughly around 500 bc with the oldest extant horoscope dated to just before 400 bc
the seven-day week being approximately a quarter of a lunation has been proposed (e.g by friedrich delitzsch) as the implicit astronomical origin of the seven-day week and indeed the babylonian calendar used intercalary days to synchronize the last week of a month with the new moon
the seven-day week seems to have been adopted (independently) by the persian empire in judaism and in hellenistic astrology and (via greek transmission) in gupta india and tang china the babylonian system was received by the greeks in the 4th century bc (notably via eudoxus of cnidus) but the designation of the seven days of the week to the seven planets does not seem to have any babylonian precedent and is rather an original innovation of hellenistic astrology probably first conceived in the 2nd century bc it was widely known throughout the roman empire by the 1st century ad and ultimately replaced the older roman system of the nundinal cycle during the 4th century
=== ancient near east ===
the earliest evidence of an astrological significance of a seven-day period is connected to gudea priest-king of lagash in sumer during the gutian dynasty who built a seven-room temple which he dedicated with a seven-day festival in the flood story of the assyro-babylonian epic of gilgamesh the storm lasts for seven days the dove is sent out after seven days and the noah-like character of utnapishtim leaves the ark seven days after it reaches firm ground
it seems likely that the hebrew seven-day week is based on the babylonian tradition although going through certain adaptations george aaron barton speculated that the seven-day creation account of genesis is connected to the babylonian creation epic enuma elish which is recorded on seven tablets
babylonians celebrated a holy day every seven days starting from the new moon then the first visible crescent of the moon but adjusted the number of days of the final week in each month so that months would continue to commence on the new moon
counting from the new moon the babylonians celebrated the 7th 14th 21st and 28th as holy-days also called evil days (meaning unsuitable for prohibited activities) on these days officials were prohibited from various activities and common men were forbidden to make a wish and at least the 28th was known as a rest-day on each of them offerings were made to a different god and goddess
in a frequently-quoted suggestion going back to the early 20th century the hebrew sabbath is compared to the sumerian sa-bat mid-rest a term for the full moon the sumerian term has been reconstructed as rendered sapattum or sabattum in babylonian possibly present in the lost fifth tablet of the enma eli tentatively reconstructed [sa]bbath shalt thou then encounter mid[month]ly
=== achaemenid period ===
the zoroastrian calendar follows the babylonian in relating the seventh and other days of the month to ahura mazda the forerunner of all modern zoroastrian calendars is the system used to reckon dates in the persian empire adopted from the babylonian calendar by the 4th century bc
frank c senn in his book christian liturgy catholic and evangelical points to data suggesting evidence of an early continuous use of a seven-day week referring to the jews during the babylonian captivity in the 6th century bc after the destruction of the temple of solomon while the seven-day week in judaism is tied to creation account in the book of genesis in the hebrew bible (where god creates the heavens and the earth in six days and rests on the seventh genesis 1:1-2:3 in the book of exodus the fourth of the ten commandments is to rest on the seventh day shabbat which can be seen as implying a socially instituted seven-day week) it is not clear whether the genesis narrative predates the babylonian captivity of the jews in the 6th century bc at least since the second temple period under persian rule judaism relied on the seven-day cycle of recurring sabbaths
tablets from the achaemenid period indicate that the lunation of 29 or 30 days basically contained three seven-day weeks and a final week of eight or nine days inclusive breaking the continuous seven-day cycle the babylonians additionally celebrated the 19th as a special evil day the day of anger because it was roughly the 49th day of the (preceding) month completing a week of weeks also with sacrifices and prohibitions
difficulties with friedrich delitzsch's origin theory connecting hebrew shabbat with the babylonian lunar cycle include reconciling the differences between an unbroken week and a lunar week and explaining the absence of texts naming the lunar week as shabbat in any language
=== hellenistic and roman era ===
in jewish sources by the time of the septuagint the term sabbath (greek sabbaton) by synecdoche also came to refer to an entire seven-day week the interval between two weekly sabbaths jesus's parable of the pharisee and the publican (luke 18:12) describes the pharisee as fasting twice in the week (greek dis tou sabbatou)
the ancient romans traditionally used the eight-day nundinal cycle but after the julian calendar had come into effect in 45 bc the seven-day week came into use for a while the week and the nundinal cycle coexisted but by the time the week was officially adopted by constantine in ad 321 the nundinal cycle had fallen out of use the association of the days of the week with the sun the moon and the five planets visible to the naked eye dates to the roman era (2nd century)
the continuous seven-day cycle of the days of the week can be traced back to the reign of augustus the first identifiable date cited complete with day of the week is 6 february 60 identified as a sunday (as viii idus februarius dies solis eighth day before the ides of february day of the sun") in a pompeiian graffito according to the currently-used julian calendar 6 february 60 was however a wednesday this is explained by the existence of two conventions of naming days of the weeks based on the planetary hours system 6 february was a sunday based on the sunset naming convention and a wednesday based on the sunrise naming convention
=== adoption in asia ===
the earliest known reference in chinese writings to a seven-day week is attributed to fan ning who lived in the late 4th century in the jin dynasty while diffusions from the manichaeans are documented with the writings of the chinese buddhist monk yi jing and the ceylonese or central asian buddhist monk bu kong of the 7th century (tang dynasty)
the chinese variant of the planetary system was soon brought to japan by the japanese monk kobo daishi surviving diaries of the japanese statesman fujiwara michinaga show the seven-day system in use in heian japan as early as 1007 in japan the seven-day system was kept in use for astrological purposes until its promotion to a full-fledged western-style calendrical basis during the meiji era
the seven-day week was known in india by the 6th century referenced in the pacasiddhntik shashi (2000) mentions the garga samhita which he places in the 1st century bc or ad as a possible earlier reference to a seven-day week in india he concludes the above references furnish a terminus ad quem (viz 1st century) the terminus a quo cannot be stated with certainty
=== christian europe ===
the seven-day weekly cycle has remained unbroken in europe for almost two millennia despite changes to the alexandrian julian and gregorian calendars demonstrated by the date of easter sunday having been traced back through numerous computistic tables to an ethiopic copy of an early alexandrian table beginning with the easter of ad 311
the roman context of the spread of christianity meant that rome contributed a lot to the structure and calendar of the new faith.
a tradition of divinations arranged for the days of the week on which certain feast days occur develops in the early medieval period there are many later variants of this including the german bauern-praktik and the versions of erra pater published in 16th to 17th century england mocked in samuel butler's hudibras south and east slavic versions are known as koliadniki (from koliada a loan of latin calendae) with bulgarian copies dating from the 13th century and serbian versions from the 14th century medieval christian traditions associated with the lucky or unlucky nature of certain days of the week survived into the modern period this concerns primarily friday associated with the crucifixion of jesus sunday sometimes personified as saint anastasia was itself an object of worship in russia a practice denounced in a sermon extant in copies going back to the 14th century
sunday in the ecclesiastical numbering system also counted as the feria prima or the first day of the week yet at the same time figures as the eighth day and has occasionally been so called in christian liturgy
justin martyr wrote the first day after the sabbath remaining the first of all the days is called however the eighth according to the number of all the days of the cycle and [yet] remains the first
a period of eight days starting and ending on a sunday is called an octave particularly in roman catholic liturgy in german the phrase in acht tage (literally in eight days") means one week from today
== week numbering ==
weeks in a gregorian calendar year can be numbered for each year this style of numbering is commonly used (for example by schools and businesses) in some european and asian countries but rare elsewhere
iso 8601 includes the iso week date system a numbering system for weeks each week begins on a monday and is associated with the year that contains that week's thursday (so that if a year starts in a long weekend fridaysunday week number one of the year will start after that) for example week 1 of 2004 (2004w01) ran from monday 29 december 2003 to sunday 4 january 2004 because its thursday was 1 january 2004 whereas week 1 of 2005 (2005w01) ran from monday 3 january 2005 to sunday 9 january 2005 because its thursday was 6 january 2005 and so the first thursday of 2005 the highest week number in a year is either 52 or 53 (it was 53 in the year 2004) schematically this iso convention translates as follows
in some countries though the numbering system is different from the iso standard at least six numberings are in use
the semiconductor package date code is often a 4 digit date code yyww where the first two digits yy are the last 2 digits of the calendar year and the last two digits ww are the two-digit week number
the tire date code mandated by the us dot is a 4 digit date code wwyy with two digits of the week number ww followed by the last two digits of the calendar year yy
== weeks in other calendars ==
the term week is sometimes expanded to refer to other time units comprising a few days such weeks of between four and ten days have been used historically in various places intervals longer than 10 days are not usually termed weeks as they are closer in length to the fortnight or the month than to the seven-day week
=== pre-modern calendars ===
calendars unrelated to the chaldean hellenistic christian or jewish traditions often have time cycles between the day and the month of varying lengths sometimes also called weeks
an eight-day week was used in ancient rome and possibly in the pre-christian celtic calendar traces of a nine-day week are found in baltic languages and in welsh the ancient chinese calendar had a ten-day week as did the ancient egyptian calendar (and incidentally the french republican calendar dividing its 30-days months into thirds)
a six-day week is found in the akan calendar several cultures used a five-day week including the 10th century icelandic calendar the javanese calendar and the traditional cycle of market days in korea the igbo have a market week of four days evidence of a three-day week has been derived from the names of the days of the week in guipuscoan basque
the aztecs divided a ritual cycle of 260 days known as tonalpohualli into 20 weeks of 13 days known as trecena they also divided the solar year into 18 periods of 20 days and five nameless days known as nemontemi creating a 20-day month divided into four five-day weeks the maya divided a 260-day ritual cycle known tzolk'in into 20 weeks of 13 days known as trecena the maya also divided the year haab into 18 periods of 20 days uinal and five nameless days known as wayeb
the balinese pawukon is a 210-day calendar consisting of 10 different concurrent weeks of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 days
=== modern calendar reforms ===
a 10-day week called dcade was used in france for nine and a half years from october 1793 to april 1802 furthermore the paris commune adopted the revolutionary calendar for 18 days in 1871
the international fixed calendar (also known as the eastman plan") fixed every date always on the same weekday this plan kept a 7-day week while defining a year of 13 months with 28 days each it was the official calendar of the eastman kodak company for decades
between 1929 and 1931 the ussr changed from the seven-day week to a five-day week there were 72 weeks and an additional five national holidays inserted within three of them totaling a year of 365 days in 1931 after its brief experiment with a five-day week the soviet union changed to a six-day week every sixth day (6th 12th 18th 24th and 30th) of the gregorian calendar was a state rest day the five additional national holidays in the earlier five-day week remained and did not fall on the state rest day but as january march may july august october and december have 31 days the week after the state rest day of the 30th was seven days long (31st7th) this extra day was a working day for most or an extra holiday for others also as february is only 28 or 29 days depending on whether it is a leap year or not the first of march was also made a state rest day although not every enterprise conformed to this to clarify the week after the state rest day 24/25 february to 1 march was only five or six days long depending on whether it was a leap year or not the week after that 2 to 6 march was only five days long the calendar was abandoned 26 june 1940 and the seven-day week reintroduced the next day
