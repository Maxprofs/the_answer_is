certainty is perfect knowledge that has total security from error or the mental state of being without doubt
objectively defined certainty is total continuity and validity of all foundational inquiry to the highest degree of precision something is certain only if no skepticism can occur philosophy (at least historical cartesian philosophy) seeks this state
it is widely held that certainty about the real world is a failed historical enterprise (that is beyond deductive truths tautology etc.) this is in large part due to the power of david hume's problem of induction physicist carlo rovelli adds that certainty in real life is useless or often damaging (the idea is that total security from error is impossible in practice and a complete lack of doubt is undesirable)
== history ==
=== pyrrho ancient greece ===
pyrrho is credited as being the first skeptic philosopher the main principle of pyrrho's thought is expressed by the word acatalepsia which denotes the ability to withhold assent from doctrines regarding the truth of things in their own nature against every statement its contradiction may be advanced with equal justification secondly it is necessary in view of this fact to preserve an attitude of intellectual suspense or as timon expressed it no assertion can be known to be better than another
=== al-ghazali islamic theologian ===
al-ghazali was a professor of philosophy in the 11th century his book titled the incoherence of the philosophers marks a major turn in islamic epistemology as ghazali effectively discovered philosophical skepticism that would not be commonly seen in the west until averroes ren descartes george berkeley and david hume he described the necessity of proving the validity of reasonindependently from reason he attempted this and failed the doubt that he introduced to his foundation of knowledge could not be reconciled using philosophy taking this very seriously he resigned from his post at the university and suffered serious psychosomatic illness it was not until he became a religious sufi that he found a solution to his philosophical problems which are based on islamic religion this encounter with skepticism led ghazali to embrace a form of theological occasionalism or the belief that all causal events and interactions are not the product of material conjunctions but rather the immediate and present will of god
=== ibn-rushd - averroes ===
latinized name averros
averroes was a defender of aristotelian philosophy against ash'ari theologians led by al-ghazali averroes philosophy was considered controversial in muslim circles averroes had a greater impact on western european circles and he has been described as the founding father of secular thought in western europe
=== descartes 17th century ===
descartes meditations on first philosophy is a book in which descartes first discards all belief in things which are not absolutely certain and then tries to establish what can be known for sure although the phrase cogito ergo sum is often attributed to descartes meditations on first philosophy it is actually put forward in his discourse on method due to the implications of inferring the conclusion within the predicate however he changed the argument to i think i exist this then became his first certainty
=== ludwig wittgenstein 20th century ===
on certainty is a series of notes made by ludwig wittgenstein just prior to his death the main theme of the work is that context plays a role in epistemology wittgenstein asserts an anti-foundationalist message throughout the work that every claim can be doubted but certainty is possible in a framework the function [propositions] serve in language is to serve as a kind of framework within which empirical propositions can make sense
== degrees of certainty ==
physicist lawrence m krauss suggests that identifying degrees of certainty is under-appreciated in various domains including policy making and the understanding of science this is because different goals require different degrees of certaintyand politicians are not always aware of (or do not make it clear) how much certainty we are working with
rudolf carnap viewed certainty as a matter of degree (degrees of certainty) which could be objectively measured with degree one being certainty bayesian analysis derives degrees of certainty which are interpreted as a measure of subjective psychological belief
alternatively one might use the legal degrees of certainty these standards of evidence ascend as follows no credible evidence some credible evidence a preponderance of evidence clear and convincing evidence beyond reasonable doubt and beyond any shadow of a doubt (i.e undoubtablerecognized as an impossible standard to meetwhich serves only to terminate the list)
== foundational crisis of mathematics ==
the foundational crisis of mathematics was the early 20th century's term for the search for proper foundations of mathematics
after several schools of the philosophy of mathematics ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be stated within mathematics itself began to be heavily challenged
one attempt after another to provide unassailable foundations for mathematics was found to suffer from various paradoxes (such as russell's paradox) and to be inconsistent
various schools of thought on the right approach to the foundations of mathematics were fiercely opposing each other the leading school was that of the formalist approach of which david hilbert was the foremost proponent culminating in what is known as hilbert's program which sought to ground mathematics on a small basis of a formal system proved sound by metamathematical finitistic means the main opponent was the intuitionist school led by l.e.j brouwer which resolutely discarded formalism as a meaningless game with symbols the fight was acrimonious in 1920 hilbert succeeded in having brouwer whom he considered a threat to mathematics removed from the editorial board of mathematische annalen the leading mathematical journal of the time
gdel's incompleteness theorems proved in 1931 showed that essential aspects of hilbert's program could not be attained in gdel's first result he showed how to construct for any sufficiently powerful and consistent finitely axiomatizable systemsuch as necessary to axiomatize the elementary theory of arithmetica statement that can be shown to be true but that does not follow from the rules of the system it thus became clear that the notion of mathematical truth can not be reduced to a purely formal system as envisaged in hilbert's program in a next result gdel showed that such a system was not powerful enough for proving its own consistency let alone that a simpler system could do the job this dealt a final blow to the heart of hilbert's program the hope that consistency could be established by finitistic means (it was never made clear exactly what axioms were the finitistic ones but whatever axiomatic system was being referred to it was a weaker system than the system whose consistency it was supposed to prove) meanwhile the intuitionistic school had failed to attract adherents among working mathematicians and floundered due to the difficulties of doing mathematics under the constraint of constructivism
in a sense the crisis has not been resolved but faded away most mathematicians either do not work from axiomatic systems or if they do do not doubt the consistency of zermelofraenkel set theory generally their preferred axiomatic system in most of mathematics as it is practiced the various logical paradoxes never played a role anyway and in those branches in which they do (such as logic and category theory) they may be avoided
== quotes ==
doubt is not a pleasant condition but certainty is absurd
in this world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes
there is no such thing as absolute certainty but there is assurance sufficient for the purposes of human life
if you tried to doubt everything you would not get as far as doubting anything the game of doubting itself presupposes certainty
