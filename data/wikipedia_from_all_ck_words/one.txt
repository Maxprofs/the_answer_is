1 (one /wn/ or uk /wn/ also called unit unity and (multiplicative) identity) is a number a numeral and the name of the glyph representing that number it represents a single entity the unit of counting or measurement for example a line segment of unit length is a line segment of length 1
== as a number ==
one sometimes referred to as unity is the integer before two and after zero one is the first non-zero number in the natural numbers as well as the first odd number in the natural numbers
any number multiplied by one is that number as one is the identity for multiplication as a result one is its own factorial its own square its own cube and so on one is also the result of the empty product as any number multiplied by one is itself it is also the only natural number that is neither composite nor prime with respect to division but instead considered a unit

the glyph used today in the western world to represent the number 1 a vertical line often with a serif at the top and sometimes a short horizontal line at the bottom traces its roots back to the indians who wrote 1 as a horizontal line much like the chinese character  the gupta wrote it as a curved line and the nagari sometimes added a small circle on the left (rotated a quarter turn to the right this 9-look-alike became the present day numeral 1 in the gujarati and punjabi scripts) the nepali also rotated it to the right but kept the circle small this eventually became the top serif in the modern numeral but the occasional short horizontal line at the bottom probably originates from similarity with the roman numeral  in some countries the little serif at the top is sometimes extended into a long upstroke sometimes as long as the vertical line which can lead to confusion with the glyph for seven in other countries where the 1 is written with a long upstroke the number 7 has a horizontal stroke through the vertical line
while the shape of the 1 character has an ascender in most modern typefaces in typefaces with text figures the character usually is of x-height as for example in 
many older typewriters do not have a separate symbol for 1 and use the lowercase l instead it is possible to find cases when the uppercase j is used while it may be for decorative purposes
== mathematics ==
mathematically 1 is
in arithmetic (algebra) and calculus the natural number that follows 0 and precedes 2 and the multiplicative identity element of the integers real numbers and complex numbers
more generally in algebra the multiplicative identity (also called unity) usually of a group or a ring
one cannot be used as the base of a positional numeral system (sometimes tallying is referred to as base 1 since only one mark the tally itself is needed but this is not a positional notation.)
since the base 1 exponential function (1x) always equals 1 its inverse does not exist (which would be called the logarithm base 1 if it did exist)
there are two ways to write the real number 1 as a recurring decimal as 1.000... and as 0.999 (q.v.) there is only one way to represent the real number 1 as a dedekind cut 
formalizations of the natural numbers have their own representations of 1
in the peano axioms 1 is the successor of 0
in principia mathematica 1 is defined as the set of all singletons (sets with one element)
in the von neumann cardinal assignment of natural numbers 1 is defined as the set {0}
in a multiplicative group or monoid the identity element is sometimes denoted 1 especially in abelian groups but e (from the german einheit unity") is more traditional however 1 is especially common for the multiplicative identity of a ring i.e. when an addition and 0 are also present when such a ring has characteristic n not equal to 0 the element called 1 has the property that n1 = 1n = 0 (where this 0 is the additive identity of the ring) important examples are general fields
one is the first figurate number of every kind such as triangular number pentagonal number and centered hexagonal number to name just a few
in many mathematical and engineering equations numeric values are typically normalized to fall within the unit interval from 0 to 1 where 1 usually represents the maximum possible value in the range of parameters
because of the multiplicative identity if f(x) is a multiplicative function then f(1) must equal 1
it is also the first and second number in the fibonacci sequence (0 is the zeroth) and is the first number in many other mathematical sequences as a matter of convention sloane's early handbook of integer sequences added an initial 1 to any sequence that did not already have it and considered these initial 1's in its lexicographic ordering sloane's later encyclopedia of integer sequences and its web counterpart the on-line encyclopedia of integer sequences ignore initial ones in their lexicographic ordering of sequences because such initial ones often correspond to trivial cases
one is neither a prime number nor a composite number but a unit like 1 and in the gaussian integers i and i the fundamental theorem of arithmetic guarantees unique factorization over the integers only up to units (for example 4 = 22 but if units are included is also equal to say (1)612322 among infinitely many similar factorizations".)
the definition of a field requires that 1 must not be equal to 0 thus there are no fields of characteristic 1 nevertheless abstract algebra can consider the field with one element which is not a singleton and is not a set at all
one is the only positive integer divisible by exactly one positive integer (whereas prime numbers are divisible by exactly two positive integers composite numbers are divisible by more than two positive integers and zero is divisible by all positive integers) one was formerly considered prime by some mathematicians using the definition that a prime is divisible only by one and itself however this complicates the fundamental theorem of arithmetic so modern definitions exclude units
one is one of three possible values of the mbius function it takes the value one for square-free integers with an even number of distinct prime factors
one is the only odd number in the range of euler's totient function (x) in the cases x = 1 and x = 2
one is the only 1-perfect number (see multiply perfect number)
by definition 1 is the magnitude absolute value or norm of a unit complex number unit vector and a unit matrix (more usually called an identity matrix) note that the term unit matrix is sometimes used to mean something quite different
by definition 1 is the probability of an event that is almost certain to occur
one is the most common leading digit in many sets of data a consequence of benford's law
the ancient egyptians represented all fractions (with the exception of 2/3) in terms of sums of fractions with numerator 1 and distinct denominators for example  such representations are popularly known as egyptian fractions or unit fractions

in the philosophy of plotinus and a number of other neoplatonists the one is the ultimate reality and source of all existence philo of alexandria (20 bc ad 50) regarded the number one as god's number and the basis for all numbers ("de allegoriis legum, ii.12 [i.66])

1 is the lowest number permitted for use by players of the national hockey league (nhl) as the league has banned 00 and 0 (the highest number permitted is 98.)
many sports use 1 as their standard scoring incrementexamples include goals in a large number of sports runs in baseball and cricket and points in volleyball examples where 1 is a non-standard increment or used for one of several possible classes of scores are listed below by sport
in australian rules football 1 point is awarded to the attacking team for a behind scored when
the ball is kicked by the attacking team and passes between a goal post (taller post) and the nearest behind post (shorter post) on the defensive side of the field without touching the behind post
the ball passes between the defending team's goal posts but either (1) was not kicked by the attacking team or (2) hit a goal post
the defending team deliberately forces the ball between any two of its own posts this particular score is officially called a rushed behind
in baseball scoring the number 1 is assigned to the pitcher
in basketball
1 point is awarded for a successful free throw
in the 33 variant of the game shots made from inside the three-point arc are also worth 1 point (shots from outside the arc are worth 2 points.)
the number 1 is used to designate the point guard position
in association football (soccer) the number 1 is often given to the goalkeeper
in gaelic football hurling and camogie a point with a scoring value of 1 is awarded when the attacking team legally sends the ball over the opponent's crossbar (above the goal)
in gridiron football codes one point is awarded under the following circumstances
in almost all leagues for a successful place kick after a touchdown in american football the score is formally known as a try although the terms extra point conversion pat (for point after touchdown") and point after are far more commonly used in canadian football the score is formally and popularly called a convert conversions can also be scored by the now rare drop kick in standard american and canadian football such a conversion is worth 1 point while most forms of indoor football including the arena football league award 2 points for a drop-kicked conversion
in college football if a point after try is blocked if the blocked ball stayed in the field of play a defender may pick up and run the ball to his end zone at the other end of the field for a one-point safety
in six-man football one point is awarded for a successful conversion from scrimmage after a touchdown note that in standard 11-man (american) or 12-man (canadian) football place kicks are worth 1 point and conversions from scrimmage worth 2 this is reversed in six-man because the reduced number of players makes kicked conversions much more difficult
in canadian football only a single or rouge is awarded when the ball is legally kicked into the opponent's end zone (except for a successful field goal) and the receiving team does not return or kick the ball out of its end zone (in american football the same play would result in a touchback and no points.)
some forms of indoor football in the u.s award a single similar to the canadian score on kickoffs only
in rugby league
a drop goal is worth 1 point
in most competitions (though not the european super league which uses static squad numbering) the starting fullback wears jersey number 1
in rugby union
the starting loosehead prop wears the jersey number 1
in the early years of the sport (prior to 1890) conversions penalties drop goals and goals from mark were all worth 1 point at that time a try was worth no points only giving the attacking team the right to attempt a conversion in 189091 tries were rewarded with 1 point while all other scores were increased in value after that time all scores have been worth at least 2 points (the goal from mark was abolished in 1977)
the jersey number 1 has been retired by several north american sports teams in honor of past playing greats or other key figures (or in one case a team's fans)
