lewis structures also known lewis dot diagrams electron dot diagrams lewis dot formulas lewis dot structures electron dot structures diagrams show bonding atoms molecule lone pairs electrons may exist molecule lewis structure drawn covalently bonded molecule well coordination compounds lewis structure named gilbert n lewis introduced article atom molecule similar electron dot diagrams valence electrons lone pairs represented dots also contain lines represent shared pairs chemical bond single double triple etc
lewis structures show atom position structure molecule using chemical symbol lines drawn atoms bonded one another pairs dots used instead lines excess electrons form lone pairs represented pairs dots placed next atoms
although main group elements second period beyond usually react gaining losing sharing electrons achieved valence shell electron configuration full octet electrons elements obey different rules hydrogen h form bonds share two electrons transition metals often conform duodectet rule eg compounds permanganate ion
construction
counting electrons
total number electrons represented lewis structure equal sum numbers valence electrons individual atom nonvalence electrons represented lewis structures
total number available electrons determined electrons must placed structure placed initially lone pairs one pair dots pair electrons available lone pairs initially placed outer atoms hydrogen outer atom eight electrons bonding pairs lone pairs extra lone pairs may placed central atom doubt lone pairs placed electronegative atoms first
lone pairs placed atomsespecially central atomsmay octet electrons case atoms must form double bond lone pair electrons moved form second bond two atoms bonding pair shared two atoms atom originally lone pair still octet atom two electrons valence shell
lewis structures polyatomic ions may drawn method counting electrons negative ions extra electrons placed lewis structures positive ions fewer electrons uncharged molecule
lewis structure ion written entire structure placed brackets charge written superscript upper right outside brackets
simpler method proposed constructing lewis structures eliminating need electron counting atoms drawn showing valence electrons bonds formed pairing valence electrons atoms involved bondmaking process anions cations formed adding removing electrons tofrom appropriate atoms
trick count valence electrons count number electrons needed complete octet rule hydrogen electrons take difference two numbers answer number electrons make bonds rest electrons go fill atoms octets
another simple general procedure write lewis structures resonance forms proposed
formal charge
terms lewis structures formal charge used description comparison assessment likely topological resonance structures determining apparent electronic charge atom within based upon electron dot structure assuming exclusive covalency nonpolar bonding uses determining possible electron reconfiguration referring reaction mechanisms often results sign partial charge atom exceptions general formal charge atom calculated using following formula assuming nonstandard definitions markup used
formal charge
represents number valence electrons free atom element
represents number unshared electrons atom
represents total number electrons bonds atom another
formal charge atom computed difference number valence electrons neutral atom would number electrons belong lewis structure electrons covalent bonds split equally atoms involved bond total formal charges ion equal charge ion total formal charges neutral molecule equal zero
resonance
molecules ions difficult determine lone pairs moved form double triple bonds sometimes case multiple atoms type surround central atom especially common polyatomic ions
situation occurs molecules lewis structure said resonance structure molecule exists resonance hybrid different possibilities superimposed others molecule considered lewis structure equivalent average states
nitrate ion instance must form double bond nitrogen one oxygens satisfy octet rule nitrogen however molecule symmetrical matter oxygens forms double bond case three possible resonance structures expressing resonance drawing lewis structures may done either drawing possible resonance forms placing doubleheaded arrows using dashed lines represent partial bonds although latter good representation resonance hybrid formally speaking lewis structure
comparing resonance structures molecule usually fewest formal charges contribute overall resonance hybrid formal charges necessary resonance structures negative charges electronegative elements positive charges less electronegative elements favored
single bonds also moved way create resonance structures hypervalent molecules sulfur hexafluoride correct description according quantum chemical calculations instead common expanded octet model
resonance structure interpreted indicate molecule switches forms molecule acts average multiple forms
example
formula nitrite ion
nitrogen less electronegative atom two central atom multiple criteria
count valence electrons nitrogen valence electrons oxygen total ion charge indicates extra electron total number electrons
place lone pairs oxygen must bonded nitrogen uses four electronstwo bond remaining electrons initially placed lone pairs oxygen may take maximum lone pairs giving oxygen electrons including bonding pair seventh lone pair must placed nitrogen atom
satisfy octet rule oxygen atoms currently electrons assigned nitrogen atom electrons assigned one lone pairs oxygen atom must form double bond either atom work equally well therefore resonance structure
tie loose ends two lewis structures must drawn structure one two oxygen atoms doublebonded nitrogen atom second oxygen atom structure singlebonded nitrogen atom place brackets around structure add charge upper right outside brackets draw doubleheaded arrow two resonance forms
