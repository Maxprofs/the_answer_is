rhythm (from greek  rhythmos any regular recurring motion symmetry (liddell and scott 1996)) generally means a movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements or of opposite or different conditions (anon 1971 2537) this general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to millions of years
in the performance arts rhythm is the timing of events on a human scale of musical sounds and silences of the steps of a dance or the meter of spoken language and poetry rhythm may also refer to visual presentation as timed movement through space (jirousek 1995,) and a common language of pattern unites rhythm with geometry in recent years rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars recent work in these areas includes books by maury yeston (yeston 1976) fred lerdahl and ray jackendoff jonathan kramer christopher hasty (hasty 1997) godfried toussaint (toussaint 2005) william rothstein and joel lester (lester 1986)
in thinking and destiny harold w percival defined rhythm as the character and meaning of thought expressed through the measure or movement in sound or form or by written signs or words percival 1946 1006

in his television series how music works howard goodall presents theories that human rhythm recalls the regularity with which we walk and the heartbeat (goodall 2006,) other research suggests that it does not relate to the heartbeat directly but rather the speed of emotional affect which also influences heartbeat yet other researchers suggest that since certain features of human music are widespread it is reasonable to suspect that beat-based rhythmic processing has ancient evolutionary roots (patel 2014,) justin london writes that musical metre involves our initial perception as well as subsequent anticipation of a series of beats that we abstract from the rhythm surface of the music as it unfolds in time (london 2004 4) the perception and abstraction of rhythmic measure is the foundation of human instinctive musical participation as when we divide a series of identical clock-ticks into tick-tock-tick-tock (scholes 1977b scholes 1977c)
the establishment of a basic beat requires the perception of a regular sequence of distinct short-duration pulses and as subjective perception of loudness is relative to background noise levels a pulse must decay to silence before the next occurs if it is to be really distinct for this reason the fast-transient sounds of percussion instruments lend themselves to the definition of rhythm musical cultures that rely upon such instruments may develop multi-layered polyrhythm and simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature called polymeter such are the cross-rhythms of sub-saharan africa and the interlocking kotekan rhythms of the gamelan

== terminology ==
=== pulse beat and measure ===
(see main articles pulse (music) beat (music))
most music dance and oral poetry establishes and maintains an underlying metric level a basic unit of time that may be audible or implied the pulse or tactus of the mensural level (berry 1976/1986 349 lerdahl and jackendoff 1983 fitch and rosenfeld 2007 44) or beat level sometimes simply called the beat this consists of a (repeating) series of identical yet distinct periodic short-duration stimuli perceived as points in time (winold 1975 213) the beat pulse is not necessarily the fastest or the slowest component of the rhythm but the one that is perceived as fundamental it has a tempo to which listeners entrain as they tap their foot or dance to a piece of music (handel 1989) it is currently most often designated as a crotchet or quarter note in western notation (see time signature) faster levels are division levels and slower levels are multiple levels (winold 1975 213) rhythms of recurrence arise from the interaction of two levels of motion the faster providing the pulse and the slower organizing the beats into repetitive groups (yeston 1976 5052) once a metric hierarchy has been established we as listeners will maintain that organization as long as minimal evidence is present (lester 1986 77)
=== unit and gesture ===
a durational pattern that synchronises with a pulse or pulses on the underlying metric level may be called a rhythmic unit these may be classified as metriceven patterns such as steady eighth notes or pulsesintrametricconfirming patterns such as dotted eighth-sixteenth note and swing patternscontrametricnon-confirming or syncopated patterns and extrametricirregular patterns such as tuplets
a rhythmic gesture is any durational pattern that in contrast to the rhythmic unit does not occupy a period of time equivalent to a pulse or pulses on an underlying metric level it may be described according to its beginning and ending or by the rhythmic units it contains beginnings on a strong pulse are thetic a weak pulse anacrustic and those beginning after a rest or tied-over note are called initial rest endings on a strong pulse are strong a weak pulse weak and those that end on a strong or weak upbeat are upbeat (winold 1975 239)
=== alternation and repetition ===
rhythm is marked by the regulated succession of opposite elements the dynamics of the strong and weak beat the played beat and the inaudible but implied rest beat the long and short note as well as perceiving rhythm we must be able to anticipate it this depends upon repetition of a pattern that is short enough to memorize
the alternation of the strong and weak beat is fundamental to the ancient language of poetry dance and music the common poetic term foot refers as in dance to the lifting and tapping of the foot in time in a similar way musicians speak of an upbeat and a downbeat and of the on and off beat these contrasts naturally facilitate a dual hierarchy of rhythm and depend upon repeating patterns of duration accent and rest forming a pulse-group that corresponds to the poetic foot normally such pulse-groups are defined by taking the most accented beat as the first and counting the pulses until the next accent (macpherson 1930 5 scholes 1977b) a rhythm that accents another beat and de-emphasises the down beat as established or assumed from the melody or from a preceding rhythm is called syncopated rhythm
normally even the most complex of meters may be broken down into a chain of duple and triple pulses (macpherson 1930 5 scholes 1977b) either by addition or division according to pierre boulez beat structures beyond four in western music are simply not natural (slatkin n.d. at 5:05)
=== tempo and duration ===
(see main articles duration (music) tempo)
the tempo of the piece is the speed or frequency of the tactus a measure of how quickly the beat flows this is often measured in beats per minute (bpm) 60 bpm means a speed of one beat per second a frequency of 1 hz a rhythmic unit is a durational pattern that has a period equivalent to a pulse or several pulses (winold 1975 237) the duration of any such unit is inversely related to its tempo
musical sound may be analyzed on five different time scales which moravscik has arranged in order of increasing duration (moravcsik 2001 114)
supershort a single cycle of an audible wave approximately 1/301/10,000 second (3010,000 hz or more than 1,800 bpm) these though rhythmic in nature are not perceived as separate events but as continuous musical pitch
short of the order of one second (1 hz 60bpm 10100,000 audio cycles) musical tempo is generally specified in the range 40 to 240 beats per minute a continuous pulse cannot be perceived as a musical beat if it is faster than 810 per second (810 hz 480600 bpm) or slower than 1 per 1.52 seconds (0.60.5 hz 4030 bpm) too fast a beat becomes a drone too slow a succession of sounds seems unconnected (fraisse 1956 woodrow 1951 both quoted in covaciu-pogorilowski n.d.) this time-frame roughly corresponds to the human heart rate and to the duration of a single step syllable or rhythmic gesture
medium few seconds this median durational level defines rhythm in music (moravcsik 2001 114) as it allows the definition of a rhythmic unit the arrangement of an entire sequence of accented unaccented and silent or rest pulses into the cells of a measure that may give rise to the briefest intelligible and self-existent musical unit (scholes 1977c) a motif or figure this may be further organized by repetition and variation into a definite phrase that may characterise an entire genre of music dance or poetry and that may be regarded as the fundamental formal unit of music (macpherson 1930,)
long many seconds or a minute corresponding to a durational unit that consists of musical phrases (moravcsik 2001 114)which may make up a melody a formal section a poetic stanza or a characteristic sequence of dance moves and steps thus the temporal regularity of musical organisation includes the most elementary levels of musical form (macpherson 1930 3)
very long minutes or many hours musical compositions or subdivisions of compositions
curtis roads (roads 2001) takes a wider view by distinguishing nine time scales this time in order of decreasing duration the first two the infinite and the supramusical encompass natural periodicities of months years decades centuries and greater while the last three the sample and subsample which take account of digital and electronic rates too brief to be properly recorded or perceived measured in millionths of seconds (microseconds) and finally the infinitesimal or infinitely brief are again in the extra-musical domain roads macro level encompassing overall musical architecture or form roughly corresponds to moravcsik's very long division while his meso level the level of divisions of form including movements sections phrases taking seconds or minutes is likewise similar to moravcsik's long category roads sound object (schaeffer 1959 schaeffer 1977) a basic unit of musical structure and a generalization of note (xenakis ministructural time scale) fraction of a second to several seconds and his microsound (see granular synthesis) down to the threshold of audible perception thousands to millionths of seconds are similarly comparable to moravcsik's short and supershort levels of duration
=== metric structure ===
(see main articles metre (music) bar (music) metre (poetry))
the study of rhythm stress and pitch in speech is called prosody it is a topic in linguistics and poetics where it means the number of lines in a verse the number of syllables in each line and the arrangement of those syllables as long or short accented or unaccented music inherited the term meter or metre from the terminology of poetry (scholes 1977b scholes 1977c latham 2002)
the metric structure of music includes meter tempo and all other rhythmic aspects that produce temporal regularity against which the foreground details or durational patterns of the music are projected (winold 1975,) the terminology of western music is notoriously imprecise in this area (scholes 1977b) macpherson 1930 3 preferred to speak of time and rhythmic shape imogen holst (holst 1963 17) of measured rhythm
dance music has instantly recognizable patterns of beats built upon a characteristic tempo and measure the imperial society of teachers of dancing defines the tango for example as to be danced in 2/4 time at approximately 66 beats per minute the basic slow step forwards or backwards lasting for one beat is called a slow so that a full right-left step is equal to one 2/4 measure (imperial society of teachers of dancing 1977,)
the general classifications of metrical rhythm measured rhythm and free rhythm may be distinguished (cooper 1973 30) metrical or divisive rhythm by far the most common in western music calculates each time value as a multiple or fraction of the beat normal accents re-occur regularly providing systematical grouping (measures) measured rhythm (additive rhythm) also calculates each time value as a multiple or fraction of a specified time unit but the accents do not recur regularly within the cycle free rhythm is where there is neither (cooper 1973 30) such as in christian chant which has a basic pulse but a freer rhythm like the rhythm of prose compared to that of verse (scholes 1977c) see free time (music)
finally some music such as some graphically scored works since the 1950s and non-european music such as honkyoku repertoire for shakuhachi may be considered ametric (karpinski 2000 19) senza misura is an italian musical term for without meter meaning to play without a beat using time to measure how long it will take to play the bar (forney and machlis 2007)
== composite rhythm ==
a composite rhythm is the durations and patterns (rhythm) produced by amalgamating all sounding parts of a musical texture in music of the common practice period the composite rhythm usually confirms the meter often in metric or even-note patterns identical to the pulse on a specific metric level white defines composite rhythm as the resultant overall rhythmic articulation among all the voices of a contrapuntal texture (white 1976 136.)
== rhythm notation ==
worldwide there are many different approaches to passing on rhythmic phrases and patterns as they exist in traditional music from generation to generation
=== african music ===
in the griot tradition of africa everything related to music has been passed on orally babatunde olatunji (19272003) a nigerian drummer who lived and worked in the united states developed a simple series of spoken sounds for teaching the rhythms of the hand drum he used six vocal sounds goon doon go do pa ta there are three basic sounds on the drum but each can be played with either the left or the right hand this simple system is now used worldwide particularly by djembe players
it is noteworthy that the debate about the appropriateness of staff notation for african music is a subject of particular interest to outsiders not insiders african scholars from kyagambiddwa to kongo have for the most part accepted the conventionsand limitationsof staff notation and gone on to produce transcriptions in order to inform and make possible a higher level of discussion and debate (agawu 2003 52)
john miller chernoff 1979 has argued that west african music is based on tension between rhythms this tension between rhythms is called polyrhythms and is created by the simultaneous sounding of two or more different rhythms often there is a dominant rhythm interacting with an independent competing rhythm or rhythms these often oppose or complement each other and combine freely with the dominant rhythm creating a rich rhythmic texture not limited to any one set meter or tempo
a set of moral values underpins a full musical system based on repetition of relatively simple patterns that meet at distant cross-rhythmic intervals and call and answer schemes values also show up in collective utterances such as proverbs or lineages appear either in phrases that translate as drum talk or in the words of songs people expect musicians to stimulate participation of all present notably by reacting to people dancing the music appreciation of musicians is related to the effectiveness of their upholding community values (chernoff 1979)
=== indian music ===
indian music has also been passed on orally tabla players would learn to speak complex rhythm patterns and phrases before attempting to play them sheila chandra an english pop singer of indian descent made performances based on her singing these patterns in indian classical music the tala of a composition is the rhythmic pattern over which the whole piece is structured
=== western music ===
in the 20th century composers like igor stravinsky bla bartk philip glass and steve reich wrote more rhythmically complex music using odd meters and techniques such as phasing and additive rhythm at the same time modernists such as olivier messiaen and his pupils used increased complexity to disrupt the sense of a regular beat leading eventually to the widespread use of irrational rhythms in new complexity this use may be explained by a comment of john cage's where he notes that regular rhythms cause sounds to be heard as a group rather than individually the irregular rhythms highlight the rapidly changing pitch relationships that would otherwise be subsumed into irrelevant rhythmic groupings (sandow 2004 257) lamonte young also wrote music in which the sense of a regular beat is absent because the music consists only of long sustained tones (drones) in the 1930s henry cowell wrote music involving multiple simultaneous periodic rhythms and collaborated with lon thrmin to invent the rhythmicon the first electronic rhythm machine in order to perform them similarly conlon nancarrow wrote for the player piano
use of polyrhythms in american music is generally traced to the influence of black culture through dixieland and jazz styles the effect of multiple soloing in these forms often utilizing cross-rhythms comes directly from the underlying aesthetics of sub-saharan african music these complex rhythmic structures have been widely adopted in many current forms of western popular music
== linguistics ==
in linguistics rhythm or isochrony is one of the three aspects of prosody along with stress and intonation languages can be categorized according to whether they are syllable-timed mora-timed or stress-timed speakers of syllable-timed languages such as spanish and cantonese put roughly equal time on each syllable in contrast speakers of stressed-timed languages such as english and mandarin chinese put roughly equal time lags between stressed syllables with the timing of the unstressed syllables in between them being adjusted to accommodate the stress timing
narmour 1977 (cited in winold1975,) describes three categories of prosodic rules that create rhythmic successions that are additive (same duration repeated) cumulative (short-long) or countercumulative (long-short) cumulation is associated with closure or relaxation countercumulation with openness or tension while additive rhythms are open-ended and repetitive richard middleton points out this method cannot account for syncopation and suggests the concept of transformation (middleton 1990,)
