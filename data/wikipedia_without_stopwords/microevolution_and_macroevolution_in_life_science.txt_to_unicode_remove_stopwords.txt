macroevolution evolution scale separated gene pools macroevolutionary studies focus change occurs level species contrast microevolution refers smaller evolutionary changes typically described changes allele frequencies within species population macroevolution microevolution describe fundamentally identical processes different time scales
process speciation may fall within purview either depending forces thought drive paleontology evolutionary developmental biology comparative genomics genomic phylostratigraphy contribute evidence patterns processes classified macroevolution example macroevolution appearance feathers evolution birds theropod dinosaurs viewed distance future although arose developing changes would deemed microevolution
evolutionary course equidae wide family including horses related animals often viewed typical example macroevolution broad viewpoint notable accumulation previously microevolutionary changes earliest known genus hyracotherium reclassified palaeothere browsing herbivore animal resembling dog lived early cenozoic preferred evolutionary explanation habitat transformed open arid grassland reconstruct pollen seed records selective pressure acted animal become fast grazer recorded dentition changes etc thus elongation legs head well reduction toes gradually occurred producing extant genus equidae equus
origin term
russian entomologist yuri filipchenko first coined terms macroevolution microevolution german language work variabilitt und variation since inception two terms meanings revised several times term macroevolution fell limited disfavour taken writers geneticist richard goldschmidt paleontologist otto schindewolf describe orthogenetic theories
practical definition term describes changes occurring geological time scales contrast microevolution occurs timescale human lifetimes definition reflects spectrum micro macroevolution whilst leaving clear difference terms geological record rarely resolution better years humans rarely live longer years mesoevolution never observed
evolutionary biologists theodosius dobzhansky bernhard rensch ernst mayr use term many neodarwinian preferring instead talk evolution changes allele frequencies without mention level changes species level use term common continental european traditions dobzhansky mayr rensch goldschmidt schindewolf less common angloamerican tradition john maynard smith richard dawkins hence use term macroevolution sometimes wrongly used litmus test whether writer properly neodarwinian
macroevolution modern evolutionary synthesis
within modern evolutionary synthesis school thought macroevolution thought compounded effects microevolution thus distinction micro macroevolution fundamental one difference time scale ernst w mayr observes transspecific evolution nothing extrapolation magnification events take place within populations speciesit misleading make distinction causes micro macroevolution however time necessary distinguishing factor macroevolution happen without gradual compounding small changes wholegenome duplication result speciation occurring single generation especially common plants
changes genes regulating development also proposed important producing speciation large relatively sudden changes animals morphology
types macroevolution
many ways view macroevolution example observing changes genetics morphology taxonomy ecology behavior organisms evidence elements macroevolution closely tied viewing evolution one perspective must also considered context others sahney et al stated connection taxonomic diversity increased incentives tetrapods move new modes life initially resources may seem unlimited competitors possible refuge danger ecological diversity increases taxa diversify ancestors much greater rate among faunas superior innovative flexible adaptations
molecular evolution occurs small changes molecular cellular level long period time cause big effects genetics organisms
taxonomic evolution occurs small changes populations species long period time cause big effects taxonomy organisms growth whole new clades species level
morphological evolution occurs small changes morphology organism long period time cause big effects morphology major clades clearly seen cetacea throughout early evolution cetacea hindlimbs still present however millions years hindlimbs regressed became internal
ecological evolution occurs small changes ecological roles organisms occupy long period time cause big effects ecological landscape example occupation niche

misuse
term macroevolution frequently arises within context evolutioncreation debate usually used creationists alleging significant difference evolutionary changes observed field laboratory studies larger scale macroevolutionary changes scientists believe taken thousands millions years occur accept evolutionary change possible within call kinds microevolution deny one kind evolve another macroevolution claim maintained vagueness undefined unscientific term kind evolution life forms beyond species level ie macroevolution scientific definition observed multiple times controlled laboratory conditions nature creation science creationists accepted speciation occurring within created kind baramin objected called third levelmacroevolution new genus higher rank taxonomy generally ambiguity draw line species created kinds etc events lineages fall within rubric microevolution macroevolution claim macroevolution occur impossible supported scientific community
claims rejected scientific community basis ample evidence macroevolution active process presently past terms macroevolution microevolution relate processes operating different scales creationist claims misuse terms vaguely defined way accurately reflect scientific usage acknowledging well observed evolution microevolution denying macroevolution takes place evolutionary theory including macroevolutionary change remains dominant scientific paradigm explaining origins earths biodiversity occurrence disputed within scientific community details macroevolution continuously studied scientific community overall theory behind macroevolution ie common descent overwhelmingly consistent empirical data predictions empirical data theory common descent consistent biologists often refer fact evolution
describing fundamental similarity macro microevolution authoritative textbook evolutionary biology biologist douglas futuyma writes
one important tenets theory forged evolutionary synthesis macroevolutionary differences among organisms distinguish higher taxa arise accumulation kinds genetic differences found within species opponents point view believed macroevolution qualitatively different microevolution within species based totally different kind genetic developmental patterning genetic studies species differences decisively disproved claim differences species morphology behavior processes underlie reproductive isolation genetic properties variation within species occupy consistent chromosomal positions may polygenic based genes may display additive dominant epistatic effects instances traced specifiable differences proteins dna nucleotide sequences degree reproductive isolation populations whether prezygotic postzygotic varies little none complete thus reproductive isolation like divergence character evolves cases gradual substitution alleles populations
