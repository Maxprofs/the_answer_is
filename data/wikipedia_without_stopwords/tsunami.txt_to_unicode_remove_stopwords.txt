tsunami plural tsunamis tsunami japanese lit harbor wave english pronunciation tsunmi also known seismic sea wave series waves water body caused displacement large volume water generally ocean large lake earthquakes volcanic eruptions underwater explosions including detonations underwater nuclear devices landslides glacier calvings meteorite impacts disturbances water potential generate tsunami generated displacement water tsunami contrasts normal ocean wave generated wind tides generated gravitational pull moon sun bodies water
tsunami waves resemble normal sea waves wavelength far longer rather appearing breaking wave tsunami may instead initially resemble rapidly rising tide reason often referred tidal waves although usage favored scientific community tsunamis tidal nature tsunamis generally consist series waves periods ranging minutes hours arriving socalled wave train wave heights tens meters generated large events although impact tsunamis limited coastal areas destructive power enormous affect entire ocean basins indian ocean tsunami among deadliest natural disasters human history least people killed missing countries bordering indian ocean
greek historian thucydides suggested lateth century bc history peloponnesian war tsunamis related submarine earthquakes understanding tsunamis nature remained slim th century much remains unknown major areas current research include trying determine large earthquakes generate tsunamis smaller ones trying accurately forecast passage tsunamis across oceans also forecast tsunami waves would interact specific shorelines
terminology
numerous terms used english language describe waves created body water displacement water none terms frequent use entirely accurate
tsunami
term tsunami meaning harbor wave literal translation comes japanese composed two kanji tsu meaning harbor nami meaning wave plural one either follow ordinary english practice add use invariable plural japanese
languages equivalent native word acehnese words beuna aln buluk depending dialect tamil aazhi peralai simeulue island western coast sumatra indonesia devayan word smong sigulai emong
singkil aceh province surrounding areas people use word glorogaloro tsunami nias called olorogaloro ende called ae mesi nuka tana lala
spanish portuguese term used marmoto literally sea moves often associated terramotos otherwise known earthquakes residents many coastal areas spanish portuguese spoken know feel terramoto seek high ground case marmoto occurs
tidal wave
tsunami sometimes referred tidal waves oncepopular term derives common appearance tsunami extraordinarily high tidal bore tsunami tides produce waves water move inland case tsunami inland movement water may much greater giving impression incredibly high forceful tide recent years term tidal wave fallen favor especially scientific community tsunami actually nothing tides produced gravitational pull moon sun rather displacement water although meanings tidal include resembling form character tides use term tidal wave discouraged geologists oceanographers
seismic sea wave
term seismic sea wave also used refer phenomenon waves often generated seismic activity earthquakes prior rise use term tsunami englishspeaking countries scientists generally encouraged use term seismic sea wave rather inaccurate term tidal wave however like tsunami seismic sea wave completely accurate term forces earthquakes including underwater landslides volcanic eruptions underwater explosions land ice slumping ocean meteorite impacts even weather atmospheric pressure changes rapidly generate waves displacing water
history
japan may longest recorded history tsunamis sheer destruction caused indian ocean earthquake tsunami event mark devastating kind modern times killing around people sumatran region unused tsunamis either earthquakes varying magnitudes regularly occurring coast island
tsunamis often underestimated hazard mediterranean sea region europe general historical current regard risk assumptions importance eg lisbon earthquake tsunami caused azoresgibraltar transform fault calabrian earthquakes causing several ten thousand deaths messina earthquake tsunami tsunami claimed lives sicily calabria among deadly natural disasters modern europe storegga slide norwegian sea examples tsunamis affecting british isles refer landslide meteotsunamis predominantly less earthquakeinduced waves
early bc greek historian thucydides inquired book history peloponnesian war causes tsunami first argue ocean earthquakes must cause
cause opinion phenomenon must sought earthquake point shock violent sea driven back suddenly recoiling redoubled force causes inundation without earthquake see accident could happen
roman historian ammianus marcellinus res gestae described typical sequence tsunami including incipient earthquake sudden retreat sea following gigantic wave ad tsunami devastated alexandria
generation mechanisms
principal generation mechanism cause tsunami displacement substantial volume water perturbation sea displacement water usually attributed either earthquakes landslides volcanic eruptions glacier calvings rarely meteorites nuclear tests waves formed way sustained gravity tides play part generation tsunamis
seismicity
tsunami generated sea floor abruptly deforms vertically displaces overlying water tectonic earthquakes particular kind earthquake associated earths crustal deformation earthquakes occur beneath sea water deformed area displaced equilibrium position specifically tsunami generated thrust faults associated convergent destructive plate boundaries move abruptly resulting water displacement owing vertical component movement involved movement normal extensional faults also cause displacement seabed largest events typically related flexure outer trench swell cause enough displacement give rise significant tsunami sumba sanriku events
tsunamis small amplitude wave height offshore long wavelength often hundreds kilometres long whereas normal ocean waves wavelength metres generally pass unnoticed sea forming slight swell usually millimetres normal sea surface grow height reach shallower water wave shoaling process described tsunami occur tidal state even low tide still inundate coastal areas
april magnitude richter scale earthquake occurred near aleutian islands alaska generated tsunami inundated hilo island hawaii metre high ft surge area earthquake occurred pacific ocean floor subducting pushed downwards alaska
examples tsunami originating locations away convergent boundaries include storegga years ago grand banks papua new guinea tappin grand banks papua new guinea tsunamis came earthquakes destabilised sediments causing flow ocean generate tsunami dissipated traveling transoceanic distances
cause storegga sediment failure unknown possibilities include overloading sediments earthquake release gas hydrates methane etc
valdivia earthquake mw alaska earthquake mw indian ocean earthquake mw thoku earthquake mw recent examples powerful megathrust earthquakes generated tsunamis known teletsunamis cross entire oceans smaller mw earthquakes japan trigger tsunamis called local regional tsunamis devastate nearby coasts minutes
landslides
discovered larger tsunamis previously believed possible could caused giant submarine landslides rapidly displace large water volumes energy transfers water rate faster water absorb existence confirmed giant landslide lituya bay alaska caused highest wave ever recorded height metres feet wave travel far struck land almost immediately two people fishing bay killed another boat amazingly managed ride wave
another landslidetsunami event occurred massive landslide monte toc entered vajont dam italy resulting wave surged m ft high dam metres ft destroyed several towns around people died scientists named waves megatsunamis
geologists claim large landslides volcanic islands eg cumbre vieja la palma canary islands may able generate megatsunamis cross oceans disputed many others
general landslides generate displacements mainly shallower parts coastline conjecture nature large landslides enter water shown lead effect water enclosed bays lakes landslide large enough cause transoceanic tsunami occurred within recorded history susceptible locations believed big island hawaii fogo cape verde islands la reunion indian ocean cumbre vieja island la palma canary islands along volcanic ocean islands large masses relatively unconsolidated volcanic material occurs flanks cases detachment planes believed developing however growing controversy dangerous slopes actually
meteotsunamis
meteorological conditions especially deep depressions tropical cyclones generate type storm surge called meteotsunami raises water heights normal levels often suddenly shoreline
case deep tropical cyclones due low atmospheric pressure inward swirling winds causing uplifted dome water form travel tandem storm water domes reach shore surge upward shallows laterally much earthquakegenerated tsunamis typically arriving shortly landfall storms eye
manmade triggered tsunamis
studies potential induction least one actual attempt create tsunami waves tectonic weapon
world war ii new zealand military forces initiated project seal attempted create small tsunamis explosives area todays shakespear regional park attempt failed
considerable speculation possibility using nuclear weapons cause tsunamis near enemy coastline even world war ii consideration idea using conventional explosives explored nuclear testing pacific proving ground united states seemed generate poor results operation crossroads fired two kilotonnes tnt tj bombs one air one underwater shallow m ft waters bikini atoll lagoon fired km mi nearest island waves higher m ft upon reaching shoreline underwater tests mainly hardtack iwahoo deep water hardtack iumbrella shallow water confirmed results analysis effects shallow deep underwater explosions indicate energy explosions doesnt easily generate kind deep allocean waveforms tsunamis energy creates steam causes vertical fountains water creates compressional waveforms tsunamis hallmarked permanent large vertical displacements large volumes water dont occur explosions
characteristics
tsunamis cause damage two mechanisms smashing force wall water travelling high speed destructive power large volume water draining land carrying large amount debris even waves appear large
everyday wind waves wavelength crest crest metres ft height roughly metres ft tsunami deep ocean much larger wavelength kilometres mi wave travels well kilometres per hour mph owing enormous wavelength wave oscillation given point takes minutes complete cycle amplitude metre ft makes tsunamis difficult detect deep water ships unable feel passage
velocity tsunami calculated obtaining square root depth water meters multiplied acceleration due gravity approximated m sec example pacific ocean considered depth meters velocity tsunami would square root x meters per second feet per second equates speed kilometers per hour miles per hour formula used calculating velocity shallow waves tsunami behaves like shallow wave peak peak value reaches floor ocean surface
reason japanese name harbour wave sometimes villages fishermen would sail encounter unusual waves sea fishing come back land find village devastated huge wave
tsunami approaches coast waters become shallow wave shoaling compresses wave speed decreases kilometres per hour mph wavelength diminishes less kilometres mi amplitude grows enormously since wave still long period tsunami may take minutes reach full height except largest tsunamis approaching wave break rather appears like fastmoving tidal bore open bays coastlines adjacent deep water may shape tsunami steplike wave steepbreaking front
tsunamis wave peak reaches shore resulting temporary rise sea level termed run run measured metres reference sea level large tsunami may feature multiple waves arriving period hours significant time wave crests first wave reach shore may highest run
tsunamis occur pacific ocean possible wherever large bodies water including lakes caused earthquakes landslides volcanic explosions glacier calvings bolides
drawback
waves positive negative peak ie ridge trough case propagating wave like tsunami either may first arrive first part arrive shore ridge massive breaking wave sudden flooding first effect noticed land however first part arrive trough drawback occur shoreline recedes dramatically exposing normally submerged areas drawback exceed hundreds metres people unaware danger sometimes remain near shore satisfy curiosity collect fish exposed seabed
typical wave period damaging tsunami minutes means drawback phase first part wave arrive sea recede areas well sea level exposed minutes next minutes tsunami wave trough builds ridge time sea filled destruction occurs land next minutes tsunami wave changes ridge trough causing flood waters drain drawback occur may sweep victims debris distance land process repeats next wave arrives
