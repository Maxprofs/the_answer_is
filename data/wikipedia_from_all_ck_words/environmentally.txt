summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons falling between spring and autumn at the summer solstice the days are longest and the nights are shortest with day-length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice the date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate tradition and culture but when it is summer in the northern hemisphere it is winter in the southern hemisphere and vice versa
== timing ==
from an astronomical view the equinoxes and solstices would be the middle of the respective seasons but sometimes astronomical summer is defined as starting at the solstice the time of maximal insolation a variable seasonal lag means that the meteorological center of the season which is based on average temperature patterns occurs several weeks after the time of maximal insolation according to meteorologists summer extends for the whole months of june july and august in the northern hemisphere and the whole months of december january and february in the southern hemisphere under meteorological definitions all seasons are arbitrarily set to start at the beginning of a calendar month and end at the end of a month this meteorological definition of summer also aligns with the commonly viewed notion of summer as the season with the longest (and warmest) days of the year in which daylight predominates the meteorological reckoning of seasons is used in austria denmark the former soviet union and japan it is also used by many in the united kingdom in ireland the summer months according to the national meteorological service met ireann are june july and august however according to the irish calendar summer begins on 1 may and ends on 1 august school textbooks in ireland follow the cultural norm of summer commencing on 1 may rather than the meteorological definition of 1 june
days continue to lengthen from equinox to solstice and summer days progressively shorten after the solstice so meteorological summer encompasses the build-up to the longest day and a diminishing thereafter with summer having many more hours of daylight than spring reckoning by hours of daylight alone summer solstice marks the midpoint not the beginning of the seasons midsummer takes place over the shortest night of the year which is the summer solstice or on a nearby date that varies with tradition
where a seasonal lag of half a season or more is common reckoning based on astronomical markers is shifted half a season by this method in north america summer is the period from the summer solstice (usually 20 or 21 june in the northern hemisphere) to the autumn equinox
reckoning by cultural festivals the summer season in the united states is commonly regarded as beginning on memorial day weekend (the last weekend in may) and ending on labor day weekend (the first weekend in september) more closely in line with the meteorological definition for the parts of the country that have four-season weather the similar canadian tradition starts summer on victoria day one week prior (although summer conditions vary widely across canada's expansive territory) and ends as in the united states on labour day
in chinese astronomy summer starts on or around 5 may with the jiq (solar term) known as lxi () i.e establishment of summer and it ends on or around 6 august
in southern and southeast asia where the monsoon occurs summer is more generally defined as lasting from march april may and june the warmest time of the year ending with the onset of the monsoon rains
because the temperature lag is shorter in the oceanic temperate southern hemisphere most countries in this region use the meteorological definition with summer starting on 1 december and ending on the last day of february
in australia and new zealand summer officially begins on 1 december and ends on 28 and 29 february
== weather ==
summer is traditionally associated with hot or warm weather in the mediterranean regions it is also associated with dry weather while in other places (particularly in eastern asia because of the monsoon) it is associated with rainy weather the wet season is the main period of vegetation growth within the savanna climate regime where the wet season is associated with a seasonal shift in the prevailing winds it is known as a monsoon
