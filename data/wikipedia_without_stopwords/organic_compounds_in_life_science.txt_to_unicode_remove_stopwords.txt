organic compound member large class gaseous liquid solid chemical compounds whose molecules contain carbon historical reasons discussed types carboncontaining compounds carbides carbonates simple oxides carbon co co cyanides considered inorganic distinction organic inorganic carbon compounds useful organizing vast subject chemistry somewhat arbitrary

historyedit
vitalismedit
word organic historical dating st century many centuries western alchemists believed vitalism theory certain compounds could synthesized classical elementsearth water air fireby action lifeforce vis vitalis organisms possessed vitalism taught organic compounds fundamentally different inorganic compounds could obtained elements chemical manipulation
vitalism survived even rise modern atomic theory replacement aristotelian elements know today first came question friedrich whler synthesized oxalic acid compound known occur living organisms cyanogen decisive experiment whlers synthesis urea inorganic salts potassium cyanate ammonium sulfate urea long considered organic compound known occur urine living organisms whlers experiments followed many others increasingly complex organic substances produced inorganic ones without involvement living organism
modern classificationedit
even though vitalism discredited scientific nomenclature retains distinction organic inorganic compounds modern meaning organic compound compound contains significant amount carboneven though many organic compounds known today connection substance found living organisms
single official definition organic compound textbooks define organic compound one contains one ch bonds others include cc bonds definition others state molecule contains carbonit organic
even broader definition carboncontaining molecules requires exclusion carboncontaining alloys including steel relatively small number carboncontaining compounds metal carbonates carbonyls simple oxides carbon cyanides well allotropes carbon simple carbon halides sulfides usually considered inorganic
ch definition excludes compounds historically practically considered organic neither urea oxalic acid organic definition yet two key compounds vitalism debate iupac blue book organic nomenclature specifically mentions urea oxalic acid compounds lacking ch bonds also traditionally considered organic include benzenehexol mesoxalic acid carbon tetrachloride mellitic acid contains ch bonds considered possible organic substance martian soil cc bonds found organic compounds except small molecules like methane methanol one carbon atom structure
ch bondonly rule also leads somewhat arbitrary divisions sets carbonfluorine compounds example teflon considered rule inorganic whereas tefzel considered organic likewise many halons considered inorganic whereas rest considered organic reasons sources believe ch compounds subset organic compounds
summary carboncontaining compounds organic almost organic compounds contain least ch bond cc bond compound need contain ch bonds considered organic eg urea many organic compounds
classificationedit
organic compounds may classified variety ways one major distinction natural synthetic compounds organic compounds also classified subdivided presence heteroatoms eg organometallic compounds feature bonds carbon metal organophosphorus compounds feature bonds carbon phosphorus
another distinction based size organic compounds distinguishes small molecules polymers
natural compoundsedit
natural compounds refer produced plants animals many still extracted natural sources would expensive produce artificially examples include sugars alkaloids terpenoids certain nutrients vitamin b general natural products large stereoisometrically complicated molecules present reasonable concentrations living organisms
compounds prime importance biochemistry antigens carbohydrates enzymes hormones lipids fatty acids neurotransmitters nucleic acids proteins peptides amino acids lectins vitamins fats oils
synthetic compoundsedit
compounds prepared reaction compounds known synthetic may either compounds already found plants animals occur naturally
polymers category includes plastics rubbers organic synthetic semisynthetic compounds
biotechnologyedit
several compounds industrially manufactured utilizing biochemistry organisms bacteria yeast two examples ethanol insulin regularly dna organism altered express desired compounds often ordinarily produced organism sometimes biotechnologically engineered compounds never present nature first place
nomenclatureedit
iupac nomenclature organic compounds slightly differs cas nomenclature
databasesedit
cas database comprehensive repository data organic compounds search tool scifinder offered
beilstein database contains information million substances covers scientific literature present today accessible via reaxys structures large diversity physical chemical properties available substance reference original literature
pubchem contains million entries compounds especially covers field medicinal chemistry
