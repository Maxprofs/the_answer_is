glial cells sometimes called neuroglia simply glia greek glue pronounced english either li la nonneuronal cells maintain homeostasis form myelin provide support protection neurons central nervous system peripheral nervous system
greek name implies glia commonly known glue nervous system however fully accurate glia discovered pathologist rudolf virchow search connective tissue brain neuroscience currently identifies four main functions glial cells
surround neurons hold place
supply nutrients oxygen neurons
insulate one neuron another
destroy pathogens remove dead neurons
century believed neuroglia play role neurotransmission however st century neuroscience recognized glial cells effects certain physiological processes like breathing assisting neurons form synaptic connections
functionsedit
glial cells function primarily physical support neurons others regulate internal environment brain especially fluid surrounding neurons synapses nutrify neurons early embryogenesis glial cells direct migration neurons produce molecules modify growth axons dendrites recent research indicates glial cells hippocampus cerebellum participate synaptic transmission regulate clearance neurotransmitters synaptic cleft release gliotransmitters atp modulate synaptic function
glial cells known capable mitosis contrast scientific understanding whether neurons permanently postmitotic capable mitosis still developing past glia considered lack certain features neurons example glial cells believed chemical synapses release transmitters considered passive bystanders neural transmission however recent studies shown untrue
example astrocytes crucial clearance neurotransmitters within synaptic cleft provides distinction arrival action potentials prevents toxic buildup certain neurotransmitters glutamate excitotoxicity also thought glia play role many neurological diseases including alzheimers disease furthermore least vitro astrocytes release gliotransmitter glutamate response certain stimulation another unique type glial cell oligodendrocyte precursor cells opcs welldefined functional synapses least two major groups neurons notable differences neurons glial cells neurons possession axons dendrites capacity generate action potentials
glia ought regarded glue nervous system name implies rather partner neurons also crucial development nervous system processes synaptic plasticity synaptogenesis glia role regulation repair neurons injury central nervous system cns glia suppress repair glial cells known astrocytes enlarge proliferate form scar produce inhibitory molecules inhibit regrowth damaged severed axon peripheral nervous system pns glial cells known schwann cells promote repair axonal injury schwann cells regress earlier developmental state encourage regrowth axon difference cns pns raises hopes regeneration nervous tissue cns example spinal cord may able repaired following injury severance schwann cells also known neurilemmocytes cells envelop nerve fibers pns winding repeatedly around nerve fiber nucleus inside process creates myelin sheath aids conductivity also assists regeneration damaged fibers oligodendrocytes another type glial cell cns dendrocytes resemble octopus bulbous body contain fifteen armlike processes arm reaches nerve fiber spirals around creating myelin sheath myelin sheath insulates nerve fiber extracellular fluid well speeds signal conduction nerve fiber
