== terminologyedit ==
the word suffering is sometimes used in the narrow sense of physical pain but more often it refers to mental pain or more often yet to pain in the broad sense i.e to any unpleasant feeling emotion or sensation the word pain usually refers to physical pain but it is also a common synonym of suffering the words pain and suffering are often used both together in different ways for instance they may be used as interchangeable synonyms or they may be used in contradistinction to one another as in pain is physical suffering is mental or pain is inevitable suffering is optional or they may be used to define each other as in pain is physical suffering or suffering is severe physical or mental pain
qualifiers such as physical mental emotional and psychological are often used for referring to certain types of pain or suffering in particular mental pain (or suffering) may be used in relationship with physical pain (or suffering) for distinguishing between two wide categories of pain or suffering a first caveat concerning such a distinction is that it uses physical pain in a sense that normally includes not only the typical sensory experience of physical pain but also other unpleasant bodily experiences including air hunger hunger vestibular suffering nausea sleep deprivation and itching a second caveat is that the terms physical or mental should not be taken too literally physical pain or suffering as a matter of fact happens through conscious minds and involves emotional aspects while mental pain or suffering happens through physical brains and being an emotion involves important physiological aspects
the word unpleasantness which some people use as a synonym of suffering or pain in the broad sense may be used to refer to the basic affective dimension of pain (its suffering aspect) usually in contrast with the sensory dimension as for instance in this sentence pain-unpleasantness is often though not always closely linked to both the intensity and unique qualities of the painful sensation. other current words that have a definition with some similarity to suffering include distress unhappiness misery affliction woe ill discomfort displeasure disagreeableness
== philosophyedit ==
hedonism as an ethical theory claims that good and bad consist ultimately in pleasure and pain many hedonists in accordance with epicurus and contrarily to popular perception of his doctrine advocate that we should first seek to avoid suffering and that the greatest pleasure lies in a robust state of profound tranquility (ataraxia) that is free from the worrisome pursuit or the unwelcome consequences of ephemeral pleasures
for stoicism the greatest good lies in reason and virtue but the soul best reaches it through a kind of indifference (apatheia) to pleasure and pain as a consequence this doctrine has become identified with stern self-control in regard to suffering
jeremy bentham developed hedonistic utilitarianism a popular doctrine in ethics politics and economics bentham argued that the right act or policy was that which would cause the greatest happiness of the greatest number he suggested a procedure called hedonic or felicific calculus for determining how much pleasure and pain would result from any action john stuart mill improved and promoted the doctrine of hedonistic utilitarianism karl popper in the open society and its enemies proposed a negative utilitarianism which prioritizes the reduction of suffering over the enhancement of happiness when speaking of utility i believe that there is from the ethical point of view no symmetry between suffering and happiness or between pain and pleasure (...) human suffering makes a direct moral appeal for help while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway. david pearce for his part advocates a utilitarianism that aims straightforwardly at the abolition of suffering through the use of biotechnology (see more details below in section biology neurology psychology) another aspect worthy of mention here is that many utilitarians since bentham hold that the moral status of a being comes from its ability to feel pleasure and pain therefore moral agents should consider not only the interests of human beings but also those of (other) animals richard ryder came to the same conclusion in his concepts of speciesism and painism peter singer's writings especially the book animal liberation represent the leading edge of this kind of utilitarianism for animals as well as for people
another doctrine related to the relief of suffering is humanitarianism (see also humanitarian principles humanitarian aid and humane society) where humanitarian efforts seek a positive addition to the happiness of sentient beings it is to make the unhappy happy rather than the happy happier (...) [humanitarianism] is an ingredient in many social attitudes in the modern world it has so penetrated into diverse movements (...) that it can hardly be said to exist in itself.
pessimists hold this world to be mainly bad or even the worst possible plagued with among other things unbearable and unstoppable suffering some identify suffering as the nature of the world and conclude that it would be better if life did not exist at all arthur schopenhauer recommends us to take refuge in things like art philosophy loss of the will to live and tolerance toward fellow-sufferers
friedrich nietzsche first influenced by schopenhauer developed afterward quite another attitude arguing that the suffering of life is productive exalting the will to power despising weak compassion or pity and recommending us to embrace willfully the eternal return of the greatest sufferings
philosophy of pain is a philosophical specialty that focuses on physical pain and is through that relevant to suffering in general
== religionedit ==
suffering plays an important role in a number of religions regarding matters such as the following consolation or relief moral conduct (do no harm help the afflicted show compassion) spiritual advancement through life hardships or through self-imposed trials (mortification of the flesh penance ascetism) ultimate destiny (salvation damnation hell) theodicy deals with the problem of evil which is the difficulty of reconciling the existence of an omnipotent and benevolent god with the existence of evil a quintessential form of evil for many people is extreme suffering especially in innocent children or in creatures destined to an eternity of torments (see problem of hell)
the four noble truths of buddhism are about dukkha a term usually translated as suffering in the dharma suffering is greatly defined in buddhism and hold a key role in attaining the supreme bliss nirvana the nature of suffering recognising its cause and cessation of suffering is quintessential in the practice of buddhism the way leading to its cessation (is the noble eightfold path)
buddhism considers liberation from suffering dukkha and the practice of compassion (karuna)and mindfulness (sati) as basic for leading a holy life and attaining the nirvana thus,elimination of suffering by attaining buddhahood
hinduism holds that suffering follows naturally from personal negative behaviors in ones current life or in a past life (see karma in hinduism) one must accept suffering as a just consequence and as an opportunity for spiritual progress thus the soul or true self which is eternally free of any suffering may come to manifest itself in the person who then achieves liberation (moksha) abstinence from causing pain or harm to other beings (ahimsa) is a central tenet of hinduism suffering is thought to be an inclusive effect of human experience beyond this hindus are looking to achieve enlightenment and end human suffering by answering questions about life this will lead to a unity in god as well as find the meaning of their suffering ultimately achieving bliss
christianity also believes that human suffering plays an important role in religion suffering is only to be thought a positive experience in the case of achieving a higher meaning of life such as jesus suffering for the lives of other christians suffering is the time to find god and value faith while doing so this allows christians to face reality of human experience with suffering and find an understanding in the divine
hinduism and christianity embrace similar aspects in suffering both religions realize the need for god as well as the moral significance for god that suffering provides this allows enlightenment to be reached and suffering to be seen in the conditions that faith entails rather than an issue these human experiences with suffering in both hinduism and christianity help educators to emphasize the need for dialogue and religious education in schools
in islam the faithful must endure suffering with hope and faith not resist or ask why accept it as allah's will and submit to it as a test of faith (allah never asks more than can be endured) one must also work to alleviate suffering of others as well as one's own
the bible's book of job reflects on the nature and meaning of suffering it is supplemented in the hebrew bible by the passages found in the book of isaiah and the book of jeremiah which elaborate the emotional and physical suffering of a conquered nation with its vanquished inhabitants forced into the suffering of exile and captivity in a foreign land
in the new testament suffering is portrayed both in the life of jesus portrayed in the synoptics which narrate the suffering of the crucifixion and in the post-easter narratives the suffering associated with punishment is further portrayed in the apocalypse of john where suffering at the scene of the last judgment is depicted as the just recompense for sin and wrongdoing pope john paul ii wrote on the christian meaning of human suffering this meaning revolves around the notion of redemptive suffering
according to the bah faith all suffering is a brief and temporary manifestation of physical life whose source is the material aspects of physical existence and often attachment to them whereas only joy exists in the spiritual worlds in the words of `abdu'l-bah all these examples are to show you that the trials which beset our every step all our sorrow pain shame and grief are born in the world of matter whereas the spiritual kingdom never causes sadness a man living with his thoughts in this kingdom knows perpetual joy the ills all flesh is heir to do not pass him by but they only touch the surface of his life the depths are calm and serene. (paris talks p 110)
== arts and literatureedit ==
artistic and literary works often engage with suffering sometimes at great cost to their creators or performers the literature arts and medicine database offers a list of such works under the categories art film literature and theater be it in the tragic comic or other genres art and literature offer means to alleviate (and perhaps also exacerbate) suffering as argued for instance in harold schweizer's suffering and the remedy of art

about suffering they were never wrong,the old masters how well they understoodits human position how it takes placewhile someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;(...)in breughel's icarus for instance how everything turns awayquite leisurely from the disaster (...)
== social sciencesedit ==
social suffering according to arthur kleinman and others describes collective and individual human suffering associated with life conditions shaped by powerful social forces such suffering is an increasing concern in medical anthropology ethnography mass media analysis and holocaust studies says iain wilkinson who is developing a sociology of suffering
the encyclopedia of world problems and human potential is a work by the union of international associations its main databases are about world problems (56,564 profiles) global strategies and solutions (32,547 profiles) human values (3,257 profiles) and human development (4,817 profiles) it states that the most fundamental entry common to the core parts is that of pain (or suffering) and common to the core parts is the learning dimension of new understanding or insight in response to suffering
ralph g.h siu an american author urged in 1988 the creation of a new and vigorous academic discipline called panetics to be devoted to the study of the infliction of suffering the international society for panetics was founded in 1991 to study and develop ways to reduce the infliction of human suffering by individuals acting through professions corporations governments and other social groups

== biology neurology psychologyedit ==
suffering and pleasure are respectively the negative and positive affects or hedonic tones or valences that psychologists often identify as basic in our emotional lives the evolutionary role of physical and mental suffering through natural selection is primordial it warns of threats motivates coping (fight or flight escapism) and reinforces negatively certain behaviors (see punishment aversives) despite its initial disrupting nature suffering contributes to the organization of meaning in an individual's world and psyche in turn meaning determines how individuals or societies experience and deal with suffering
many brain structures and physiological processes are involved in suffering various hypotheses try to account for the experience of suffering one of these the pain overlap theory takes note thanks to neuroimaging studies that the cingulate cortex fires up when the brain feels suffering from experimentally induced social distress or physical pain as well the theory proposes therefore that physical pain and social pain (i.e two radically differing kinds of suffering) share a common phenomenological and neurological basis
according to david pearces online manifesto the hedonistic imperative suffering is the avoidable result of darwinian genetic design bltc research and the abolitionist society following pearce's abolitionism promote replacing the pain/pleasure axis with a robot-like response to noxious stimuli or with gradients of bliss through genetic engineering and other technical scientific advances
hedonistic psychology affective science and affective neuroscience are some of the emerging scientific fields that could in the coming years focus their attention on the phenomenon of suffering
== health careedit ==
disease and injury may contribute to suffering in humans and animals for example suffering may be a feature of mental or physical illness such as borderline personality disorder and occasionally in advanced cancer health care addresses this suffering in many ways in subfields such as medicine clinical psychology psychotherapy alternative medicine hygiene public health and through various health care providers
health care approaches to suffering however remain problematic physician and author eric cassell widely cited on the subject of attending to the suffering person as a primary goal of medicine has defined suffering as the state of severe distress associated with events that threaten the intactness of the person cassell writes the obligation of physicians to relieve human suffering stretches back to antiquity despite this fact little attention is explicitly given to the problem of suffering in medical education research or practice. mirroring the traditional body and mind dichotomy that underlies its teaching and practice medicine strongly distinguishes pain from suffering and most attention goes to the treatment of pain nevertheless physical pain itself still lacks adequate attention from the medical community according to numerous reports besides some medical fields like palliative care pain management (or pain medicine) oncology or psychiatry do somewhat address suffering as such in palliative care for instance pioneer cicely saunders created the concept of total pain ('total suffering say now the textbooks) which encompasses the whole set of physical and mental distress discomfort symptoms problems or needs that a patient may experience hurtfully
== relief and prevention in societyedit ==
since suffering is such a universal motivating experience people when asked can relate their activities to its relief and prevention farmers for instance may claim that they prevent famine artists may say that they take our minds off our worries and teachers may hold that they hand down tools for coping with life hazards in certain aspects of collective life however suffering is more readily an explicit concern by itself such aspects may include public health human rights humanitarian aid disaster relief philanthropy economic aid social services insurance and animal welfare to these can be added the aspects of security and safety which relate to precautionary measures taken by individuals or families to interventions by the military the police the firefighters and to notions or fields like social security environmental security and human security
== usesedit ==
philosopher leonard katz wrote but nature as we now know regards ultimately only fitness and not our happiness (...) and does not scruple to use hate fear punishment and even war alongside affection in ordering social groups and selecting among them just as she uses pain as well as pleasure to get us to feed water and protect our bodies and also in forging our social bonds.
people make use of suffering for specific social or personal purposes in many areas of human life as can be seen in the following instances

in politics there is purposeful infliction of suffering in war torture and terrorism people may use nonphysical suffering against competitors in nonviolent power struggles people who argue for a policy may put forward the need to relieve prevent or avenge suffering individuals or groups may use past suffering as a political lever in their favor
