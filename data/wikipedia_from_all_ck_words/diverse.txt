a disease is a particular abnormal condition a disorder of a structure or function that affects part or all of an organism the causal study of disease is called pathology disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs it may be caused by factors originally from an external source such as infectious disease or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions such as autoimmune diseases in humans disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain dysfunction distress social problems or death to the person afflicted or similar problems for those in contact with the person in this broader sense it sometimes includes injuries disabilities disorders syndromes infections isolated symptoms deviant behaviors and atypical variations of structure and function while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories diseases usually affect people not only physically but also emotionally as contracting and living with a disease can alter one's perspective on life and one's personality
death due to disease is called death by natural causes there are four main types of disease pathogenic disease deficiency disease hereditary disease and physiological disease diseases can also be classified as communicable and non-communicable the deadliest disease in humans is ischemic heart disease (blood flow obstruction) followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections respectively
== terminologyedit ==
=== conceptsedit ===
in many cases terms such as disease disorder morbidity and illness are used interchangeably there are situations however when specific terms are considered preferable
disease
the term disease broadly refers to any condition that impairs the normal functioning of the body for this reason diseases are associated with dysfunctioning of the body's normal homeostatic process commonly the term disease is used to refer specifically to infectious diseases which are clinically evident diseases that result from the presence of pathogenic microbial agents including viruses bacteria fungi protozoa multicellular organisms and aberrant proteins known as prions an infection that does not and will not produce clinically evident impairment of normal functioning such as the presence of the normal bacteria and yeasts in the gut or of a passenger virus is not considered a disease by contrast an infection that is asymptomatic during its incubation period but expected to produce symptoms later is usually considered a disease non-infectious diseases are all other diseases including most forms of cancer heart disease and genetic disease
chronic disease - disease that is a long term issue
incurable disease - disease that cannot be cured also known as pathological disease
terminal disease - disease with death as an inevitable result of it
illness
illness and sickness are generally used as synonyms for disease however this term is occasionally used to refer specifically to the patient's personal experience of his or her disease in this model it is possible for a person to have a disease without being ill (to have an objectively definable but asymptomatic medical condition) and to be ill without being diseased (such as when a person perceives a normal experience as a medical condition or medicalizes a non-disease situation in his or her life) illness is often not due to infection but a collection of evolved responsessickness behavior by the bodythat helps clear infection such aspects of illness can include lethargy depression anorexia sleepiness hyperalgesia and inability to concentrate
disorder
in medicine a disorder is a functional abnormality or disturbance medical disorders can be categorized into mental disorders physical disorders genetic disorders emotional and behavioral disorders and functional disorders the term disorder is often considered more value-neutral and less stigmatizing than the terms disease or illness and therefore is a preferred terminology in some circumstances in mental health the term mental disorder is used as a way of acknowledging the complex interaction of biological social and psychological factors in psychiatric conditions however the term disorder is also used in many other areas of medicine primarily to identify physical disorders that are not caused by infectious organisms such as metabolic disorders
medical condition
a medical condition is a broad term that includes all diseases lesions and disorders while the term medical condition generally includes mental illnesses in some contexts the term is used specifically to denote any illness injury or disease except for mental illnesses the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm) the widely used psychiatric manual that defines all mental disorders uses the term general medical condition to refer to all diseases illnesses and injuries except for mental disorders this usage is also commonly seen in the psychiatric literature some health insurance policies also define a medical condition as any illness injury or disease except for psychiatric illnesses
as it is more value-neutral than terms like disease the term medical condition is sometimes preferred by people with health issues that they do not consider deleterious on the other hand by emphasizing the medical nature of the condition this term is sometimes rejected such as by proponents of the autism rights movement
the term medical condition is also a synonym for medical state in which case it describes an individual patient's current state from a medical standpoint this usage appears in statements that describe a patient as being in critical condition for example
morbidity
morbidity (from latin morbidus meaning sick unhealthy") is a diseased state disability or poor health due to any cause the term may be used to refer to the existence of any form of disease or to the degree that the health condition affects the patient among severely ill patients the level of morbidity is often measured by icu scoring systems comorbidity is the simultaneous presence of two or more medical conditions such as schizophrenia and substance abuse
in epidemiology and actuarial science the term morbidity rate can refer to either the incidence rate or the prevalence of a disease or medical condition this measure of sickness is contrasted with the mortality rate of a condition which is the proportion of people dying during a given time interval
syndrome
a syndrome is the association of several medical signs symptoms and or other characteristics that often occur together some syndromes such as down syndrome have only one cause others such as parkinsonian syndrome have multiple possible causes in other cases the cause of the syndrome is unknown a familiar syndrome name often remains in use even after an underlying cause has been found or when there are a number of different possible primary causes
predisease
predisease is a type of disease creep or medicalization in which currently healthy people with risk factors for disease but no evidence of actual disease are told that they are sick prediabetes and prehypertension are common examples labeling a healthy person with predisease can result in overtreatment such as taking drugs that only help people with severe disease or in useful preventive measures such as motivating the person to get a healthy amount of physical exercise
=== types by body systemedit ===
mental
mental illness is a broad generic label for a category of illnesses that may include affective or emotional instability behavioral dysregulation and/or cognitive dysfunction or impairment specific illnesses known as mental illnesses include major depression generalized anxiety disorder schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to name a few mental illness can be of biological (e.g. anatomical chemical or genetic) or psychological (e.g. trauma or conflict) origin it can impair the affected person's ability to work or study and can harm interpersonal relationships the term insanity is used technically as a legal term
organic
an organic disease is one caused by a physical or physiological change to some tissue or organ of the body the term sometimes excludes infections it is commonly used in contrast with mental disorders it includes emotional and behavioral disorders if they are due to changes to the physical structures or functioning of the body such as after a stroke or a traumatic brain injury but not if they are due to psychosocial issues
=== stagesedit ===
in an infectious disease the incubation period is the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms the latency period is the time between infection and the ability of the disease to spread to another person which may precede follow or be simultaneous with the appearance of symptoms some viruses also exhibit a dormant phase called viral latency in which the virus hides in the body in an inactive state for example varicella zoster virus causes chickenpox in the acute phase after recovery from chickenpox the virus may remain dormant in nerve cells for many years and later cause herpes zoster (shingles)
acute disease
an acute disease is a short-lived disease like the common cold
chronic disease
a chronic disease is one that lasts for a long time usually at least six months during that time it may be constantly present or it may go into remission and periodically relapse a chronic disease may be stable (does not get any worse) or it may be progressive (gets worse over time) some chronic diseases can be permanently cured most chronic diseases can be beneficially treated even if they cannot be permanently cured
flare-up
a flare-up can refer to either the recurrence of symptoms or an onset of more severe symptoms
refractory disease
a refractory disease is a disease that resists treatment especially an individual case that resists treatment more than is normal for the specific disease in question
progressive disease
progressive disease is a disease whose typical natural course is the worsening of the disease until death serious debility or organ failure occurs slowly progressive diseases are also chronic diseases many are also degenerative diseases the opposite of progressive disease is stable disease or static disease a medical condition that exists but does not get better or worse
cure
a cure is the end of a medical condition or a treatment that is very likely to end it while remission refers to the disappearance possibly temporarily of symptoms complete remission is the best possible outcome for incurable diseases
=== scopeedit ===
localized disease
a localized disease is one that affects only one part of the body such as athlete's foot or an eye infection
disseminated disease
a disseminated disease has spread to other parts with cancer this is usually called metastatic disease
systemic disease
a systemic disease is a disease that affects the entire body such as influenza or high blood pressure
== classificationsedit ==
diseases may be classified by etiology (cause) pathogenesis (mechanism by which the disease is caused) or by symptom(s) alternatively diseases may be classified according to the organ system involved though this is often complicated since many diseases affect more than one organ
a chief difficulty in nosology is that diseases often cannot be defined and classified clearly especially when etiology or pathogenesis are unknown thus diagnostic terms often only reflect a symptom or set of symptoms (syndrome)
classical classification of human disease derives from observational correlation between pathological analysis and clinical syndromes today it is preferred to classify them by their aetiology if it is known
arguably the most known classification of diseases is the world health organization's icd they publish periodical updates currently the last publication is the icd-10
== causesedit ==
only some diseases such as influenza are contagious and commonly believed infectious the micro-organisms that cause these diseases are known as pathogens and include varieties of bacteria viruses protozoa and fungi infectious diseases can be transmitted e.g by hand-to-mouth contact with infectious material on surfaces by bites of insects or other carriers of the disease and from contaminated water or food (often via fecal contamination) etc in addition there are sexually transmitted diseases in some cases microorganisms that are not readily spread from person to person play a role while other diseases can be prevented or ameliorated with appropriate nutrition or other lifestyle changes
some diseases such as most (but not all) forms of cancer heart disease and mental disorders are non-infectious diseases many non-infectious diseases have a partly or completely genetic basis (see genetic disorder) and may thus be transmitted from one generation to another
social determinants of health are the social conditions in which people live that determine their health illnesses are generally related to social economic political and environmental circumstances social determinants of health have been recognized by several health organizations such as the public health agency of canada and the world health organization to greatly influence collective and personal well-being the world health organization's social determinants council also recognizes social determinants of health in poverty
when the cause of a disease is poorly understood societies tend to mythologize the disease or use it as a metaphor or symbol of whatever that culture considers evil for example until the bacterial cause of tuberculosis was discovered in 1882 experts variously ascribed the disease to heredity a sedentary lifestyle depressed mood and overindulgence in sex rich food or alcoholall the social ills of the time
=== types of causesedit ===
airborne
an airborne disease is any disease that is caused by pathogens and transmitted through the air
infectious
infectious diseases also known as transmissible diseases or communicable diseases comprise clinically evident illness (i.e. characteristic medical signs and/or symptoms of disease) resulting from the infection presence and growth of pathogenic biological agents in an individual host organism included in this category are
contagious an infection such as influenza or the common cold that commonly spreads from one person to another
communicable an infection that can spread from one person to another but is not usually spread through everyday contact such as the viral hepatitis
non-communicable
a non-communicable disease is a medical condition or disease that is non-transmissible non-communicable diseases cannot be spread directly from one person to another heart disease and cancers are examples of non-communicable diseases in humans
foodborne
foodborne illness or food poisoning is any illness resulting from the consumption of food contaminated with pathogenic bacteria toxins viruses prions or parasites
lifestyle
a lifestyle disease is any disease that appears to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer especially if the risk factors include behavioral choices like a sedentary lifestyle or a diet high in unhealthful foods such as refined carbohydrates trans fats or alcoholic beverages
== preventionedit ==
many diseases and disorders can be prevented through a variety of means these include sanitation proper nutrition adequate exercise vaccinations and other self-care and public health measures
== treatmentsedit ==
medical therapies or treatments are efforts to cure or improve a disease or other health problem in the medical field therapy is synonymous with the word treatment among psychologists the term may refer specifically to psychotherapy or talk therapy common treatments include medications surgery medical devices and self-care treatments may be provided by an organized health care system or informally by the patient or family members
a prevention or preventive therapy is a way to avoid an injury sickness or disease in the first place a treatment or cure is applied after a medical problem has already started a treatment attempts to improve or remove a problem but treatments may not produce permanent cures especially in chronic diseases cures are a subset of treatments that reverse diseases completely or end medical problems permanently many diseases that cannot be completely cured are still treatable pain management (also called pain medicine) is that branch of medicine employing an interdisciplinary approach to the relief of pain and improvement in the quality of life of those living with pain
treatment for medical emergencies must be provided promptly often through an emergency department or in less critical situations through an urgent care facility
== epidemiologyedit ==
epidemiology is the study of the factors that cause or encourage diseases some diseases are more common in certain geographic areas among people with certain genetic or socioeconomic characteristics or at different times of the year
epidemiology is considered a cornerstone methodology of public health research and is highly regarded in evidence-based medicine for identifying risk factors for disease in the study of communicable and non-communicable diseases the work of epidemiologists ranges from outbreak investigation to study design data collection and analysis including the development of statistical models to test hypotheses and the documentation of results for submission to peer-reviewed journals epidemiologists also study the interaction of diseases in a population a condition known as a syndemic epidemiologists rely on a number of other scientific disciplines such as biology (to better understand disease processes) biostatistics (the current raw information available) geographic information science (to store data and map disease patterns) and social science disciplines (to better understand proximate and distal risk factors) epidemiology can help identify causes as well as guide prevention efforts
in studying diseases epidemiology faces the challenge of defining them especially for poorly understood diseases different groups might use significantly different definitions without an agreed-on definition different researchers may report different numbers of cases and characteristics of the disease
some morbidity databases are compiled with data supplied by states and territories health authorities at national level (national hospital morbidity database (nhmd) for example) or at european scale (european hospital morbidity database or hmdb) but not yet at world scale
=== burdens of diseaseedit ===
disease burden is the impact of a health problem in an area measured by financial cost mortality morbidity or other indicators
there are several measures used to quantify the burden imposed by diseases on people the years of potential life lost (ypll) is a simple estimate of the number of years that a person's life was shortened due to a disease for example if a person dies at the age of 65 from a disease and would probably have lived until age 80 without that disease then that disease has caused a loss of 15 years of potential life ypll measurements do not account for how disabled a person is before dying so the measurement treats a person who dies suddenly and a person who died at the same age after decades of illness as equivalent in 2004 the world health organization calculated that 932 million years of potential life were lost to premature death
the quality-adjusted life year (qaly) and disability-adjusted life year (daly) metrics are similar but take into account whether the person was healthy after diagnosis in addition to the number of years lost due to premature death these measurements add part of the years lost to being sick unlike ypll these measurements show the burden imposed on people who are very sick but who live a normal lifespan a disease that has high morbidity but low mortality has a high daly and a low ypll in 2004 the world health organization calculated that 1.5 billion disability-adjusted life years were lost to disease and injury in the developed world heart disease and stroke cause the most loss of life but neuropsychiatric conditions like major depressive disorder cause the most years lost to being sick
== society and cultureedit ==
how a society responds to diseases is the subject of medical sociology
a condition may be considered a disease in some cultures or eras but not in others for example obesity can represent wealth and abundance and is a status symbol in famine-prone areas and some places hard-hit by hiv/aids epilepsy is considered a sign of spiritual gifts among the hmong people
sickness confers the social legitimization of certain benefits such as illness benefits work avoidance and being looked after by others the person who is sick takes on a social role called the sick role a person who responds to a dreaded disease such as cancer in a culturally acceptable fashion may be publicly and privately honored with higher social status in return for these benefits the sick person is obligated to seek treatment and work to become well once more as a comparison consider pregnancy which is not interpreted as a disease or sickness even if the mother and baby may both benefit from medical care
most religions grant exceptions from religious duties to people who are sick for example one whose life would be endangered by fasting on yom kippur or during ramadan is exempted from the requirement or even forbidden from participating people who are sick are also exempted from social duties for example ill health is the only socially acceptable reason for an american to refuse an invitation to the white house
the identification of a condition as a disease rather than as simply a variation of human structure or function can have significant social or economic implications the controversial recognitions as diseases of repetitive stress injury (rsi) and post-traumatic stress disorder (also known as soldier's heart shell shock and combat fatigue") has had a number of positive and negative effects on the financial and other responsibilities of governments corporations and institutions towards individuals as well as on the individuals themselves the social implication of viewing aging as a disease could be profound though this classification is not yet widespread
lepers were people who were historically shunned because they had an infectious disease and the term leper still evokes social stigma fear of disease can still be a widespread social phenomenon though not all diseases evoke extreme social stigma
social standing and economic status affect health diseases of poverty are diseases that are associated with poverty and low social status diseases of affluence are diseases that are associated with high social and economic status which diseases are associated with which states varies according to time place and technology some diseases such as diabetes mellitus may be associated with both poverty (poor food choices) and affluence (long lifespans and sedentary lifestyles) through different mechanisms the term diseases of civilization describes diseases that are more common among older people for example cancer is far more common in societies in which most members live until they reach the age of 80 than in societies in which most members die before they reach the age of 50
=== language of diseaseedit ===
an illness narrative is a way of organizing a medical experience into a coherent story that illustrates the sick individual's personal experience
people use metaphors to make sense of their experiences with disease the metaphors move disease from an objective thing that exists to an affective experience the most popular metaphors draw on military concepts disease is an enemy that must be feared fought battled and routed the patient or the healthcare provider is a warrior rather than a passive victim or bystander the agents of communicable diseases are invaders non-communicable diseases constitute internal insurrection or civil war because the threat is urgent perhaps a matter of life and death unthinkably radical even oppressive measures are society's and the patient's moral duty as they courageously mobilize to struggle against destruction the war on cancer is an example of this metaphorical use of language this language is empowering to some patients but leaves others feeling like they are failures
another class of metaphors describes the experience of illness as a journey the person travels to or from a place of disease and changes himself discovers new information or increases his experience along the way he may travel on the road to recovery or make changes to get on the right track or choose pathways some are explicitly immigration-themed the patient has been exiled from the home territory of health to the land of the ill changing identity and relationships in the process this language is more common among british healthcare professionals than the language of physical aggression
some metaphors are disease-specific slavery is a common metaphor for addictions the alcoholic is enslaved by drink and the smoker is captive to nicotine some cancer patients treat the loss of their hair from chemotherapy as a metonymy or metaphor for all the losses caused by the disease
some diseases are used as metaphors for social ills cancer is a common description for anything that is endemic and destructive in society such as poverty injustice or racism aids was seen as a divine judgment for moral decadence and only by purging itself from the pollution of the invader could society become healthy again more recently when aids seemed less threatening this type of emotive language was applied to avian flu and type 2 diabetes mellitus authors in the 19th century commonly used tuberculosis as a symbol and a metaphor for transcendence victims of the disease were portrayed in literature as having risen above daily life to become ephemeral objects of spiritual or artistic achievement in the 20th century after its cause was better understood the same disease became the emblem of poverty squalor and other social problems
