pascals law principle transmission fluidpressure also pascals principle principle fluid mechanics states pressure exerted anywhere confined incompressible fluid transmitted equally directions throughout fluid pressure variations initial differences remain law established french mathematician blaise pascal
definition
pascals principle defined
principle stated mathematically
hydrostatic pressure given pascals si system difference pressure two points within fluid column due weight fluid
fluid density kilograms per cubic meter si system
g acceleration due gravity normally using sea level acceleration due earths gravity si metres per second squared
height fluid point measurement difference elevation two points within fluid column metres si
intuitive explanation formula change pressure two elevations due weight fluid elevations correct interpretation though pressure change caused change potential energy per unit volume liquid due existence gravitational field note variation height depend additional pressures therefore pascals law interpreted saying change pressure applied given point fluid transmitted undiminished throughout fluid
explanation
utube filled water pistons placed end pressure exerted left piston transmitted throughout liquid bottom right piston pistons simply plugs slide freely snugly inside tube pressure left piston exerts water exactly equal pressure water exerts right piston suppose tube right side made wider piston larger area used example piston right times area piston left n load placed left piston additional pressure due weight load transmitted throughout liquid larger piston difference force pressure important additional pressure exerted entire area larger piston since times area times much force exerted larger piston thus larger piston support n load fifty times load smaller piston
forces multiplied using device one newton input produces newtons output increasing area larger piston reducing area smaller piston forces multiplied principle amount pascals principle underlies operation hydraulic press hydraulic press violate energy conservation decrease distance moved compensates increase force small piston moved downward centimeters large piston raised onefiftieth centimeters input force multiplied distance moved smaller piston equal output force multiplied distance moved larger piston one example simple machine operating principle mechanical lever
