population genetics population ecology population size usually denoted n number individual organisms population
effective population size ne defined number breeding individuals idealized population would show amount dispersion allele frequencies random genetic drift amount inbreeding population consideration ne usually less n absolute population size important applications conservation genetics
small population size results increased genetic drift population bottlenecks population size reduces short period time
overpopulation may indicate case population species animal may exceed carrying capacity ecological niche
