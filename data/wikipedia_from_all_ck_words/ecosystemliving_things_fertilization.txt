pollen is a fine to coarse powder containing the microgametophytes of seed plants which produce the male gametes (sperm cells) pollen grains have a hard coat made of sporopollenin that protects the gametophytes during the process of their movement from the stamens to the pistil of flowering plants or from the male cone to the female cone of coniferous plants if pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone it germinates producing a pollen tube that transfers the sperm to the ovule containing the female gametophyte individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail the study of pollen is called palynology and is highly useful in paleoecology paleontology archaeology and forensics
pollen in plants is used for transferring haploid male genetic material from the anther of a single flower to the stigma of another in cross-pollination in a case of self-pollination this process takes place from the anther of a flower to the stigma of the same flower
== the structure and formation of pollenedit ==
pollen itself is not the male gamete each pollen grain contains vegetative (non-reproductive) cells (only a single cell in most flowering plants but several in other seed plants) and a generative (reproductive) cell in flowering plants the vegetative tube cell produces the pollen tube and the generative cell divides to form the two sperm cells
=== formationedit ===
pollen is produced in the microsporangium (contained in the anther of an angiosperm flower male cone of a coniferous plant or male cone of other seed plants) pollen grains come in a wide variety of shapes (most often spherical) sizes and surface markings characteristic of the species (see electron micrograph right) pollen grains of pines firs and spruces are winged the smallest pollen grain that of the forget-me-not (myosotis spp.) is around 6 m (0.006 mm) in diameter wind-borne pollen grains can be as large as about 90100 m
in angiosperms during flower development the anther is composed of a mass of cells that appear undifferentiated except for a partially differentiated dermis as the flower develops four groups of sporogenous cells form within the anther the fertile sporogenous cells are surrounded by layers of sterile cells that grow into the wall of the pollen sac some of the cells grow into nutritive cells that supply nutrition for the microspores that form by meiotic division from the sporogenous cells in a process called microsporogenesis four haploid microspores are produced from each diploid sporogenous cell (microsporocyte pollen mother cell or meiocyte) after meiotic division after the formation of the four microspores which are contained by callose walls the development of the pollen grain walls begins the callose wall is broken down by an enzyme called callase and the freed pollen grains grow in size and develop their characteristic shape and form a resistant outer wall called the exine and an inner wall called the intine the exine is what is preserved in the fossil record
in the microgametogenesis the unicellular microspores undergoes mitosis and develops into mature microgametophytes containing the gametes in some flowering plants germination of the pollen grain often begins before it leaves the microsporangium with the generative cell forming the two sperm cells
=== structureedit ===
except in the case of some submerged aquatic plants the mature pollen-grain has a double wall the vegetative and generative cells are surrounded by a thin delicate wall of unaltered cellulose called the endospore or intine and a tough resistant outer cuticularized wall composed largely of sporopollenin called the exospore or exine the exine often bears spines or warts or is variously sculptured and the character of the markings is often of value for identifying genus species or even cultivar or individual the spines may be less than a micron in length (spinulum plural spinuli) referred to as spinulose (scabrate) or longer than a micron (echina echinae) referred to as echinate various terms also describe the sculpturing such as reticulate a net like appearance consisting of elements (murus muri) separated from each other by a lumen (plural lumina)
the pollen wall protects the sperm while the pollen grain is moving from the anther to the stigma it protects the vital genetic material from drying out and solar radiation the pollen grain surface is covered with waxes and proteins which are held in place by structures called sculpture elements on the surface of the grain the outer pollen wall which prevents the pollen grain from shrinking and crushing the genetic material during desiccation is composed of two layers these two layers are the tectum and the foot layer which is just above the intine the tectum and foot layer are separated by a region called the columella which is composed of strengthening rods the outer wall is constructed with a resistant biopolymer called sporopollenin
the pollen tube passes through the pollen grain wall by way of structures called apertures the apertures are various modifications of the wall of the pollen grain that may involve thinning ridges and pores they allow shrinking and swelling of the grain caused by changes in moisture content elongated apertures or furrows in the pollen grain are called colpi (singular colpus) or sulci (singular sulcus) apertures that are more circular are called pores colpi sulci and pores are major features in the identification of classes of pollen pollen may be referred to as inaperturate (apertures absent) or aperturate (apertures present) the aperture may have a lid (operculum) hence is described as operculate
the orientation of furrows (relative to the original tetrad of microspores) classifies the pollen as sulcate or colpate sulcate pollen has a furrow across the middle of what was the outer face when the pollen grain was in its tetrad if the pollen has only a single sulcus it is described as monosulcate colpate pollen has furrows other than across the middle of the outer faces eudicots have pollen with three colpi (tricolpate) or with shapes that are evolutionarily derived from tricolpate pollen the evolutionary trend in plants has been from monosulcate to polycolpate or polyporate pollen
== pollinationedit ==
the transfer of pollen grains to the female reproductive structure (pistil in angiosperms) is called pollination this transfer can be mediated by the wind in which case the plant is described as anemophilous (literally wind-loving) anemophilous plants typically produce great quantities of very lightweight pollen grains sometimes with air-sacs non-flowering seed plants (e.g pine trees) are characteristically anemophilous anemophilous flowering plants generally have inconspicuous flowers entomophilous (literally insect-loving) plants produce pollen that is relatively heavy sticky and protein-rich for dispersal by insect pollinators attracted to their flowers many insects and some mites are specialized to feed on pollen and are called palynivores
in non-flowering seed plants pollen germinates in the pollen chamber located beneath the micropyle underneath the integuments of the ovule a pollen tube is produced which grows into the nucellus to provide nutrients for the developing sperm cells sperm cells of pinophyta and gnetophyta are without flagella and are carried by the pollen tube while those of cycadophyta and ginkgophyta have many flagella
when placed on the stigma of a flowering plant under favorable circumstances a pollen grain puts forth a pollen tube which grows down the tissue of the style to the ovary and makes its way along the placenta guided by projections or hairs to the micropyle of an ovule the nucleus of the tube cell has meanwhile passed into the tube as does also the generative nucleus which divides (if it hasn't already) to form two sperm cells the sperm cells are carried to their destination in the tip of the pollen-tube
== pollen in the fossil recordedit ==
pollen's sporopollenin outer sheath affords it some resistance to the rigours of the fossilisation process that destroy weaker objects it is also produced in huge quantities there is an extensive fossil record of pollen grains often disassociated from their parent plant the discipline of palynology is devoted to the study of pollen which can be used both for biostratigraphy and to gain information about the abundance and variety of plants alive which can itself yield important information about paleoclimates pollen is first found in the fossil record in the late devonian period and increases in abundance until the present day
== allergy to pollenedit ==
nasal allergy to pollen is called pollinosis and allergy specifically to grass pollen is called hay fever generally pollens that cause allergies are those of anemophilous plants (pollen is dispersed by air currents.) such plants produce large quantities of lightweight pollen (because wind dispersal is random and the likelihood of one pollen grain landing on another flower is small) which can be carried for great distances and are easily inhaled bringing it into contact with the sensitive nasal passages
in the us people often mistakenly blame the conspicuous goldenrod flower for allergies since this plant is entomophilous (its pollen is dispersed by animals) its heavy sticky pollen does not become independently airborne most late summer and fall pollen allergies are probably caused by ragweed a widespread anemophilous plant
arizona was once regarded as a haven for people with pollen allergies although several ragweed species grow in the desert however as suburbs grew and people began establishing irrigated lawns and gardens more irritating species of ragweed gained a foothold and arizona lost its claim of freedom from hay fever
anemophilous spring blooming plants such as oak birch hickory pecan and early summer grasses may also induce pollen allergies most cultivated plants with showy flowers are entomophilous and do not cause pollen allergies
the percentage of people in the united states affected by hay fever varies between 10% and 20% and such allergy has proven to be the most frequent allergic response in the nation there are certain evidential suggestions pointing out hay fever and similar allergies to be of hereditary origin individuals who suffer from eczema or are asthmatic tend to be more susceptible to developing long-term hay fever
in denmark decades of rising temperatures cause pollen to appear earlier and in greater numbers as well as introduction of new species such as ragweed
the most efficient way to handle a pollen allergy is by preventing contact with the material individuals carrying the ailment may at first believe that they have a simple summer cold but hay fever becomes more evident when the apparent cold does not disappear the confirmation of hay fever can be obtained after examination by a general physician
=== treatmentedit ===
antihistamines are effective at treating mild cases of pollinosis this type of non-prescribed drugs includes loratadine cetirizine and chlorphenamine they do not prevent the discharge of histamine but it has been proven that they do prevent a part of the chain reaction activated by this biogenic amine which considerably lowers hay fever symptoms
decongestants can be administered in different ways such as tablets and nasal sprays
allergy immunotherapy (ait) treatment involves administering doses of allergens to accustom the body to pollen thereby inducing specific long-term tolerance allergy immunotherapy can be administered orally (as sublingual tablets or sublingual drops) or by injections under the skin (subcutaneous) discovered by leonard noon and john freeman in 1911 allergy immunotherapy represents the only causative treatment for respiratory allergies
== nutritionedit ==
most major classes of predatory and parasitic arthropods contain species that eat pollen despite the common perception that bees are the primary pollen-consuming arthropod group many other hymenoptera other than bees consume pollen as adults though only a small number feed on pollen as larvae (including some ant larvae) spiders are normally considered carnivores but pollen is an important source of food for several species particularly for spiderlings which catch pollen on their webs it is not clear how spiderlings manage to eat pollen however since their mouths are not large enough to consume pollen grains some predatory mites also feed on pollen with some species being able to subsist solely on pollen such as euseius tularensis which feeds on the pollen of dozens of plant species members of some beetle families such as mordellidae and melyridae feed almost exclusively on pollen as adults while various lineages within larger families such as curculionidae chrysomelidae cerambycidae and scarabaeidae are pollen specialists even though most members of their families are not (e.g. only 36 of 40000 species of ground beetles which are typically predatory have been shown to eat pollenbut this is thought to be a severe underestimate as the feeding habits are only known for 1000 species) similarly ladybird beetles mainly eat insects but many species also eat pollen as either part or all of their diet hemiptera are mostly herbivores or omnivores but pollen feeding is known (and has only been well studied in the anthocoridae) many adult flies especially syrphidae feed on pollen and three uk syrphid species feed strictly on pollen (syrphids like all flies cannot eat pollen directly due to the structure of their mouthparts but can consume pollen contents that are dissolved in a fluid) some species of fungus including fomes fomentarius are able to break down grains of pollen as a secondary nutrition source that is particularly high in nitrogen
some species of heliconius butterflies consume pollen as adults which appears to be a valuable nutrient source and these species are more distasteful to predators than the non-pollen consuming species
although bats butterflies and hummingbirds are not pollen eaters per se their consumption of nectar in flowers is an important aspect of the pollination process
=== in humansedit ===
a variety of producers have started selling bee pollen for human consumption often marketed as a food (rather than a dietary supplement) the largest constituent is carbohydrates with protein content ranging from 7 to 35 percent depending on the plant species collected by bees
honey produced by bees from natural sources contains pollen derived p-coumaric acid an antioxidant
the u.s food and drug administration (fda) has not found any harmful effects of bee pollen consumption except from the usual allergies however fda does not allow bee pollen marketers in the united states to make health claims about their produce as no scientific basis for these has ever been proven furthermore there are possible dangers not only from allergic reactions but also from contaminants such as pesticides and from fungi and bacteria growth related to poor storage procedures a manufacturers's claim that pollen collecting helps the bee colonies is also controversial
pine pollen ( songhwa garu) is traditionally consumed in korea as an ingredient in sweets and beverages
== forensic palynologyedit ==
in forensic biology pollen can tell a lot about where a person or object has been because regions of the world or even more particular locations such a certain set of bushes will have a distinctive collection of pollen species pollen evidence can also reveal the season in which a particular object picked up the pollen pollen has been used to trace activity at mass graves in bosnia catch a burglar who brushed against a hypericum bush during a crime and has even been proposed as an additive for bullets to enable tracking them
