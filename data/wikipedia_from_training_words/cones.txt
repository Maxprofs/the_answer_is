a cone is a three-dimensional geometric shape that tapers smoothly from a flat base (frequently though not necessarily circular) to a point called the apex or vertex
more precisely it is the solid figure bounded by a base in a plane and by a surface (called the lateral surface) formed by the locus of all straight line segments joining the apex to the perimeter of the base the term cone sometimes refers just to the surface of this solid figure or just to the lateral surface
the axis of a cone is the straight line (if any) passing through the apex about which the base (and the whole cone) has a circular symmetry
in common usage in elementary geometry cones are assumed to be right circular where circular means that the base is a circle and right means that the axis passes through the centre of the base at right angles to its plane contrasted with right cones are oblique cones in which the axis does not pass perpendicularly through the centre of the base in general however the base may be any shape and the apex may lie anywhere (though it is usually assumed that the base is bounded and therefore has finite area and that the apex lies outside the plane of the base)
a cone with a polygonal base is called a pyramid
== other mathematical meaningsedit ==
in mathematical usage the word cone is used also for an infinite cone the union of a set of half-lines that start at a common apex point and go through a base an infinite cone is not bounded by its base but extends to infinity a doubly infinite cone or double cone is the union of a set of straight lines that pass through a common apex point and go through a base therefore double infinite cones extend symmetrically on both sides of the apex
the boundary of an infinite or doubly infinite cone is a conical surface and the intersection of a plane with this surface is a conic section for infinite cones the word axis again usually refers to the axis of rotational symmetry (if any) either half of a double cone on one side of the apex is called a nappe
depending on the context cone may also mean specifically a convex cone or a projective cone
== further terminologyedit ==
the perimeter of the base of a cone is called the directrix and each of the line segments between the directrix and apex is a generatrix of the lateral surface (for the connection between this sense of the term directrix and the directrix of a conic section see dandelin spheres.)
the volume and the surface area for a straight cone are described in the geometry section below
the base radius of a circular cone is the radius of its base often this is simply called the radius of the cone the aperture of a right circular cone is the maximum angle between two generatrix lines if the generatrix makes an angle to the axis the aperture is 2
a cone with its apex cut off by a plane is called a truncated cone if the truncation plane is parallel to the cone's base it is called a frustum an elliptical cone is a cone with an elliptical base a generalized cone is the surface created by the set of lines passing through a vertex and every point on a boundary (also see visual hull)
== cartesian coordinatesedit ==
in the cartesian coordinate system an elliptic cone is the locus of an equation of the form

=== surface areaedit ===
the lateral surface area of a right circular cone is where is the radius of the circle at the bottom of the cone and is the lateral height of the cone (given by the pythagorean theorem where is the height of the cone) the surface area of the bottom circle of a cone is the same as for any circle  thus the total surface area of a right circular cone is
or
also there is another formula for finding lateral surface area by using only circumference and slant height
where c is circumference
=== volumeedit ===
the volume of any conic solid is one third of the product of the area of the base and the height
in modern mathematics this formula can easily be computed using calculus it is up to scaling the integral without using calculus the formula can be proven by comparing the cone to a pyramid and applying cavalieri's principle specifically comparing the cone to a (vertically scaled) right square pyramid which forms one third of a cube this formula cannot be proven without using such infinitesimal arguments unlike the 2-dimensional formulae for polyhedral area though similar to the area of the circle and hence admitted less rigorous proofs before the advent of calculus with the ancient greeks using the method of exhaustion this is essentially the content of hilbert's third problem more precisely not all polyhedral pyramids are scissors congruent (can be cut apart into finite pieces and rearranged into the other) and thus volume cannot be computed purely by using a decomposition argument
the volume of the cone is also related to the summation of square numbers
=== center of massedit ===
the center of mass of a conic solid of uniform density lies one-quarter of the way from the center of the base to the vertex on the straight line joining the two
=== right circular coneedit ===
for a circular cone with radius r and height h the formula for volume becomes
where r is the radius of the cone at height h measured from the apex
thus
thus
for a right circular cone the surface area is
where is the slant height
the first term in the area formula  is the area of the base while the second term  is the area of the lateral surface
a right circular cone with height and aperture  whose axis is the coordinate axis and whose apex is the origin is described parametrically as
where range over   and  respectively
in implicit form the same solid is defined by the inequalities
where
more generally a right circular cone with vertex at the origin axis parallel to the vector  and aperture  is given by the implicit vector equation where
or
where  and denotes the dot product
== projective geometryedit ==
in projective geometry a cylinder is simply a cone whose apex is at infinity intuitively if one keeps the base fixed and takes the limit as the apex goes to infinity one obtains a cylinder the angle of the side increasing as arctan in the limit forming a right angle
this is useful in the definition of degenerate conics which require considering the cylindrical conics
