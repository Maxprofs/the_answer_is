== turkey ==
turkish stem education task force (or fetemmfen bilimleri teknoloji mhendislik ve matematik) is a coalition of academicians and teachers who show an effort to increase the quality of education in stem fields rather than focussing on increasing the number of stem graduates
== qatar ==
qatar took the initiation to activate stem through al-bairaq program al-bairaq is carried out by center for advanced materials (cam) at qatar university and targets high-school students with a curriculum that focuses on stem al-bairaq engages high school students in scientific activities which enhances their skills motivation and interest and guide them in their future career each year around 946 students participate in al-bairaq competitions with about 40 high schools in qatar
what is special in al-bairaq project is that it links between learning and fun which motivate youth to join it it doesn't depend on the ready prepared lessons but make the students to be partners in the learning process al-bairaq also gives the students the freedom for discovering their abilities and skills al-bairaq engages students and increases motivation with project-based learning encourages students to solve authentic problems and inquires them to work with each other as a team to build real solutions al-bairaq is cultural achievements that reflect student's humanity power the economy for our country
the effects of al-bairaq on the secondary school students are supported by the results of a research which was carried out in qatar as they concluded that advanced learning environment resulted in the improvement of the students ability to acquire and retain new knowledge furthermore advanced learning environment had direct positive impact on students attitude towards research and students gained positive attitude towards work as well
== women ==
current campaigns to increase the gender balance within stem fields include the uk's wise as well as mentoring programs such as the million women mentors initiative connecting girls and young women with stem mentors and verizon's #inspirehermind project the us office of science and technology policy during the obama administration is collaborating with the white house council on women and girls to increase the participation of women and girls within stem fields along with the educate to innovate campaign
women in stem fields are often underrepresented holding less than 25% of the jobs in the u.s and 13% in the uk (2014) in the united states studies have been conducted to explain this pattern such as mechanisms in recruitment and hiring processes on average women in stem fields earn 33% more than those in non-stem professions however women can be found as leaders in top professions around the country these include the u.s department of defense nasa and the national science foundation (nsf)
though women nearly comprise half of the us workforce they've held less than 25% of stem jobs consistently over the last decade women and other minorities account for 75% of college students but earn only 45% of stem degrees each year while 12% of women in bachelor programs will get a degree in stem each year only 3% go on to work within the stem field according to the national science foundation only 5% of asian women 5% of african american women and 2% of hispanic women constitute scientist and engineering labor force in the u.s while nearly 60% of bachelor's degrees are awarded to graduating women each year less than 20% are in computer science
part of this disconnect can be attributed to biases of those who do the hiring for positions in stem a 2012 study in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the united states showed that an implicit bias exists against hiring women for even entry-level stem positions this study had faculty members in university biology chemistry and physics departments judge applications for a laboratory manager position these applications only differed in name (john vs jennifer) faculty members of both sex viewed men as more competent and thus more hirable and also offered male applicants higher starting salaries and more career mentoring though faculty participants reported that they thought female applicants were more likable they still reported them as being less competent than their male counterparts trending towards hiring the male applicant these trends were present in both male and female faculty members showing that the implicit bias is present in both males and females
== criticism of the stem concept ==
the focus on increasing participation in stem fields has attracted criticism in the 2014 article the myth of the science and engineering shortage in the atlantic demographer michael s teitelbaum criticized the efforts of the u.s government to increase the number of stem graduates saying that among studies on the subject no one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelors degrees or higher and that most studies report that real wages in manybut not allscience and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations. teitelbaum also wrote that the then-current national fixation on increasing stem participation paralleled previous u.s government efforts since world war ii to increase the number of scientists and engineers all of which he stated ultimately ended up in mass layoffs hiring freezes and funding cuts including one driven by the space race of the late 1950s and 1960s which he wrote led to a bust of serious magnitude in the 1970s.
ieee spectrum contributing editor robert n charette echoed these sentiments in the 2013 article the stem crisis is a myth also noting that there was a mismatch between earning a stem degree and having a stem job in the united states with only around 1/4 of stem graduates working in stem fields while less than half of workers in stem fields have a stem degree there is even greater discrepancy to be found among women and people of color between those graduate with a stem degree and those who are hired in a stem field
economics writer ben casselman in a 2014 study of post-graduation earnings for fivethirtyeight wrote that based on the data science should not be grouped with the other three stem categories because while the other three generally result in high-paying jobs many sciences particularly the life sciences pay below the overall median for recent college graduates.
