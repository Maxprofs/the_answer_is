breathing process moves air lungs oxygen respiratory organs gills organisms lungs breathing also called ventilation includes inhalation exhalation breathing one part physiological respiration required sustain life aerobic organisms birds mammals reptilesrequire oxygen release energy via cellular respiration form metabolism energyrich molecules glucose breathing one processes deliver oxygen needed body remove carbon dioxide another important process involves movement blood circulatory system gas exchange occurs pulmonary alveoli passive diffusion gases alveolar gas blood lung capillaries dissolved gases blood heart powers flow around body via circulatory system medical term normal relaxed breathing eupnea
addition removing carbon dioxide breathing results loss water body exhaled air relative humidity water diffusing across moist surface breathing passages alveoli person exhales cold outdoor air moistureladen atmosphere lungs becomes chilled point water condenses fog making exhale visible anyone
mechanics
mammals breathing inhaling due contraction flattening diaphragm domed muscle separates thorax abdomen abdomen relaxed contraction causes abdomen bulge outwards expanding volume body increased volume causes fall pressure thorax causes expansion lungs diaphragm relaxes air leaves largely elasticity lung quiet relaxed breathing needing little energy need increases abdominal muscles resist expansion increased abdominal pressure tilts diaphragm ribcage upwards increase volume entry air expiration follows relaxation diaphragm abdominal muscles increased downward action abdominal muscles rib cage forced expiration increases pressure across airways walls may lead narrowing perhaps wheezing speech depends balance two forms breathing humans conscious change often modifies autonomous reaction need pattern vary fear anticipation need anxiety may conditioned experience loss inhaler also affected loss lung elasticity age pulmonary disease abdominal expansion obesity muscle power resist expansion pull ribcage ten muscles used inspiration
diaphragm intercostal muscles scalenes pectoralis minor serratus anterior sternocleidomastoid levator costarum upper superior trapezius latissimus dorsi subclavius

internal intercostal obliquus internus obliquus externus levator ani triangularis sterni transversalis pyramidalis rectus abdominus
amphibians process used positive pressure breathing muscles lower floor oral cavity enlarging drawing air nostrils uses mechanics pressure volume diffusion mammalian lung nostrils mouth closed floor oral cavity forced forces air trachea lungs
control breathing
breathing one bodily functions within limits controlled consciously unconsciously
conscious control
conscious control breathing common many forms meditation specifically forms yoga example pranayama
swimming cardio fitness speech vocal training one learns discipline ones breathing initially consciously later subconsciously purposes life support
human speech also dependent conscious breath control
also breathing control used buteyko method alternative physical therapy proposes use breathing exercises treatment asthma conditions
unconscious control
unconsciously breathing controlled specialized centers brainstem automatically regulates rate depth breathing depending bodys needs time carbon dioxide levels increase blood reacts water blood producing carbonic acid lactic acid produced fermentation exercise also lowers ph drop bloods ph stimulates chemoreceptors carotid aortic bodies well inside respiratory center medulla oblongata chemoreceptors send nerve impulses respiration centre medulla oblongata pons brain turn send nerve impulses phrenic thoracic nerves diaphragm
examples
instance exercising level carbon dioxide blood increases due increased cellular respiration muscles activates carotid aortic bodies respiration center ultimately cause higher rate respiration
rest level carbon dioxide lower breathing rate lower ensures appropriate amount oxygen delivered muscles organs important reiterate buildup carbon dioxide making blood acidic elicits desperation breath much lack oxygen
interaction
possible healthy person voluntarily stop breathing indefinitely one inhale level carbon dioxide builds blood one experiences overwhelming air hunger irrepressible reflex surprising given without breathing bodys internal oxygen levels drop dangerously low within minutes leading permanent brain damage followed eventually death however instances people survived long two hours without air possible submerged cold water triggers mammalian diving reflex well putting subject state suspended animation
healthy person voluntarily stop breathing ie hold breath long enough amount time would lose consciousness body would resume breathing one cannot commit suicide method unless ones breathing also restricted something else eg water see drowning
hyperventilating causes drop co normal levels lowering blood oxygen supply vital organs due coinduced vasoconstriction suppressed bohr effect voluntary hyperventilation cause tissue oxygen levels go dangerously low levels leading example fainting due brain hypoxia
composition
air inhale roughly composed volume
nitrogen
oxygen
argon
addition air underwater divers often breathe oxygenrich heliumrich gas mixtures oxygen analgesic gases sometimes given patients medical care atmosphere space suits pure oxygen also reliance relatively small amount oxygen cause overactivity euphoria pure oxygenrich environments
permanent gases gas exhale volume carbon dioxide volume less oxygen inhaled expired air typically composed
nitrogen
oxygen
carbon dioxide
argon gases
additionally vapors trace gases present water vapor several parts per million ppm hydrogen carbon monoxide part per million ppm ammonia less ppm acetone methanol ethanol unless ethanol ingested case much higher concentrations would occur breath cf breathalyzer volatile organic compounds oxygen used body cellular respiration uses carbon dioxide product processes exact amount exhaled oxygen carbon dioxide breathing amount gases exhaled may vary based diet exercise fitness
air pressure
atmospheric air altitude lower pressure sea level due lesser weight air lower pressure lead altitude sickness hypoxia
gases breathed underwater higher pressure sea level due added weight water lead nitrogen narcosis oxygen toxicity decompression sickness
