moseley and the surrounding areas were much developed after 1910 being built upon the once extensive farm land that was predominant in this area the new properties being mostly of large houses designed to cater for the edwardian middle-class families that settled in the suburbs surrounding birmingham's industrial centre these large houses relied upon at least one servant or tweeny as they were often termed to help the lady of the house run the household with the advent of the first world war staff were hard to find to maintain houses of this size the heating bills and high maintenance made them unpopular after the war and many were split into flats to cater for the requirements of the expanding working population who moved from the city centre as extensive redevelopment took place in the 1960s
