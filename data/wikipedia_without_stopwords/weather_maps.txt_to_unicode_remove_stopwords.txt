history
use weather charts modern sense began middle portion th century order devise theory storm systems crimean war storm devastated french fleet balaklava french scientist urbain le verrier able show chronological map storm issued path would take could predicted avoided fleet
england scientist francis galton heard work well pioneering weather forecasts robert fitzroy gathering information weather stations across country month october plotted data map using system symbols thereby creating worlds first weather map used map prove air circulated clockwise around areas high pressure coined term anticyclone describe phenomenon also instrumental publishing first weather map newspaper modified pantograph instrument copying drawings inscribe map onto printing blocks times began printing weather maps using methods data meteorological office
introduction countrywide weather maps required existence national telegraph networks data across country could gathered real time remain relevant subsequent analysis first use telegraph gathering data weather manchester examiner newspaper
led us inquire electric telegraph yet extended far enough manchester obtain information eastern countiesinquiries made following places answers returned append
also important time standardized across time zones information map accurately represent weather given time standardized time system first used coordinate british railway network inauguration greenwich mean time
usa smithsonian institution developed network observers much central eastern united states joseph henry took helm us army signal corps inherited network act congress expanded west coast soon afterwards first data map used due lack time standardization united states fully adopted time zones detroit finally established standard time
th century
use frontal zones weather maps began norway polar front theory attributed jacob bjerknes derived coastal network observation sites norway world war theory proposed main inflow cyclone concentrated along two lines convergence one ahead low another trailing behind low convergence line ahead low became known either steering line warm front trailing convergence zone referred squall line cold front areas clouds rainfall appeared focused along convergence zones concept frontal zones led concept air masses nature threedimensional structure cyclone would wait development upper air network since leading edge air mass changes bore resemblance military fronts world war term front came use represent lines united states began formally analyze fronts surface analyses late wban analysis center opened downtown washington dc
addition surface weather maps weather agencies began generate constant pressure charts united states began daily weather map series first analyzed hpa level around metres ft sea level may hpa surface analyzed metres ft sea level effort automate map plotting began united states process complete hong kong completed process automated surface plotting
computer systems software finally become sophisticated enough allow ability underlay workstation satellite imagery radar imagery modelderived fields atmospheric thickness frontogenesis combination surface observations make best possible surface analysis united states development achieved intergraph workstations replaced nawips workstations various surface analyses done within national weather service combined unified surface analysis issued every six hours combines analyses four different centers recent advances fields meteorology geographic information systems made possible devise finely tailored products take us traditional weather map entirely new realm weather information quickly matched relevant geographical detail instance icing conditions mapped onto road network likely continue lead changes way surface analyses created displayed next several years
plotting data
station model symbolic illustration showing weather occurring given reporting station meteorologists created station model plot number weather elements small space weather maps maps filled dense stationmodel plots difficult read allow meteorologists pilots mariners see important weather patterns computer draws station model observation location station model primarily used surfaceweather maps also used show weather aloft completed stationmodel map allows users analyze patterns air pressure temperature wind cloud cover precipitation
station model plots use internationally accepted coding convention changed little since august elements plot show key weather elements including temperature dewpoint wind cloud cover air pressure pressure tendency precipitation winds standard notation plotted weather maps century ago winds plotted arrows feathers one side depicting five knots wind feathers sides depicted knots kmh wind notation changed half arrow half wind barb indicating five knots full barb ten knots pennant flag fifty knots
