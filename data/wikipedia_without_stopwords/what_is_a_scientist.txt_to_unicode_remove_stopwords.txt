computer scientist scientist acquired knowledge computer science study theoretical foundations information computation application
computer scientists typically work theoretical side computer systems opposed hardware side computer engineers mainly focus although overlap although computer scientists also focus work research specific areas algorithm data structure development design software engineering information theory database theory computational complexity theory numerical analysis programming language theory computer graphics computer vision foundation theoretical study computing fields derive
primary goal computer scientists development validation modelsoften mathematical naturefor estimating properties computerbased systems processors programs computers interaction people computers interacting computers etc overarching objective discovering designs admit improved performance faster better cheaper etc
education
computer scientists required possess phd ms bs computer science similar fields like cis closely related discipline mathematics strong aptitude mathematics important computer scientist
good communication skills also important computer scientist since key part good scientist conveying results use others generally via wellcrafted publications presentations additionally since computer scientists often work teams realworld projects must able communicate effectively computer personnel programmers managers well users staff may technical computer background
employment
computer scientists often hired software publishing firms scientific research development organizations develop theories allow new technologies developed computer scientists also employed educational institutions universities
computer scientists follow practical applications knowledge things software engineering computer scientists also found field information technology consulting computer scientists also seen type mathematician seeing much field dependent mathematics
computer scientists employed industry may eventually advance managerial project leadership positions
employment prospects computer scientists said excellent excellent prospects seem attributed part rapid growth computer systems design related services industry well software publishing industry projected among fastest growing industries us economy
