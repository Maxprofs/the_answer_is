sight important lizards locating prey communication many lizards highly acute color vision lizards rely heavily body language using specific postures gestures movements define territory resolve disputes entice mates species lizards also use bright colors iridescent patches belly sceloporus colors would highly visible predators often hidden underside scales revealed necessary
particular innovation respect dewlap brightly colored patch skin throat usually hidden scales display needed lizard erect hyoid bone throat resulting large vertical flap brightly colored skin beneath head used communication anoles particularly famous display species specific colors including patterns visible ultraviolet uv light many lizards see uv light
shedding regenerating tailsedit
lizard tails often different dramatically vivid color rest body encourage potential predators strike tail first
many lizard species including geckos skinks others capable shedding part tails process called autotomy example pars pro toto principle sacrificing part whole employed lizards allow escape captured tail predator detached tail writhes wiggles creating deceptive sense continued struggle distracting predators attention fleeing prey animal
lizard partially regenerate tail period weeks research identified genes involving regeneration lizard tails new section contain cartilage rather bone skin may distinctly discolored compared rest body
reproductionedit
lizards oviparous egg laying though species eggs retained live young emerge parthenogenesis squamata asexual reproduction occurs species lizard believed female ability absence males widespread among lizards
evolution relationshipsedit
sexual selection lizards shows evidence female mate choice males found favouring males display fitness indicators less ectoparasites
retention basic reptilian amniote body form lizards makes tempting assume similar animal alive extinct also lizard however case lizards squamates part welldefined group
earliest amniotes superficially lizardlike solid boxlike skulls openings eyes nostrils termed anapsid condition turtles retain reevolved skull form early anapsids later gave rise two new groups additional holes skulls make room anchor larger jaw muscles synapsids single fenestra gave rise large generally lizardlike pelycosaurs include dimetrodon group gave rise therapsids including cynodonts modern mammals would evolve
modern sphenodon retains basic lepidosaur skull distinguishing true lizards spite superficial similarities squamates including snakes true lizards lightened skull eliminating lower margin lower skull opening
