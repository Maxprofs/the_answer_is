transduction bacterial genes bacteriophage appears consequence infrequent errors intracellular assembly virus particles rather bacterial adaptation conjugation muchstudied e coli system determined plasmid genes adaptation transferring copies plasmid one bacterial host another seldom conjugative plasmid integrates host bacterial chromosome subsequently transfers part host bacterial dna another bacterium plasmidmediated transfer host bacterial dna also appears accidental process rather bacterial adaptation
transformation unlike transduction conjugation depends numerous bacterial gene products specifically interact perform complex process thus transformation clearly bacterial adaptation dna transfer order bacterium bind take recombine donor dna chromosome must first enter special physiological state termed competence see natural competence bacillus subtilis genes required development competence length dna transferred b subtilis transformation third chromosome whole chromosome transformation appears common among bacterial species thus far least species known natural ability become competent transformation development competence nature usually associated stressful environmental conditions seems adaptation facilitating repair dna damage recipient cells
