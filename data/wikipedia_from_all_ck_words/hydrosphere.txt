the hydrosphere (from greek - hydr water and - sphaira sphere") in physical geography describes the combined mass of water found on under and over the surface of a planet
igor shiklomanov the man selected by the united nations to do its world inventory of water resources estimated that there are 1386 million cubic kilometres of water on earth this includes water in liquid and frozen forms in groundwater glaciers oceans lakes and streams saltwater accounts for 97.5% of this amount fresh water accounts for only 2.5% of this fresh water 68.7% is in the form of ice and permanent snow cover in the arctic the antarctic and in the mountainous regions next 29.9% exists as fresh groundwaters only 0.26% of the total amount of fresh waters on planet earth is easily accessible it is found in lakes reservoirs and river systems the principal elements of water ecosystems. the total mass of the earth's hydrosphere is about 1.4 1018 tonnes which is about 0.023% of the earth's total mass about 20 1012 tonnes of this is in the earth's atmosphere (for practical purposes 1 cubic metre of water weighs one tonne) approximately 75% of the earth's surface an area of some 361 million square kilometers (139.5 million square miles) is covered by ocean the average salinity of the earth's oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5%)
== water cycleedit ==
the hydrological cycle transfers water from one state or reservoir to another reservoirs include atmospheric moisture (snow rain and clouds) oceans rivers lakes groundwater subterranean aquifers polar icecaps and saturated soil solar energy in the form of heat and light (insolation) and gravity cause the transfer from one state to another over periods from hours to thousands of years most evaporation comes from the oceans and is returned to the earth as snow or rain (page 27) sublimation refers to evaporation from snow and ice transpiration refers to the expiration of water through the minute pores or stomata of trees evapotranspiration is the term used by hydrologists in reference to the three processes together transpiration sublimation and evaporation
in his book water marq de villiers described the hydrosphere as a closed system in which water exists the hydrosphere is intricate complex interdependent all-pervading and stable and seems purpose-built for regulating life (de villiers 2003:26). de villiers claimed that on earth the total amount of water has almost certainly not changed since geological times what we had then we still have water can be polluted abused and misused but it is neither created nor destroyed it only migrates there is no evidence that water vapor escapes into space (page 26).
every year the turnover of water on earth involves 577,000 km3 of water this is water that evaporates from the oceanic surface (502,800 km3) and from land (74,200 km3) the same amount of water falls as atmospheric precipitation 458,000 km3 on the ocean and 119,000 km3 on land the difference between precipitation and evaporation from the land surface (119,000 - 74,200 = 44,800 km3/year) represents the total runoff of the earth's rivers (42,700 km3/year) and direct groundwater runoff to the ocean (2100 km3/year) these are the principal sources of fresh water to support life necessities and man's economic activities.
water is a basic necessity of life since 2/3 of the earth is covered by water the earth is also called the blue planet and the watery planet hydrosphere plays an important role in the existence of the atmosphere in its present form oceans are important in this regard when the earth was formed it had only a very thin atmosphere rich in hydrogen and helium similar to the present atmosphere of mercury later the gases hydrogen and helium were expelled from the atmosphere the gases and water vapor released as the earth cooled became our present atmosphere other gases and water vapor released by volcanoes also entered the atmosphere as the earth cooled the water vapor in the atmosphere condensed and fell as rain the atmosphere cooled further as atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolved in to rain water in turn this further caused the water vapor to condense and fall as rain this rain water filled the depressions on the earth's surface and formed the oceans it is estimated that this occurred about 4000 million years ago the first life forms began in the oceans these organisms did not breathe oxygen later when cyanobacteria evolved the process of conversion of carbon dioxide into food and oxygen began as a result our atmosphere has a distinctly different composition from that of the other planets it is a fundamental requirement for life on earth
== recharging reservoirsedit ==
according to igor a shiklomanov it takes 2500 years for the complete recharge and replenishment of oceanic waters 10,000 years for permafrost and ice 1500 years for deep groundwater and mountainous glaciers 17 years in lakes and 16 days in rivers
== specific fresh water availabilityedit ==
specific water availability is the residual (after use) per capita quantity of fresh water. fresh water resources are unevenly distributed in terms of space and time and can go from floods to water shortages within months in the same area in 1998 76% of the total population had a specific water availability of less than 5.0 thousand m3 per year per capita already by 1998 35% of the global population suffered very low or catastrophically low water supplies and shiklomanov predicted that the situation would deteriorate in the twenty-first century with most of the earth's population will be living under the conditions of low or catastrophically low water supply by 2025 there is only 2.5% of fresh water in the hydrosphere
