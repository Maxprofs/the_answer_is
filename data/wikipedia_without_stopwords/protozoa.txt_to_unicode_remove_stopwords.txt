systems biological classification protozoa diverse group unicellular eukaryotic organisms historically protozoa defined singlecelled organisms animallike behaviors motility predation group regarded zoological counterpart protophyta considered plantlike capable photosynthesis terms protozoa protozoans also used informally designate singlecelled nonphotosynthetic protists ciliates amoebae flagellates

history terminology
word protozoa singular protozoon protozoan coined zoologist georg august goldfuss greek equivalent german urthiere meaning primitive original animals goldfuss erected protozoa class containing believed simplest animals originally group included microbes also lower multicellular animals rotifers corals sponges jellyfish bryozoa polychaete worms
light advancements cell theory pioneered theodore schwann matthias schleiden anatomist zoologist ct von siebold proposed bodies microbial organisms ciliates amoebae made single cells similar multicellular tissues plants animals constructed von siebold redefined protozoa include unicellular forms exclusion metazoa time raised group level phylum containing two broad classes microbes infusoria mostly ciliates flagellated algae rhizopoda amoeboid organisms definition protozoa phylum subkingdom made unicellular animals adopted zoologist otto btschlicelebrated centenary architect protozoologyand term came wide use
phylum animalia protozoa firmly rooted old twokingdom classification life according living beings classified either animals plants long scheme remained dominant protozoa understood animals studied departments zoology photosynthetic microbes microscopic fungithe socalled protophytawere assigned plants studied departments botany
criticism system began latter half th century realization many organisms met criteria inclusion among plants animals example algae euglena dinobryon chloroplasts photosynthesis also feed organic matter motile john hogg argued use protozoa grounds naturalists divided opinionand probably ever continue sowhether many organisms living beings animals plants alternative proposed new kingdom called primigenum consisting protozoa unicellular algae protophyta combined together name protoctista hoggss conception animal plant kingdoms likened two great pyramids blending bases kingdom primigenum
six years later ernst haeckel also proposed third kingdom life named protista first haeckel included multicellular organisms kingdom later work restricted protista singlecelled organisms simple colonies whose individual cells differentiated different kinds tissues
despite proposals protozoa emerged preferred taxonomic placement heterotrophic microbes amoebae ciliates remained century course th century however old two kingdom system began weaken growing awareness fungi belong among plants unicellular protozoa closely related animals plants midcentury biologists herbert f copeland robert h whittaker lynn margulis advocated revival haeckels protista hoggs protoctista kingdomlevel eukaryotic group alongside plants animals fungi variety multikingdom systems proposed kingdoms protista protoctista became well established biology texts curricula
many taxonomists abandoned protozoa highlevel group thomas cavaliersmith retained kingdom various classifications proposed cavaliersmiths protozoa excludes several major groups organisms traditionally placed among protozoa including ciliates dinoflagellates foraminifera members sar supergroup current form kingdom protozoa paraphyletic group includes common ancestor descendents excludes two important clades branch within animals fungi
characteristics
protozoa traditionally defined mainly microscopic organisms ranging size micrometers however significantly larger among largest deepsea dwelling xenophyophores singlecelled foraminifera whose shells reach cm diameter freeliving forms restricted moist environments soils mosses aquatic habitats although many form resting cysts enable survive drying many protozoan species symbionts parasites predators bacteria algae protists
motility feeding
organisms traditionally classified protozoa abundant aqueous environments soil occupying range trophic levels group includes flagellates move help whiplike structures called flagella ciliates move using hairlike structures called cilia amoebae move use footlike structures called pseudopodia protozoa sessile move
protozoa may take food osmotrophy absorbing nutrients cell membranes may feed phagocytosis either engulfing particles food pseudopodia amoebae taking food mouthlike aperture called cytostome protozoa digest food stomachlike compartments called vacuoles
pellicle
pellicle thin layer supporting cell membrane various protozoa ciliates protecting allowing retain shape especially locomotion allowing organism hydrodynamic pellicle varies flexible elastic rigid although somewhat stiff pellicle also flexible allows protist fit tighter spaces ciliates apicomplexa formed closely packed vesicles called alveoli euglenids formed protein strips arranged spirally along length body familiar examples protists pellicle euglenoids ciliate paramecium protozoa pellicle hosts epibiotic bacteria adhere surface fimbriae attachment pili
ecological role
components micro meiofauna protozoa important food source microinvertebrates thus ecological role protozoa transfer bacterial algal production successive trophic levels important predators prey upon unicellular filamentous algae bacteria microfungi protozoan species include herbivores consumers decomposer link food chain also control bacteria populations biomass extent average protozoa eat bacteria per hour protozoa malaria parasites plasmodium spp trypanosomes leishmania important diseasecausing agents humans protozoa stimulate decomposition organic matter digest cellulose rumen cows termite guts play role nutrient mobilization
life cycle
protozoa life phases alternating proliferative stages eg trophozoites dormant cysts cysts protozoa survive harsh conditions exposure extreme temperatures harmful chemicals long periods without access nutrients water oxygen period time cyst enables parasitic species survive outside host allows transmission one host another protozoa form trophozoites greek tropho nourish actively feed conversion trophozoite cyst form known encystation process transforming back trophozoite known excystation protozoa reproduce asexually binary fission multiple fission many protozoan species exchange genetic material sexual means typically conjugation however sexuality generally decoupled process reproduction immediately result increased population
classification
classification protozoa remains problematic area taxonomy available dna sequences used basis classification majority described protozoa material available still mostly basis morphology parasitic species hosts protozoa divided traditionally basis means locomotion
flagellates eg giardia lamblia
amoeboids eg entamoeba histolytica
sporozoans eg plasmodium knowlesi
apicomplexa alveolata
microsporidia fungi
ascetosporea rhizaria
myxosporidia cnidaria
ciliates eg balantidium coli
phylum protozoa historically divided four subphyla reflecting means locomotion
subphylum sarcomastigophora
superclass mastigophora includes flagellates
superclass sarcodina
superclass opalinata
subphylum sporozoa includes apicomplexans
class microsporidea
subphylum ciliophora includes ciliates
systems longer considered valid
human disease
protozoa human parasites causing diseases including malaria amoebiasis giardiasis toxoplasmosis cryptosporidiosis trichomoniasis chagas disease leishmaniasis sleeping sickness amoebic dysentery acanthamoeba keratitis primary amoebic meningoencephalitis
animal disease
protozoan ophryocystis elektroscirrha parasite butterflies infects butterfly entering larval stage spores found body infected butterflies spores passed female caterpillar severely infected individuals weak unable expand wings unable eclose shortened lifespans parasite levels vary populations case laboratory commercial rearing generations individuals infected infection parasite creates effect known culling whereby infected migrating animals less likely complete migration results populations lower parasite loads end migration
