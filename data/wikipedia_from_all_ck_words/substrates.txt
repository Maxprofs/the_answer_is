thought can refer to the ideas or arrangements of ideas that result from thinking the act of producing thoughts or the process of producing thoughts although thought is a fundamental human activity familiar to everyone there is no generally accepted agreement as to what thought is or how it is created somehow thoughts arise in the mind from the product of subconscious brain processing
because thought underlies many human actions and interactions understanding its physical and metaphysical origins processes and effects has been a longstanding goal of many academic disciplines including psychology neuroscience philosophy artificial intelligence biology sociology and cognitive science
thinking allows humans to make sense of interpret represent or model the world they experience and to make predictions about that world it is therefore helpful to an organism with needs objectives and desires as it makes plans or otherwise attempts to accomplish those goals

== philosophy ==
the phenomenology movement in philosophy saw a radical change in the way in which we understand thought martin heidegger's phenomenological analyses of the existential structure of man in being and time cast new light on the issue of thinking unsettling traditional cognitive or rational interpretations of man which affect the way we understand thought the notion of the fundamental role of non-cognitive understanding in rendering possible thematic consciousness informed the discussion surrounding artificial intelligence during the 1970s and 1980s
phenomenology however is not the only approach to thinking in modern western philosophy philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind mental events mental functions mental properties consciousness and their relationship to the physical body particularly the brain the mind-body problem i.e the relationship of the mind to the body is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body
=== the mind-body problem ===
the mind-body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship that exists between minds or mental processes and bodily states or processes the main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states/processes and howor even ifminds are affected by and can affect the body
human perceptual experiences depend on stimuli which arrive at one's various sensory organs from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in one's mental state ultimately causing one to feel a sensation which may be pleasant or unpleasant someone's desire for a slice of pizza for example will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants the question then is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties a related problem is to explain how someone's propositional attitudes (e.g beliefs and desires) can cause that individual's neurons to fire and his muscles to contract in exactly the correct manner these comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted epistemologists and philosophers of mind from at least the time of ren descartes
=== functionalism vs embodiment ===
the above reflects a classical functional description of how we work as cognitive thinking systems however the apparently irresolvable mind-body problem is said to be overcome and bypassed by the embodied cognition approach with its roots in the work of heidegger piaget vygotsky merleau-ponty and the pragmatist john dewey
this approach states that the classical approach of separating the mind and analysing its processes is misguided instead we should see that the mind actions of an embodied agent and the environment it perceives and envisions are all parts of a whole which determine each other therefore functional analysis of the mind alone will always leave us with the mind-body problem which cannot be solved
== biology ==
a neuron (also known as a neurone or nerve cell) is an excitable cell in the nervous system that processes and transmits information by electrochemical signaling neurons are the core components of the brain the vertebrate spinal cord the invertebrate ventral nerve cord and the peripheral nerves a number of specialized types of neurons exist sensory neurons respond to touch sound light and numerous other stimuli affecting cells of the sensory organs that then send signals to the spinal cord and brain motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord and cause muscle contractions and affect glands interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the brain and spinal cord neurons respond to stimuli and communicate the presence of stimuli to the central nervous system which processes that information and sends responses to other parts of the body for action neurons do not go through mitosis and usually cannot be replaced after being destroyed although astrocytes have been observed to turn into neurons as they are sometimes pluripotent
== psychology ==
psychologists have concentrated on thinking as an intellectual exertion aimed at finding an answer to a question or the solution of a practical problem cognitive psychology is a branch of psychology that investigates internal mental processes such as problem solving memory and language the school of thought arising from this approach is known as cognitivism which is interested in how people mentally represent information processing it had its foundations in the gestalt psychology of max wertheimer wolfgang khler and kurt koffka and in the work of jean piaget who provided a theory of stages/phases that describe children's cognitive development
cognitive psychologists use psychophysical and experimental approaches to understand diagnose and solve problems concerning themselves with the mental processes which mediate between stimulus and response they study various aspects of thinking including the psychology of reasoning and how people make decisions and choices solve problems as well as engage in creative discovery and imaginative thought cognitive theory contends that solutions to problems take the form of algorithmsrules that are not necessarily understood but promise a solution or heuristicsrules that are understood but that do not always guarantee solutions cognitive science differs from cognitive psychology in that algorithms that are intended to simulate human behavior are implemented or implementable on a computer in other instances solutions may be found through insight a sudden awareness of relationships
in developmental psychology jean piaget was a pioneer in the study of the development of thought from birth to maturity in his theory of cognitive development thought is based on actions on the environment that is piaget suggests that the environment is understood through assimilations of objects in the available schemes of action and these accommodate to the objects to the extent that the available schemes fall short of the demands as a result of this interplay between assimilation and accommodation thought develops through a sequence of stages that differ qualitatively from each other in mode of representation and complexity of inference and understanding that is thought evolves from being based on perceptions and actions at the sensorimotor stage in the first two years of life to internal representations in early childhood subsequently representations are gradually organized into logical structures which first operate on the concrete properties of the reality in the stage of concrete operations and then operate on abstract principles that organize concrete properties in the stage of formal operations in recent years the piagetian conception of thought was integrated with information processing conceptions thus thought is considered as the result of mechanisms that are responsible for the representation and processing of information in this conception speed of processing cognitive control and working memory are the main functions underlying thought in the neo-piagetian theories of cognitive development the development of thought is considered to come from increasing speed of processing enhanced cognitive control and increasing working memory
positive psychology emphasizes the positive aspects of human psychology as equally important as the focus on mood disorders and other negative symptoms in character strengths and virtues peterson and seligman list a series of positive characteristics one person is not expected to have every strength nor are they meant to fully capsulate that characteristic entirely the list encourages positive thought that builds on a person's strengths rather than how to fix their symptoms
== psychoanalysis ==
id ego and super-ego are the three parts of the psychic apparatus defined in sigmund freud's structural model of the psyche they are the three theoretical constructs in terms of whose activity and interaction mental life is described according to this model the uncoordinated instinctual trends are the id the organized realistic part of the psyche is the ego, and the critical and moralizing function the super-ego.
the unconscious was considered by freud throughout the evolution of his psychoanalytic theory a sentient force of will influenced by human desire and yet operating well below the perceptual conscious mind for freud the unconscious is the storehouse of instinctual desires needs and psychic drives while past thoughts and reminiscences may be concealed from immediate consciousness they direct the thoughts and feelings of the individual from the realm of the unconscious
for psychoanalysis the unconscious does not include all that is not conscious rather only what is actively repressed from conscious thought or what the person is averse to knowing consciously in a sense this view places the self in relationship to their unconscious as an adversary warring with itself to keep what is unconscious hidden if a person feels pain all he can think of is alleviating the pain any of his desires to get rid of pain or enjoy something command the mind what to do for freud the unconscious was a repository for socially unacceptable ideas wishes or desires traumatic memories and painful emotions put out of mind by the mechanism of psychological repression however the contents did not necessarily have to be solely negative in the psychoanalytic view the unconscious is a force that can only be recognized by its effectsit expresses itself in the symptom
== sociology ==
social psychology is the study of how people and groups interact scholars in this interdisciplinary area are typically either psychologists or sociologists though all social psychologists employ both the individual and the group as their units of analysis
despite their similarity psychological and sociological researchers tend to differ in their goals approaches methods and terminology they also favor separate academic journals and professional societies the greatest period of collaboration between sociologists and psychologists was during the years immediately following world war ii although there has been increasing isolation and specialization in recent years some degree of overlap and influence remains between the two disciplines
the collective unconscious sometimes known as collective subconscious is a term of analytical psychology coined by carl jung it is a part of the unconscious mind shared by a society a people or all humanity in an interconnected system that is the product of all common experiences and contains such concepts as science religion and morality while freud did not distinguish between an individual psychology and a collective psychology, jung distinguished the collective unconscious from the personal subconscious particular to each human being the collective unconscious is also known as a reservoir of the experiences of our species.
in the definitions chapter of jung's seminal work psychological types under the definition of collective jung references representations collectives a term coined by lucien lvy-bruhl in his 1910 book how natives think jung says this is what he describes as the collective unconscious freud on the other hand did not accept the idea of a collective unconscious
