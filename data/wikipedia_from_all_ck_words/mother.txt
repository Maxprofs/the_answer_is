mothers are women who inhabit or perform the role of bearing some relation to their children who may or may not be their biological offspring thus dependent on the context women can be considered mothers by virtue of having given birth by raising their child(ren) supplying their ovum for fertilization or some combination thereof such conditions provide a way of delineating the concept of motherhood or the state of being a mother women who meet the third and first categories usually fall under the terms birth mother or biological mother regardless of whether the individual in question goes on to parent their child accordingly a woman who meets only the second condition may be considered an adoptive mother and those who meet only the third a surrogacy mother
the above concepts defining the role of mother are neither exhaustive nor universal as any definition of mother may differ based on how social cultural and religious roles are defined the parallel conditions and terms for males those who are (typically biologically) fathers do not by definition take up the role of fatherhood it should also be noted that mother and fatherhood are not limited to those who are or have parented women who are pregnant may be referred to as expectant mothers or mothers-to-be though such applications tend to be less readily applied to (biological) fathers or adoptive parents
== etymology ==
the modern english word is from middle english moder from old english mdor from proto-germanic *mdr (cf east frisian muur dutch moeder german mutter) from proto-indo-european *mhtr (cf irish mthair tocharian a mcar b mcer lithuanian mt) other cognates include latin mter greek  common slavic *mati (thence russian (mat)) persian (madar) and sanskrit (mt)
== biological mother ==
biological motherhood for humans as in other mammals occurs when a pregnant female gestates a fertilized ovum (the egg") typically a fetus develops from the viable zygote resulting in an embryo gestation occurs in the woman's uterus until the fetus (assuming it is carried to term) is sufficiently developed to be born in humans gestation is often around 9 months in duration after which the woman experiences labor and gives birth this is not always the case however as some babies are born prematurely late or in the case of stillbirth do not survive gestation usually once the baby is born the mother produces milk via the lactation process the mother's breast milk is the source of antibodies for the infant's immune system and commonly the sole source of nutrition for the first year or more of the child's life
== non-biological mother ==
mother can often apply to a woman other than the biological parent especially if she fulfills the main social role in raising the child this is commonly either an adoptive mother or a stepmother (the biologically unrelated partner of a child's father) the term othermother or other mother is also used in some contexts for women who provide care for a child not biologically their own in addition to the child's primary mother
adoption in various forms has been practiced throughout history modern systems of adoption arising in the 20th century tend to be governed by comprehensive statutes and regulations in recent decades international adoptions have become more and more common
adoption in the united states is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared to other western countries) in 2001 with over 127,000 adoptions the us accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide
=== surrogate mother ===
a surrogate mother is a woman who bears a child that came from another woman's fertilized ovum on behalf of a couple unable to give birth to children thus the surrogate mother carries and gives birth to a child that she is not the biological mother of surrogate motherhood became possible with advances in reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization
not all women who become pregnant via in vitro fertilization are surrogate mothers surrogacy involves both a genetic mother who provides the ovum and a gestational (or surrogate) mother who carries the child to term
=== motherhood in same-sex relationships ===
the possibility for lesbian and bisexual women in same-sex relationships (and/or women without a partner) to become mothers has increased over the past few decades due to technological developments modern lesbian parenting (a term that somewhat erases the bisexual case) originated with women who were in heterosexual relationships who later identified as lesbian or bisexual as changing attitudes provided more acceptance for non-heterosexual relationships another way for such women to become mothers is through adopting and/or foster parenting there is also the option of self-insemination and clinically assisted donor insemination forms of artificial insemination as fertility technology has advanced more women not in a heterosexual relationship have become mothers through in vitro fertilization
== social role ==
historically the role of women was confined to some extent to being a mother and wife with women being expected to dedicate most of their energy to these roles and to spend most of their time taking care of the home in many cultures women received significant help in performing these tasks from older female relatives such as mothers in law or their own mothers
regarding women in the workforce mothers often entail a mommy track rather than being entirely career women mothers have historically fulfilled the primary role in raising children but since the late 20th century the role of the father in child care has been given greater prominence and social acceptance in some western countries the 20th century also saw more and more women entering paid work
the social role and experience of motherhood varies greatly depending upon location mothers are more likely than fathers to encourage assimilative and communion-enhancing patterns in their children mothers are more likely than fathers to acknowledge their children's contributions in conversation the way mothers speak to their children ("motherese") is better suited to support very young children in their efforts to understand speech (in context of the reference english) than fathers
since the 1970s in vitro fertilization has made pregnancy possible at ages well beyond natural limits generating ethical controversy and forcing significant changes in the social meaning of motherhood this is however a position highly biased by western world locality outside the western world in-vitro fertilization has far less prominence importance or currency compared to primary basic healthcare women's basic health reducing infant mortality and the prevention of life-threatening diseases such as polio typhus and malaria
traditionally and still in most parts of the world today a mother was expected to be a married woman with birth outside of marriage carrying a strong social stigma historically this stigma not only applied to the mother but also to her child this continues to be the case in many parts of the developing world today but in many western countries the situation has changed radically with single motherhood being much more socially acceptable now for more details on these subjects see legitimacy (law) and single parent
the total fertility rate (tfr) that is the number of children born per woman differs greatly from country to country the tfr in 2013 was estimated to be highest in niger (7.03 children born per woman) and lowest in singapore (0.79 children/woman)
in the united states the tfr was estimated for 2013 at 2.06 births per woman in 2011 the average age at first birth was 25.6 and 40.7% of births were to unmarried women
== health and safety issues ==
a maternal death is defined by who as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes
about 56% of maternal deaths occur in sub-saharan africa and another 29% in south asia
in 2006 the organization save the children has ranked the countries of the world and found that scandinavian countries are the safest places to give birth whereas countries in sub-saharan africa are the least safe to give birth this study argues a mother in the bottom ten ranked countries is over 750 times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth compared to a mother in the top ten ranked countries and a mother in the bottom ten ranked countries is 28 times more likely to see her child die before reaching their first birthday
the most recent data suggests that italy sweden and luxembourg are the safest countries in terms of maternal death and afghanistan central african republic and malawi are the most dangerous
childbirth is an inherently dangerous and risky procedure subject to many complications the natural mortality rate of childbirthwhere nothing is done to avert maternal deathhas been estimated as being 1500 deaths per 100,000 births modern medicine has greatly alleviated the risk of childbirth in modern western countries the current maternal mortality rate is around 10 deaths per 100,000 births
== religious ==
nearly all world religions define tasks or roles for mothers through either religious law or through the glorification of mothers who served in substantial religious events there are many examples of religious law relating to mothers and women
major world religions which have specific religious law or scriptural canon regarding mothers include christianity judaism and islam some examples of honoring motherhood include the madonna or blessed virgin mother mary for catholics and the multiple positive references to active womanhood as a mother in the book of proverbs
hindu's mother goddess and demeter of ancient greek pre-christian belief are also mothers
== mother-offspring violence ==
history records many conflicts between mothers and their children some even resulted in murder such as the conflict between cleopatra iii of egypt and her son ptolemy x
in modern cultures matricide (the killing of one's mother) and filicide ((the killing of one's son or daughter) have been studied but remain poorly understood psychosis and schizophrenia are common causes of both and young indigent mothers with a history of domestic abuse are slightly more likely to commit filicide mothers are more likely to commit filicide than fathers when the child is 8 years old or younger matricide is most frequently committed by adult sons
in the united states in 2012 there were 130 matricides (0.4 per million people) and 383 filicides (1.2 per million) or 1.4 incidents per day
