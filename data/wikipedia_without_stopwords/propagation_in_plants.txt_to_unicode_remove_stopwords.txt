plant propagation process creating new plants variety sources seeds cuttings bulbs plant parts plant propagation also refer artificial natural dispersal plants
sexual propagation seed
seeds spores used reproduction eg sowing seeds typically produced sexual reproduction within species genetic recombination occurred plant grown seeds may different characteristics parents species produce seeds require special conditions germinate cold treatment seeds many australian plants plants southern africa american west require smoke fire germinate plant species including many trees produce seeds reach maturity may take many years seeds difficult acquire plants produce seed plants like certain ff hybrids gmo plants may produce seed fertile seed certain cases like gmos done prevent accidental spreading plants generally nonnative crops example birds animals
asexual propagation
plants number mechanisms asexual vegetative reproduction taken advantage horticulturists gardeners multiply clone plants rapidly people also use methods plants use tissue culture grafting plants produced using material single parent exchange genetic material therefore vegetative propagation methods almost always produce plants identical parent vegetative reproduction uses plants parts roots stems leaves plants seeds produced without fertilization seeds contain genetic material parent plant therefore propagation via asexual seeds apomixis asexual reproduction vegetative propagation
techniques vegetative propagation include
air ground layering
division
grafting bud grafting widely used fruit tree propagation
micropropagation
stolons runners
storage organs bulbs corms tubers rhizomes
striking cuttings
twinscaling
offsets
heated propagator
heated propagator horticultural device maintain warm damp environment seeds cuttings grow
form clear enclosed bin sitting hotpad even portable heater pointed bin key keep moisture clear bin keeping lighting top usually
seed propagation mat
electric seedpropagation mat heated rubber mat covered metal cage used gardening mats made planters containing seedlings placed top metal cage without risk starting fire extreme cold gardeners place loose plastic cover plantersmats creates sort miniature greenhouse constant predictable heat allows people garden winter months weather generally cold seedlings survive naturally combined lighting system many plants grown indoors using mats
