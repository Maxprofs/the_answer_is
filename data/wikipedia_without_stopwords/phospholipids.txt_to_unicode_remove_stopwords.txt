phospholipids class lipids major component cell membranes form lipid bilayers amphiphilic characteristic structure phospholipid molecule generally consists two hydrophobic fatty acid tails hydrophilic head consisting amponents joined together glycerol molecule phosphate groups modified simple organic molecules choline
first phospholipid identified biological tissues lecithin phosphatidylcholine egg yolk chickens french chemist pharmacist theodore nicolas gobley biological membranes eukaryotes also contain another class lipid sterol interspersed among phospholipids together provide membrane fluidity mechanical strength purified phospholipids produced commercially found applications nanotechnology materials science
amphipathic characteredit
head hydrophilic attracted water hydrophobic tails repelled water forced aggregate hydrophilic head contains negatively charged phosphate group glycerol hydrophobic tail usually consists long fatty acid chains placed water phospholipids form variety structures depending specific properties phospholipid specific properties allow phospholipids play important role phospholipid bilayer biological systems phospholipids often occur molecules eg proteins glycolipids sterols bilayer cell membrane lipid bilayers occur hydrophobic tails line one another forming membrane hydrophilic heads sides facing water

applicationsedit
phospholipids widely used prepare liposomal ethosomal nanoformulations topical oral parenteral drugs differing reasons like improved bioavailability reduced toxicity increased penetration ethosomal formulation ketoconazole using phospholipids showed good entrapment efficiency stability profile promising option transdermal delivery potential topical application fungal infections liposomes often composed phosphatidylcholineenriched phospholipids may also contain mixed phospholipid chains surfactant properties
simulationsedit
computational simulations phospholipids often performed using molecular dynamics force fields gromos charmm amber
characterizationedit
phospholipids optically highly birefringent ie refractive index different along axis opposed perpendicular measurement birefringence achieved using cross polarisers microscope obtain image eg vesicle walls using techniques dual polarisation interferometry quantify lipid order disruption supported bilayers
analysisedit
simple methods available analysis phospholipids since close range polarity different phospholipid species makes detection difficult oil chemists often use spectroscopy determine total phosphorus content calculate content phospholipids based molecular weight expected fatty acid species lipidomists use absolute methods analysis nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr particularly pnmr hplcelsd provides relative values
phospholipid synthesisedit
phospholipid synthesis occurs cytosol adjacent er membrane studded proteins act synthesis gpat lpaat acyl transferases phosphatase choline phosphotransferase allocation flippase floppase eventually vesicle bud er containing phospholipids destined cytoplasmic cellular membrane exterior leaflet phospholipids destined exoplasmic cellular membrane inner leaflet
sourcesedit
common sources industrially produced phospholipids soya rapeseed sunflower chicken eggs bovine milk fish eggs etc source unique profile individual phospholipid species consequently differing applications food nutrition pharmaceuticals cosmetics drug delivery
signal transductionedit
types phospholipid split produce products function second messengers signal transduction examples include phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate pip split enzyme phospholipase c inositol triphosphate ip diacylglycerol dag carry functions gq type g protein response various stimuli intervene various processes long term depression neurons leukocyte signal pathways started chemokine receptors
phospholipids also intervene prostaglandin signal pathways raw material used lipase enzymes produce prostaglandin precursors plants serve raw material produce jasmonic acid plant hormone similar structure prostaglandins mediates defensive responses pathogens
food technologyedit
phospholipids act emulsifier enabling oils form colloid water phospholipids one components lecithin found eggyolks well extracted soy beans used food additive many products purchased dietary supplement lysolecithins typically used wo emulsions like margarine due higher hlb ratio
