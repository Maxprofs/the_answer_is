in healthcare teamwork is a dynamic process involving two or more healthcare professionals with complementary background and skills sharing common health goals and exercising concerted physical and mental effort in assessing planning or evaluating patient care
in a business setting accounting techniques may be used to provide financial measures of the benefits of teamwork which are useful for justifying the concept health-care policy-makers increasingly advocate teamwork as a means of assuring quality and safety in the delivery of services a committee of the institute of medicine recommended in 2000 that patient-safety programs establish interdisciplinary team training programs for providers that incorporate proven methods of team training such as simulation.
in health care a systematic concept analysis in 2008 concluded teamwork to be a dynamic process involving two or more healthcare professionals with complementary backgrounds and skills sharing common health goals and exercising concerted physical and mental effort in assessing planning or evaluating patient care. elsewhere teamwork is defined as those behaviours that facilitate effective team member interaction with team defined as a group of two or more individuals who perform some work related task interact with one another dynamically have a shared past have a foreseeable shared future and share a common fate another definition for teamwork proposed in 2008 is the interdependent components of performance required to effectively coordinate the performance of multiple individuals as such teamwork is nested within the broader concept of team performance which also includes individual-level taskwork a 2012 review of the academic literature found that the word teamwork has been used as a catchall to refer to a number of behavioral processes and emergent states
== processesedit ==
researchers have identified 10 teamwork processes that fall into three categories
transition process (between periods of action)
mission analysis
goal specification
strategy formulation
action process (when the team attempts to accomplish its goals and objectives)
monitoring progress toward goals
systems monitoring
team monitoring and backup behavior
coordination
interpersonal process (present in both action periods and transition periods)
conflict management
motivation and confidence building
affect management
researchers have confirmed that performing teamwork generally works better when members of the team have prior experience working together due to enhanced coordination and communication this appears partly due to a chemical called serotonin(5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)) which helps an individual to communicate better and think more positively serotonin is produced when an individual is in a situation where he/she is in comfortable environment
== training to improve teamworkedit ==

problems solving a single brain cant bounce different ideas off of each other each team member has a responsibility to contribute equally and offer their unique perspective on a problem to arrive at the best possible solution teamwork can lead to better decisions products or services the quality of teamwork may be effective by analyzing the following six components of collaboration among team members communication coordination balance of member contributions mutual support effort and cohesion in one study teamwork quality as measured in this manner correlated with team performance in the areas of effectiveness (i.e. producing high quality work) and efficiency (i.e. meeting schedules and budgets) a 2008 meta-analysis also found a relationship between teamwork and team effectiveness
healthy competition a healthy competition in groups can be used to motivate individuals and help the team excel
developing relationships a team that continues to work together will eventually develop an increased level of bonding this can help people avoid unnecessary conflicts since they have become well acquainted with each other through team work team members ratings of their satisfaction with a team is correlated with the level of teamwork processes present
everyone has unique qualities every team member can offer their unique knowledge and ability to help improve other team members through teamwork the sharing of these qualities will allow team members to be more productive in the future
in healthcare teamwork is associated with increased patient safety
=== things to avoidedit ===
teamwork may have an unintended effect of fermenting hostility toward the managerial goal of making the teams fully self-managing. in one case study of a clothing manufacturer a switch from production line work (with bonuses given for individual performance) to teamwork (in which an individual's earnings depended on team performance) caused workers to resent having to monitor each other
there is a potential of social loafing (i.e. an individual's doing less work in a team than what he/she would normally do working individually) in order to minimize social loafing management can make individual performance more visible while in a team setting this can be done by forming smaller teams specializing specific tasks to certain individuals and measuring individual performance social loafing can also be reduced by increasing employee motivation by selecting employees who have previously shown themselves to be motivated and increasing job enrichment in experiments conducted in the 1990s an increase in group cohesiveness appeared to decrease social loafing
=== phraseedit ===
coming together is beginning keeping together is progress working together leads to success (working together is nothing but team work)
