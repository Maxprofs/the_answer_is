nomenclature
iupac nomenclature systematic way naming compounds alkanes based identifying hydrocarbon chains unbranched saturated hydrocarbon chains named systematically greek numerical prefix denoting number carbons suffix ane
august wilhelm von hofmann suggested systematizing nomenclature using whole sequence vowels e o u create suffixes ane ene ine yne one une hydrocarbons cnhn cnhn cnhn cnhn cnhn first three name hydrocarbons single double triple bonds one represents ketone ol represents alcohol oh group oxy means ether refers oxygen two carbons methoxymethane iupac name dimethyl ether
difficult impossible find compounds one iupac name shorter chains attached longer chains prefixes convention includes brackets numbers name referring carbon group attached low possible implied usually omitted names organic compounds one sidegroup symmetric compounds two ways arriving name
linear alkanes
straightchain alkanes sometimes indicated prefix n normal nonlinear isomer exists although strictly necessary usage still common cases important difference properties straightchain branchedchain isomers eg nhexane methylpentane alternative names group linear paraffins nparaffins
members series terms number carbon atoms named follows
methane ch one carbon four hydrogen
ethane ch two carbon six hydrogen
propane ch three carbon hydrogen
butane ch four carbon hydrogen
pentane ch five carbon hydrogen
hexane ch six carbon hydrogen
first four names derived methanol ether propionic acid butyric acid respectively alkanes five carbon atoms named adding suffix ane appropriate numerical multiplier prefix elision terminal vowel o basic numerical term hence pentane ch hexane ch heptane ch octane ch etc prefix generally greek however alkanes carbon atom count ending nine example nonane use latin prefix non complete list see list alkanes
branched alkanes
simple branched alkanes often common name using prefix distinguish linear alkanes example npentane isopentane neopentane
iupac naming conventions used produce systematic name
key steps naming complicated branched alkanes follows
identify longest continuous chain carbon atoms
name longest root chain using standard naming rules
name side chain changing suffix name alkane ane yl
number root chain sum numbers assigned side group low possible
number name side chains name root chain
multiple side chains type use prefixes di tri indicate number one
add side chain names alphabetical disregarding di etc prefixes order front name root chain
cyclic alkanes
socalled cyclic alkanes technical sense alkanes cycloalkanes hydrocarbons like alkanes contain one rings
simple cycloalkanes prefix cyclo distinguish alkanes cycloalkanes named per acyclic counterparts respect number carbon atoms eg cyclopentane ch cycloalkane carbon atoms like pentane ch joined fivemembered ring similar manner propane cyclopropane butane cyclobutane etc
substituted cycloalkanes named similarly substituted alkanes cycloalkane ring stated substituents according position ring numbering decided cahningoldprelog rules

table alkanes
boiling point
alkanes experience intermolecular van der waals forces stronger intermolecular van der waals forces give rise greater boiling points alkanes
two determinants strength van der waals forces
number electrons surrounding molecule increases alkanes molecular weight
surface area molecule
standard conditions ch ch alkanes gaseous ch ch liquids ch solids boiling point alkanes primarily determined weight surprise boiling point almost linear relationship size molecular weight molecule rule thumb boiling point rises c carbon added chain rule applies homologous series
straightchain alkane boiling point higher branchedchain alkane due greater surface area contact thus greater van der waals forces adjacent molecules example compare isobutane methylpropane nbutane butane boil c dimethylbutane dimethylbutane boil c respectively latter case two molecules dimethylbutane lock better crossshaped dimethylbutane hence greater van der waals forces
hand cycloalkanes tend higher boiling points linear counterparts due locked conformations molecules give plane intermolecular contact
melting points
melting points alkanes follow similar trend boiling points reason outlined things equal larger molecule higher melting point one significant difference boiling points melting points solids rigid fixed structure liquids rigid structure requires energy break thus better put together solid structures require energy break apart alkanes seen graph ie blue line oddnumbered alkanes lower trend melting points even numbered alkanes even numbered alkanes pack well solid phase forming wellorganized structure requires energy break apart oddnumber alkanes pack less well looser organized solid packing structure requires less energy break apart
melting points branchedchain alkanes either higher lower corresponding straightchain alkanes depending ability alkane question pack well solid phase particularly true isoalkanes methyl isomers often melting points higher linear analogues
conductivity solubility
alkanes conduct electricity substantially polarized electric field reason form hydrogen bonds insoluble polar solvents water since hydrogen bonds individual water molecules aligned away alkane molecule coexistence alkane water leads increase molecular order reduction entropy significant bonding water molecules alkane molecules second law thermodynamics suggests reduction entropy minimized minimizing contact alkane water alkanes said hydrophobic repel water
solubility nonpolar solvents relatively good property called lipophilicity different alkanes example miscible proportions among
density alkanes usually increases increasing number carbon atoms remains less water hence alkanes form upper layer alkanewater mixture

spatial arrangement bonds similar four sporbitalsthey tetrahedrally arranged angle structural formulae represent bonds right angles one another common useful correspond reality
conformation
structural formula bond angles usually sufficient completely describe geometry molecule degree freedom carbon carbon bond torsion angle atoms groups bound atoms end bond spatial arrangement described torsion angles molecule known conformation
ethane forms simplest case studying conformation alkanes one c c bond one looks axis c c bond one see socalled newman projection hydrogen atoms front rear carbon atoms angle resulting projection base tetrahedron onto flat plane however torsion angle given hydrogen atom attached front carbon given hydrogen atom attached rear carbon vary freely consequence free rotation carbon carbon single bond despite apparent freedom two limiting conformations important eclipsed conformation staggered conformation
two conformations also known rotamers differ energy staggered conformation kjmol lower energy stable eclipsed conformation least stable
difference energy two conformations known torsion energy low compared thermal energy ethane molecule ambient temperature constant rotation cc bond time taken ethane molecule pass one staggered conformation next equivalent rotation one chgroup relative order seconds
