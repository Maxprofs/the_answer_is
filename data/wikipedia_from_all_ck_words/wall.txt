a wall is a structure that defines an area carries a load or provides shelter or security there are many kinds of walls
defensive walls in fortification
walls in buildings that form a fundamental part of the superstructure or separate interior sections sometimes for fire safety
retaining walls which hold back earth stone or water
walls that protect from oceans (seawalls or rivers levees)
permanent solid fences
border barriers between countries
brick wall
stone wall
== etymology ==
wall comes from latin vallum meaning ...an earthen wall or rampart set with palisades a row or line of stakes a wall a rampart fortification... while the latin word murus means a defensive stone wall english uses the same word to mean an external wall and the internal sides of a room but this is not universal many languages distinguish between the two in german some of this distinction can be seen between wand and mauer in spanish between pared and muro
== defensive wall ==
the word wall originally referred to defensive walls and ramparts
== building wall ==
building walls purposes are to support roofs floors and ceilings enclose a space as part of the building envelope along with a roof to give buildings form and to provide shelter and security in addition the wall may house various types of utilities such as electrical wiring or plumbing wall construction falls into two basic categories framed walls or mass-walls in framed walls the load is transferred to the foundation through posts columns or studs framed walls most often have three or more separate components the structural elements (such as 24 studs in a house wall) insulation and finish elements or surfaces (such as drywall or panelling) mass-walls are of a solid material including masonry concrete including slipform stonemasonry log building cordwood construction adobe rammed earth cob earthbag construction bottles tin cans straw-bale construction and ice
there are three basic methods walls control water intrusion moisture storage drained cladding or face-sealed cladding moisture storage is typical of stone and brick mass-wall buildings where moisture is absorbed and released by the walls of the structure itself drained cladding also known as screened walls acknowledges moisture will penetrate the cladding so a moisture barrier such as housewrap or felt paper inside the cladding provides a second line of defense and sometimes a drainage plane or air gap allows a path for the moisture to drain down through and exit the wall sometimes ventilation is provided in addition to the drainage plane such as in rainscreen construction face-sealed also called barrier wall or perfect barrier cladding relies on maintaining a leak-free surface of the cladding examples of face sealed cladding are the early exterior insulation finishing systems structural glazing metal clad panels and corrugated metal
building walls frequently become works of art externally and internally such as when featuring mosaic work or when murals are painted on them or as design foci when they exhibit textures or painted finishes for effect
=== curtain wall ===
in architecture and civil engineering curtain wall refers to a building facade that is not load-bearing but provides decoration finish front face or historical preservation
=== mullion wall ===
mullion walls are a structural system that carries the load of the floor slab on prefabricated panels around the perimeter
=== partition wall ===
a partition wall is a wall that separates rooms or divides a room partition walls are usually not load-bearing partition walls are constructed of many materials including steel panels bricks blocks of clay terra-cotta concrete or glass blocks
some partition walls are made of sheet glass glass partition walls are a series of individual toughened glass panels mounted in wood or metal framing they may be suspended from or slide along a robust aluminium ceiling track the system does not require the use of a floor guide which allows easy operation and an uninterrupted threshold
a timber partition consists of a wooden framework supported on the floor or by side walls metal lath and plaster properly laid forms a reinforced partition wall partition walls constructed from fibre cement sheeting are popular as bases for tiling in kitchens or in wet areas like bathrooms galvanized sheet fixed to wooden or steel members are mostly adopted in works of temporary character plain or reinforced partition walls may also be constructed from concrete including pre-cast concrete blocks metal framed partitioning is also available this partition consists of track (used primarily at the base and head of the partition) and stud (vertical sections fixed at 600mm centres)
internal wall partitions also known as office partitioning is usually made of plasterboard (drywall) or varieties of glass toughened glass is a common option as is low-iron glass (better known as opti-white glass which increases light and solar heat transmission
wall partitions are constructed using beads and tracking that is either hung from the ceiling or fixed into the ground the panels are inserted into the tracking and fixed some wall partition variations specify their fire resistance and acoustic performance rating
=== party wall ===
party walls are walls that separate buildings or units within a building they may provide sound resistance or serve as a fire wall ownership of such walls can become a legal issue
=== infill wall ===
an infill wall is the supported wall that closes the perimeter of a building constructed with a three-dimensional framework structure
=== fire wall ===
fire walls are special walls that resist spread of fire within or sometimes between structures to provide passive fire protection a delay in the spread of fire gives occupants more time to escape and fire fighters more time to extinguish the fire such walls have no windows and are made of non-combustible material such as concrete cement block brick or fire rated drywalland have wall penetrations sealed with special materials a doorway in a firewall must have a rated fire door fire walls provide varying resistance to the spread of fire some intended to last one to four hours firewalls generally are also smoke barriers
=== shear wall ===
shear walls resist lateral forces such as in an earthquake or severe wind there are different kinds of shear walls such as the steel plate shear wall
=== knee wall ===
knee walls are short walls that either support rafters or add height in the top floor rooms of houses in a one-and-one-half story house the knee wall supports the half story
=== cavity wall ===
cavity walls are walls made with a space between two skins to inhibit heat transfer
=== pony wall ===
pony wall is a general term for short walls such as
a half wall that only extends partway from floor to ceiling without supporting anything
a stem walla concrete wall that extends from the foundation slab to the cripple wall or floor joists
a cripple walla framed wall from the stem wall or foundation slab to the floor joists
a knee wall which extends from the floor to a counter top rafter or handrail
=== movable partitions ===
movable partitions are walls that open to join two or more rooms into one large floor area these include
slidinga series of panels that slide in tracks fixed to the floor and ceiling similar sliding doors
sliding and foldingsimilar to sliding folding doors these are good for smaller spans
screensusually constructed of a metal or timber frame fixed with plywood and chipboard and supported with legs for free standing and easy movement
pipe and drapefixed or telescopic uprights and horizontals provide a ground supported drape system with removable panels
=== solar energy ===
a trombe wall in passive solar building design acts as a heat sink
== shipbuilding ==
on a ship a wall that separates major compartments is called a bulkhead a thinner wall between cabins is called a partition
== boundary wall ==
boundary walls include privacy walls boundary-marking walls on property and town walls these intergrade into fences the conventional differentiation is that a fence is of minimal thickness and often open in nature while a wall is usually more than a nominal thickness and is completely closed or opaque more to the point an exterior structure of wood or wire is generally called a fencebut one of masonry is a wall a common term for both is barrier which is convenient for structures that are partly wall and partly fencefor example the berlin wall another kind of wall-fence ambiguity is the ha-hawhich is set below ground level to protect a view yet acts as a barrier (to cattle for example)
before the invention of artillery many of the world's cities and towns particularly in europe and asia had defensive or protective walls (also called town walls or city walls) in fact the english word wall derives from latin valluma type of fortification wall these walls are no longer relevant for defense so such cities have grown beyond their walls and many fortification walls or portions of them have been torn downfor example in rome italy and beijing china examples of protective walls on a much larger scale include the great wall of china and hadrian's wall
== border wall ==
some walls formally mark the border between one population and another a border wall is constructed to limit the movement of people across a certain line or border these structures vary in placement with regard to international borders and topography the most famous example of border barrier in history is probably the great wall of china a series of walls that separated the empire of china from nomadic powers to the north the most prominent recent example is the berlin wall which surrounded the enclave of west berlin and separated it from east germany for most of the cold war era
== retaining wall ==
in areas of rocky soils around the world farmers have often pulled large quantities of stone out of their fields to make farming easier and have stacked those stones to make walls that either mark the field boundary or the property boundary or both
retaining walls resist movement of earth stone or water they may be part of a building or external the ground surface or water on one side of a retaining wall is typically higher than on the other side a dike is a retaining wall as is a levee a load-bearing foundation wall and a sea wall
== shared wall ==
special laws often govern walls that neighbouring properties share typically one neighbour cannot alter the common wall if it is likely to affect the building or property on the other side a wall may also separate apartment or hotel rooms from each other each wall has two sides and breaking a wall on one side will break the wall on the other side
== portable wall ==
portable walls such as room dividers or portable partitions divide a larger open space into smaller rooms portable walls can be static such as cubicle walls or can be wall panels mounted on casters to provide an easy way to reconfigure assembly space they are often found inside schools churches convention centers hotels and corporate facilities
== temporary wall ==
a temporary wall is constructed for easy removal or demolition a typical temporary wall can be constructed with 12 (6 mm) to 58 (16 mm) sheet rock (plasterboard) metal 2 3s (approx 5 7 cm) or 2 4s or taped plastered and compounded most installation companies use lattice (strips of wood) to cover the joints of the temporary wall with the ceiling these are sometime known as pressurized walls or temporary pressurized walls
== walls in popular culture ==
walls are often seen in many popular cultures representing barriers preventing progress or entry for example the progressive/psychedelic rock band pink floyd used a metaphorical wall to represent the isolation felt by the protagonist of their 1979 concept album the wall american poet laureate robert frost describes a pointless rock wall as a metaphor for the myopia of the culture-bound in his poem mending wall published in 1914 in a real-life example the berlin wall constructed by the soviet union to divide berlin into nato and warsaw pact zones of occupation became a worldwide symbol of oppression and isolation
in some cases a wall may refer to an individual's debilitating mental or physical condition seen as an impassable barrier
another common usage is as a communal surface to write upon for instance the social networking site facebook previously used an electronic wall to log the scrawls of friends until it was replaced by the timeline feature
