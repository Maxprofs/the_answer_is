the points of the compass are points on a compass specifically on the compass rose marking divisions of the four cardinal directions north south east west the number of points may be only the 4 cardinal points or the 8 principal points adding the intercardinal (or ordinal) directions northeast (ne) southeast (se) southwest (sw) and northwest (nw) in meteorological usage further intermediate points are added to give the sixteen points of a wind compass finally at the most complete in european tradition are found the full thirty-two points of the mariner's compass in ancient china 24 points of the compass were used
in the mariner's exercise of boxing the compass all thirty-two points of the compass are named in clockwise order the names of intermediate points are formed by the initials of the cardinal directions and their intermediate ordinal directions and are very handy to refer to a heading (or course or azimuth) in a general or colloquial fashion without having to resort to computing or recalling degrees for most applications the minor points have been superseded by degrees measured clockwise from north
== compass point namesedit ==
the names of the 32-wind compass rose follow these rules
the cardinal directions are north (n) east (e) south (s) west (w) at 90 angles on the compass rose
the ordinal (or intercardinal) directions are northeast (ne) southeast (se) southwest (sw) and northwest (nw) formed by bisecting the angle of the cardinal winds the name is merely a combination of the cardinals it bisects
the eight principal winds (or main winds) are the cardinals and ordinals considered together that is n ne e se s sw w nw each principal wind is 45 from its neighbour the principal winds form the basic eight-wind compass rose
the eight half-winds are the points obtained by bisecting the angles between the principal winds the half-winds are north-northeast (nne) east-northeast (ene) east-southeast (ese) south-southeast (sse) south-southwest (ssw) west-southwest (wsw) west-northwest (wnw) and north-northwest (nnw) notice that the name is constructed simply by combining the names of the principal winds to either side with the cardinal wind coming first the ordinal wind second the eight principal winds and the eight half-winds together yield a 16-wind compass rose with each compass point at a 22 12 angle from the next
the sixteen quarter winds are the direction points obtained by bisecting the angles between the points on a 16-wind compass rose the sixteen quarter-winds are north by east (nbe) northeast by north (nebn) northeast by east (nebe) east by north (ebn) in the first quadrant east by south (ebs) southeast by east (sebe) southeast by south (sebs) south by east (sbe) in the second quadrant south by west (sbw) southwest by south (swbs) southwest by west (swbw) west by south (wbs) in the third quadrant and finally west by north (wbn) northwest by west (nwbw) northwest by north (nwbn) and north by west (nbw) in the fourth quadrant
the name of a quarter-wind is typically x by y where x is a principal wind and y is a cardinal wind as a mnemonic device it is useful to think of x by y as a shortcut for the phrase one quarter wind from x towards y where a quarter is 11 14 x is the nearest principal wind and y the next (more distant) cardinal wind so northeast by east means one quarter from ne towards e southwest by south means one quarter from sw towards s the eight principal winds eight half-winds and sixteen quarter winds together yield a 32-wind compass rose with each compass direction point at 11 14 angle from the next
the title of the alfred hitchcock 1959 movie north by northwest is actually not a direction point on the 32-wind compass but the film contains a reference to northwest airlines similarly the names of the two film festivals south by southwest and north by northeast are not 32-wind compass points a quarter wind whose name contains both a cardinal and an ordinal direction is named with the ordinal direction first
== traditional namesedit ==
the traditional compass rose of eight winds (and its 16-wind and 32-wind derivatives) was invented by seafarers in the mediterranean sea during the middle ages (the ancient greco-roman 12 classical compass winds have little to do with them) the traditional mariner's wind names were expressed in italian or more precisely the italianate mediterranean lingua franca common among sailors in the 13th and 14th centuries that was principally composed of genoese (ligurian) mixed with venetian sicilian provenal catalan greek and arabic terms from around the mediterranean basin
this italianate patois was used to designate the names of the principal winds on the compass rose found in mariner compasses and portolan charts of the 14th and 15th centuries the traditional names of the eight principal winds are
(n) tramontana
(ne) greco (or bora in some venetian sources)
(e) levante (sometimes oriente)
(se) scirocco (or exaloc in catalan)
(s) ostro (or mezzogiorno in venetian)
(sw) libeccio (or garbino eissalot in provenal)
(w) ponente (or zephyrus in greek)
(nw) maestro (or mistral in provenal)
local spelling variations are far more numerous than listed e.g tramutana gregale grecho sirocco xaloc lebeg libezo leveche mezzodi migjorn magistro mestre etc traditional compass roses will typically have the initials t g l s o l p and m on the main points portolan charts also colour-coded the compass winds black for the eight principal winds green for the eight half-winds and red for the sixteen quarter-winds
in the english compass all wind names are constructed on the basis of the cardinal four names (n e s w) in the traditional compass one needs to memorize eight basic names one for each of the eight principal winds (n ne e se s sw w nw.) while there are more names to memorize the payoff is that the name construction rules for the 32-wind compass are more straightforward the half-winds are just a combination of the two principal winds it bisects with the shortest name usually coming first (e.g nne is greco-tramontana ene is greco-levante sse is ostro-scirocco etc.) the quarter winds are expressed with an italian phrase quarto di x verso y (one quarter from x towards y pronounced [kwarto di x vrso y]) or x al y (x to y) or x per y (x by y) there are no irregularities to trip over the nearest principal wind always comes first the more distant one second e.g north-by-east is quarto di tramontana verso greco northeast-by-north quarto di greco verso tramontana the names are perfectly symmetric
== 32 cardinal pointsedit ==
== half- and quarter-pointsedit ==
by at least the middle of the eighteenth century the 32-point system had been further extended with the use of half- and quarter-points to give a total of 128 directions these fractional points are named by appending for example 1/4east 1/2east or 3/4east to the name of one of the 32 points each of the 96 fractional points can be named in two ways depending of which of the two adjoining whole points is used for example n3/4e is equivalent to nbe1/4n either form is easily understood but differing conventions as to correct usage developed in different countries and organisations
the table below shows how each of the 128 directions are named the first two columns give the number of points and degrees clockwise from north the third gives the equivalent bearing to the nearest degree from north or south towards east or west the cw column gives the fractional-point bearings increasing in the clockwise direction and ccw counter clockwise the final three columns show three common naming conventions no by avoids the use of by with fractional points usn the system used by us navy and rn the royal navy the colour coding illustrates where each of the three naming systems matches the cw and ccw columns
compass roses very rarely named the fractional points and only showed small unlabelled markers as a guide for helmsmen
