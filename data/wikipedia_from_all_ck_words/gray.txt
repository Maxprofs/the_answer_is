=== the greying of hairedit ===
the color of a person's hair is created by the pigment melanin found in the core of each hair melanin is also responsible for the color of the skin and of the eyes there are only two types of pigment dark (eumelanin) or light (phaeomelanin) combined in various combinations these pigments create all natural hair colors
melanin itself is the product of a specialized cell the melanocyte which is found in each hair follicle from which the hair grows as hair grows the melanocyte injects melanin into the hair cells which contain the protein keratin and which makes up our hair skin and nails as long as the melanocytes continue injecting melanin into the hair cells the hair retains its original color at a certain age however which varies from person to person the amount of melanin injected is reduced and eventually stops the hair without pigment turns grey and eventually white the reason for this decline of production of melanocytes is uncertain in the february 2005 issue of science a team of harvard scientists suggested that the cause was the failure of the melanocyte stem cells to maintain the production of the essential pigments due to age or genetic factors after a certain period of time for some people the breakdown comes in their twenties for others many years later according to the site of the magazine scientific american generally speaking among caucasians 50 percent are 50 percent gray by age 50. adult male gorillas also develop silver hair but only on their backs see physical characteristics of gorillas

rgb model
grey values result when r = g = b for the color (r g b)
cmyk model
grey values are produced by c = m = y = 0 for the color (c m y k) lightness is adjusted by varying k in theory any mixture where c = m = y is neutral but in practice such mixtures are often a muddy brown (see discussion on this topic)
