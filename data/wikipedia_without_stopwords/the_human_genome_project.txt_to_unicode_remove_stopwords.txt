project
history
may robert sinsheimer organized workshop discuss sequencing human genome number reasons nih uninterested pursuing proposal following march santa fe workshop organized charles delisi david smith department energys office health environmental research oher time renato dulbecco proposed whole genome sequencing essay science james watson followed two months later workshop held cold spring harbor laboratory
fact santa fe workshop motivated supported federal agency opened path albeit difficult tortuous one cookdeegan converting idea public policy memo assistant secretary energy research alvin trivelpiece charles delisi director oher outlined broad plan project started long complex chain events led approved reprogramming funds enabled oher launch project recommend first line item hgp president regans budget submission cookdeegan ultimately approved congress particular importance congressional approval advocacy senator peter domenici delisi befriended domenici chaired senate committee energy natural resources well budget committee key doe budget process congress added comparable amount nih budget thereby beginning official funding agencies
dr alvin trivelpiece sought obtained approval delisis proposal deputy secretary william flynn martin chart used spring trivelpiece director office energy research department energy brief martin secretary joseph salgado regarding intention reprogram million initiate project approval secretary herrington reprogramming followed line item budget million reagan administrations budget submission congress subsequently passed houses project planned years
candidate technologies already considered proposed undertaking least early
two major funding agencies doe nih developed memorandum understanding order coordinate plans set clock initiation project time david galas director renamed office biological environmental research us department energys office science james watson headed nih genome program aristides patrinos succeeded galas francis collins succeeded james watson assuming role overall project head director us national institutes health nih national center human genome research would later become national human genome research institute working draft genome announced papers describing published february complete draft published genome finishing work continued decade
billion project formally founded us department energy national institutes health expected take years addition united states international consortium comprised geneticists united kingdom france australia china myriad spontaneous relationships
due widespread international cooperation advances field genomics especially sequence analysis well major advances computing technology rough draft genome finished announced jointly us president bill clinton british prime minister tony blair june first available rough draft assembly genome completed genome bioinformatics group university california santa cruz primarily led graduate student jim kent ongoing sequencing led announcement essentially complete genome april two years earlier planned may another milestone passed way completion project sequence last chromosome published nature
state completion
project aim sequence dna found human cells sequenced euchromatic regions genome make genome regions called heterochromatic found centromeres telomeres sequenced project
human genome project declared complete april initial rough draft human genome available june february working draft completed published followed final sequencing mapping human genome april although reported euchromatic human genome accuracy major quality assessment human genome sequence published may indicating sampling exceeded accuracy within intended goal analyses papers hgp continue occur
applications proposed benefits
sequencing human genome holds benefits many fields molecular medicine human evolution human genome project sequencing dna help us understand diseases including genotyping specific viruses direct appropriate treatment identification mutations linked different forms cancer design medication accurate prediction effects advancement forensic applied sciences biofuels energy applications agriculture animal husbandry bioprocessing risk assessment bioarcheology anthropology evolution another proposed benefit commercial development genomics research related dna based products multibilliondollar industry

techniques analysis
process identifying boundaries genes features raw dna sequence called genome annotation domain bioinformatics expert biologists make best annotators work proceeds slowly computer programs increasingly used meet highthroughput demands genome sequencing projects beginning new technology known rnaseq introduced allowed scientists directly sequence messenger rna cells replaced previous methods annotation relied inherent properties dna sequence direct measurement much accurate today annotation human genome genomes relies primarily deep sequencing transcripts every human tissue using rnaseq experiments revealed human genes contain least one usually several alternative splice variants exons combined different ways produce gene products locus
genome published hgp represent sequence every individuals genome combined mosaic small number anonymous donors european origin hgp genome scaffold future work identifying differences among individuals subsequent projects sequenced genomes multiple distinct ethnic groups though today still one reference genome
findings
key findings draft complete genome sequences include
approximately genes human beings range mice
human genome significantly segmental duplications nearly identical repeated sections dna previously suspected
time draft sequence published fewer protein families appeared vertebrate specific
accomplishment
human genome project started goal sequencing identifying three billion chemical units human genetic instruction set finding genetic roots disease developing treatments considered mega project human genome approximately billion basepairs sequence hand next step identify genetic variants increase risk common diseases like cancer diabetes
far expensive time think sequencing patients whole genomes national institutes health embraced idea shortcut look sites genome many people variant dna unit theory behind shortcut since major diseases common would genetic variants caused natural selection keeps human genome free variants damage health children grown theory held fails variants strike later life allowing become quite common national institutes health started million project called hapmap catalog common variants european east asian african genomes
genome broken smaller pieces approximately base pairs length pieces ligated type vector known bacterial artificial chromosomes bacs derived bacterial chromosomes genetically engineered vectors containing genes inserted bacteria copied bacterial dna replication machinery pieces sequenced separately small shotgun project assembled larger base pairs go together create chromosomes known hierarchical shotgun approach genome first broken relatively large chunks mapped chromosomes selected sequencing
funding came us government national institutes health united states uk charity organization wellcome trust well numerous groups around world funding supported number large sequencing centers including whitehead institute sanger centre washington university st louis baylor college medicine
united nations educational scientific cultural organization unesco served important channel involvement developing countries human genome project
public versus private approaches
similar privately funded quest launched american researcher craig venter firm celera genomics venter scientist nih early project initiated celera effort intended proceed faster pace fraction cost roughly billion publicly funded project celera approach able proceed much rapid rate lower cost public project relied upon data made available publicly funded project
celera used technique called whole genome shotgun sequencing employing pairwise end sequencing used sequence bacterial genomes six million base pairs length anything nearly large three billion base pair human genome
celera initially announced would seek patent protection genes later amended seeking intellectual property protection fullycharacterized important structures amounting targets firm eventually filed preliminary placeholder patent applications whole partial genes celera also promised publish findings accordance terms bermuda statement releasing new data annually hgp released new data daily although unlike publicly funded project would permit free redistribution scientific use data publicly funded competitors compelled release first draft human genome celera reason july ucsc genome bioinformatics group released first working draft web scientific community downloaded gb information ucsc genome server first hours free unrestricted access
march president clinton announced genome sequence could patented made freely available researchers statement sent celeras stock plummeting dragged biotechnologyheavy nasdaq biotechnology sector lost billion market capitalization two days
although working draft announced june february celera hgp scientists published details drafts special issues nature published publicly funded projects scientific paper science published celeras paper described methods used produce draft sequence offered analysis sequence drafts covered genome euchromatic regions gaps order orientation many segments yet established february time joint publications press releases announced project completed groups improved drafts announced filling approximately sequence currently
genome donors
ihgsc international publicsector human genome project hgp researchers collected blood female sperm male samples large number donors many collected samples processed dna resources thus donor identities protected neither donors scientists could know whose dna sequenced dna clones many different libraries used overall project libraries created dr pieter j de jongs lab much sequence reference genome produced public hgp came single anonymous male donor buffalo new york code name rp
hgp scientists used white blood cells blood two male two female donors randomly selected donor yielding separate dna library one libraries rp used considerably others due quality considerations one minor technical issue male samples contain half much dna sex chromosomes one x chromosome one y chromosome compared female samples contain two x chromosomes chromosomes autosomes sexes
although main sequencing phase hgp completed studies dna variation continue international hapmap project whose goal identify patterns singlenucleotide polymorphism snp groups called haplotypes haps dna samples hapmap came total individuals yoruba people ibadan nigeria japanese people tokyo han chinese beijing french centre detude du polymorphisme humain ceph resource consisted residents united states ancestry western northern europe
