genetics
one strongest evidences common descent comes study gene sequences comparative sequence analysis examines relationship dna sequences different species producing several lines evidence confirm darwins original hypothesis common descent hypothesis common descent true species share common ancestor inherited ancestors dna sequence well mutations unique ancestor closely related species greater fraction identical sequence shared substitutions compared distantly related species
simplest powerful evidence provided phylogenetic reconstruction reconstructions especially done using slowly evolving protein sequences often quite robust used reconstruct great deal evolutionary history modern organisms even instances evolutionary history extinct organisms recovered gene sequences mammoths neanderthals reconstructed phylogenies recapitulate relationships established morphological biochemical studies detailed reconstructions performed basis mitochondrial genomes shared eukaryotic organisms short easy sequence broadest reconstructions performed either using sequences ancient proteins using ribosomal rna sequence
phylogenetic relationships also extend wide variety nonfunctional sequence elements including repeats transposons pseudogenes mutations proteincoding sequences result changes aminoacid sequence minority elements might later found harbor function aggregate demonstrate identity must product common descent rather common function
universal biochemical organisation molecular variance patterns

pseudogenes
pseudogenes also known noncoding dna extra dna genome get transcribed rna synthesize proteins noncoding dna known functions much known function called junk dna example vestige since replicating genes uses energy making waste many cases pseudogene produced coding gene accumulates mutations prevent transcribed making nonfunctional since transcribed may disappear without affecting fitness unless provided beneficial function noncoding dna nonfunctional pseudogenes may passed later species thereby labeling later species descended earlier species
mechanisms
also large body molecular evidence number different mechanisms large evolutionary changes among genome gene duplication facilitates rapid evolution providing substantial quantities genetic material weak selective constraints horizontal gene transfer process transferring genetic material another cell organisms offspring allowing species acquire beneficial genes recombination capable reassorting large numbers different alleles establishing reproductive isolation endosymbiotic theory explains origin mitochondria plastids eg chloroplasts organelles eukaryotic cells incorporation ancient prokaryotic cell ancient eukaryotic cell rather evolving eukaryotic organelles slowly theory offers mechanism sudden evolutionary leap incorporating genetic material biochemical composition separate species evidence supporting mechanism found protist hatena predator engulfs green algae cell subsequently behaves endosymbiont nourishing hatena turn loses feeding apparatus behaves autotroph

widely separated groups organisms originated common ancestry expected certain basic features common degree resemblance two organisms indicate closely related evolution
groups little common assumed diverged common ancestor much earlier geological history groups lot common
deciding closely related two animals comparative anatomist looks structures fundamentally similar even though may serve different functions adult structures described homologous suggest common origin

evidence paleontology
organisms die often decompose rapidly consumed scavengers leaving permanent evidences existence however occasionally organisms preserved remains traces organisms past geologic age embedded rocks natural processes called fossils extremely important understanding evolutionary history life earth provide direct evidence evolution detailed information ancestry organisms paleontology study past life based fossil records relations different geologic time periods
fossilization take place traces remains organisms must quickly buried weathering decomposition occur skeletal structures hard parts organisms commonly occurring form fossilized remains paul behrensmeyer martin also trace fossils showing moulds cast imprints previous organisms
animal dies organic materials gradually decay bones become porous animal subsequently buried mud mineral salts infiltrate bones gradually fill pores bones harden stones preserved fossils process known petrification dead animals covered windblown sand sand subsequently turned mud heavy rain floods process mineral infiltration may occur apart petrification dead bodies organisms may well preserved ice hardened resin coniferous trees amber tar anaerobic acidic peat fossilization sometimes trace impression form examples include leaves footprints fossils made layers harden
fossil record
possible find particular group organisms evolved arranging fossil records chronological sequence sequence determined fossils mainly found sedimentary rock sedimentary rock formed layers silt mud top thus resulting rock contains series horizontal layers strata layer contains fossils typical specific time period formed lowest strata contain oldest rock earliest fossils highest strata contain youngest rock recent fossils
succession animals plants also seen fossil discoveries studying number complexity different fossils different stratigraphic levels shown older fossilbearing rocks contain fewer types fossilized organisms simpler structure whereas younger rocks contain greater variety fossils often increasingly complex structures
many years geologists could roughly estimate ages various strata fossils found instance estimating time formation sedimentary rock layer layer today measuring proportions radioactive stable elements given rock ages fossils precisely dated scientists technique known radiometric dating
throughout fossil record many species appear early stratigraphic level disappear later level interpreted evolutionary terms indicating times species originated became extinct geographical regions climatic conditions varied throughout earths history since organisms adapted particular environments constantly changing conditions favoured species adapted new environments mechanism natural selection
extent fossil record
despite relative rarity suitable conditions fossilization approximately fossil species known number individual fossils represents varies greatly species species many millions fossils recovered instance three million fossils last ice age recovered la brea tar pits los angeles many fossils still ground various geological formations known contain high fossil density allowing estimates total fossil content formation made example occurs south africas beaufort formation part karoo supergroup covers south africa rich vertebrate fossils including therapsids reptilemammal transitional forms estimated formation contains billion vertebrate fossils
limitations
fossil record important source scientists tracing evolutionary history organisms however limitations inherent record fine scales intermediate forms related groups species lack continuous fossils record major limitation tracing descent biological groups transitional fossils found show intermediate forms previously gap knowledge often popularly referred missing links
gap million years beginning cambrian period end ordovician period early cambrian period period numerous fossils sponges cnidarians eg jellyfish echinoderms eg eocrinoids molluscs eg snails arthropods eg trilobites found first animal possessed typical features vertebrates arandaspis dated existed later ordovician period thus fossils intermediate type invertebrates vertebrates found although likely candidates include burgess shale animal pikaia gracilens maotianshan shales relatives myllokunmingia yunnanozoon haikouella lanceolata haikouichthys
reasons incompleteness fossil records
general probability organism becomes fossilized low
species groups less likely become fossils softbodied
species groups less likely become fossils live die conditions favourable fossilization
many fossils destroyed erosion tectonic movements
fossils fragmentary
evolutionary change occurs populations limits species ecological range populations likely small probability fossilization lower see punctuated equilibrium
similarly environmental conditions change population species likely greatly reduced evolutionary change induced new conditions less likely fossilized
fossils convey information external form little organism functioned
using presentday biodiversity guide suggests fossils unearthed represent small fraction large number species organisms lived past
