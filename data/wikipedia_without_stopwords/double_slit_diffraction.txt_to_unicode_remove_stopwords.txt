interpretations experiment
like schrdingers cat thought experiment doubleslit experiment often used highlight differences similarities various interpretations quantum mechanics
copenhagen interpretation
copenhagen interpretation put forth pioneers field quantum mechanics asserts undesirable posit anything goes beyond mathematical formulae kinds physical apparatus reactions enable us gain knowledge goes atomic scale one mathematical constructs enables experimenters predict accurately certain experimental results sometimes called probability wave mathematical form analogous description physical wave crests troughs indicate levels probability occurrence certain phenomena eg spark light certain point detector screen observed macro world ordinary human experience
probability wave said pass space probability values one compute mathematical representation dependent time one cannot speak location particle photon time emitted time detected simply order say something located somewhere certain time one detect requirement eventual appearance interference pattern particles emitted screen least two distinct paths particle take emitter detection screen experiments observe nothing whatsoever time emission particle arrival detection screen ray tracing next made light wave understood classical physics wide enough take paths ray tracing accurately predict appearance maxima minima detector screen many particles pass apparatus gradually paint expected interference pattern
pathintegral formulation
copenhagen interpretation similar path integral formulation quantum mechanics provided feynman path integral formulation replaces classical notion single unique trajectory system sum possible trajectories trajectories added together using functional integration
path considered equally likely thus contributes amount however phase contribution given point along path determined action along path
contributions added together magnitude final result squared get probability distribution position particle
always case calculating probability results must normalized imposing
summarize probability distribution outcome normalized square norm superposition paths point origin final point waves propagating proportionally action along path differences cumulative action along different paths thus relative phases contributions produces interference pattern observed doubleslit experiment feynman stressed formulation merely mathematical description attempt describe real process measure
relational interpretation
