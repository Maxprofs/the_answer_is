rotated electrode voltammetry a subclass of voltammetry is technique in which the working electrode usually a rotating disk electrode (rde) or rotating ring-disk electrode (rrde) is rotated at a very high rate (2000 to 10,000 (?) rpm) this asserts some control over the mass transport process which brings the analyte to the electrode surface this technique was made popular through the work of the russian electrochemist benjamin levich this technique is useful for studying the kinetics and electrochemical reaction mechanism for a half reaction this technique is part of a larger class of electroanalytical methods known as hydrodynamic voltammetry (see also hydrodynamics)
