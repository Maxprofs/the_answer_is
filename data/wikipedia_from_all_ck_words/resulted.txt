== song information ==
"losing my mind is from the 1971 musical follies twist in my sobriety was originally recorded by tanita tikaram from the 1988 album ancient heart "love pains was originally recorded by yvonne elliman from the 1979 album yvonne rent and tonight is forever were both originally recorded by pet shop boys from respectively the albums actually (1987) and please (1986)
the pet shop boys demo version of losing my mind (which had neil tennant singing the vocal) was later tidied up and released as a b-side on the pet shop boys single jealousy
the bridge to if there was love features minnelli reciting sonnet 94 by william shakespeare they that have power to hurt
the album title was chosen at minnelli's request by pet shop boys after they heard an offhand comment by their friend janet street-porter regarding some of her clothes ("i call it my results wear cause when i wear them i always get results")
