the hyphen () is a punctuation mark used to join words and to separate syllables of a single word the use of hyphens is called hyphenation the hyphen should not be confused with dashes (   ) which are longer and have different uses or with the minus sign () which is also longer in some contexts
as an orthographic concept the hyphen is a single entity in terms of character encoding and display that entity is represented by any of several characters and glyphs (including hard hyphens soft or optional hyphens and nonbreaking hyphens) depending on the context of use (discussed below)
although as mentioned above hyphens are not to be confused with en dashes and minus signs there are some overlaps in usage (in which either a hyphen or an en dash may be acceptable depending on user preference discussed below) and in character encoding (which often uses the same character called a hyphen-minus to represent both the hyphen and minus sign entities discussed below)
== etymologyedit ==
the term derives from ancient greek (hyph hn) contracted from (hyp hn) in one (literally under one")
the term () ((he) hyphn) was used for a tie-like () sign written below two consecutive letters to indicate that they belong to the same word (when it was necessary to avoid ambiguity before the space was in regular use)
== use in englishedit ==
hyphens are mostly used to break single words into parts or to join ordinarily separate words into single words spaces should not be placed between a hyphen and either of the words it connects except when using a suspended or hanging hyphen (e.g nineteenth- and twentieth-century writers)
a definitive collection of hyphenation rules does not exist rather different manuals of style prescribe different guidelines the rules of style that apply to dashes and hyphens have evolved to support ease of reading in complex constructions editors often accept deviations from them that will support rather than hinder ease of reading
the use of the hyphen in english compound nouns and verbs has in general been steadily declining compounds that might once have been hyphenated are increasingly left with spaces or are combined into one word in 2007 the sixth edition of the shorter oxford english dictionary removed the hyphens from 16000 entries such as fig-leaf (now fig leaf) pot-belly (now pot belly) and pigeon-hole (now pigeonhole) the advent of the internet and the increasing prevalence of computer technology have given rise to a subset of common nouns that might have been hyphenated in the past (e.g toolbar hyperlink pastebin")
despite decreased use hyphenation remains the norm in certain compound-modifier constructions and amongst some authors with certain prefixes (see below) hyphenation is also routinely used as part of syllabification in justified texts to avoid unsightly spacing (especially in columns with narrow measure such as in newspapers)
=== separatingedit ===
==== justification and line-wrappingedit ====
when flowing text it is sometimes preferable to break a word in half so that it continues on another line rather than moving the entire word to the next line the word may be divided at the nearest break point between syllables (syllabification) and a hyphen inserted to indicate that the letters form a word fragment rather than a full word this allows more efficient use of paper allows flush appearance of right-side margins (justification) without oddly large word spaces and decreases the problem of rivers this kind of hyphenation is most useful when the width of the column (called the measure in typography) is very narrow for example
the details of doing this properly are complex and language-dependent and can interact with other orthographic and typesetting practices hyphenation algorithms when employed in concert with dictionaries are sufficient for all but the most formal texts see also justification
it may be necessary to distinguish an incidental line-break hyphen from one integral to a word being mentioned (e.g in a dictionary) or present in an original text being quoted (e.g in a critical edition)not only to control its word wrap behavior (which encoding handles with hard and soft hyphens having the same glyph) but also to differentiate appearance (with a different glyph) merriam-webster's third new international dictionary and the chambers dictionary use a double hyphen for integral hyphens and a single hyphen for line-breaks whereas kromhout's afrikaansenglish dictionary uses the opposite convention the concise oxford dictionary fifth edition repeated an integral hyphen at the start of the following line
==== prefixes and suffixesedit ====
prefixes (such as de- pre- re- and non-) and suffixes (such as -less -like -ness and -hood) may or may not be hyphenated (the unhyphenated style is also called closed up or solid.) a rule of thumb is that they are not hyphenated unless the lack of a hyphen hurts clarityspecifically clarity at first glance rather than clarity upon a second look or a moment's pause the clearunclear distinction involves some subjectivity because what is instantly clear to one reader may not be to another (depending on for example subject matter familiarity) nonetheless consensus among users of a language often reduces that subjectivity for many words this is explained further below
many long-established words such as disgusted degrade and refresh do not require a hyphen because they are fully fused to the point that their first syllable is barely even thought about as having a prefix function many other words such as prewashed or repainted may not be quite so fully fused (the prefix function may be slightly more prominent in consciousness) but nonetheless they require no hyphen because (1) most readers recognize the closed-up word as a familiar one and thus have no trouble parsing the syllables and (2) if all such words were hyphenated the many hyphens throughout the text would seem superfluous
in contrast for some other words the closed-up style may not be as clear and the hyphen can ensure clarity and avoid awkwardness including odd appearance or misguided parsing of syllables an example of avoiding misguided parsing would be to hyphenate the word co-worker (versus coworker) to prevent the reader's eye being caught automatically by the letter group cow (which might suggest cow (/ka/) before backtracking and reparsing occurred) in such cases styling varies depending on individual preference regional preference occupational specialty or style guide preference because the definition of awkwardness for any given word depends on who is judging it
words for which prefix hyphenation is least subjective to the point that closed-up style is widely rejected are of several classes one such class consists of a few words that require a hyphen to distinguish them from other words that would otherwise be homographs such as recreation (fun or sport) versus re-creation (the act of creating again) retreat (turn back) versus re-treat (give therapy again) and un-ionized (not in ion form) versus unionized (organized into trade unions) the other classes are those in which the prefix is applied to (1) a proper (capitalized) noun or adjective (un-american de-stalinisation) (2) an acronym (anti-tnf antibody non-si units) or (3) a number (pre-1949 diplomacy pre-1492 cartography)
style guides codify rules to minimize inconsistency the ultimate goal of which is to have the style unnoticed by the reader (that is to avoid catching the reader's eye either with trivial differences or with a lot of superfluous hyphens) the style guide rules allow exceptions to avoid awkwardness for example a guide will typically say to follow dictionary x's style for any word entered therein and for words not entered to close up by default and thus hyphenate only to avoid awkwardness such a rule successfully codifies almost all choices and thus leaves little to discretion except a few rare or neologistic words which are safely hyphenated this ensures high intradocument and interdocument consistency rules about avoiding doubled vowels or doubled consonants are often mentioned in style guides these appropriately cascade only downstream not upstream of the follow dictionary x rule because most dictionaries close up many well-established doubled-letter pairs (for example any style that follows merriam-webster's collegiate dictionary thus closes up preempt reexamine deemphasize nonnegotiable posttransfusion and hundreds of others.) as mentioned earlier the definition of awkwardness for any given word is inherently subjective but nonetheless also subject to consensus for example reexamine and deemphasize are accepted as nonawkward by a broad consensus to prefer the hyphenated styling is a matter of opinion but to insist that the solid styling is awkward would be considered pedantic by many educated readers however some doublings attract smaller majorities than others in such a consensus with the co-worker/coworker example (mentioned earlier) or with antiinflammatory/anti-inflammatory many readers may consider solid styling nonawkward whereas plenty of others don't and in such cases dictionary styles may vary (dorland's antiinflammatory merriam-webster's medical dictionary anti-inflammatory) tripled letters rarely occur but when they do the hyphen is considered mandatory (thus shell-like not shelllike)
there is a trend that over decades words that once were hyphenated for clarity lose the hyphen as their familiarity grows an excellent example is email/e-mail the number of people who find email awkward dropped from the 1990s to the 2010s and thus the hyphen has been dropped increasingly for some instances the consensus depends on occupational specialty or subspecialty although proto-oncogene is still hyphenated by most users (and by both dorland's and merriam-webster's medical) the solid styling (protooncogene) is gaining popularity with oncologists and geneticists (for whom the term is most familiar) leading the way
a hyphen can clarify that two adjacent vowelswhether two of the same letter (e.g. oo ee) or two different letters (e.g. ae ei)are pronounced separately rather than being merged in a diphthong the question is how necessary the clarification is thus hyphenated de-escalate and co-operation have plenty of support consensus-wise (plenty of users consider their hyphens as not superfluous) although solid deescalate and cooperation have plenty of support as well (plenty of users consider the hyphens superfluous) consensus for styling varies by class subclass and even by individual word with the common theme being that internal punctuation drops out of any combination judged as instantly recognizable enough in its context not to need it as classes there are doubling (namely aa ee ii oo uu yy) and nondoubling (for example a+e a+i a+o e+e e+i e+o) several subclasses exist there are combinations that are not rare in english as diphthongs and also not rare as nondiphthongs for users willing to style prefixed words solidly (such as ee and ei) regarding de+e/re+e/pre+e and de+i/re+i/pre+i nearly everyone agrees that some fully fused examples (such as reiterate and reinforce) need no hyphen but other examples have more evenly split pluralities (such as reexamine/re-examine or deemphasize/de-emphasize) there are combinations that are rare in english as diphthongs (for example aa and ii) but not rare in prefixed words for those willing to style them solidly and thus either they hardly need clarification within prefixed words (the solidification argument thus intraarterial and antiinflammatory) or they need a hyphen to avoid looking like rare diphthongs which are odd-looking because rare (the hyphenation argument thus intra-arterial and anti-inflammatory)
a diaeresis can also sometimes be used either to indicate nondiphthong status (as in coperation and nave) or to indicate nonsilent terminal -e (as in bront) but there are several implicit boundaries on this style's use it is now rare (its peak of popularity was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries) and it was never applied extensively across the language (only a handful of examples including coperation nave and bront are encountered with any appreciable frequency in english for whatever reason it never had any popularity in the de+e/re+e/pre+e or de+i/re+i/pre+i subclassesthus never *rexamine *reterate *demphasize or others although they might have been useful) many users (and various dictionaries) consider the diaeresis optional in naive/nave (because not necessary for the reader to recognize the word) and *na-ive draws attention to itself as a style that is simply never used (although comprehensible) for deity and deify only solid styling (no hyphen or diaeresis) is normative
==== syllabification and spellingedit ====
hyphens are occasionally used to denote syllabification as in syl-la-bi-fi-ca-tion most british and north american dictionaries use an interpunct sometimes called a middle dot or hyphenation point for this purpose as in syllabification this allows the hyphen to be reserved only for places where a hard hyphen is intended (for example self-conscious unselfconscious long-standing) similarly hyphens may be used to indicate a word is being or should be spelled for example w-o-r-d spells word
=== joiningedit ===
==== compound modifiersedit ====
compound modifiers are groups of two or more words that jointly modify the meaning of another word when a compound modifier other than an adverbadjective combination appears before a term the compound modifier is often hyphenated to prevent misunderstanding such as in american-football player or little-celebrated paintings without the hyphen there is potential confusion about whether the writer means a player of american football or an american player of football and whether the writer means paintings that are little celebrated or celebrated paintings that are little compound modifiers can extend to three or more words as in ice-cream-flavored candy and can be adverbial as well as adjectival (spine-tinglingly frightening) however if the compound is a familiar one it is usually unhyphenated for example at least one style guide prefers the construction high school students to high-school students although the expression is technically ambiguous ("students of a high school"/"school students who are high") it would normally be formulated differently if other than the first meaning were intended nounnoun compound modifiers may also be written without a hyphen when no confusion is likely grade point average and department store manager when the modifier is an adverb ending in -ly or when one of the parts is a proper noun or a proper adjective there is no hyphen (e.g a badly written novel or a south american actor")
when a compound modifier follows the term to which it applies a hyphen is typically not used if the compound is a temporary compound for example that gentleman is well respected not that gentleman is well-respected or a patient-centered approach was used but the approach was patient centered. but permanent compounds found as headwords in dictionaries are treated as invariable so if they are hyphenated in the cited dictionary the hyphenation will be used in both attributive and predicative positions for example a cost-effective method was used and the method was cost-effective (cost-effective is a permanent compound that is hyphenated as a headword in various dictionaries)
in the 19th century it was common to hyphenate adverbadjective modifiers with the adverb ending in -ly (in other words producing the character string ly-) however this has become rare for example wholly owned subsidiary and quickly moving vehicle are unambiguous because the adverbs clearly modify the adjectives quickly cannot modify vehicle however if an adverb can also function as an adjective then a hyphen may be or should be used for clarity depending on the style guide for example the phrase more-important reasons ("reasons that are more important") is distinguished from more important reasons ("additional important reasons") where more is an adjective similarly more-beautiful scenery (with a mass-noun) is distinct from more beautiful scenery (in contrast the hyphen in a more-important reason/a more important reason is not necessary because the syntax cannot be misinterpreted.) a few words including well and early attract especial attention in this category the hyphen in well-[past_participled] noun such as in well-differentiated cells might very reasonably be judged too superfluous to stet (the syntax cannot be misinterpreted) and yet plenty of style guides call for it and because early has both adverbial and adjectival senses its hyphenation can attract attention some editors comparing with advanced-stage disease and adult-onset disease like the parallelism of early-stage disease and early-onset disease similarly the hyphen in little-celebrated paintings clarifies that one is not speaking of little paintings
hyphens are usually used to connect numbers and words in modifying phrases (such as in dimensional measurements of weight size and time) under the rationale that like other compound modifiers they take hyphens in attributive position (before the modified noun) although not in predicative position (after the modified noun) this is applied whether numerals or words are used for the numbers thus 28-year-old woman and twenty-eight-year-old woman or 32-foot wingspan and thirty-two-foot wingspan but the woman is 28 years old and a wingspan of 32 feet however with symbols for si units (such as m or kg)as opposed to the names of these units (such as metre or kilogram)both the international bureau of weights and measures and the u.s national institute of standards and technology recommend use without a hyphen a 25 kg sphere (which is why some scientists get annoyed when such hyphens are added to their article when it is edited for a journal using ama style whose hyphenation of these symbols bucks si style) when the units are spelled out this recommendation does not apply a 25-kilogram sphere a roll of 35-millimeter film
in spelled-out fractions hyphens are usually used when the fraction is used as an adjective but not when it is used as a noun thus two-thirds majority and one-eighth portion but i drank two thirds of the bottle or i kept three quarters of it for myself however at least one major style guide hyphenates spelled-out fractions invariably (whether adjective or noun)
in english an en dash ( ) sometimes replaces the hyphen in hyphenated compounds if either of its constituent parts is already hyphenated or contains a space (for example san franciscoarea residents hormone receptorpositive cells cell cyclerelated factors and public-schoolprivate-school rivalries) a commonly used alternative style is the hyphenated string (hormone-receptor-positive cells cell-cycle-related factors) (for other aspects of en dashversushyphen use see dash > en dash.)
==== objectverbal noun compoundsedit ====
when an object is compounded with a verbal noun such as egg-beater (a tool that beats eggs) the result is sometimes hyphenated some authors do this consistently others only for disambiguation in this case egg-beater egg beater and eggbeater are all common
an example of an ambiguous phrase appears in they stood near a group of alien lovers which without a hyphen implies that they stood near a group of lovers who were aliens they stood near a group of alien-lovers clarifies that they stood near a group of people who loved aliens as alien can be either an adjective or a noun on the other hand in the phrase a hungry pizza-lover the hyphen will often be omitted (a hungry pizza lover) as pizza cannot be an adjective and the phrase is therefore unambiguous
similarly there's a man-eating shark in these waters is nearly the opposite of there's a man eating shark at table 6 the first is a shark and the second a man a government-monitoring program is a program that monitors the government whereas a government monitoring program is a government program that monitors something else
==== other compoundsedit ====
connecting hyphens are used in a large number of miscellaneous compounds other than modifiers such as in lily-of-the-valley cock-a-hoop clever-clever tittle-tattle and orang-utan use is often dictated by convention rather than fixed rules and hyphenation styles may vary between authors for example orang-utan is also written as orangutan or orang utan and lily-of-the-valley may or may not be hyphenated
some married couples compose a new surname (sometimes referred to as a double-barrelled name) for their new family by combining their two surnames with a hyphen jane doe and john smith might become jane and john smith-doe or doe-smith for instance in some countries only the woman hyphenates her birth surname appending her husband's surname (see also spanish naming customs#hyphenation and portuguese name#hyphenation.)
==== suspended hyphensedit ====
a suspended hyphen (also called a suspensive hyphen or hanging hyphen or less commonly a dangling or floating hyphen) may be used when a single base word is used with separate consecutive hyphenated words which are connected by and or or to for example nineteenth-century and twentieth-century may be written as nineteenth- and twentieth-century this usage is now common in english and specifically recommended in some style guides although less common suspended hyphens are also used in english when the base word comes first such as in investor-owned and -operated uses such as applied and sociolinguistics (instead of applied linguistics and sociolinguistics") are frowned on in english the indiana university style guide uses this example and says do not take a shortcut when the first expression is ordinarily open. (i.e. ordinarily two separate words) this is different however from instances where prefixes that are normally closed up (styled solidly) are used suspensively for example preoperative and postoperative becomes pre- and postoperative (not pre- and post-operative) when suspended some editors prefer to avoid suspending such pairs choosing instead to write out both words in full
=== other usesedit ===
a hyphen may be used to connect groups of numbers such as in dates (see below) telephone numbers or sports scores it can also be used to indicate a range of values although many styles prefer an en dash (see examples at dash > en dash > ranges of values)
the hyphen is sometimes used to hide letters in words (censoring) as in g-d although an en dash can be used as well (gd)
the hyphen is often used in reduplicatives

== origin and historyedit ==
the first known documentation of the hyphen is in the grammatical works of dionysius thrax at the time hyphenation was joining two words that would otherwise be read separately by a low tie mark between the two words in greek these marks were known as enotikon officially romanized as a hyphen
with the introduction of letter-spacing in the middle ages the hyphen still written beneath the text reversed its meaning scribes used the mark to connect two words that had been incorrectly separated by a space this era also saw the introduction of the marginal hyphen for words broken across lines
the modern format of the hyphen originated with johannes gutenberg of mainz germany c.1455 with the publication of his 42-line bible his tools did not allow for a subliminal hyphen and he thus moved it to the middle of the line examination of an original copy on vellum (hubay index #35) in the u s library of congress shows that gutenberg's movable type was set justified in a uniform style 42 equal lines per page the gutenberg printing press required words made up of individual letters of type to be held in place by a surrounding non-printing rigid frame gutenberg solved the problem of making each line the same length to fit the frame by inserting a hyphen as the last element at the right-side margin this interrupted the letters in the last word requiring the remaining letters be carried over to the start of the line below his hyphen appears throughout the bible as a short double line inclined to the right at a 60-degree angle
== in computingedit ==
=== hyphen-minusedit ===
in the ascii character encoding the hyphen is encoded as character 45 this character is actually called the hyphen-minus and it is also used as the minus sign and for dashes in unicode the hyphen-minus is encoded as u+002d (-) so that unicode remains compatible with ascii however unicode also encodes the hyphen and minus separately as u+2010 () and u+2212 () respectively along with the em dash u+2014 () en dash u+2013 () and other related characters the hyphen-minus is a general-purpose character which attempts to fulfill several roles and wherever optimal typography is desired the preferred hyphen minus or other symbol should be used instead for example compare 4+32=5 (minus) and 4+3-2=5 (hyphen-minus) in most fonts the hyphen-minus will not have the optimal width thickness or vertical position whereas the minus character will
however the unicode hyphen is awkward to enter on most keyboards so the hyphen-minus character remains very common they are often used instead of dashes or minus signs in situations where the preferred characters are unavailable (such as ascii-only text) where the preferred characters take effort to enter (via dialog boxes or multi-key unmemorable keyboard shortcuts) or when the writer is unaware of the distinction some writers use two hyphen-minuses (--) to represent a dash in ascii text
the ascii hyphen-minus character is also often used when specifying command-line options the character is usually followed by one or more letters that indicate specific actions typically it is called a dash or switch in this context various implementations of the getopt() function to parse command-line options additionally allow the use of two hyphen-minus characters ( -- ) to specify long option names that are more descriptive than their single-letter equivalents another use of hyphens is that employed by programs written with pipelining in mind a single hyphen may be recognized in lieu of a filename with the hyphen then serving as an indicator that a standard stream instead of a file is to be worked with
=== hard and soft hyphensedit ===
although software (hyphenation algorithms) can often automatically make decisions on when to hyphenate a word at a line break it is also sometimes useful for the user to be able to insert cues for those decisions (which are dynamic in the online medium given that text can be reflowed) for this purpose the concept of a soft hyphen (discretionary hyphen optional hyphen) was introduced allowing such manual specification of a place where a hyphenated break is allowed but not forced that is it does not force a line break in an inconvenient place when the text is later reflowed
in contrast a hyphen that is always displayed and printed is called a hard hyphen (although some use this term to refer to a non-breaking hyphen see below) soft hyphens are inserted into the text at the positions where hyphenation may occur it can be a tedious task to insert the soft hyphens by hand and tools using hyphenation algorithms are available that do this automatically current modules of the cascading style sheets (css) standard provide language-specific hyphenation dictionaries
=== nonbreaking hyphensedit ===
the word segmentation rules of most text systems consider a hyphen to be a word boundary and a valid point at which to break a line when flowing text however this is not always desirable behavior especially when it could lead to ambiguity (such as in the examples given before where recreation and recreation would be indistinguishable) or in languages other than english (e.g a line break at the hyphen in irish an tathair or romanian sa would be undesirable) for this purpose unicode also encodes a nonbreaking hyphen (non-breaking hyphen no-break hyphen) as u+2011 ( coded for by &#8209;) this character looks identical to the regular hyphen but it is treated as a letter by word processors namely that the hyphenated word will not be divided at the hyphen should this fall at what would be the end of a line of text instead the whole hyphenated word either will remain in full at the end of the line or will go in full to the beginning of the next line the non-breaking space exists for similar reasons
== usage in date notationedit ==
in parts of europe the hyphen is used to delineate parts within a written date germans and slavs also used roman numerals for the month 14vii1789 for example is one way of writing the first bastille day though this usage is rapidly falling out of favour plaques on the wall of the moscow kremlin are written this way use of hyphens as opposed to the slashes used in the english language is specified for international standards
international standard iso 8601 which was accepted as european standard en 28601 and incorporated into various typographic style guides (e.g. din 5008 in germany) brought about a new standard using the hyphen now all official european governmental documents use this these norms prescribe writing dates using hyphens 1789-07-14 is the new way of writing the first bastille day this is also the typical date format used in large parts of eastern europe and asia although sometimes with other separators than the hyphen
this method has gained influence within north america as most common computer filesystems make the use of slashes difficult or impossible dos os/2 and windows simultaneously support both \ and / as directory separators but / is also used to introduce and separate switches to shell commands (unless reconfigured to use the hyphen-minus in dos) unix-like systems use / as a directory separator and while \ is legal in filenames it is awkward to use as the shell uses it as an escape character unix also uses a space followed by a hyphen to introduce switches apart from the separator used the non-year form of the date format is also identical to the standard american representation
the iso date format sorts correctly using a default collation which can be useful in many computing situations including for filenames so many computer systems and it technicians have switched to this method the government of the commonwealth of massachusetts for example has switched to this method
