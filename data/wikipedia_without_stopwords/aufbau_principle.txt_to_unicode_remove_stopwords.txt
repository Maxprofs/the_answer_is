aufbau principle states hypothetically electrons orbiting one atoms fill lowest available energy levels filling higher levels eg way electrons atom molecule ion harmonize stable electron configuration possible
aufbau german noun means construction aufbau principle sometimes called buildingup principle aufbau rule
details buildingup tendency described mathematically atomic orbital functions electron behavior elaborated principles atomic physics hunds rule pauli exclusion principle hunds rule asserts even multiple orbitals energy available electrons fill unoccupied orbitals first reusing orbitals occupied electrons according pauli exclusion principle order electrons occupy orbital must different spins
version aufbau principle known nuclear shell model used predict configuration protons neutrons atomic nucleus
madelung energy ordering rule
order orbitals filled given n rule also known madelung rule erwin madelung janet rule klechkowski rule charles janet vsevolod klechkovsky mostly french russianspeaking countries diagonal rule orbitals lower n value filled higher n values context n represents principal quantum number azimuthal quantum number values correspond p d f labels respectively
rule based total number nodes atomic orbital n related energy case equal n values orbital lower n value filled first fact ground state configurations neutral atoms fill orbitals following n n pattern obtained experimentally reference spectroscopic characteristics elements
madelung energy ordering rule applies neutral atoms ground state even case several elements predicts configurations differ determined experimentally copper chromium palladium common examples property according madelung rule orbital n occupied d orbital n rule predicts configuration cu ssps psd abbreviated arsd ar denotes configuration ar preceding noble gas however experimental electronic configuration copper atom arsd filling d orbital copper lower energy state similarly chromium takes electronic configuration arsd instead arsd case chromium halffull d shell palladium madelung rule predicts krsd experimental configuration krd differs placement two electrons
