acidbas reaction
acidbas reaction acid plus base react form conjug base plus conjug acid
conjug form acid lose hydrogen proton base gain hydrogen proton refer follow figur
say water molecul conjug acid hydroxid ion latter receiv hydrogen proton donat ammonium hand ammonia conjug base acid ammonium ammonium donat hydrogen ion toward product water molecul also refer oh conjug base h
o sinc water molecul donat proton toward product nh
revers reaction predomin process natur due strength base nh
hydroxid ion base inform clear term acid base conjug acid conjug base fix certain chemic speci interchang accord reaction take place
strength conjug
strength conjug acid direct proport dissoci constant conjug acid strong dissoci higher equilibrium constant product reaction favor strength conjug base seen tendenc speci pull hydrogen proton toward conjug base classifi strong hold hydrogen proton solut acid dissoci
chemic speci classifi weak acid conjug base strong natur observ ammonia relat strong base reaction water reaction proceed ammonia transform ammonium shift right chemic equilibrium reaction mean ammonium dissoci easili water weak acid conjug base stronger hydroxid ion
hand speci classifi strong acid conjug base weak natur exampl case would dissoci hydrochlor acid hcl water sinc hcl strong acid dissoci great extent conjug base cl weak conjug base therefor system h form hydronium ion h
o instead attach cl anion conjug base weaker water molecul
summar stronger acid base weaker conjug vice versa
