the land now called canada has been inhabited for millennia by various aboriginal peoples beginning in the late 15th century british and french colonies were established on the region's atlantic coast as a consequence of various conflicts the united kingdom gained and lost north american territories until left in the late 18th century with what mostly comprises canada today pursuant to the british north america act on july 1 1867 three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal dominion of canada this began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing dominion in 1931 britain granted canada near total independence with the statute of westminster 1931 and full sovereignty was attained when the canada act 1982 severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the british parliament

== etymologyedit ==
while a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of canada the name is now accepted as coming from the st lawrence iroquoian word kanata meaning village or settlement in 1535 indigenous inhabitants of the present-day quebec city region used the word to direct french explorer jacques cartier to the village of stadacona cartier later used the word canada to refer not only to that particular village but the entire area subject to donnacona (the chief at stadacona) by 1545 european books and maps had begun referring to this region as canada
in the 17th and early 18th centuries canada referred to the part of new france that lay along the st lawrence river in 1791 the area became two british colonies called upper canada and lower canada collectively named the canadas until their union as the british province of canada in 1841 upon confederation in 1867 canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country and the word dominion was conferred as the country's title the transition away from the use of dominion was formally reflected in 1982 with the passage of the canada act which refers only to canada later that year the national holiday was renamed from dominion day to canada day the term dominion is also used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces though after the second world war the term federal had replaced dominion
== historyedit ==
=== aboriginal peoplesedit ===
aboriginal peoples in present-day canada include the first nations inuit and mtis the latter being a mixed-blood people who originated in the mid-17th century when first nations and inuit people married european settlers archaeological studies and genetic analyses have indicated a human presence in the northern yukon region from 13,00012,000 bc and in southern ontario from 7500 bc these first settlers entered canada through beringia by way of the bering land bridge the paleo-indian archeological sites at old crow flats and bluefish caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in canada the characteristics of canadian aboriginal societies included permanent settlements agriculture complex societal hierarchies and trading networks some of these cultures had collapsed by the time european explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations
the aboriginal population at the time of the first european settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million with a figure of 500,000 accepted by canada's royal commission on aboriginal peoples as a consequence of the european colonization canada's aboriginal peoples suffered from repeated outbreaks of newly introduced infectious diseases such as influenza measles and smallpox (to which they had no natural immunity) resulting in a forty to eighty percent population decrease in the centuries after the european arrival
although not without conflict european canadians early interactions with first nations and inuit populations were relatively peaceful the crown and aboriginal peoples began interactions during the european colonialization period though the inuit in general had more limited interaction with european settlers from the late 18th century european canadians encouraged aboriginals to assimilate into their own culture these attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations
=== european colonizationedit ===
the first known attempt at european colonization began when norsemen settled briefly at l'anse aux meadows in newfoundland around 1000 ad no further european exploration occurred until 1497 when italian seafarer john cabot explored canada's atlantic coast for england then basque and portuguese mariners established seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the atlantic coast in the early 16th century in 1534 french explorer jacques cartier explored the st lawrence river where on july 24 he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words long live the king of france and took possession of the territory in the name of king francis i
in 1583 sir humphrey gilbert by the royal prerogative of queen elizabeth i founded st john's newfoundland as the first north american english colony french explorer samuel de champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent european settlements at port royal (in 1605) and quebec city (in 1608) among the colonists of new france canadiens extensively settled the st lawrence river valley and acadians settled the present-day maritimes while fur traders and catholic missionaries explored the great lakes hudson bay and the mississippi watershed to louisiana the beaver wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the north american fur trade
the english established additional colonies in cupids and ferryland newfoundland beginning in 1610 the thirteen colonies to the south were founded soon after a series of four wars erupted in colonial north america between 1689 and 1763 the later wars of the period constituted the north american theatre of the seven years war mainland nova scotia came under british rule with the 1713 treaty of utrecht and the 1763 treaty of paris ceded canada and most of new france to britain after the seven years war
the royal proclamation of 1763 created the province of quebec out of new france and annexed cape breton island to nova scotia st john's island (now prince edward island) became a separate colony in 1769 to avert conflict in quebec the british parliament passed the quebec act of 1774 expanding quebec's territory to the great lakes and ohio valley it re-established the french language catholic faith and french civil law there this angered many residents of the thirteen colonies fuelling anti-british sentiment in the years prior to the 1775 outbreak of the american revolution
the 1783 treaty of paris recognized american independence and ceded the newly added territories south (but not north) of the great lakes to the new united states new brunswick was split from nova scotia as part of a reorganization of loyalist settlements in the maritimes to accommodate english-speaking loyalists in quebec the constitutional act of 1791 divided the province into french-speaking lower canada (later quebec) and english-speaking upper canada (later ontario) granting each its own elected legislative assembly
the canadas were the main front in the war of 1812 between the united states and britain following the war large-scale immigration to canada from britain and ireland began in 1815 between 1825 and 1846 626,628 european immigrants reportedly landed at canadian ports these included irish immigrants escaping the great irish famine as well as gaelic-speaking scots displaced by the highland clearances infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 per cent of europeans who immigrated to canada before 1891
the desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive rebellions of 1837 the durham report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of french canadians into english culture the act of union 1840 merged the canadas into a united province of canada and responsible government was established for all british north american provinces by 1849 the signing of the oregon treaty by britain and the united states in 1846 ended the oregon boundary dispute extending the border westward along the 49th parallel this paved the way for british colonies on vancouver island (1849) and in british columbia (1858)
=== confederation and expansionedit ===
following several constitutional conferences the 1867 constitution act officially proclaimed canadian confederation on july 1 1867 initially with four provinces ontario quebec nova scotia and new brunswick canada assumed control of rupert's land and the north-western territory to form the northwest territories where the mtis grievances ignited the red river rebellion and the creation of the province of manitoba in july 1870 british columbia and vancouver island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 while prince edward island joined in 1873
the canadian parliament passed a bill introduced by the conservative cabinet that established a national policy of tariffs to protect the nascent canadian manufacturing industries to open the west parliament also approved sponsoring the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the canadian pacific railway) opening the prairies to settlement with the dominion lands act and establishing the north-west mounted police to assert its authority over this territory in 1898 during the klondike gold rush in the northwest territories parliament created the yukon territory the cabinet of liberal prime minister wilfrid laurier fostered continental european immigrants settling the prairies and alberta and saskatchewan became provinces in 1905
=== early 20th centuryedit ===
because britain still maintained control of canada's foreign affairs under the confederation act its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought canada into world war i volunteers sent to the western front later became part of the canadian corps which played a substantial role in the battle of vimy ridge and other major engagements of the war out of approximately 625,000 canadians who served in world war i some 60,000 were killed and another 172,000 were wounded the conscription crisis of 1917 erupted when the unionist cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from french-speaking quebecers the military service act brought in compulsory military service though it coupled with disputes over french language schools outside quebec deeply alienated francophone canadians and temporarily split the liberal party in 1919 canada joined the league of nations independently of britain and the 1931 statute of westminster affirmed canada's independence
the great depression in canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn leading to hardship across the country in response to the downturn the co-operative commonwealth federation (ccf) in saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by tommy douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s on the advice of liberal prime minister william lyon mackenzie king king george vi declared war on germany during world war ii seven days after britain the first canadian army units arrived in britain in december 1939
in all over a million canadians served in the armed forces during world war ii and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war including the failed 1942 dieppe raid the allied invasion of italy the normandy landings the battle of normandy and the battle of the scheldt in 1944 canada provided asylum for the dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from nazi germany the canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for canada britain china and the soviet union despite another conscription crisis in quebec in 1944 canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy
=== modern timesedit ===
the financial crisis of the great depression had led the dominion of newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a crown colony ruled by a british governor after two bitter referendums newfoundlanders voted to join canada in 1949 as a province
canada's post-war economic growth combined with the policies of successive liberal governments led to the emergence of a new canadian identity marked by the adoption of the current maple leaf flag in 1965 the implementation of official bilingualism (english and french) in 1969 and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971 socially democratic programs were also instituted such as medicare the canada pension plan and canada student loans though provincial governments particularly quebec and alberta opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions finally another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the 1982 patriation of canada's constitution from the united kingdom concurrent with the creation of the canadian charter of rights and freedoms in 1999 nunavut became canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government
at the same time quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the quiet revolution of the 1960s giving birth to a modern nationalist movement the radical front de libration du qubec (flq) ignited the october crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970 and the sovereignist parti qubcois was elected in 1976 organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980 attempts to accommodate quebec nationalism constitutionally through the meech lake accord failed in 1990 this led to the formation of the bloc qubcois in quebec and the invigoration of the reform party of canada in the west a second referendum followed in 1995 in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent in 1997 the supreme court ruled that unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional and the clarity act was passed by parliament outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from confederation
in addition to the issues of quebec sovereignty a number of crises shook canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s these included the explosion of air india flight 182 in 1985 the largest mass murder in canadian history the cole polytechnique massacre in 1989 a university shooting targeting female students and the oka crisis of 1990 the first of a number of violent confrontations between the government and aboriginal groups canada also joined the gulf war in 1990 as part of a us-led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s including the unprofor mission in the former yugoslavia canada sent troops to afghanistan in 2001 but declined to join the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 in 2009 canada's economy suffered in the worldwide great recession but it has since largely rebounded in 2011 canadian forces participated in the nato-led intervention into the libyan civil war and also became involved in battling the islamic state insurgency in iraq in the mid-2010s
