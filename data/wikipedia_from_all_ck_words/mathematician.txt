a mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his or her work typically to solve mathematical problems mathematics is concerned with numbers data quantity structure space models and change
== history ==
one of the earliest known mathematicians was thales of miletus (c 624c.546 bc) he has been hailed as the first true mathematician and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed he is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry by deriving four corollaries to thales theorem
the number of known mathematicians grew when pythagoras of samos (c 582c 507 bc) established the pythagorean school whose doctrine it was that mathematics ruled the universe and whose motto was all is number it was the pythagoreans who coined the term mathematics and with whom the study of mathematics for its own sake begins
the first woman mathematician recorded by history was hypatia of alexandria (ad 350 - 415) she succeeded her father as librarian at the great library and wrote many works on applied mathematics because of a political dispute the christian community in alexandria punished her presuming she was involved by stripping her naked and scraping off her skin with clamshells (some say roofing tiles)
science and mathematics in the islamic world during the middle ages followed various models and modes of funding varied based primarily on scholars it was extensive patronage and strong intellectual policies implemented by specific rulers that allowed scientific knowledge to develop in many areas funding for translation of scientific texts in other languages was ongoing throughout the reign of certain caliphs and it turned out that certain scholars became experts in the works they translated and in turn received further support for continuing to develop certain sciences as these sciences received wider attention from the elite more scholars were invited and funded to study particular sciences an example of a translator and mathematician who benefited from this type of support was al-khawarizmi a notable feature of many scholars working under muslim rule in medieval times is that they were often polymaths examples include the work on optics maths and astronomy of ibn al-haytham
the renaissance brought an increased emphasis on mathematics and science to europe during this period of transition from a mainly feudal and ecclesiastical culture to a predominantly secular one many notable mathematicians had other occupations luca pacioli (founder of accounting) niccol fontana tartaglia (notable engineer and bookkeeper) gerolamo cardano (earliest founder of probability and binomial expansion) robert recorde (physician) and franois vite (lawyer)
as time passed many mathematicians gravitated towards universities an emphasis on free thinking and experimentation had begun in britain's oldest universities beginning in the seventeenth century at oxford with the scientists robert hooke and robert boyle and at cambridge where isaac newton was lucasian professor of mathematics & physics moving into the 19th century the objective of universities all across europe evolved from teaching the regurgitation of knowledge to encourag[ing] productive thinking in 1810 humboldt convinced the king of prussia to build a university in berlin based on friedrich schleiermachers liberal ideas the goal was to demonstrate the process of the discovery of knowledge and to teach students to take account of fundamental laws of science in all their thinking thus seminars and laboratories started to evolve
british universities of this period adopted some approaches familiar to the italian and german universities but as they already enjoyed substantial freedoms and autonomy the changes there had begun with the age of enlightenment the same influences that inspired humboldt the universities of oxford and cambridge emphasized the importance of research arguably more authentically implementing humboldts idea of a university than even german universities which were subject to state authority overall science (including mathematics) became the focus of universities in the 19th and 20th centuries students could conduct research in seminars or laboratories and began to produce doctoral theses with more scientific content according to humboldt the mission of the university of berlin was to pursue scientific knowledge the german university system fostered professional bureaucratically regulated scientific research performed in well-equipped laboratories instead of the kind of research done by private and individual scholars in great britain and france in fact regg asserts that the german system is responsible for the development of the modern research university because it focused on the idea of freedom of scientific research teaching and study

== required education ==
mathematicians usually cover a breadth of topics within mathematics in their undergraduate education and then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the graduate-level in some universities a qualifying exam serves to test both the breadth and depth of a student's understanding of mathematics the students who pass are permitted to work on a doctoral dissertation
== activities ==
=== applied mathematics ===
mathematicians involved with solving problems with applications in real life are called applied mathematicians applied mathematicians are mathematical scientists who with their specialized knowledge and professional methodology approach many of the imposing problems presented in related scientific fields with professional focus on a wide variety of problems theoretical systems and localized constructs applied mathematicians work regularly in the study and formulation of mathematical models mathematicians and applied mathematicians are considered to be two of the stem (science technology engineering and mathematics) careers
the discipline of applied mathematics concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science engineering business and industry thus applied mathematics is a mathematical science with specialized knowledge the term applied mathematics also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on problems often concrete but sometimes abstract as professionals focused on problem solving applied mathematicians look into the formulation study and use of mathematical models in science engineering business and other areas of mathematical practice
=== abstract mathematics ===
pure mathematics is mathematics that studies entirely abstract concepts from the eighteenth century onwards this was a recognized category of mathematical activity sometimes characterized as speculative mathematics and at variance with the trend towards meeting the needs of navigation astronomy physics economics engineering and other applications
another insightful view put forth is that pure mathematics is not necessarily applied mathematics it is possible to study abstract entities with respect to their intrinsic nature and not be concerned with how they manifest in the real world even though the pure and applied viewpoints are distinct philosophical positions in practice there is much overlap in the activity of pure and applied mathematicians
to develop accurate models for describing the real world many applied mathematicians draw on tools and techniques that are often considered to be pure mathematics on the other hand many pure mathematicians draw on natural and social phenomena as inspiration for their abstract research
=== mathematics teaching ===
many professional mathematicians also engage in the teaching of mathematics duties may include
teaching university mathematics courses
supervising undergraduate and graduate research and
serving on academic committees
=== consulting ===
many careers in mathematics outside of universities involve consulting for instance actuaries assemble and analyze data to estimate the probability and likely cost of the occurrence of an event such as death sickness injury disability or loss of property actuaries also address financial questions including those involving the level of pension contributions required to produce a certain retirement income and the way in which a company should invest resources to maximize its return on investments in light of potential risk using their broad knowledge actuaries help design and price insurance policies pension plans and other financial strategies in a manner which will help ensure that the plans are maintained on a sound financial basis
as another example mathematical finance will derive and extend the mathematical or numerical models without necessarily establishing a link to financial theory taking observed market prices as input mathematical consistency is required not compatibility with economic theory thus for example while a financial economist might study the structural reasons why a company may have a certain share price a financial mathematician may take the share price as a given and attempt to use stochastic calculus to obtain the corresponding value of derivatives of the stock (see valuation of options financial modeling)

a mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems
attributed to both alfrd rnyi and paul erds
die mathematiker sind eine art franzosen redet man mit ihnen so bersetzen sie es in ihre sprache und dann ist es alsobald ganz etwas anderes (mathematicians are [like] a sort of frenchmen if you talk to them they translate it into their own language and then it is immediately something quite different.)
johann wolfgang von goethe
each generation has its few great mathematicians...and [the others'] research harms no one
alfred w adler (1930- ) mathematics and creativity
in short i never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x squared + px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q say to one of these gentlemen by way of experiment if you please that you believe occasions may occur where x squared + px is not altogether equal to q and having made him understand what you mean get out of his reach as speedily as convenient for beyond doubt he will endeavor to knock you down
edgar allan poe the purloined letter
a mathematician like a painter or poet is a maker of patterns if his patterns are more permanent than theirs it is because they are made with ideas
g h hardy a mathematician's apology
some of you may have met mathematicians and wondered how they got that way
tom lehrer
it is impossible to be a mathematician without being a poet in soul
sofia kovalevskaya
there are two ways to do great mathematics the first is to be smarter than everybody else the second way is to be stupider than everybody elsebut persistent
raoul bott
mathematics is the queen of the sciences and arithmetic the queen of mathematics
carl friedrich gauss
== women in mathematics ==
while the majority of mathematicians are male there have been some demographic changes since world war ii for example in europe from 1992 onwards several women have been laureates of the prestigious ems prize some prominent female mathematicians throughout history are hypatia of alexandria (ca 400 ad) ada lovelace (18151852) maria gaetana agnesi (17181799) emmy noether (18821935) sophie germain (17761831) sofia kovalevskaya (18501891) alicia boole stott (18601940) rzsa pter (19051977) julia robinson (19191985) olga taussky-todd (19061995) milie du chtelet (17061749) mary cartwright (19001998) olga ladyzhenskaya (19222004) olga oleinik (19252001) and maryam mirzakhani
the association for women in mathematics is a professional society whose purpose is to encourage women and girls to study and to have active careers in the mathematical sciences and to promote equal opportunity and the equal treatment of women and girls in the mathematical sciences. the american mathematical society and other mathematical societies offer several prizes aimed at increasing the representation of women and minorities in the future of mathematics
