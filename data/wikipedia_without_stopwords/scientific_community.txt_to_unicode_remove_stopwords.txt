speaking scientific community
unlike previous centuries community scholars members learned societies similar institutions singular bodies individuals said today speak science scientists partly due specialized training scientists receive fields result many would lack expertise fields sciences instance due increasing complexity information specialization scientists cuttingedge research today done well funded groups scientists rather individuals however still multiple societies academies many countries help consolidate opinions research help guide public discussions matters policy governmentfunded research example united states national academy science nas united kingdoms royal society sometimes act surrogates opinions scientific community need ascertained policy makers national government statements national academy science royal society binding scientists necessarily reflect opinions every scientist given community since membership often exclusive commissions explicitly focused serving governments never shown systematic interest rankand file scientists think scientific matters exclusivity membership types organizations seen election processes existing members officially nominate others candidacy membership unusual organizations like national academy science engage external research projects since normally focus preparing scientific reports government agencies example rarely nas engages external active research seen struggle prepare overcome hurdles due lack experience coordinating research grants major research programs environment health
