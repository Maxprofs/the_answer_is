true flies are insects of the order diptera (from the greek di = two and ptera = wings) the most obvious distinction from other orders of insects is that a typical fly possesses a pair of flight wings on the mesothorax and a pair of halteres derived from the hind wings on the metathorax (some species of flies are exceptional in that they are secondarily flightless.) the only other order of insects bearing two true functional wings plus any form of halteres are the strepsiptera and in contrast to the flies the strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax
== taxonomyedit ==
the presence of a single pair of wings distinguishes most true flies from other insects with fly in their names such as mayflies dragonflies damselflies stoneflies whiteflies fireflies alderflies dobsonflies snakeflies sawflies caddisflies butterflies or scorpionflies however some true flies have become secondarily wingless for example many members of the superfamily hippoboscoidea and some species that are inquilines in social insect colonies
some authors draw a distinction in writing the common names of insects true flies are written as two words such as crane fly robber fly bee fly moth fly and fruit fly in contrast common names of nondipteran insects that have fly in their names are written as one word e.g butterfly stonefly dragonfly scorpionfly sawfly caddisfly whitefly in practice however though it is practical this is a comparatively new convention especially in older books one commonly might see the likes of saw fly and caddis fly or hyphenated forms such as house-fly and dragon-fly in any case non-entomologists cannot in general be expected to tell dipterans true flies from other insects so it would be unrealistic to expect rigour in the use of common names also exceptions to this rule occur such as the hoverfly which is a true fly and the spanish fly a type of blister beetle
the diptera comprise a large order containing an estimated 1,000,000 species of mosquitoes gnats midges and others although only an eighth (about 120,000 species) have been described it is one of the major insect orders both in terms of ecological and human (medical and economic) importance the diptera in particular the mosquitoes (culicidae) are of great importance as disease transmitters acting as vectors for malaria dengue west nile virus yellow fever encephalitis and other infectious diseases
== anatomy and biologyedit ==
flies are adapted for aerial movement and typically have short and streamlined bodies the first tagma of the fly the head consists of ocelli antennae compound eyes and the mouthparts (the labrum labium mandible and maxilla make up the mouthparts) the second tagma the thorax bears the wings and contains the flight muscles on the second segment which is greatly enlarged the first and third segments have been reduced to collar-like structures the third segment of the thorax bears the halteres which help to balance the insect during flight a further adaptation for flight is the reduction in number of the neural ganglia and concentration of nerve tissue in the thorax a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived muscomorpha infraorder
flies have a mobile head with eyes and in most cases have large compound eyes on the sides of the head with three small ocelli on the top for visual course control flies optic flow field is analyzed by a set of motion-sensitive neurons a subset of these neurons is thought to be involved in using the optic flow to estimate the parameters of self-motion such as yaw roll and sideward translation other neurons are thought to be involved in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself such as separating figures from ground using motion parallax the h1 neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of the fly allowing the fly to generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw the antennae take a variety of forms but are often short which reduces drag while flying
because no species of fly has teeth or any other organ or limb that allows them to eat solid foods flies consume only liquid food or finely granular foods such as pollen and their mouthparts and digestive tracts show various modifications for such diets female tabanidae use knife-like mandibles and maxillae to make a cross-shaped incision in the hosts skin and then lap up the blood the gut includes large diverticulae allowing the insect to store small quantities of liquid after a meal
for detailed anatomy explore which uses examples from the four major fly groups (lower diptera lower brachycera acalyptrate calyptrate) representing different anatomical expressions
=== reproduction and developmentedit ===
the genitalia of female flies are rotated to a varying degree from the position found in other insects in some flies this is a temporary rotation during mating but in others it is a permanent torsion of the organs that occurs during the pupal stage this torsion may lead to the anus being below the genitals or in the case of 360 torsion to the sperm duct being wrapped around the gut and the external organs being in their usual position when flies mate the male initially flies on top of the female facing in the same direction but then turns around to face in the opposite direction this forces the male to lie on his back for his genitalia to remain engaged with those of the female or the torsion of the male genitals allows the male to mate while remaining upright this leads to flies having more reproduction abilities than most insects and at a much quicker rate flies occur in great populations due to their ability to mate effectively and in a short period of time during the mating season
the female lays her eggs as close to the food source as possible and development is rapid allowing the larvae to consume as much food as possible in a short period of time before transforming into adults the eggs hatch immediately after being laid or the flies are ovoviviparous with the larvae hatching inside the mother
larval flies have no true legs some dipteran larvae such as species of simuliidae tabanidae and vermileonidae have prolegs adapted to such functions as holding onto a substrate in flowing water holding onto host tissues or holding prey roughly speaking some anatomical distinction exists between the larvae of the nematocera and the brachycera (see classification section below) especially in the brachycera little demarcation is seen between the thorax and abdomen though the demarcation may be very visible in many nematocera such as mosquitoes (see image both here and in the mosquito article) in the brachycera the head of the larva is not clearly distinguishable from the rest of the body and few if any sclerites occur informally such brachyceran larvae are called maggots but the term is not technical and often applied indifferently to fly larvae or insect larvae in general the eyes and antennae of brachyceran larvae are reduced or absent and the abdomen also lacks appendages such as cerci this lack of features is an adaptation to food such as carrion decaying detritus or host tissues surrounding endoparasites nematoceran larvae generally have visible eyes and antennae though usually small and of limited function
the pupae take various forms and in some cases develop inside a silk cocoon despite the myth that flies only live a day (which may have either arisen from confusion with the mayfly or the fact that a fly inside a house may starve to death in a few days) most adult dipterans can live about one month
== classificationedit ==
the nematocera are recognized by their elongated bodies and many-segmented often feathery antennae as represented by mosquitoes and crane flies the brachycera have a more roundly proportioned body and much shorter antennae in 1964 boris borisovitsch rohdendorf proposed a classification in which the nematocera are split into two suborders the archidiptera and the eudiptera
suborder nematocera (77 families 35 of them extinct) long antennae pronotum distinct from mesonotum in nematocera larvae are either eucephalic or hemicephalic and often aquatic
suborder brachycera (141 families 8 of them extinct) short antennae the pupa is inside a puparium formed from the last larval skin and they are generally robust flies with larvae having reduced mouthparts
infraorders tabanomorpha and asilomorpha these comprise the majority of what were the orthorrhapha under older classification schemes the antennae are short but differ in structure from those of the muscomorpha
infraorder muscomorpha (largely the cyclorrhapha of older schemes) muscomorpha have three-segmented aristate (with a bristle) antennae and larvae with three acephalic instars (maggots)
most of the muscomorpha are further subdivided into the subsections acalyptratae and calyptratae based on whether or not they have a calypter (a wing flap that extends over the halteres) the family muscidae that includes the house fly is among the calyptratae
beyond that considerable revision in the taxonomy of the flies has taken place since the introduction of modern cladistic techniques and much remains uncertain the secondary ranks between the suborders and the families are more out of practical or historical considerations than out of strict respect for phylogenetic classifications (modern cladists reject the use of linnaean rank names) all classifications in use now including this article contain some paraphyletic groupings this is emphasized where the numerous alternative systems are most greatly at odds see list of families of diptera
dipterans belong to the taxon mecopterida that also contains the mecoptera siphonaptera lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and trichoptera inside it they are classified closely together with mecoptera and siphonaptera in the superorder antliophora
== evolutionedit ==
the diptera derive from mecoptera or a strictly related group the first true dipterans known are from the middle triassic (around 240 million years ago) and they became widespread during the middle and late triassic
the basal clades in the diptera are the deuterophlebiidae and nymphomyiidae the bibionomorpha are a sister clade to brachycera the branching order of the remaining clades of the lower diptera - infraorders culicomorpha psychodomorpha and tipulomorpha - has yet to be resolved
within the brachycera several progressively nested groups exist eremoneura (three larval instars) cyclorrhapha (pupation occurs within a puparium) schizophora (flies that escape from their puparium using the ptilinal sac an evertable frontal pouch) and calyptratae (larger flies with wings that have the calypter an enlarged basal lobe)
the schizophora include most of the family-level diversity in diptera (about 85 families) and more than 50,000 species the calyptratae form a monophyletic superfamily other monophyletic superfamilies include the ephydroidea lauxanioidea nerioidea sciomyzoidea and tephritoidea the relationships between the remaining families have yet to be clarified
sister groups to the drosophilidae consist of two families braulidae and cryptochetidae
three episodes of rapid evolution occurred in the lower diptera (about 220 million years ago) lower brachycera (180 million years ago) and schizophora (66 million years ago)
== maggotsedit ==
maggots found on corpses are useful to forensic scientists specifically forensic entomologists maggot species can be identified by various means such as their anatomy and by matching their dna maggots of various species of flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly well-defined times after the death of the victim and so do their predators such as beetles in the family histeridae thus the presence or absence of particular species of fly maggots and other scavenger insects provide evidence as a basis for estimation of the time since death and sometimes other details such as the place of death
some species of maggots are bred commercially they are sold as bait in angling and as food for carnivorous pets such as some fishes reptiles and birds
in maggot therapy larvae of certain flies in the family calliphoridae are used to debride necrotic wounds
in food production certain cheese varieties such as casu marzu are exposed to flies known as cheese skippers members of the family piophilidae the digestive activities of the fly larvae soften or liquefy the cheese and modify the aroma as part of the process of maturation

flies have been depicted in mythology and literature in the biblical fourth plague of egypt flies represent death and decay myiagros was a god in greek mythology who chased away flies during the sacrifices to zeus and athena and zeus sent a fly to bite pegasus causing bellerophon to fall back to earth when he attempted to ride the winged steed to mount olympus in the traditional navajo religion big fly is an important spirit being

emily dickinson's 1855 poem i heard a fly buzz when i died also makes reference to flies in the context of death in fact flies such as the genus hydrotaea are used in forensic cases to determine time of death for corpses in william golding's 1954 novel lord of the flies the fly is a symbol of the children involved
in the 1958 science fiction film the fly (and its 1986 remake) a scientist accidentally exchanges parts of his body with those of a fly
the 1960 alfred hitchcock film psycho shows a close-up view of a fly while the lead character is heard mother [voice-over] it's sad when a mother has to speak the words that condemn her own son but i couldn't allow them to believe that i would commit murder they'll put him away now as i should have years ago he was always bad and in the end he intended to tell them i killed those girls and that man as if i could do anything except just sit and stare like one of his stuffed birds oh they know i can't even move a finger and i won't i'll just sit here and be quiet just in case they do suspect me they're probably watching me well let them let them see what kind of a person i am i'm not even going to swat that fly i hope they are watching they'll see they'll see and they'll know and they'll say why she wouldn't even harm a fly.
