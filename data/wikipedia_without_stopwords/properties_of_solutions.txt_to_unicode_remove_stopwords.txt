history
word colligative latin coligare introduced wilhelm ostwald ostwald classified solute properties three categories
colligative properties depend solute concentration temperature independent nature solute particles
additive properties mass sums properties constituent particles therefore depend also composition molecular formula solute
constitutional properties depend molecular structure solute
