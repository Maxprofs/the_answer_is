=== speaking with forked tongueedit ===
the phrase speaking with a forked tongue means to deliberately say one thing and mean another or to be hypocritical or act in a duplicitous manner in the longstanding tradition of many native american tribes speaking with a forked tongue has meant lying and a person was no longer considered worthy of trust once he had been shown to speak with a forked tongue this phrase was also adopted by americans around the time of the revolution and may be found in abundant references from the early 19th century often reporting on american officers who sought to convince the tribal leaders with whom they negotiated that they spoke with a straight and not with a forked tongue (as for example president andrew jackson told the creek nation in 1829) according to one 1859 account the native proverb that the white man spoke with a forked tongue originated as a result of the french tactic of the 1690s in their war with the iroquois of inviting their enemies to attend a peace conference only to be slaughtered or captured

the discoverer of a lie may also be convinced or coerced to collaborate with the liar becoming part of a conspiracy they may actively propagate the lie to other parties actively prevent the lie's discovery by other parties or simply omit publicizing the lie (a secondary lie of omission)
== detectionedit ==
some people may be better lie detectors than others better able to distinguish a lie by facial expression cadence of speech certain movements consistency and other methods according to david j lieberman phd in never be lied to again how to get the truth in five minutes or less in any conversation or situation these methods can be learned some methods of questioning may be more likely to elicit the truth for instance when was the last time you smoked marijuana? (a leading question) is more likely to get a truthful answer than do you smoke pot? asking the question most likely to get the information you want is a skill and can be learned avoiding vague questioning will help avoid lies of omission or vagueness
the question of whether lies can reliably be detected through nonverbal means is a subject of some controversy
polygraph lie detector machines measure the physiological stress a subject endures in a number of measures while he/she gives statements or answers questions spikes in stress are purported to indicate lying the accuracy of this method is widely disputed and in several well-known cases it was proven to have been deceived nonetheless it remains in use in many areas primarily as a method for eliciting confessions or employment screening polygraph results are not admissible as court evidence and are generally perceived to be pseudoscience
various truth drugs have been proposed and used anecdotally though none are considered very reliable the cia attempted to find a universal truth serum in the mk-ultra project but it was an overall failure
a recent study found that lying takes longer than telling the truth and thus the time to answer a question may be used as a method of lie detection however it has also been shown that instant-answers can be proof of a prepared lie the only compromise is to try to surprise the victim and find a midway answer not too quick nor too long
dr paul ekman and dr maureen o'sullivan spent several decades studying people's ability to spot deception in a study called the wizards project they studied police officers psychologists judges lawyers the cia fbi and the secret service after studying nearly 20,000 people they identified just over 50 people who can spot deception with great accuracy
dr freitas-magalhaes developed the forensicpsy and the psy7faces to read lies by facial expressions
== ethicsedit ==
aristotle believed no general rule on lying was possible because anybody who advocated lying could never be believed he said the philosophers st augustine as well as st thomas aquinas and immanuel kant condemned all lying however thomas aquinas also had an argument for lying according to all three there are no circumstances in which one may ethically lie even if the only way to protect oneself is to lie it is never ethically permissible to lie even in the face of murder torture or any other hardship each of these philosophers gave several arguments against lying all compatible with each other among the more important arguments are
lying is a perversion of the natural faculty of speech the natural end of which is to communicate the thoughts of the speaker
when one lies one undermines trust in society
meanwhile utilitarian philosophers have supported lies which achieve good outcomes white lies in his 2008 book how to make good decisions and be right all the time iain king suggested a credible rule on lying was possible and defined it as deceive only if you can change behaviour in a way worth more than the trust you would lose were the deception discovered (whether the deception actually is exposed or not).
in human all too human philosopher friedrich nietzsche suggested that those who refrain from lying may do so only because of the difficulty involved in maintaining the lie this is consistent with his general philosophy that divides (or ranks) people according to strength and ability thus some people tell the truth only out of weakness
== in other speciesedit ==
the capacity to lie has also been claimed to be possessed by non-humans in language studies with great apes in one instance gorilla koko when asked who tore a sink from the wall pointed to one of her handlers and then laughed deceptive body language such as feints that mislead as to the intended direction of attack or flight is observed in many species including wolves a mother bird deceives when it pretends to have a broken wing to divert the attention of a perceived predator including unwitting humans from the eggs in its nest to itself most notably the killdeer

=== literatureedit ===
sir walter scott's famous couplet oh what a tangled web we weave / when first we practise to deceive! describes the often difficult procedure of covering up a lie so that it is not detected in the future
== paradoxesedit ==
in any scenario where statements are assumed to be either true or false a person whom we know is consistently lying would paradoxically be a source of truth by taking the opposite of whatever they say there are many such paradoxes the most famous being known as the liar paradox commonly expressed as this sentence is a lie or this sentence is false. the so-called epimenides paradox ("all cretans are liars as stated by epimenides the cretan) is a forerunner of this though its status as a paradox is disputed a class of related logic puzzles are known as knights and knaves in which the goal is to determine who in a group of people is lying and who is telling the truth
== psychologyedit ==
the capacity to lie is noted early and nearly universally in human development social psychology and developmental psychology are concerned with the theory of mind which people employ to simulate another's reaction to their story and determine if a lie will be believable the most commonly cited milestone what is known as machiavellian intelligence is at the age of about four and a half years when children begin to be able to lie convincingly before this they seem simply unable to comprehend why others do not see the same view of events that they do and seem to assume that there is only one point of view which is their own the evolutionary theory proposed by darwin states that only the fittest will survive and by lying we aim to improve others perception of our social image and status capability and desirability in general studies have shown that humans begin lying at a mere age of 6 months through crying and laughing to gain attention scientific studies have also shown the presence of gender differences in lying although men and women lie at equal frequencies men are more likely to lie in order to please themselves while women are more likely to lie to please others we are individuals living in a world of competition and strict social norms where we are able to use lies and deception to enhance our chances of survival and reproduction stereotypically speaking men like to exaggerate about their sexual expertise but shy away from topics that degrade them while women understate their sexual expertise to make themselves more respectable and loyal in the eyes of men and avoid being labelled as a scarlet woman
young children learn from experience that stating an untruth can avoid punishment for misdeeds before they develop the theory of mind necessary to understand why it works in this stage of development children will sometimes tell outrageous and unbelievable lies because they lack the conceptual framework to judge whether a statement is believable or even to understand the concept of believability
when children first learn how lying works they lack the moral understanding of when to refrain from doing it this takes years of watching people tell lies and the results of these lies to develop a proper understanding propensity to lie varies greatly between children some doing so habitually and others being habitually honest habits in this regard are likely to change in early adulthood
those with parkinson's disease show difficulties in deceiving others difficulties that link to prefrontal hypometabolism this suggests a link between the capacity for dishonesty and integrity of prefrontal functioning pseudologia fantastica is a term applied by psychiatrists to the behavior of habitual or compulsive lying mythomania is the condition where there is an excessive or abnormal propensity for lying and exaggerating a recent study found that lying takes longer than telling the truth or as chief joseph succinctly put it it does not require many words to speak the truth.
== religious perspectivesedit ==
it is alleged that some belief systems may find lying to be justified leo tolstoy is cited as describing religious institutions as the product of deception [and] lies for a good purpose
=== augustine's taxonomyedit ===
augustine of hippo wrote two books about lying on lying (de mendacio) and against lying (contra mendacio) he describes each book in his later work retractions based on the location of de mendacio in retractions it appears to have been written about 395 ad the first work on lying begins magna qustio est de mendacio ("there is a great question about lying") from his text it can be derived that st augustine divided lies into eight categories listed in order of descending severity
lies in religious teaching
lies that harm others and help no one
lies that harm others and help someone
lies told for the pleasure of lying
lies told to please others in smooth discourse
lies that harm no one and that help someone materially
lies that harm no one and that help someone spiritually
lies that harm no one and that protect someone from bodily defilement
despite distinguishing between lies according to their external severity augustine maintains in both treatises that all lies defined precisely as the external communication of what one does not hold to be internally true are categorically sinful and therefore ethically impermissible
augustine wrote that lies told in jest or by someone who believes or opines the lie to be true are not in fact lies
=== in the bibleedit ===
the old testament and new testament of the bible both contain statements that god cannot lie and that lying is immoral (num 23:19 hab 2:3 heb 6:1318) nevertheless there are examples of god deliberately causing enemies to become disorientated and confused in order to provide victory (2 thess 2:11 1 kings 22:23 ezek 14:9)
and for this reason god will send them strong delusion that they should believe the lie (2 thess 2:11 nkjv)
various passages of the bible feature exchanges that assert lying is immoral and wrong (prov 6:1619 ps 5:6) (lev 19:11 prov 14:5 prov 30:6 zeph 3:13) (isa 28:15 dan 11:27) most famously in the ten commandments thou shalt not bear false witness (ex 20:217 deut 5:621) ex 23:1 matt 19:18 mark 10:19 luke 18:20 a specific reference to perjury
other passages feature descriptive (not prescriptive) exchanges where lying was committed in extreme circumstances involving life and death however most christian philosophers would argue that lying is never acceptable but that even those who are righteous in god's eyes sin sometimes old testament accounts of lying include
the midwives lied about their inability to kill the israelite children (ex 1:1521)
rahab lied to the king of jericho about hiding the hebrew spies (josh 2:45) and was not killed with those who were disobedient because of her faith (heb 11:31)
abraham instructed his wife sarah to mislead the egyptians and say that she is his sister (gen 12:10) abraham's story was strictly true sarah was his half sister but intentionally misleading because it was designed to lead the egyptians to believe that sarah was not abraham's wife for abraham feared that they would kill him in order to take her for she was very beautiful
in the new testament jesus refers to the devil as the father of lies (john 8:44) and paul commands christians do not lie to one another (col 3:9 cf lev 19:11)
in the day of judgement unrepentant liars will be punished in the lake of fire (rev 21:8 21:27)
=== in paganismedit ===
in gestattr one of the sections within the eddaic poem hvaml odin states that it is advisable when dealing with a false foe who lies to tell lies oneself
=== in zoroastrianismedit ===
zoroaster teaches that there are two powers in the universe asha which is truth order and that which is real and druj which is the lie later on the lie became personified as angra mainyu a figure similar to the christian devil who was portrayed as the eternal opponent of ahura mazda (god)
==== in ancient persiaedit ====
herodotus in his mid-5th century bc account of persian residents of the pontus reports that persian youths from their fifth year to their twentieth year were instructed in three things to ride a horse to draw a bow and to speak the truth he further notes that the most disgraceful thing in the world [the persians] think is to tell a lie the next worst to owe a debt because among other reasons the debtor is obliged to tell lies.
in achaemenid persia the lie drauga (in avestan druj) is considered to be a cardinal sin and it was punishable by death in some extreme cases tablets discovered by archaeologists in the 1930s at the site of persepolis give us adequate evidence about the love and veneration for the culture of truth during the achaemenian period these tablets contain the names of ordinary persians mainly traders and warehouse-keepers according to professor stanley insler of yale university as many as 72 names of officials and petty clerks found on these tablets contain the word truth thus says insler we have artapana protector of truth artakama lover of truth artamanah truth-minded artafarnah possessing splendour of truth artazusta delighting in truth artastuna pillar of truth artafrida prospering the truth and artahunara having nobility of truth it was darius the great who laid down the ordinance of good regulations during his reign darius testimony about his constant battle against the lie is found in the behistun inscription he testifies i was not a lie-follower i was not a doer of wrong  according to righteousness i conducted myself neither to the weak or to the powerful did i do wrong the man who cooperated with my house him i rewarded well who so did injury him i punished well.
he asks ahuramazda the god to protect the country from a (hostile) army from famine from the lie
darius had his hands full dealing with large-scale rebellion which broke out throughout the empire after fighting successfully with nine traitors in a year darius records his battles against them for posterity and tells us how it was the lie that made them rebel against the empire at the behistun inscription darius says
i smote them and took prisoner nine kings one was gaumata by name a magian he lied thus he said i am smerdis the son of cyrus  one acina by name an elamite he lied thus he said i am king in elam  one nidintu-bel by name a babylonian he lied thus he said i am nebuchadnezzar the son of nabonidus  the lie made them rebellious so that these men deceived the people
then advice to his son xerxes who is to succeed him as the great king
thou who shalt be king hereafter protect yourself vigorously from the lie the man who shall be a lie-follower him do thou punish well if thus thou shall think may my country be secure
