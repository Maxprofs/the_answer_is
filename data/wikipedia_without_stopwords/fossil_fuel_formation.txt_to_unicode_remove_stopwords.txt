introduction development concept
concept crossboundary subsidies developed merging ideas studies landscape ecology food web ecology ideas landscape ecology allow study population community food web dynamics incorporate spatial relationships landscape elements understanding dynamics polis et al
janzen first defined crossboundary subsidies process whereby organisms disperse one patch another impact resident organisms providing increased food resources opportunities reproduction thus serving subsidy residents definition crossboundary movement organisms considered broader definitions crossboundary subsidies also include materials nutrients detritus ie marburg et al facelli pickett
crossboundary subsidies subset general process spatial subsidies see polis et al crossboundary subsidies acknowledge presence role boundary different habitat patches mediating flows organisms materials contrast spatial subsidies require external inputs materials organisms originate outside patch interest
conceptual models
attempts made combine landscape food web ecology way explicitly recognizes importance crossboundary subsidies spatial features landscape food web dynamics often spatial subsidies treated subsidies simply arrive outside patch interest addressing landscape patterns processes may affect movement inputs boundary characteristics patch connectivity polis et al published thorough review spatially subsidized food web dynamics focusing effect subsidies population community consumerresource food web dynamics one main conclusions subsidies consumer species organisms eat organisms obtain energy resulted declines food resources recipient patch callaway hastings built polis et als conclusion model show subsidized consumers may always drive resource recipient patch consumers move patches frequently might occur consumers often move reasons food resource acquisition
cadenasso et al developed framework studying ecological boundaries implications understanding dynamics specific crossboundary subsidies boundary defined zone steepest gradient change characteristic one patch another rapidly decreasing light levels habitat transitions field forest framework flows across variable landscapes characterized type flow materials energy organisms etc patch contrast architecture composition process boundary structure architecture composition symbolic perceptual features considering crossboundary subsidy terms framework shows boundary mediate subsidy example cadenasso pickett found decreased lateral vegetation boundary forest field increased amount seeds transferred forest interior

source sink dynamics
idea subsidy materials organisms across patch boundary affecting resident populations clear parallels sourcesink dynamics fagan et al theory local populations connected dispersal extinction local populations prevented immigration neighboring patches pulliam sourcesink dynamics assumed individuals productive patches move less productive patches unsustainable populations pulliam many examples crossboundary subsidies thought exhibiting sourcesink dynamics rand et al found insects high productivity agricultural patch able sustain local populations lower productivity wildland patch continued dispersal agricultural patch effect subsidies local patches also impact populations species recipient food web subsidized population may compete prey upon species effectively would able without influx fagan et al
biotic interactions trophic structure
crossboundary subsidies important impacts species interactions food web dynamics subsidies materials organisms affect trophic feeding levels food webs either directly indirectly inputs nutrient detritus another patch generally increase population growth resident producers plants detritivores polis et al increased growth producer level result bottomup trophic effect increases populations lower trophic levels support higher population consumers would otherwise possible closed system polis et al allochthonous detrital inputs also strong impacts food web dynamics variety temporal scales ranging seconds millennia case fossil fuel formation buildup detritus millennia moore et al
coarse woody debris
many food webs rely crossboundary subsidies detritus sources energy nutrients huxel mccann example series lakes wisconsin examined presence coarse woody debris cwd characteristics surrounding landscape might control input lakes coarse woody debris lakes important providing habitat food resources variety organisms including small fish werner hall algae detritivores bowen et al marburg et al compared variation within among lakes cwd found subsidies cwd lakes lower lakes human development along shore development along lakeshore thought alteration characteristics patch boundary lake forest case development decreased forest density source cwd also permeability boundary flows cwd marburg et al
predatorprey
addition bottomup effects topdown effects may also occur due crossboundary subsidies topdown effects subsidies consumers top level food web control populations lower levels would expected action resident consumers polis et al consumers cross boundaries may greater effect recipient patch population prey recipient patch lower population growth rate prey source patch fagan et al rand et al thus crossboundary subsidies may alter predatorpreycompetitive interactions result disproportionate impact communities recipient patch
trophic cascade
subsidizing top trophic levels effects may also felt lower trophic levels phenomenon known trophic cascade example trophic cascade also acted crossboundary subsidy illustrated study knight et al changes trophic structure one ecosystem resulted effect cascaded adjacent ecosystem ponds containing fish dragonfly larvae kept minimum fish predation resulting low density adult dragonfly predators led high density bee pollinators fish present adjacent ponds bees able pollinate flowers adjacent upland ecosystem fish absent dragonfly population could thought subsidized absence fish predation subsidy transferred across pondupland boundary adult dragonfly movement affect interaction bee pollinators plants
human activities affecting crossboundary subsidies
fragmentation
landscapes become increasingly fragmented due human activity influence patch boundaries individual patches becomes relatively important murcia fragmentation cut necessary subsidies patches increase magnitude subsidies adjacent patches example study fragmentation wildlands agriculturally dominated landscape subsidies habitat specialist insects wildland patches prevented surrounding small wildland patches inhospitable agricultural land isolation reduced potential gene flow longterm persistence population subsidies insects specialized agricultural crops increased wildland populations increasing effect resident wildland species duelli
alteration patch boundary characteristics
changing internal structure composition patch may substantially alter crossboundary subsidies logging may temporarily increase subsidies nutrients detritus adjacent streams likens et al invasive species introduced agricultural patches may act subsidy adjacent wildland invasive populations preventing native species establishment even within protected area janzen
marine systems
human alterations patch characteristics may also curtail crossboundary subsidies overfishing marine systems may drastically reduce potentially crucial marine subsidies organisms freshwater riparian systems zhang et al example helfield naiman found riparian trees alaska obtain nitrogen marine sources transferred migrating salmon system salmon feed ocean incorporating marine nitrogen biomass later return natal small streams spawn die salmon carcasses transferred across streamriparian zone boundary terrestrial predators flooding events subsidized growth terrestrial plants thus marine overfishing may affect productivity alaskan forests depend subsidies marinederived nitrogen
discussed crossboundary subsidies depend characteristics patch boundary humaninduced changes characteristics affect boundary permeability certain organisms materials example crossboundary subsidy leaf litter forest adjacent open field may attenuated boundary road present making boundary less permeable flows leaf litter facelli pickett
implications management future research needs
habitat management might benefit recognizing effect humans may individual patches dynamics patches cases managers may need focus patterns processes occur outside patch interest factors may also important internal population dynamics understanding boundary features influence various flows interest necessary managing flows
invasive species
implications invasive species use biological control agents may also closely related idea crossboundary subsidies introducing species one patch biocontrol may unforeseen consequences dynamics within adjacent patches
fields public policy also benefit considering crossboundary subsidies example governments often provide financial subsidies fisheries negative effect ecosystems encouraging overfishing munro sumaila understanding processes affect financial resources flow across particular governmentindustry boundary important maintenance marine food webs considering crossboundary effects essential complete understanding potential consequences human action landscape
