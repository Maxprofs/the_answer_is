a revolver is a repeating firearm that has a revolving cylinder containing multiple chambers and at least one barrel for firing the term revolver refers to a handgun but other weapons may also have a revolving chamber these include some models of grenade launchers shotguns and rifles
though the original name was revolving gun the short-hand revolver is universally used (cannon using this mechanism are known as revolver cannon.) nearly all early revolvers and many modern ones have six chambers in the cylinder giving rise to the slang term six-shooter however revolvers with a number of different chambers have been made with most modern revolvers having 5 or 6 chambers
the revolver allows the user to fire multiple rounds without reloading each time the user cocks the hammer the cylinder revolves to align the next chamber and round with the hammer and barrel which gives this type of firearm its name in a single-action revolver the user pulls the hammer back with his free hand or thumb the trigger pull only releases the hammer in a double-action revolver pulling the trigger moves the hammer back then releases it which requires a longer and heavier trigger pull than single-action loading and unloading a double-action revolver requires the operator to swing out the cylinder and insert the proper ammunition all while keeping the gun pointed in a safe direction
the first guns with multichambered cylinders that revolved to feed one barrel were made in the late 16th century in europe they were expensive and rare curiosities not until the 19th century would revolvers become common weapons for non-rich owners one of the first was a flintlock revolver made by elisha collier in 1814 the first percussion cap revolver was invented by the italian francesco antonio broccu 1833 he received a prize of 300 francs for his invention although he did not patent it his revolver was shown to king charles albert of sardinia however in 1835 a similar handgun was patented by samuel colt who would go on to make the first mass-produced revolver
the first cartridge revolvers were produced around 1854 by eugene lefaucheux
revolvers soon became standard for nearly all uses in the early 20th century semi-automatic pistols were developed which can hold more rounds and are faster to reload automatic pistols also have a flat profile more suitable for concealed carry semi-auto pistols were not considered reliable enough for serious police work or self-defense until the later half of the century however and revolvers were the dominant handgun for police and civilians until modern pistols such as the beretta 92 and glock 17 were developed in the 70s and 80s automatic pistols have almost completely replaced revolvers in military and law enforcement use (in military use from 1910-1960 in law enforcement in the 1980s and 1990s)
revolvers still remain popular as back-up and off-duty handguns among american law enforcement officers and security guards also revolvers are still common in the american private sector as defensive and sporting/hunting firearms famous police and military revolvers include the webley the colt single action army the colt police special the smith & wesson model 36 the smith & wesson model 10 the smith & wesson 1917 the smith & wesson model 3 the nagant m1895
== history ==
in the development of firearms an important limiting factor was the time it took to reload the weapon after it was fired while the user was reloading the weapon was useless and an adversary might be able to take advantage of the situation and kill or wound the user several approaches to the problem of increasing the rate of fire were developed the earliest being multi-barrelled weapons which allowed two or more shots without reloading later weapons featured multiple barrels revolving along a single axis
the earliest examples of what today is called a revolver were made in germany in the late 16th century these weapons featured a single barrel with a revolving cylinder holding the powder and ball they would soon be made by many european gun-makers in numerous designs and configurations however these weapons were difficult to use complicated and prohibitively expensive to make as such they were not widely distributed it would be several hundred years before the revolver would see widespread use
in 1836 an american samuel colt patented the first revolver mechanism that led to the widespread use of the revolver according to samuel colt he came up with the idea for the revolver while at sea inspired by the capstan which had a ratchet and pawl mechanism on it a version of which was used in his guns to rotate the cylinder revolvers proliferated largely due to colt's ability as a salesman but his influence spread in other ways as well the build quality of his company's guns became famous and its armories in america and england trained several seminal generations of toolmakers and other machinists who had great influence in other manufacturing efforts of the next half century
early revolvers were caplocks and loaded as a muzzle-loader the user poured black powder into each chamber rammed down a bullet on top of it then placed percussion caps on the nipple at the rear of each chamber where the hammer would fall on it this was similar to loading a traditional single-shot muzzle-loading pistol except that the powder and shot could be loaded directly into the front of the cylinder rather than having to be loaded down the whole length of the barrel importantly this allowed the barrel itself to be rifled since the user wasn't required to force the tight fitting bullet down the barrel in order to load it (a traditional muzzle-loading pistol had a smoothbore and relatively loose fitting shot which allowed easy loading but gave much less accuracy) when firing the next shot the user would raise his pistol vertically as he cocked the hammer back so as to let the fragments of the burst percussion cap fall out so as to not jam the mechanism some of the most popular cap-and-ball revolvers were the colt model 1851 navy mode 1860 army model and colt pocket percussion revolvers all of which saw extensive use in the american civil war although american revolvers were the most common european arms makers were making numerous revolvers by that time as well many of which found their way into the hands of the american forces including the single action lefaucheux and lemat revolver and the beaumont-adams and tranter revolvers which were early double-action weapons in spite of being muzzle-loaders
in 1854 eugene lefaucheux introduced the lefaucheux model 1854 the first revolver to use self-contained metallic cartridges rather than loose powder pistol ball and percussion caps it is a single-action pinfire revolver holding six rounds
on november 17 1856 daniel b wesson and horace smith signed an agreement for the exclusive use of the rollin white patent at a rate of 25 cents for every revolver smith & wesson began production late in 1857 and enjoyed years of exclusive production of rear-loading cartridge revolvers in america due to their association with rollin white who held the patent and vigorously defended it against any perceived infringement by other manufacturers (much as colt had done with his original patent on the revolver) although white held the patent other manufacturers were able to sell firearms using the design provided they were willing to pay royalties
after white's patent finally expired in april 1869 a 3rd extension was refused other gun-makers were finally allowed to produce their own weapons using the rear-loading method without having to pay a royalty on each gun sold early guns were often conversions of earlier cap-and-ball revolvers modified to accept metallic cartridges loaded from the rear but later models such as the colt model 1872 open top and the smith & wesson model 3 were designed from the start as cartridge revolvers
in 1873 colt introduced the famous model 1873 also known as the single action army the colt 45 (not to be confused with colt made models of the m1911 semi-automatic) or simply the peacemaker one of the most famous handguns ever made this popular design which was a culmination of many of the advances introduced in earlier weapons fired 6 metallic cartridges and was offered in over 30 different calibers and various barrel lengths it is still in production along with numerous clones and lookalikes and its overall appearance has remained the same since 1873 although originally made for the united states army (hence the name) the model 1873 was widely distributed and popular with ranchers lawmen and outlaws alike its design has influenced countless other revolvers colt has discontinued its production twice but brought it back due to popular demand and continues to make it to this day
in the u.s the traditional single-action revolver still reigned supreme until the late 19th century in europe however arms makers were quick to adopt the double-action trigger while the us was producing weapons like the model 1873 the europeans were building double-action models like the french mas modle 1873 and the somewhat later british enfield mk i and ii revolvers (britain relied on cartridge conversions of the earlier beaumont-adams double-action prior to this) colt's first attempt at a double action revolver to compete with the european manufacturers was the colt model 1877 which earned lasting notoriety for its overly complex expensive and fragile trigger mechanism which in addition to failing frequently also had a terrible trigger pull unless given the attentions of a competent gunsmith
in 1889 colt introduced the model 1889 the first truly modern double action revolver which differed from earlier double action revolvers by having a swing-out cylinder as opposed to a top-break or side-loading cylinder swing out cylinders quickly caught on because they combined the best features of earlier designs top-break actions gave the ability to eject all empty shells simultaneously and exposed all chambers for easy reloading but having the frame hinged into two halves weakened the gun and negatively effected accuracy due to lack of rigidity side-loaders like the earlier colt model 1871 and 1873 gave a rigid frame but required the user to eject and load one cylinder at a time as they rotated the cylinder to line each chamber up with the side-mounted loading gate smith & wesson followed 7 years later with the hand ejector model 1896 in 32 s&w long caliber followed by the very similar yet improved model 1899 (later known as the model 10) which introduced the new 38 special cartridge the model 10 went on to become the best selling handgun of the 20th century at 6,000,000 units and the 38 special is still the most popular chambering for revolvers in the world these new guns were an improvement over the colt 1889 design since they incorporated a combined center-pin and ejector rod to lock the cylinder in position the 1889 did not use a center pin and the cylinder was prone to move out of alignment
revolvers have remained popular to the present day in many areas although in the military and law enforcement they have largely been supplanted by magazine-fed semi-automatic pistols such as the beretta m9 especially in circumstances where reload time and higher cartridge capacity are deemed important
=== patents ===
elisha collier of boston massachusetts patented a flintlock revolver in britain in 1818 and significant numbers were being produced in london by 1822 the origination of this invention is in doubt as similar designs were patented in the same year by artemus wheeler in the united states and by cornelius coolidge in france samuel colt submitted a british patent for his revolver in 1835 and an american patent (number 138) on february 25 1836 for a revolving gun and made the first production model on march 5 of that year
another revolver patent was issued to samuel colt on august 29 1839 the february 25 1836 patent was then reissued as u.s patent re00,124 entitled revolving gun on october 24 1848 this was followed by u.s patent 0,007,613 on september 3 1850 for a revolver and by u.s patent 0,007,629 on september 10 1850 for a revolver u.s patent 5,333,531 was issued to roger c field for an economical device for minimizing the flash gap of a revolver between the barrel and the cylinder in 1855 rollin white patented the bored-through cylinder entitled improvement in revolving fire-arms u.s patent 00,093,653 in 1856 horace smith & daniel wesson formed a partnership (s&w) developed and manufactured a revolver chambered for a self-contained metallic cartridge
== design ==
a revolver works by having several firing chambers arranged in a circle in a cylindrical block that are brought into alignment with the firing mechanism and barrel one at a time in contrast other repeating firearms such as bolt-action lever-action pump-action and semi-automatic have a single firing chamber and a mechanism to load and extract cartridges into it
a single-action revolver requires the hammer to be pulled back by hand before each shot which also revolves the cylinder this leaves the trigger with just one single action left to perform - releasing the hammer to fire the shot - so the force and distance required to pull the trigger can be minimal in contrast with a self-cocking revolver one long squeeze of the trigger pulls back the hammer and revolves the cylinder then finally fires the shot they can generally be fired faster than a single-action but with reduced accuracy in the hands of most shooters
most modern revolvers are traditional double-action which means they may operate either in single-action or self-cocking mode the accepted meaning of double-action has confusingly come to be the same as self-cocking so modern revolvers that cannot be pre-cocked are called double-action-only these are intended for concealed carry because the hammer of a traditional design is prone to snagging on clothes when drawn most revolvers do not come with accessory rails which are used for mounting lights and lasers except for the smith & wesson m&p r8 (.357 magnum) smith & wesson model 325 thunder ranch (.45 acp) and all versions of the chiappa rhino (.357 magnum 919mm 40 s&w or 921mm) except for the 2 model respectively however certain revolvers such as the taurus judge and charter arms revolvers can be fitted with accessory rails
most commonly such revolvers have 5 or 6 chambers hence the common names of six-gun or six-shooter however some revolvers have 7 8 9 or 10 chambers often depending on the caliber and at least one revolver has 12 chambers (the us fire arms model 12/22) each chamber has to be reloaded manually which makes reloading a revolver a much slower procedure than reloading a semi-automatic pistol
compared to autoloading handguns a revolver is often much simpler to operate and may have greater reliability for example should a semiautomatic pistol fail to fire clearing the chamber requires manually cycling the action to remove the errant round as cycling the action normally depends on the energy of a cartridge firing with a revolver this is not necessary as none of the energy for cycling the revolver comes from the firing of the cartridge but is supplied by the user either through cocking the hammer or in a double-action design by just squeezing the trigger another significant advantage of revolvers is superior ergonomics particularly for users with small hands a revolver's grip does not hold a magazine and it can be designed or customized much more than the grip of a typical semi-automatic partially because of these reasons revolvers still hold significant market share as concealed carry and home-defense weapons
a revolver can be kept loaded and ready to fire without fatiguing any springs and is not very dependent on lubrication for proper firing additionally in the case of double-action-only revolvers there is no risk of accidental discharge from dropping alone as the hammer is cocked by the trigger pull however the revolver's clockwork-like internal parts are relatively delicate and can become misaligned after a severe impact and its revolving cylinder can become jammed by excessive dirt or debris
over the long period of development of the revolver many calibers have been used some of these have proved more durable during periods of standardization and some have entered general public awareness among these are the 22 rimfire a caliber popular for target shooting and teaching novice shooters 38 special and 357 magnum known for police use the 44 magnum famous from clint eastwood's dirty harry films and the 45 colt used in the colt revolver of the wild west introduced in 2003 the smith & wesson model 500 is one of the most powerful revolvers utilizing the 500 s&w magnum cartridge
because the rounds in a revolver are headspaced on the rim some revolvers are capable of chambering more than one type of ammunition the 44 magnum round will chamber the shorter 44 special and shorter 44 colt likewise the 357 magnum will safely chamber 38 special and 38 short colt in 1996 a revolver known as the medusa m47 was made that could chamber 25 different cartridges with bullet diameters between 355 and 357
revolver technology lives on in other weapons used by the military some autocannons and grenade launchers use mechanisms similar to revolvers and some riot shotguns use spring-loaded cylinders holding up to 12 rounds in addition to serving as backup guns revolvers still fill the specialized niche role as a shield gun law enforcement personnel using a bulletproof ballistic shield (gun shield) sometimes opt for a revolver instead of a self-loading pistol because the slide of a pistol may strike the front of the shield when fired revolvers do not suffer from this disadvantage a second revolver may be secured behind the shield to provide a quick means of continuity of fire many police also still use revolvers as their duty weapon due to their relative mechanical simplicity and user friendliness
with the advancement of technology and design in 2010 major revolver manufacturers are coming out with polymer frame revolvers like the ruger lcr smith & wesson bodyguard 38 and taurus protector polymer the new innovative design incorporates advanced polymer technology that lowers weight significantly helps absorbs recoil and strong enough to handle +p and 357 magnum loads the polymer is only used on the lower frame and joined to a metal alloy upper frame barrel and cylinder polymer technology is considered one of the major advancements in revolver history because the frame has always been metal alloy and mostly one piece frame design
another recent development in revolver technology is the rhino a revolver introduced by italian manufacturer chiappa in 2009 and first sold in the u.s in 2010 the rhino built with the u.s concealed carry market in mind is designed so that the bullet fires from the bottom chamber of the cylinder instead of the top chamber as in standard revolvers this is intended to reduce muzzle flip allowing for faster and more accurate repeat shots in addition the cylinder cross-section is hexagonal instead of circular further reducing the weapon's profile
== loading and unloading ==
=== front loading ===
the first revolvers were front loading and were a bit like muskets in that the powder and bullet were loaded separately these were caplocks or cap and ball revolvers because the caplock method of priming was the first to be compact enough to make a practical revolver feasible when loading each chamber in the cylinder was rotated out of line with the barrel and charged from the front with loose powder and an oversized bullet next the chamber was aligned with the ramming lever underneath the barrel pulling the lever would drive a rammer into the chamber pushing the ball securely in place finally the user would place percussion caps on the nipples on the rear face of the cylinder
after each shot a user was advised to raise his revolver vertically while cocking back the hammer so as to allow the fragments of the spent percussion cap to fall out safely otherwise the fragments could fall into the revolver's mechanism and jam it caplock revolvers were vulnerable to chain fires wherein hot gas from a shot ignited the powder in the other chambers this could be prevented by sealing the chambers with cotton wax or grease
loading a cylinder in this manner was a slow and awkward process and generally could not be done in the midst of battle some soldiers solved this by carrying multiple revolvers in the field another solution was to use a revolver with a detachable cylinder design these revolvers allowed the shooter to quickly remove a cylinder and replace it with a full one
=== fixed cylinder designs ===
in many of the first generation of cartridge revolvers (especially those that were converted after manufacture) the base pin on which the cylinder revolved was removed and the cylinder taken from the revolver for loading most revolvers using this method of loading are single-action revolvers although iver johnson produced double-action models with removable cylinders the removable-cylinder design is employed in some modern micro-revolvers (usually in 22 caliber) in order to simplify their design these weapons are small enough to fit in the palm of the hand
later single-action revolver models with a fixed cylinder used a loading gate at the rear of the cylinder that allowed insertion of one cartridge at a time for loading while a rod under the barrel could be pressed rearward to eject the fired case
the loading gate on the original colt designs (and on nearly all single-action revolvers since such as the famous colt single action army) is on the right side which was done to facilitate loading while on horseback with the revolver held in the left hand with the reins of the horse the cartridges can be ejected and loaded with the right hand
because the cylinders in these types of revolvers are firmly attached at the front and rear of the frame and the frame is typically full thickness all the way around fixed cylinder revolvers are inherently strong designs accordingly many modern large caliber hunting revolvers tend to be based on the fixed cylinder design fixed cylinder revolvers can fire the strongest and most powerful cartridges but at the price of being the slowest to load and reload and they cannot use speedloaders or moon clips for loading as only one chamber is exposed at a time to the loading gate
=== top break ===
in a top-break revolver the frame is hinged at the bottom front of the cylinder releasing the lock and pushing the barrel down exposes the rear face of the cylinder in most top-break revolvers this act also operates an extractor that pushes the cartridges in the chambers back far enough that they will fall free or can be removed easily fresh rounds are then inserted into the cylinder the barrel and cylinder are then rotated back and locked in place and the revolver is ready to fire
top break revolvers can be loaded more rapidly than fixed-frame revolvers especially with the aid of a speedloader or moon clip however this design is much weaker and cannot handle high pressure rounds while this design is mostly obsolete today supplanted by the stronger yet equally convenient swing-out design manufacturers have begun making reproductions of late 19th century designs for use in cowboy action shooting
the most commonly found top-break revolvers were manufactured by smith & wesson webley & scott iver johnson harrington & richardson manhattan fire arms meriden arms and forehand & wadsworth
=== tip up ===
the tip-up was the first revolver design for use with metallic cartridges in the smith & wesson model 1 it is similar to the break-open design that had a hinge on the top rear of the frame but in the case of the tip-up the barrel release catch is located on the side of the frame in front of the trigger smith & wesson discontinued it in the third series of the smith & wesson model 1 1/2 but it was fairly widely used in europe in the 19th century after a patent by spirlet in 1870 which also included an ejector
=== swing out cylinder ===
the most modern method of loading and unloading a revolver is by means of the swing out cylinder the cylinder is mounted on a pivot that is parallel to the chambers and the cylinder swings out and down (to the left in most cases) an extractor is fitted operated by a rod projecting from the front of the cylinder assembly when pressed it will push all fired rounds free simultaneously (as in top break models the travel is designed to not completely extract longer unfired rounds) the cylinder may then be loaded singly or again with a speedloader closed and latched in place
the pivoting part that supports the cylinder is called the crane it is the weak point of swing-out cylinder designs using the method often portrayed in movies and television of flipping the cylinder open and closed with a flick of the wrist can in fact cause the crane to bend over time throwing the cylinder out of alignment with the barrel lack of alignment between chamber and barrel is a dangerous condition as it can impede the bullet's transition from chamber to barrel this gives rise to higher pressures in the chamber bullet damage and the potential for an explosion if the bullet becomes stuck
the shock of firing can exert a great deal of stress on the crane as in most designs the cylinder is only held closed at one point the rear of the cylinder stronger designs such as the ruger super redhawk use a lock in the crane as well as the lock at the rear of the cylinder this latch provides a more secure bond between cylinder and frame and allows the use of larger more powerful cartridges swing out cylinders are rather strong but not as strong as fixed cylinders and great care must be taken with the cylinder when loading so as not to damage the crane
== action ==
=== single-action ===
in a single-action revolver the hammer is manually cocked usually with the thumb of the firing or supporting hand this action advances the cylinder to the next round and locks the cylinder in place with the chamber aligned with the barrel the trigger when pulled releases the hammer which fires the round in the chamber to fire again the hammer must be manually cocked again this is called single-action because the trigger only performs a single action of releasing the hammer because only a single action is performed and trigger pull is lightened firing a revolver in this way allows most shooters to achieve greater accuracy additionally the need to cock the hammer manually acts as a safety the colt paterson revolver the walker colt the colt's dragoon and the colt single action army pistol of the american frontier era are all good examples of this system
=== double-action ===
in double-action (da) the stroke of the trigger pull generates three actions
the hammer is pulled back to the cocked position
at the same time the cylinder is indexed to the next round
the hammer is released to strike the firing pin
thus da means that a cocking action separate from the trigger pull is unnecessary every trigger pull will result in a complete cycle this allows uncocked carry while also allowing draw-and-fire using only the trigger a longer and harder trigger stroke is the trade-off however this drawback can also be viewed as a safety feature as the gun is safer against accidental discharges from being dropped
most double-action revolvers may be fired in two ways
the first way is single-action that is exactly the same as a single-action revolver the hammer is cocked with the thumb which indexes the cylinder and when the trigger is pulled the hammer is tripped
the second way is double-action or from a hammer-down position in this case the trigger first cocks the hammer and revolves the cylinder then trips the hammer at the rear of the trigger stroke firing the round in the chamber
certain revolvers called double-action-only (dao) or more correctly but less commonly self-cocking lack the latch that enables the hammer to be locked to the rear and thus can only be fired in the double-action mode with no way to lock the hammer back dao designs tend to have bobbed or spurless hammers and may even have the hammer completely covered by the revolver's frame (i.e. shrouded or hooded) these are generally intended for concealed carrying where a hammer spur could snag when the revolver is drawn the potential reduction in accuracy in aimed fire is offset by the increased capability for concealment
da and dao revolvers were the standard-issue sidearm of countless police departments for many decades only in the 1990s did the semiautomatic pistol begin to make serious inroads after the advent of safe actions the reasons for these choices are the modes of carry and use double action is good for high-stress situations because it allows a mode of carry in which draw and pull the trigger is the only requirementno safety catch release nor separate cocking stroke is required
=== other ===
in the cap-and-ball days of the mid 19th century two revolver models the english tranter and the american savage figure eight used a method whereby the hammer was cocked by the shooters middle finger pulling on a second trigger below the main trigger
iver johnson made an unusual model from 1940 to 1947 called the trigger cocking double action if the hammer was down pulling the trigger would cock the hammer if the trigger was pulled with the hammer cocked it would then fire this meant that to fire the revolver from a hammer down state the trigger must be pulled twice
== 3d printed revolver ==
the zig zag revolver is a 3d printed 38 revolver made public in may 2014 it was created using an $500 plastic 3d-printer used the name of the printer was not revealed by the creator it was created by a japanese citizen from kawasaki named yoshitomo imura he was arrested in may 2014 after he had posted a video online of himself firing a 3d printed zig zag revolver it is the first 3d printed japanese gun in the world which can discharge live cartridges
== use with suppressors ==
as a general rule revolvers cannot be effective with a sound suppressor ("silencer") as there is usually a small gap between the revolving cylinder and the barrel which a bullet must traverse or jump when fired from this opening a rather loud report is produced a suppressor can only suppress noise coming from the muzzle
a suppressible revolver design does exist in the nagant m1895 a belgian designed revolver used by imperial russia and later the soviet union from 1895 through world war ii this revolver uses a unique cartridge whose case extends beyond the tip of the bullet and a cylinder that moves forward to place the end of the cartridge inside the barrel when ready to fire this bridges the gap between the cylinder and the barrel and expands to seal the gap when fired while the tiny gap between cylinder and barrel on most revolvers is insignificant to the internal ballistics the seal is especially effective when used with a suppressor and a number of suppressed nagant revolvers have been used since its invention
there is a modern revolver of russian design the ots-38 which uses ammunition that incorporates the silencing mechanism into the cartridge case making the gap between cylinder and barrel irrelevant as far as the suppression issue is concerned the ots-38 does need an unusually close and precise fit between the cylinder and barrel due to the shape of bullet in the special ammunition (soviet sp-4) which was originally designed for use in a semi-automatic
additionally the us military experimented with designing a special version of the smith & wesson model 29 for tunnel rats called the quiet special purpose revolver or qspr using special 40 caliber ammunition it never entered official service
== automatic revolvers ==
the term automatic revolver has two different meanings the first being used in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when automatic referred not to the operational mechanism of firing but of extraction and ejection of spent casings an automatic revolver in this context is one which extracts empty fired cases automatically, i.e. upon breaking open the action rather than requiring manual extraction of each case individually with a sliding rod or pin (as in the colt single action army design) this term was widely used in the advertising of the period as a way to distinguish such revolvers from the far more common rod-extraction types
in the second sense automatic revolver refers to the mechanism of firing rather than extraction double-action revolvers use a long trigger pull to cock the hammer thus negating the need to manually cock the hammer between shots the disadvantage of this is that the long heavy pull cocking the hammer makes the double-action revolver much harder to shoot accurately than a single-action revolver (although cocking the hammer of a double-action reduces the length and weight of the trigger pull) a rare class of revolvers called automatic for its firing design attempts to overcome this restriction giving the high speed of a double-action with the trigger effort of a single-action the webley-fosbery automatic revolver is the most famous commercial example it was recoil-operated and the cylinder and barrel recoiled backwards to cock the hammer and revolve the cylinder cam grooves were milled on the outside of the cylinder to provide a means of advancing to the next chamberhalf a turn as the cylinder moved back and half a turn as it moved forward 38 caliber versions held eight shots 455 caliber versions six at the time the few available automatic pistols were larger less reliable and more expensive the automatic revolver was popular when it first came out but was quickly superseded by the creation of reliable inexpensive semi-automatic pistols
in 1997 the mateba company developed a type of recoil-operated automatic revolver commercially named the mateba autorevolver which uses the recoil energy to auto-rotate a normal revolver cylinder holding six or seven cartridges depending on the model the company has made several versions of its autorevolver including longer-barrelled and carbine variations chambered for 357 magnum 44 magnum and 454 casull
the pancor jackhammer is a combat shotgun based on a similar mechanism to an automatic revolver it uses a blow-forward action to move the barrel forward (which unlocks it from the cylinder) and then rotate the cylinder and cock the hammer
== revolving long guns ==
revolvers were not limited to handguns and as a longer barrelled arm is more useful in military applications than a sidearm the idea was applied to both rifles and shotguns throughout the history of the revolver mechanism with mixed degrees of success
=== rifles ===
revolving rifles were an attempt to increase the rate of fire of rifles by combining them with the revolving firing mechanism that had been developed earlier for revolving pistols colt began experimenting with revolving rifles in the early 19th century making them in a variety of calibers and barrel lengths colt revolving rifles were the first repeating rifles adopted by the u.s government but they had their problems they were officially given to soldiers because of their rate of fire but after firing six shots the shooter had to take an excessive amount of time to reload also on occasion colt rifles discharged all their rounds at once endangering the shooter even so an early model was used in the seminole wars in 1838 during the civil war a lemat carbine was made based on the lemat revolver
=== shotguns ===
colt briefly manufactured several revolving shotguns that were met with mixed success the colt model 1839 shotgun was manufactured between 1839 and 1841 later the colt model 1855 shotgun based on the model 1855 revolving rifle was manufactured between 1860 and 1863 because of their low production numbers and age they are among the rarest of all colt firearms
the armsel striker was a modern take on the revolving shotgun that held 10 rounds of 12 gauge ammunition in its cylinder it was copied by cobray as the streetsweeper
taurus manufactures a carbine variant of the taurus judge revolver along with its australian partner company rossi known as the taurus/rossi circuit judge it comes in the original combination chambering of 410 bore and 45 long colt as well as the 44 remington magnum chambering the rifle has small blast shields attached to the cylinder to protect the shooter from hot gases escaping between the cylinder and barrel
== six gun ==
a six gun is a revolver that holds six cartridges the cylinder in a six gun is often called a wheel and the six gun is itself often called a wheel gun although a six gun can refer to any six-chambered revolver it is typically a reference to the colt single action army or its modern look-alikes such as the ruger vaquero and beretta stampede
until the 1970s when older-design revolvers such as colt single action armys and ruger blackhawks were re-engineered with drop safeties (such as firing pin blocks hammer blocks or transfer bars) that prevent the firing pin from contacting the cartridge's primer unless the trigger is pulled safe carry required the hammer being positioned over an empty chamber reducing the available cartridges from six to five or on some models in between chambers on either a pin or in a groove for that purpose thus keeping the full six rounds available this kept the uncocked hammer from resting directly on the primer of a cartridge if not used in this manner the hammer rests directly on a primer and unintentional firing may occur if the gun is dropped or the hammer is struck some holster makers provided a thick leather thong to place underneath the hammer that both allowed the carry of a gun fully loaded with all six rounds and secured the gun in the holster to help prevent its accidental loss human nature being what it has always been some people simply took the risk and carried the guns fully loaded with no provisions for prevention of accidental discharges
six guns are used commonly by single-action shooting enthusiasts in shooting competitions designed to mimic the gunfights of the old west and for general target shooting hunting and personal defense
