== etymologyedit ==
the word paradise entered english from the french paradis inherited from the latin paradisus from greek pardeisos () from an old iranian *paridayda- walled enclosure by the 6th/5th century bce the old iranian word had been adopted as assyrian pardesu domain it subsequently came to indicate walled estates especially the carefully tended royal parks and menageries the term eventually appeared in greek as pardeisos park for animals in the anabasis of the early 4th century bce athenian xenophon aramaic pardaysa similarly reflects royal park
hebrew (pardes) appears thrice in the tanakh in the song of solomon 4:13 ecclesiastes 2:5 and nehemiah 2:8 in those contexts it could be interpreted as an orchard or a fruit garden in the septuagint (3rd1st centuries bce) greek pardeisos was used to translate both hebrew pardes and hebrew gan garden it is from this usage that the use of paradise to refer to the garden of eden derives the same usage also appears in arabic and in the quran as firdaws 
the word's etymology is ultimately derived from a pie root *dheig to stick and set up it is reflected in avestan as pairi-daza- the literal meaning of this eastern old iranian language word is walled (enclosure) from pairi- around and -diz to make form (a wall) build the word is not attested in other old iranian languages (these may however be hypothetically reconstructed for example as old persian *paridayda-) the idea of a walled enclosure was not preserved in most iranian usage and generally came to refer to a plantation or other cultivated area not necessarily walled for example the old iranian word survives in new persian plz (or jlz") which denotes a vegetable patch

in rabbinical judaism the word pardes recurs but less often in the second temple context of eden or restored eden a well-known reference is in the pardes story where the word may allude to mystic philosophy
the zohar gives the word a mystical interpretation and associates it with the four kinds of biblical exegesis peshat (literal meaning) remez (allusion) derash (anagogical) and sod (mystic) the initial letters of those four words then form p(a)rd(e)s which was in turn felt to represent the fourfold interpretation of the torah (in which sod the mystical interpretation ranks highest)

jehovah's witnesses believe that disobedient and wicked people will be destroyed by christ at armageddon and those obedient to christ will live eternally in a restored earthly paradise joining the survivors will be the resurrected righteous and unrighteous people who died prior to armageddon the latter are brought back because they paid for their sins by their death and/or because they lacked opportunity to learn of jehovah's requirements before dying these will be judged on the basis of their post-resurrection obedience to instructions revealed in new scrolls they believe that resurrection of the dead to paradise earth is made possible by christ's blood and the ransom sacrifice this provision does not apply to those whom christ as judge deems to have sinned against god's holy spirit

[luke 23:43] the new world translation places a comma after the word today dividing it into two separate phrases i tell you today and you will be with me in paradise this differs from standard translations of this verse as i tell you today you will be with me in paradise based on scriptures such as matthew 12:40 27:63 mark 8:31 and 9:31 witnesses believe jesus expectation that he would be bodily resurrected after three days precluded his being in paradise on the same day that he died
