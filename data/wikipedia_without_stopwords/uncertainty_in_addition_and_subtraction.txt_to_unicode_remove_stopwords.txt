mathematics binary operation commutative changing order operands change result fundamental property many binary operations many mathematical proofs depend familiar name property says property also used advanced settings name needed operations division subtraction example operations commutative noncommutative operations idea simple operations multiplication addition numbers commutative many years implicitly assumed property named th century mathematics started become formalized
common uses
commutative property commutative law property generally associated binary operations functions commutative property holds pair elements certain binary operation two elements said commute operation
mathematical definitions
term commutative used several related senses
examples
commutative operations everyday life
putting socks resembles commutative operation since sock put first unimportant either way result socks contrast putting underwear trousers commutative
commutativity addition observed paying item cash regardless order bills handed always give total
commutative operations mathematics
two wellknown examples commutative binary operations
addition real numbers commutative since
example since expressions equal
multiplication real numbers commutative since
example since expressions equal
binary truth functions also commutative since truth tables functions one changes order operands
example logical biconditional function p q equivalent q p function also written p iff q p q epq
last form example concise notation article truth functions lists sixteen possible binary truth functions eight commutative vpq vqp apq aqp dpq nand dqp epq iff eqp jpq jqp kpq kqp xpq xqp opq oqp
examples commutative binary operations include addition multiplication complex numbers addition scalar multiplication vectors intersection union sets
noncommutative operations everyday life
concatenation act joining character strings together noncommutative operation example
washing drying clothes resembles noncommutative operation washing drying produces markedly different result drying washing
rotating book around vertical axis around horizontal axis produces different orientation rotations performed opposite order
twists rubiks cube noncommutative studied using group theory
also thought processes noncommutative person asked question question b may give different answers question person asked first b asking question may change persons state mind
noncommutative operations mathematics
noncommutative binary operations
subtraction noncommutative since
division noncommutative since
truth functions noncommutative since truth tables functions different one changes order operands
example truth tables f ab b b f ba b
matrix multiplication noncommutative since
vector product cross product two vectors three dimensions anticommutative ie b b
history etymology
records implicit use commutative property go back ancient times egyptians used commutative property multiplication simplify computing products euclid known assumed commutative property multiplication book elements formal uses commutative property arose late th early th centuries mathematicians began work theory functions today commutative property well known basic property used branches mathematics
first recorded use term commutative memoir franois servois used word commutatives describing functions called commutative property word combination french word commuter meaning substitute switch suffix ative meaning tending word literally means tending substitute switch term appeared english philosophical transactions royal society
propositional logic
rule replacement
truthfunctional propositional logic commutation commutativity refer two valid rules replacement rules allow one transpose propositional variables within logical expressions logical proofs rules

related properties
associativity
associative property closely related commutative property associative property expression containing two occurrences operator states order operations performed affect final result long order terms doesnt change contrast commutative property states order terms affect final result
commutative operations encountered practice also associative however commutativity imply associativity counterexample function
clearly commutative interchanging x y affect result associative since example examples may found commutative nonassociative magmas
symmetry
forms symmetry directly linked commutativity commutative operator written binary function resulting function symmetric across line y x example let function f represent addition commutative operation fxy x y f symmetric function seen image right
relations symmetric relation analogous commutative operation relation r symmetric
noncommuting operators quantum mechanics
quantum mechanics formulated schrdinger physical variables represented linear operators x meaning multiply x two operators commute may seen considering effect compositions also called products operators onedimensional wave function
according uncertainty principle heisenberg two operators representing pair variables commute pair variables mutually complementary means cannot simultaneously measured known precisely example position linear momentum xdirection particle represented respectively operators reduced planck constant example except constant operators commute physical meaning position linear momentum given direction complementary
