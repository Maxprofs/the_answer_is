seabed structure
oceans common structure created common physical phenomena mainly tectonic movement sediment various sources structure oceans starting continents begins usually continental shelf continues continental slope steep descent ocean reaching abyssal plain topographic plain beginning seabed main area border continental slope abyssal plain usually gradual descent called continental rise caused sediment cascading continental slope
midocean ridge name implies mountainous rise middle oceans continents typically rift runs along edge ridge along tectonic plate edges typically oceanic trenches deep valleys created mantle circulation movement midocean mountain ridge oceanic trench
hotspot volcanic island ridges created volcanic activity erupting periodically tectonic plates pass hotspot areas volcanic activity oceanic trenches hydrothermal vents releasing high pressure extremely hot water chemicals typically freezing water around
deep ocean water divided layers zones typical features salinity pressure temperature marine life according depth lying along top abyssal plain abyssal zone whose lower boundary lies m ft hadal zone includes oceanic trenches lies metres ft deepest oceanic zone
technical terms
acronym mbsf meaning metres seafloor convention used depths seafloor
benthos
benthos community organisms live near seabed area known benthic zone community lives near marine sedimentary environments tidal pools along foreshore continental shelf abyssal depths benthic zone ecological region immediately seabed including sediment surface subsurface layers benthos generally live close relationship substrate bottom many organisms permanently attached bottom superficial layer soil lining given body water benthic boundary layer integral part benthic zone greatly influences biological activity takes place examples contact soil layers include sand bottoms rocky outcrops coral bay mud
seabed features
area seabed typical features common soil composition typical topography salinity water layers marine life magnetic direction rocksand sedimenting
seabed topography flat sedimenting heavy covers tectonic features sedimenting comes various sources
land erosion sediments brought mainly rivers
new young rock new magma basalt composition midocean ridge
underwater volcanic ash spreading especially hydrothermal vents
microorganism activity
sea currents eroding seabed
marine life corals fish algae crabs marine plants biological created sediment
sedimenting avoided atlantic ocean especially northern eastern atlantic original tectonic activity clearly seen straight line cracks vents thousands kilometers long
recently discovery abundant marine life deep sea especially around hydrothermal vents large deep sea communities marine life discovered around black white smokers hydrothermal vents emitting typical chemicals toxic humans vertebrates marine life receives energy extreme temperature difference typically drop degrees chemosynthesis bacteria
brine pools another seabed feature usually connected cold seeps
history exploration
seabed explored submersibles alvin extent scuba divers special equipment process continually adds new material ocean floor seafloor spreading continental slope recent years satellite images show clear mapping seabed used extensively study exploration ocean floor
art culture
childrens play songs include elements theres hole bottom sea sailor went sea could see bottom deep blue sea
seabed archaeological sites historic interest shipwrecks sunken towns underwater cultural heritage protected unesco convention protection underwater cultural heritage convention aims preventing looting destruction loss historic cultural information providing international legal framework
