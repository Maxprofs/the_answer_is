history
scientific inquiry wave nature light began th th centuries scientists robert hooke christiaan huygens leonhard euler proposed wave theory light based experimental observations thomas young english polymath performed famous doubleslit experiment later described paper entitled nature light colours experiment played major role general acceptance wave theory light
michael faraday discovered cathode rays studies followed statement blackbody radiation problem gustav kirchhoff suggestion ludwig boltzmann energy states physical system discrete quantum hypothesis max planck plancks hypothesis energy radiated absorbed discrete quanta energy elements precisely matched observed patterns blackbody radiation
wilhelm wien empirically determined distribution law blackbody radiation known wiens law honor ludwig boltzmann independently arrived result considerations maxwells equations however valid high frequencies underestimated radiance low frequencies later planck corrected model using boltzmanns statistical interpretation thermodynamics proposed called plancks law led development quantum mechanics
following max plancks solution blackbody radiation problem reported albert einstein offered quantumbased theory explain photoelectric effect reported around atomic theory corpuscular theory light first came widely accepted scientific fact latter theories viewed quantum theories matter electromagnetic radiation respectively

planck cautiously insisted simply aspect processes absorption emission radiation nothing physical reality radiation fact considered quantum hypothesis mathematical trick get right answer rather sizable discovery however albert einstein interpreted plancks quantum hypothesis realistically used explain photoelectric effect shining light certain materials eject electrons material won nobel prize physics work
einstein developed idea show electromagnetic wave light could also described particle later called photon discrete quantum energy dependent frequency

broadly speaking quantum mechanics incorporates four classes phenomena classical physics cannot account

mathematical formulations
mathematically rigorous formulation quantum mechanics developed paul dirac david hilbert john von neumann hermann weyl possible states quantum mechanical system represented unit vectors called state vectors formally reside complex separable hilbert spacevariously called state space associated hilbert space systemthat well defined complex number norm phase factor words possible states points projective space hilbert space usually called complex projective space exact nature hilbert space dependent systemfor example state space position momentum states space squareintegrable functions state space spin single proton product two complex planes observable represented maximally hermitian precisely selfadjoint linear operator acting state space eigenstate observable corresponds eigenvector operator associated eigenvalue corresponds value observable eigenstate operators spectrum discrete observable attain discrete eigenvalues
formalism quantum mechanics state system given time described complex wave function also referred state vector complex vector space abstract mathematical object allows calculation probabilities outcomes concrete experiments example allows one compute probability finding electron particular region around nucleus particular time contrary classical mechanics one never make simultaneous predictions conjugate variables position momentum accuracy instance electrons may considered certain probability located somewhere within given region space exact positions unknown contours constant probability often referred clouds may drawn around nucleus atom conceptualize electron might located probability heisenbergs uncertainty principle quantifies inability precisely locate particle given conjugate momentum
according one interpretation result measurement wave function containing probability information system collapses given initial state particular eigenstate possible results measurement eigenvalues operator representing observablewhich explains choice hermitian operators eigenvalues real probability distribution observable given state found computing spectral decomposition corresponding operator heisenbergs uncertainty principle represented statement operators corresponding certain observables commute
probabilistic nature quantum mechanics thus stems act measurement one difficult aspects quantum systems understand central topic famous bohreinstein debates two scientists attempted clarify fundamental principles way thought experiments decades formulation quantum mechanics question constitutes measurement extensively studied newer interpretations quantum mechanics formulated away concept wave function collapse see example relative state interpretation basic idea quantum system interacts measuring apparatus respective wave functions become entangled original quantum system ceases exist independent entity details see article measurement quantum mechanics
generally quantum mechanics assign definite values instead makes prediction using probability distribution describes probability obtaining possible outcomes measuring observable often results skewed many causes dense probability clouds probability clouds approximate better bohr model whereby electron location given probability function wave function eigenvalue probability squared modulus complex amplitude quantum state nuclear attraction naturally probabilities depend quantum state instant measurement hence uncertainty involved value however certain states associated definite value particular observable known eigenstates observable eigen translated german meaning inherent characteristic
everyday world natural intuitive think everything every observable eigenstate everything appears definite position definite momentum definite energy definite time occurrence however quantum mechanics pinpoint exact values particles position momentum since conjugate pairs energy time since conjugate pairs rather provides range probabilities particle might given momentum momentum probability therefore helpful use different words describe states uncertain values states definite values eigenstates usually system eigenstate observable particle interested however one measures observable wave function instantaneously eigenstate generalized eigenstate observable process known wave function collapse controversial muchdebated process involves expanding system study include measurement device one knows corresponding wave function instant measurement one able compute probability wave function collapsing possible eigenstates example free particle previous example usually wave function wave packet centered around mean position x neither eigenstate position momentum one measures position particle impossible predict certainty result probable certain near x amplitude wave function large measurement performed obtained result x wave function collapses position eigenstate centered x
time evolution quantum state described schrdinger equation hamiltonian operator corresponding total energy system generates time evolution time evolution wave functions deterministic sense given wave function initial time makes definite prediction wave function later time

wave functions change time progresses schrdinger equation describes wave functions change time playing role similar newtons second law classical mechanics schrdinger equation applied aforementioned example free particle predicts center wave packet move space constant velocity like classical particle forces acting however wave packet also spread time progresses means position becomes uncertain time also effect turning position eigenstate thought infinitely sharp wave packet broadened wave packet longer represents definite certain position eigenstate
