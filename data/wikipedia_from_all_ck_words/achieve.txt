astronomy a natural science is the study of celestial objects (such as stars galaxies planets moons asteroids comets and nebulae) and processes (such as supernovae explosions gamma ray bursts and cosmic microwave background radiation) the physics chemistry and evolution of such objects and processes and more generally all phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of earth a related but distinct subject physical cosmology is concerned with studying the universe as a whole
astronomy is one of the oldest sciences the early civilizations in recorded history such as the babylonians greeks indians egyptians nubians iranians chinese and maya performed methodical observations of the night sky however the invention of the telescope was required before astronomy was able to develop into a modern science historically astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry celestial navigation observational astronomy and the making of calendars but professional astronomy is nowadays often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics
during the 20th century the field of professional astronomy split into observational and theoretical branches observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena the two fields complement each other with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain the observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results
astronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs can still play an active role especially in the discovery and observation of transient phenomena amateur astronomers have made and contributed to many important astronomical discoveries
== etymologyedit ==
astronomy (from the greek from astron star and - -nomia from nomos law or culture") means law of the stars (or culture of the stars depending on the translation) astronomy should not be confused with astrology the belief system which claims that human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects although the two fields share a common origin they are now entirely distinct
=== use of terms astronomy and astrophysics"edit ===
generally either the term astronomy or astrophysics may be used to refer to this subject based on strict dictionary definitions astronomy refers to the study of objects and matter outside the earth's atmosphere and of their physical and chemical properties and astrophysics refers to the branch of astronomy dealing with the behavior physical properties and dynamic processes of celestial objects and phenomena in some cases as in the introduction of the introductory textbook the physical universe by frank shu astronomy may be used to describe the qualitative study of the subject whereas astrophysics is used to describe the physics-oriented version of the subject however since most modern astronomical research deals with subjects related to physics modern astronomy could actually be called astrophysics few fields such as astrometry are purely astronomy rather than also astrophysics various departments in which scientists carry out research on this subject may use astronomy and astrophysics, partly depending on whether the department is historically affiliated with a physics department and many professional astronomers have physics rather than astronomy degrees one of the leading scientific journals in the field is the european journal named astronomy and astrophysics the leading american journals are the astrophysical journal and the astronomical journal
== historyedit ==
in early times astronomy only comprised the observation and predictions of the motions of objects visible to the naked eye in some locations early cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose in addition to their ceremonial uses these observatories could be employed to determine the seasons an important factor in knowing when to plant crops as well as in understanding the length of the year
before tools such as the telescope were invented early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye as civilizations developed most notably in mesopotamia greece india china egypt and central america astronomical observatories were assembled and ideas on the nature of the universe began to be explored most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets a science now referred to as astrometry from these observations early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed and the nature of the sun moon and the earth in the universe were explored philosophically the earth was believed to be the center of the universe with the sun the moon and the stars rotating around it this is known as the geocentric model of the universe or the ptolemaic system named after ptolemy
a particularly important early development was the beginning of mathematical and scientific astronomy which began among the babylonians who laid the foundations for the later astronomical traditions that developed in many other civilizations the babylonians discovered that lunar eclipses recurred in a repeating cycle known as a saros
following the babylonians significant advances in astronomy were made in ancient greece and the hellenistic world greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational physical explanation for celestial phenomena in the 3rd century bc aristarchus of samos estimated the size and distance of the moon and sun and was the first to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system in the 2nd century bc hipparchus discovered precession calculated the size and distance of the moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from greek astronomy the antikythera mechanism (c 15080 bc) was an early analog computer designed to calculate the location of the sun moon and planets for a given date technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in europe
during the middle ages astronomy was mostly stagnant in medieval europe at least until the 13th century however astronomy flourished in the islamic world and other parts of the world this led to the emergence of the first astronomical observatories in the muslim world by the early 9th century in 964 the andromeda galaxy the largest galaxy in the local group was discovered by the persian astronomer azophi and first described in his book of fixed stars the sn 1006 supernova the brightest apparent magnitude stellar event in recorded history was observed by the egyptian arabic astronomer ali ibn ridwan and the chinese astronomers in 1006 some of the prominent islamic (mostly persian and arab) astronomers who made significant contributions to the science include al-battani thebit azophi albumasar biruni arzachel al-birjandi and the astronomers of the maragheh and samarkand observatories astronomers during that time introduced many arabic names now used for individual stars it is also believed that the ruins at great zimbabwe and timbuktu may have housed an astronomical observatory europeans had previously believed that there had been no astronomical observation in pre-colonial middle ages sub-saharan africa but modern discoveries show otherwise
the roman catholic church gave more financial and social support to the study of astronomy for over six centuries from the recovery of ancient learning during the late middle ages into the enlightenment than any other and probably all other institutions among the church's motives was finding the date for easter
=== scientific revolutionedit ===
during the renaissance nicolaus copernicus proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system his work was defended expanded upon and corrected by galileo galilei and johannes kepler galileo used telescopes to enhance his observations
kepler was the first to devise a system that described correctly the details of the motion of the planets with the sun at the center however kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down it was left to newton's invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation to finally explain the motions of the planets newton also developed the reflecting telescope
further discoveries paralleled the improvements in the size and quality of the telescope more extensive star catalogues were produced by lacaille the astronomer william herschel made a detailed catalog of nebulosity and clusters and in 1781 discovered the planet uranus the first new planet found the distance to a star was first announced in 1838 when the parallax of 61 cygni was measured by friedrich bessel
during the 1819th centuries attention to the three body problem by euler clairaut and d'alembert led to more accurate predictions about the motions of the moon and planets this work was further refined by lagrange and laplace allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations
significant advances in astronomy came about with the introduction of new technology including the spectroscope and photography fraunhofer discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the sun in 181415 which in 1859 kirchhoff ascribed to the presence of different elements stars were proven to be similar to the earth's own sun but with a wide range of temperatures masses and sizes
the existence of the earth's galaxy the milky way as a separate group of stars was only proved in the 20th century along with the existence of external galaxies and soon after the expansion of the universe seen in the recession of most galaxies from us modern astronomy has also discovered many exotic objects such as quasars pulsars blazars and radio galaxies and has used these observations to develop physical theories which describe some of these objects in terms of equally exotic objects such as black holes and neutron stars physical cosmology made huge advances during the 20th century with the model of the big bang heavily supported by the evidence provided by astronomy and physics such as the cosmic microwave background radiation hubble's law and cosmological abundances of elements space telescopes have enabled measurements in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum normally blocked or blurred by the atmosphere
== observational astronomyedit ==
in astronomy the main source of information about celestial bodies and other objects is visible light or more generally electromagnetic radiation observational astronomy may be divided according to the observed region of the electromagnetic spectrum some parts of the spectrum can be observed from the earth's surface while other parts are only observable from either high altitudes or outside the earth's atmosphere specific information on these subfields is given below
=== radio astronomyedit ===
radio astronomy studies radiation with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter radio astronomy is different from most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons hence it is relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths
although some radio waves are produced by astronomical objects in the form of thermal emission most of the radio emission that is observed from earth is the result of synchrotron radiation which is produced when electrons orbit magnetic fields additionally a number of spectral lines produced by interstellar gas notably the hydrogen spectral line at 21 cm are observable at radio wavelengths
a wide variety of objects are observable at radio wavelengths including supernovae interstellar gas pulsars and active galactic nuclei
=== infrared astronomyedit ===
infrared astronomy is founded on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation (wavelengths longer than red light) the infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light such as planets circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust longer infrared wavelengths can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light allowing the observation of young stars in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies observations from the wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous galactic protostars and their host star clusters with the exception of wavelengths close to visible light infrared radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere or masked as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission consequently infrared observatories have to be located in high dry places or in space some molecules radiate strongly in the infrared this allows the study the chemistry of space more specifically it can detect water in comets
=== optical astronomyedit ===
historically optical astronomy also called visible light astronomy is the oldest form of astronomy optical images of observations were originally drawn by hand in the late 19th century and most of the 20th century images were made using photographic equipment modern images are made using digital detectors particularly detectors using charge-coupled devices (ccds) and recorded on modern medium although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 to 7000 (400 nm to 700 nm) that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation
=== ultraviolet astronomyedit ===
ultraviolet astronomy refers to observations at ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200 (10 to 320 nm) light at these wavelengths is absorbed by the earth's atmosphere so observations at these wavelengths must be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue stars (ob stars) that are very bright in this wave band this includes the blue stars in other galaxies which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include planetary nebulae supernova remnants and active galactic nuclei however as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by interstellar dust an appropriate adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary
=== x-ray astronomyedit ===
x-ray astronomy is the study of astronomical objects at x-ray wavelengths typically x-ray radiation is produced by synchrotron emission (the result of electrons orbiting magnetic field lines) thermal emission from thin gases above 107 (10 million) kelvins and thermal emission from thick gases above 107 kelvin since x-rays are absorbed by the earth's atmosphere all x-ray observations must be performed from high-altitude balloons rockets or spacecraft notable x-ray sources include x-ray binaries pulsars supernova remnants elliptical galaxies clusters of galaxies and active galactic nuclei
x-rays were first observed and documented in 1895 by wilhelm conrad rntgen a german scientist who found them when experimenting with vacuum tubes through a series of experiments rntgen was able to discover the beginning elements of radiation the x in fact holds its own significance as it represents rntgen's inability to identify exactly the type of radiation
=== gamma-ray astronomyedit ===
gamma ray astronomy is the study of astronomical objects at the shortest wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the compton gamma ray observatory or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric cherenkov telescopes the cherenkov telescopes do not actually detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the earth's atmosphere
most gamma-ray emitting sources are actually gamma-ray bursts objects which only produce gamma radiation for a few milliseconds to thousands of seconds before fading away only 10% of gamma-ray sources are non-transient sources these steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars neutron stars and black hole candidates such as active galactic nuclei
=== fields not based on the electromagnetic spectrumedit ===
in addition to electromagnetic radiation a few other events originating from great distances may be observed from the earth
in neutrino astronomy astronomers use heavily shielded underground facilities such as sage gallex and kamioka ii/iii for the detection of neutrinos the vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the earth originate from the sun but 24 neutrinos were also detected from supernova 1987a cosmic rays which consist of very high energy particles that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the earth's atmosphere result in a cascade of particles which can be detected by current observatories additionally some future neutrino detectors may also be sensitive to the particles produced when cosmic rays hit the earth's atmosphere
gravitational wave astronomy is an emerging new field of astronomy which aims to use gravitational wave detectors to collect observational data about compact objects a few observatories have been constructed such as the laser interferometer gravitational observatory ligo but gravitational waves are extremely difficult to detect
combining observations made using electromagnetic radiation neutrinos or gravitational waves with those made using a different means which shall give complementary information is known as multi-messenger astronomy
=== astrometry and celestial mechanicsedit ===
one of the oldest fields in astronomy and in all of science is the measurement of the positions of celestial objects historically accurate knowledge of the positions of the sun moon planets and stars has been essential in celestial navigation (the use of celestial objects to guide navigation) and in the making of calendars
careful measurement of the positions of the planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational perturbations and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy a field known as celestial mechanics more recently the tracking of near-earth objects will allow for predictions of close encounters and potential collisions with the earth
the measurement of stellar parallax of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the cosmic distance ladder that is used to measure the scale of the universe parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars as their properties can be compared measurements of radial velocity and proper motion plot the movement of these systems through the milky way galaxy astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of dark matter in the galaxy
during the 1990s the measurement of the stellar wobble of nearby stars was used to detect large extrasolar planets orbiting nearby stars
== theoretical astronomyedit ==
theoretical astronomers use several tools including analytical models (for example polytropes to approximate the behaviors of a star) and computational numerical simulations each has some advantages analytical models of a process are generally better for giving insight into the heart of what is going on numerical models reveal the existence of phenomena and effects otherwise unobserved
theorists in astronomy endeavor to create theoretical models and from the results predict observational consequences of those models the observation of a phenomenon predicted by a model allows astronomers to select between several alternate or conflicting models
theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data in the case of an inconsistency the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data in some cases a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model
topics studied by theoretical astronomers include stellar dynamics and evolution galaxy formation large-scale structure of matter in the universe origin of cosmic rays general relativity and physical cosmology including string cosmology and astroparticle physics astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for black hole (astro)physics and the study of gravitational waves
some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astronomy now included in the lambda-cdm model are the big bang cosmic inflation dark matter and fundamental theories of physics
a few examples of this process
dark matter and dark energy are the current leading topics in astronomy as their discovery and controversy originated during the study of the galaxies
== specific subfieldsedit ==
=== solar astronomyedit ===
at a distance of about eight light-minutes the most frequently studied star is the sun a typical main-sequence dwarf star of stellar class g2 v and about 4.6 billion years (gyr) old the sun is not considered a variable star but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the sunspot cycle this is an 11-year fluctuation in sunspot numbers sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with intense magnetic activity
the sun has steadily increased in luminosity over the course of its life increasing by 40% since it first became a main-sequence star the sun has also undergone periodic changes in luminosity that can have a significant impact on the earth the maunder minimum for example is believed to have caused the little ice age phenomenon during the middle ages
the visible outer surface of the sun is called the photosphere above this layer is a thin region known as the chromosphere this is surrounded by a transition region of rapidly increasing temperatures and finally by the super-heated corona
at the center of the sun is the core region a volume of sufficient temperature and pressure for nuclear fusion to occur above the core is the radiation zone where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation above that are the outer layers that form a convection zone where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas it is believed that this convection zone creates the magnetic activity that generates sunspots
a solar wind of plasma particles constantly streams outward from the sun until at the outermost limit of the solar system it reaches the heliopause this solar wind interacts with the magnetosphere of the earth to create the van allen radiation belts about the earth as well as the aurora where the lines of the earth's magnetic field descend into the atmosphere
=== planetary scienceedit ===
planetary science is the study of the assemblage of planets moons dwarf planets comets asteroids and other bodies orbiting the sun as well as extrasolar planets the solar system has been relatively well-studied initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft this has provided a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system although many new discoveries are still being made
the solar system is subdivided into the inner planets the asteroid belt and the outer planets the inner terrestrial planets consist of mercury venus earth and mars the outer gas giant planets are jupiter saturn uranus and neptune beyond neptune lies the kuiper belt and finally the oort cloud which may extend as far as a light-year
the planets were formed in the protoplanetary disk that surrounded the early sun through a process that included gravitational attraction collision and accretion the disk formed clumps of matter that with time became protoplanets the radiation pressure of the solar wind then expelled most of the unaccreted matter and only those planets with sufficient mass retained their gaseous atmosphere the planets continued to sweep up or eject the remaining matter during a period of intense bombardment evidenced by the many impact craters on the moon during this period some of the protoplanets may have collided the leading hypothesis for how the moon was formed
once a planet reaches sufficient mass the materials of different densities segregate within during planetary differentiation this process can form a stony or metallic core surrounded by a mantle and an outer surface the core may include solid and liquid regions and some planetary cores generate their own magnetic field which can protect their atmospheres from solar wind stripping
a planet or moon's interior heat is produced from the collisions that created the body radioactive materials (e.g uranium thorium and 26al) or tidal heating some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water smaller bodies without tidal heating cool more quickly and their geological activity ceases with the exception of impact cratering
=== stellar astronomyedit ===
the study of stars and stellar evolution is fundamental to our understanding of the universe the astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding and from computer simulations of the interior star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas known as giant molecular clouds when destabilized cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity to form a protostar a sufficiently dense and hot core region will trigger nuclear fusion thus creating a main-sequence star
almost all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were created inside the cores of stars
the characteristics of the resulting star depend primarily upon its starting mass the more massive the star the greater its luminosity and the more rapidly it expends the hydrogen fuel in its core over time this hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium and the star begins to evolve the fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature so that the star both expands in size and increases in core density the resulting red giant enjoys a brief life span before the helium fuel is in turn consumed very massive stars can also undergo a series of decreasing evolutionary phases as they fuse increasingly heavier elements
the final fate of the star depends on its mass with stars of mass greater than about eight times the sun becoming core collapse supernovae while smaller stars form a white dwarf as it ejects matter that forms a planetary nebulae the remnant of a supernova is a dense neutron star or if the stellar mass was at least three times that of the sun a black hole close binary stars can follow more complex evolutionary paths such as mass transfer onto a white dwarf companion that can potentially cause a supernova planetary nebulae and supernovae are necessary for the distribution of metals to the interstellar medium without them all new stars (and their planetary systems) would be formed from hydrogen and helium alone
=== galactic astronomyedit ===
our solar system orbits within the milky way a barred spiral galaxy that is a prominent member of the local group of galaxies it is a rotating mass of gas dust stars and other objects held together by mutual gravitational attraction as the earth is located within the dusty outer arms there are large portions of the milky way that are obscured from view
in the center of the milky way is the core a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a supermassive black hole at the center this is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from the core this is a region of active star formation that contains many younger population i stars the disk is surrounded by a spheroid halo of older population ii stars as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as globular clusters
between the stars lies the interstellar medium a region of sparse matter in the densest regions molecular clouds of molecular hydrogen and other elements create star-forming regions these begin as a compact pre-stellar core or dark nebulae which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the jeans length) to form compact protostars
as the more massive stars appear they transform the cloud into an h ii region (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma the stellar wind and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse often leaving behind one or more young open clusters of stars these clusters gradually disperse and the stars join the population of the milky way
kinematic studies of matter in the milky way and other galaxies have demonstrated that there is more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter a dark matter halo appears to dominate the mass although the nature of this dark matter remains undetermined
=== extragalactic astronomyedit ===
the study of objects outside our galaxy is a branch of astronomy concerned with the formation and evolution of galaxies their morphology (description) and classification and the observation of active galaxies and at a larger scale the groups and clusters of galaxies finally the latter is important for the understanding of the large-scale structure of the cosmos
most galaxies are organized into distinct shapes that allow for classification schemes they are commonly divided into spiral elliptical and irregular galaxies
as the name suggests an elliptical galaxy has the cross-sectional shape of an ellipse the stars move along random orbits with no preferred direction these galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust few star-forming regions and generally older stars elliptical galaxies are more commonly found at the core of galactic clusters and may have been formed through mergers of large galaxies
a spiral galaxy is organized into a flat rotating disk usually with a prominent bulge or bar at the center and trailing bright arms that spiral outward the arms are dusty regions of star formation where massive young stars produce a blue tint spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars both the milky way and our nearest galaxy neighbor the andromeda galaxy are spiral galaxies
irregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance and are neither spiral nor elliptical about a quarter of all galaxies are irregular and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction
an active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its energy from a source other than its stars dust and gas it is powered by a compact region at the core thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material
a radio galaxy is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the radio portion of the spectrum and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas active galaxies that emit shorter frequency high-energy radiation include seyfert galaxies quasars and blazars quasars are believed to be the most consistently luminous objects in the known universe
the large-scale structure of the cosmos is represented by groups and clusters of galaxies this structure is organized into a hierarchy of groupings with the largest being the superclusters the collective matter is formed into filaments and walls leaving large voids between
=== cosmologyedit ===
cosmology (from the greek (kosmos) world universe and (logos) word study or literally logic") could be considered the study of the universe as a whole
observations of the large-scale structure of the universe a branch known as physical cosmology have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the big bang wherein our universe began at a single point in time and thereafter expanded over the course of 13.8 billion years to its present condition the concept of the big bang can be traced back to the discovery of the microwave background radiation in 1965
in the course of this expansion the universe underwent several evolutionary stages in the very early moments it is theorized that the universe experienced a very rapid cosmic inflation which homogenized the starting conditions thereafter nucleosynthesis produced the elemental abundance of the early universe (see also nucleocosmochronology.)
when the first neutral atoms formed from a sea of primordial ions space became transparent to radiation releasing the energy viewed today as the microwave background radiation the expanding universe then underwent a dark age due to the lack of stellar energy sources
a hierarchical structure of matter began to form from minute variations in the mass density of space matter accumulated in the densest regions forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars the population iii stars these massive stars triggered the reionization process and are believed to have created many of the heavy elements in the early universe which through nuclear decay create lighter elements allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer
gravitational aggregations clustered into filaments leaving voids in the gaps gradually organizations of gas and dust merged to form the first primitive galaxies over time these pulled in more matter and were often organized into groups and clusters of galaxies then into larger-scale superclusters
fundamental to the structure of the universe is the existence of dark matter and dark energy these are now thought to be its dominant components forming 96% of the mass of the universe for this reason much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components
== interdisciplinary studiesedit ==
astronomy and astrophysics have developed significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields archaeoastronomy is the study of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence astrobiology is the study of the advent and evolution of biological systems in the universe with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of vast amount of observational astrophysical data
the study of chemicals found in space including their formation interaction and destruction is called astrochemistry these substances are usually found in molecular clouds although they may also appear in low temperature stars brown dwarfs and planets cosmochemistry is the study of the chemicals found within the solar system including the origins of the elements and variations in the isotope ratios both of these fields represent an overlap of the disciplines of astronomy and chemistry as forensic astronomy finally methods from astronomy have been used to solve problems of law and history
== amateur astronomyedit ==
astronomy is one of the sciences to which amateurs can contribute the most
collectively amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves common targets of amateur astronomers include the moon planets stars comets meteor showers and a variety of deep-sky objects such as star clusters galaxies and nebulae astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the messier (110 objects) or herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky one branch of amateur astronomy amateur astrophotography involves the taking of photos of the night sky many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects types of objects or types of events which interest them
most amateurs work at visible wavelengths but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum this includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes and also the use of radio telescopes the pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was karl jansky who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s a number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (e.g the one-mile telescope)
amateur astronomers continue to make scientific contributions to the field of astronomy and it is one of the few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets they can also discover comets and perform regular observations of variable stars improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make impressive advances in the field of astrophotography
== unsolved problems in astronomyedit ==
although the scientific discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides in understanding the nature of the universe and its contents there remain some important unanswered questions answers to these may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics
what is the origin of the stellar mass spectrum that is why do astronomers observe the same distribution of stellar masses the initial mass function apparently regardless of the initial conditions a deeper understanding of the formation of stars and planets is needed
is there other life in the universe especially is there other intelligent life if so what is the explanation for the fermi paradox the existence of life elsewhere has important scientific and philosophical implications is the solar system normal or atypical
what caused the universe to form is the premise of the fine-tuned universe hypothesis correct if so could this be the result of cosmological natural selection what caused the cosmic inflation that produced our homogeneous universe why is there a baryon asymmetry
what is the nature of dark matter and dark energy these dominate the evolution and fate of the cosmos yet their true nature remains unknown what will be the ultimate fate of the universe
how did the first galaxies form how did supermassive black holes form
what is creating the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays
why is the abundance of lithium in the cosmos four times lower than predicted by the standard big bang model
