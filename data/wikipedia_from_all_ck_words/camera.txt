a camera is an optical instrument for recording images which may be stored locally transmitted to another location or both the images may be individual still photographs or sequences of images constituting videos or movies the word camera comes from camera obscura which means dark chamber and is the latin name of the original device for projecting an image of external reality onto a flat surface the modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura the functioning of the camera is very similar to the functioning of the human eye
== functional description ==
a camera may work with the light of the visible spectrum or with other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum a still camera is an optical device which creates a single image of an object or scene and records it on an electronic sensor or photographic film all cameras use the same basic design light enters an enclosed box through a converging lens and an image is recorded on a light-sensitive medium a shutter mechanism controls the length of time that light can enter the camera most photographic cameras have functions that allow a person to view the scene to be recorded allow for a desired part of the scene to be in focus and to control the exposure so that it is not too bright or too dim a display often a liquid crystal display (lcd) permits the user to view scene to be recorded and settings such as iso speed exposure and shutter speed
a movie camera or a video camera operates similarly to a still camera except it records a series of static images in rapid succession commonly at a rate of 24 frames per second when the images are combined and displayed in order the illusion of motion is achieved
== history ==
the forerunner to the photographic camera was the camera obscura in the fifth century b.c. the chinese philosopher mo ti noted that a pinhole can form an inverted and focused image when light passes through the hole and into a dark area mo ti is the first recorded person to have exploited this phenomenon to trace the inverted image to create a picture writing in the fourth century b.c. aristotle also mentioned this principle he described observing a partial solar eclipse in 330 b.c by seeing the image of the sun projected through the small spaces between the leaves of a tree in the tenth century the arabic scholar ibn al-haytham (alhazen) also wrote about observing a solar eclipse through a pinhole and he described how a sharper image could be produced by making the opening of the pinhole smaller english philosopher roger bacon wrote about these optical principles in his 1267 treatise perspectiva by the fifteenth century artists and scientists were using this phenomenon to make observations originally an observer had to enter an actual room in which a pinhole was made on one wall on the opposite wall the observer would view the inverted image of the outside the name camera obscura latin for dark room derives from this early implementation of the optical phenomenon the term was first coined by mathematician and astronomer johannes kepler in his ad vitellionem paralipomena of 1604
the italian scientist giambattista della porta described the camera obscura in detail in his 1558 work magia naturalis and specifically suggested that an artist could project a camera obscura's images onto paper and trace the outlines the camera obscura was popular as an aid for drawing and painting from the 1600s to the 1800s portable set-ups were devised in the 17th century for example kepler had built a portable tent and outfitted the camera obscura with a lens by 1620 this set-up remained popular up to the early 1800s the scientist robert hooke presented a paper in 1694 to the royal society in which he described a portable camera obscura it was a cone-shaped box which fit onto the head and shoulders of its user a hand-held device with a mirror reflex mechanism was first proposed by johann zahn in 1685 a design that would later be used in photographic cameras
before the development of the photographic camera it had been known for hundreds of years that some substances such as silver salts darkened when exposed to sunlight in a series of experiments published in 1727 the german scientist johann heinrich schulze demonstrated that the darkening of the salts was due to light alone and not influenced by heat or exposure to air the swedish chemist carl wilhelm scheele showed in 1777 that silver chloride was especially susceptible to darkening from light exposure and that once darkened it becomes insoluble in an ammonia solution the first person to use this chemistry to create images was thomas wedgwood to create images wedgwood placed items such as leaves and insect wings on ceramic pots coated with silver nitrate and exposed the set-up to light these images weren't permanent however as wedgwood didn't employ a fixing mechanism he ultimately failed at his goal of using the process to create fixed images created by a camera obscura
the first permanent photograph of a camera image was made in 1826 by joseph nicphore nipce using a sliding wooden box camera made by charles and vincent chevalier in paris nipce had been experimenting with ways to fix the images of a camera obscura since 1816 the photograph nipce succeeded in creating shows the view from his window it was made using an 8-hour exposure on pewter coated with bitumen nipce called his process heliography nipce corresponded with the inventor louis-jacques-mande daguerre and the pair entered into a partnership to improve the heliographic process nipce had experimented further with other chemicals to improve contrast in his heliographs daguerre contributed an improved camera obscura design but the partnership ended when nipce died in 1833 daguerre succeeded in developing a high-contrast and extremely sharp image by exposing on a plate coated with silver iodide and exposing this plate again to mercury vapor by 1837 he was able to fix the images with a common salt solution he called this process daguerreotype and tried unsuccessfully for a couple years to commercialize it eventually with help of the scientist and politician franois arago the french government acquired daguerre's process for public release in exchange pensions were provided to daguerre as well as nipce's son isidore
in the 1830s the english scientist henry fox talbot independently invented a process to fix camera images using silver salts although dismayed that daguerre had beaten him to the announcement of photography on january 31 1839 he submitted a pamphlet to the royal institution entitled some account of the art of photogenic drawing which was the first published description of photography within two years talbot developed a two-step process for creating photographs on paper which he called calotypes the calotyping process was the first to utilize negative prints which reverse all values in the photograph - black shows up as white and vice versa negative prints allow in principle unlimited duplicates of the positive print to be made calotyping also introduced the ability for a printmaker to alter the resulting image through retouching calotypes were never as popular or widespread as daguerreotypes owing mainly to the fact that the latter produced sharper details however because daguerreotypes only produce a direct positive print no duplicates can be made it is the two-step negative/positive process that formed the basis for modern photography
the first photographic camera developed for commercial manufacture was a daguerreotype camera built by alphonse giroux in 1839 giroux signed a contract with daguerre and isidore nipce to produce the cameras in france with each device and accessories costing 400 francs the camera was a double-box design with a landscape lens fitted to the outer box and a holder for a ground glass focusing screen and image plate on the inner box by sliding the inner box objects at various distances could be brought to as sharp a focus as desired after a satisfactory image had been focused on the screen the screen was replaced with a sensitized plate a knurled wheel controlled a copper flap in front of the lens which functioned as a shutter the early daguerreotype cameras required long exposure times which in 1839 could be from 5 to 30 minutes
after the introduction of the giroux daguerreotype camera other manufacturers quickly produced improved variations charles chevalier who had earlier provided nipce with lenses created in 1841 a double-box camera using a half-sized plate for imaging chevaliers camera had a hinged bed allowing for half of the bed to fold onto the back of the nested box in addition to having increased portability the camera had a faster lens bringing exposure times down to 3 minutes and a prism at the front of the lens which allowed the image to be laterally correct another french design emerged in 1841 created by marc antoine gaudin the nouvel appareil gaudin camera had a metal disc with three differently-sized holes mounted on the front of the lens rotating to a different hole effectively provided variable f-stops letting in different amount of light into the camera instead of using nested boxes to focus the gaudin camera used nested brass tubes in germany peter friedrich voigtlnder designed an all-metal camera with a conical shape that produced circular pictures of about 3 inches in diameter the distinguishing characteristic of the voigtlnder camera was its use of a lens designed by josef max petzval the f/3.5 petzval lens was nearly 30 times faster than any other lens of the period and was the first to be made specifically for portraiture its design was the most widely used for portraits until carl zeiss introduced the anastigmat lens in 1889
within a decade of being introduced in america 3 general forms of camera were in popular use the american- or chamfered-box camera the roberts-type camera or boston box and the lewis-type camera the american-box camera had beveled edges at the front and rear and an opening in the rear where the formed image could be viewed on ground glass the top of the camera had hinged doors for placing photographic plates inside there was one available slot for distant objects and another slot in the back for close-ups the lens was focused either by sliding or with a rack and pinion mechanism the roberts-type cameras were similar to the american-box except for having a knob-fronted worm gear on the front of the camera which moved the back box for focusing many roberts-type cameras allowed focusing directly on the lens mount the third popular daguerreotype camera in america was the lewis-type introduced in 1851 which utilized a bellows for focusing the main body of the lewis-type camera was mounted on the front box but the rear section was slotted into the bed for easy sliding once focused a set screw was tightened to hold the rear section in place having the bellows in the middle of the body facilitated making a second in-camera copy of the original image
daguerreotype cameras formed images on silvered copper plates the earliest daguerreotype cameras required several minutes to half an hour to expose images on the plates by 1840 exposure times were reduced to just a few seconds owing to improvements in the chemical preparation and development processes and to advances in lens design american daguerreotypists introduced manufactured plates in mass production and plate sizes became internationally standardized whole plate (6.5 x 8.5 inches) three-quarter plate (5.5 x 7 1/8 inches) half plate (4.5 x 5.5 inches) quarter plate (3.25 x 4.25 inches) sixth plate (2.75 x 3.25 inches) and ninth plate (2 x 2.5 inches) plates were often cut to fit cases and jewelry with circular and oval shapes larger plates were produced with sizes such as 9 x 13 inches (double-whole plate) or 13.5 x 16.5 inches (southworth & hawes plate)
the collodion wet plate process that gradually replaced the daguerreotype during the 1850s required photographers to coat and sensitize thin glass or iron plates shortly before use and expose them in the camera while still wet early wet plate cameras were very simple and little different from daguerreotype cameras but more sophisticated designs eventually appeared the dubroni of 1864 allowed the sensitizing and developing of the plates to be carried out inside the camera itself rather than in a separate darkroom other cameras were fitted with multiple lenses for photographing several small portraits on a single larger plate useful when making cartes de visite it was during the wet plate era that the use of bellows for focusing became widespread making the bulkier and less easily adjusted nested box design obsolete
for many years exposure times were long enough that the photographer simply removed the lens cap counted off the number of seconds (or minutes) estimated to be required by the lighting conditions then replaced the cap as more sensitive photographic materials became available cameras began to incorporate mechanical shutter mechanisms that allowed very short and accurately timed exposures to be made
the use of photographic film was pioneered by george eastman who started manufacturing paper film in 1885 before switching to celluloid in 1889 his first camera which he called the kodak, was first offered for sale in 1888 it was a very simple box camera with a fixed-focus lens and single shutter speed which along with its relatively low price appealed to the average consumer the kodak came pre-loaded with enough film for 100 exposures and needed to be sent back to the factory for processing and reloading when the roll was finished by the end of the 19th century eastman had expanded his lineup to several models including both box and folding cameras
films also made possible capture of motion (cinematography) establishing the movie industry by end of 19th century
the first camera using digital electronics to capture and store images was developed by kodak engineer steven sasson in 1975 he used a charge-coupled device (ccd) provided by fairchild semiconductor which provided only 0.01 megapixels to capture images sasson combined the ccd device with movie camera parts to create a digital camera that saved black and white images onto a cassette tape the images were then read from the cassette and viewed on a tv monitor later cassette tapes were replaced by flash memory
gradually in the 2000s and 2010s digital cameras became the dominant type of camera across consumer television and movies
== mechanics ==
=== image capture ===
traditional cameras capture light onto photographic plate or photographic film video and digital cameras use an electronic image sensor usually a charge coupled device (ccd) or a cmos sensor to capture images which can be transferred or stored in a memory card or other storage inside the camera for later playback or processing
cameras that capture many images in sequence are known as movie cameras or as cin cameras in europe those designed for single images are still cameras
however these categories overlap as still cameras are often used to capture moving images in special effects work and many modern cameras can quickly switch between still and motion recording modes
=== lens ===
the lens of a camera captures the light from the subject and brings it to a focus on the sensor the design and manufacture of the lens is critical to the quality of the photograph being taken the technological revolution in camera design in the 19th century revolutionized optical glass manufacture and lens design with great benefits for modern lens manufacture in a wide range of optical instruments from reading glasses to microscopes pioneers included zeiss and leitz
camera lenses are made in a wide range of focal lengths they range from extreme wide angle and standard medium telephoto each lens is best suited to a certain type of photography the extreme wide angle may be preferred for architecture because it has the capacity to capture a wide view of a building the normal lens because it often has a wide aperture is often used for street and documentary photography the telephoto lens is useful for sports and wildlife but it is more susceptible to camera shake
=== focus ===
due to the optical properties of photographic lenses only objects within a limited range of distances from the camera will be reproduced clearly the process of adjusting this range is known as changing the camera's focus there are various ways of focusing a camera accurately the simplest cameras have fixed focus and use a small aperture and wide-angle lens to ensure that everything within a certain range of distance from the lens usually around 3 metres (10 ft) to infinity is in reasonable focus fixed focus cameras are usually inexpensive types such as single-use cameras the camera can also have a limited focusing range or scale-focus that is indicated on the camera body the user will guess or calculate the distance to the subject and adjust the focus accordingly on some cameras this is indicated by symbols (head-and-shoulders two people standing upright one tree mountains)
rangefinder cameras allow the distance to objects to be measured by means of a coupled parallax unit on top of the camera allowing the focus to be set with accuracy single-lens reflex cameras allow the photographer to determine the focus and composition visually using the objective lens and a moving mirror to project the image onto a ground glass or plastic micro-prism screen twin-lens reflex cameras use an objective lens and a focusing lens unit (usually identical to the objective lens.) in a parallel body for composition and focusing view cameras use a ground glass screen which is removed and replaced by either a photographic plate or a reusable holder containing sheet film before exposure modern cameras often offer autofocus systems to focus the camera automatically by a variety of methods
some experimental cameras for example the planar fourier capture array (pfca) do not require focusing to allow them to take pictures in conventional digital photography lenses or mirrors map all of the light originating from a single point of an in-focus object to a single point at the sensor plane each pixel thus relates an independent piece of information about the far-away scene in contrast a pfca does not have a lens or mirror but each pixel has an idiosyncratic pair of diffraction gratings above it allowing each pixel to likewise relate an independent piece of information (specifically one component of the 2d fourier transform) about the far-away scene together complete scene information is captured and images can be reconstructed by computation
some cameras have post focusing post focusing means take the pictures first and then focusing later at the personal computer the camera uses many tiny lenses on the sensor to capture light from every camera angle of a scene and is called plenoptics technology a current plenoptic camera design has 40,000 lenses working together to grab the optimal picture
=== exposure control ===
the size of the aperture and the brightness of the scene controls the amount of light that enters the camera during a period of time and the shutter controls the length of time that the light hits the recording surface equivalent exposures can be made using a large aperture size with a fast shutter speed and a small aperture with a slow shutter
=== shutters ===
although a range of different shutter devices have been used during the development of the camera only two types have been widely used and remain in use today
the leaf shutter or more precisely the in-lens shutter is a shutter contained within the lens structure often close to the diaphragm consisting of a number of metal leaves which are maintained under spring tension and which are opened and then closed when the shutter is released the exposure time is determined by the interval between opening and closing in this shutter design the whole film frame is exposed at one time this makes flash synchronisation much simpler as the flash only needs to fire once the shutter is fully open disadvantages of such shutters are their inability to reliably produce very fast shutter speeds ( faster than 1/500th second or so) and the additional cost and weight of having to include a shutter mechanism for every lens
the focal-plane shutter operates as close to the film plane as possible and consists of cloth curtains that are pulled across the film plane with a carefully determined gap between the two curtains (typically running horizontally) or consisting of a series of metal plates (typically moving vertically) just in front of the film plane the focal-plane shutter is primarily associated with the single lens reflex type of cameras since covering the film rather than blocking light passing through the lens allows the photographer to view through the lens at all times except during the exposure itself covering the film also facilitates removing the lens from a loaded camera (many slrs have interchangeable lenses)
==== complexities ====
professional medium format slr (single-lens-reflex) cameras (typically using 120/220 roll film) use a hybrid solution since such a large focal-plane shutter would be difficult to make and/or may run slowly a manually inserted blade known as a dark slide allows the film to be covered when changing lenses or film backs a blind inside the camera covers the film prior to and after the exposure (but is not designed to be able to give accurately controlled exposure times) and a leaf shutter that is normally open is installed in the lens to take a picture the leaf shutter closes the blind opens the leaf shutter opens then closes again and finally the blind closes and the leaf shutter re-opens (the last step may only occur when the shutter is re-cocked)
using a focal-plane shutter exposing the whole film plane can take much longer than the exposure time the exposure time does not depend on the time taken to make the exposure over all only on the difference between the time a specific point on the film is uncovered and then covered up again for example an exposure of 1/1000 second may be achieved by the shutter curtains moving across the film plane in 1/50th of a second but with the two curtains only separated by 1/20th of the frame width in fact in practice the curtains do not run at a constant speed as they would in an ideal design obtaining an even exposure time depends mainly on being able to make the two curtains accelerate in a similar manner
when photographing rapidly moving objects the use of a focal-plane shutter can produce some unexpected effects since the film closest to the start position of the curtains is exposed earlier than the film closest to the end position typically this can result in a moving object leaving a slanting image the direction of the slant depends on the direction the shutter curtains run in (noting also that as in all cameras the image is inverted and reversed by the lens i.e top-left is at the bottom right of the sensor as seen by a photographer behind the camera)
focal-plane shutters are also difficult to synchronise with flash bulbs and electronic flash and it is often only possible to use flash at shutter speeds where the curtain that opens to reveal the film completes its run and the film is fully uncovered before the second curtain starts to travel and cover it up again typically 35mm film slrs could sync flash at only up to 1/60th second if the camera has horizontal run cloth curtains and 1/125th if using a vertical run metal shutter
== formats ==
a wide range of film and plate formats have been used by cameras in the early history plate sizes were often specific for the make and model of camera although there quickly developed some standardisation for the more popular cameras the introduction of roll film drove the standardization process still further so that by the 1950s only a few standard roll films were in use these included 120 film providing 8 12 or 16 exposures 220 film providing 16 or 24 exposures 127 film providing 8 or 12 exposures (principally in brownie cameras) and 135 (35 mm film) providing 12 20 or 36 exposures or up to 72 exposures in the half-frame format or in bulk cassettes for the leica camera range
for cine cameras film 35 mm wide and perforated with sprocket holes was established as the standard format in the 1890s it was used for nearly all film-based professional motion picture production for amateur use several smaller and therefore less expensive formats were introduced 17.5 mm film created by splitting 35 mm film was one early amateur format but 9.5 mm film introduced in europe in 1922 and 16 mm film introduced in the us in 1923 soon became the standards for home movies in their respective hemispheres in 1932 the even more economical 8 mm format was created by doubling the number of perforations in 16 mm film then splitting it usually after exposure and processing the super 8 format still 8 mm wide but with smaller perforations to make room for substantially larger film frames was introduced in 1965
== camera accessories ==
accessories for cameras are mainly for care protection special effects and functions
lens hood used on the end of a lens to block the sun or other light source to prevent glare and lens flare (see also matte box)
lens cap covers and protects the lens during storage
lens adapter sometimes called a step-ring adapts the lens to other size filters
lens filters allow artificial colors or change light density
lens extension tubes allow close focus in macro photography
flash equipment including light diffuser mount and stand reflector soft box trigger and cord
care and protection including camera case and cover maintenance tools and screen protector
large format cameras use special equipment which includes magnifier loupe view finder angle finder focusing rail /truck
battery and sometimes a charger
some professional slr could be provided with interchangeable finders for eye-level or waist-level focusing focusing screens eye-cup data backs motor-drives for film transportation or external battery packs
tripod microscope adapter cable release electric wire release
== camera designs ==
=== plate camera ===
the earliest cameras produced in significant numbers used sensitised glass plates were plate cameras light entered a lens mounted on a lens board which was separated from the plate by an extendible bellows.there were simple box cameras for glass plates but also single-lens reflex cameras with interchangeable lenses and even for color photography (autochrome lumire) many of these cameras had controls to raise or lower the lens and to tilt it forwards or backwards to control perspective
focussing of these plate cameras was by the use of a ground glass screen at the point of focus because lens design only allowed rather small aperture lenses the image on the ground glass screen was faint and most photographers had a dark cloth to cover their heads to allow focussing and composition to be carried out more easily when focus and composition were satisfactory the ground glass screen was removed and a sensitised plate put in its place protected by a dark slide to make the exposure the dark slide was carefully slid out and the shutter opened and then closed and the dark slide replaced
glass plates were later replaced by sheet film in a dark slide for sheet film adaptor sleeves were made to allow sheet film to be used in plate holders in addition to the ground glass a simple optical viewfinder was often fitted cameras which take single exposures on sheet film and are functionally identical to plate cameras were used for static high-image-quality work much longer in 20th century see large-format camera below
=== folding camera ===
the introduction of films enabled the existing designs for plate cameras to be made much smaller and for the base-plate to be hinged so that it could be folded up compressing the bellows these designs were very compact and small models were dubbed vest pocket cameras folding rollfilm cameras were preceded by folding plate cameras more compact than other designs
=== box camera ===
box cameras were introduced as a budget level camera and had few if any controls the original box brownie models had a small reflex viewfinder mounted on the top of the camera and had no aperture or focusing controls and just a simple shutter later models such as the brownie 127 had larger direct view optical viewfinders together with a curved film path to reduce the impact of deficiencies in the lens
=== rangefinder camera ===
as camera and lens technology developed and wide aperture lenses became more common rangefinder cameras were introduced to make focussing more precise early rangefinders had two separate viewfinder windows one of which is linked to the focusing mechanisms and moved right or left as the focusing ring is turned the two separate images are brought together on a ground glass viewing screen when vertical lines in the object being photographed meet exactly in the combined image the object is in focus a normal composition viewfinder is also provided later the viewfinder and rangefinder were combined many rangefinder cameras had interchangeable lenses each lens requiring its own range- and viewfinder linkages
rangefinder cameras were produced in half- and full-frame 35 mm and rollfilm (medium format)
=== instant picture camera ===
after exposure every photograph is taken through pinch rollers inside of the instant camera thereby the developer paste contained in the paper sandwich distributes on the image after a minute the cover sheet just needs to be removed and one gets a single original positive image with a fixed format with some systems it was also possible to create an instant image negative from which then could be made copies in the photo lab the ultimate development was the sx-70 system of polaroid in which a row of ten shots - engine driven - could be made without having to remove any cover sheets from the picture there were instant cameras for a variety of formats as well as cartridges with instant film for normal system cameras
=== single-lens reflex ===
in the single-lens reflex camera the photographer sees the scene through the camera lens this avoids the problem of parallax which occurs when the viewfinder or viewing lens is separated from the taking lens single-lens reflex cameras have been made in several formats including sheet film 5x7 and 4x5 roll film 220/120 taking 8,10 12 or 16 photographs on a 120 roll and twice that number of a 220 film these correspond to 6x9 6x7 6x6 and 6x4.5 respectively (all dimensions in cm) notable manufacturers of large format and roll film slr cameras include bronica graflex hasselblad mamiya and pentax however the most common format of slr cameras has been 35 mm and subsequently the migration to digital slr cameras using almost identical sized bodies and sometimes using the same lens systems
almost all slr cameras use a front surfaced mirror in the optical path to direct the light from the lens via a viewing screen and pentaprism to the eyepiece at the time of exposure the mirror is flipped up out of the light path before the shutter opens some early cameras experimented with other methods of providing through-the-lens viewing including the use of a semi-transparent pellicle as in the canon pellix and others with a small periscope such as in the corfield periflex series
=== twin-lens reflex ===
twin-lens reflex cameras used a pair of nearly identical lenses one to form the image and one as a viewfinder the lenses were arranged with the viewing lens immediately above the taking lens the viewing lens projects an image onto a viewing screen which can be seen from above some manufacturers such as mamiya also provided a reflex head to attach to the viewing screen to allow the camera to be held to the eye when in use the advantage of a tlr was that it could be easily focussed using the viewing screen and that under most circumstances the view seen in the viewing screen was identical to that recorded on film at close distances however parallax errors were encountered and some cameras also included an indicator to show what part of the composition would be excluded
some tlr had interchangeable lenses but as these had to be paired lenses they were relatively heavy and did not provide the range of focal lengths that the slr could support most tlrs used 120 or 220 film some used the smaller 127 film
=== large-format camera ===
the large-format camera taking sheet film is a direct successor of the early plate cameras and remained in use for high quality photography and for technical architectural and industrial photography there are three common types the view camera with its monorail and field camera variants and the press camera they have an extensible bellows with the lens and shutter mounted on a lens plate at the front backs taking rollfilm and later digital backs are available in addition to the standard dark slide back these cameras have a wide range of movements allowing very close control of focus and perspective composition and focusing is done on view cameras by viewing a ground-glass screen which is replaced by the film to make the exposure they are suitable for static subjects only and are slow to use
=== medium-format camera ===
medium-format cameras have a film size between the large-format cameras and smaller 35mm cameras typically these systems use 120 or 220 rollfilm the most common image sizes are 64.5 cm 66 cm and 67 cm the older 69 cm is rarely used the designs of this kind of camera show greater variation than their larger brethren ranging from monorail systems through the classic hasselblad model with separate backs to smaller rangefinder cameras there are even compact amateur cameras available in this format
=== subminiature camera ===
cameras taking film significantly smaller than 35 mm were made subminiature cameras were first produced in the nineteenth century the expensive 811 mm minox the only type of camera produced by the company from 1937 to 1976 became very widely known and was often used for espionage (the minox company later also produced larger cameras) later inexpensive subminiatures were made for general use some using rewound 16 mm cine film image quality with these small film sizes was limited
=== movie camera ===
a cin camera or movie camera takes a rapid sequence of photographs on image sensor or strips of film in contrast to a still camera which captures a single snapshot at a time the cin camera takes a series of images each called a frame through the use of an intermittent mechanism
the frames are later played back in a cin projector at a specific speed called the frame rate (number of frames per second) while viewing a person's eyes and brain merge the separate pictures to create the illusion of motion the first cin camera was built around 1888 and by 1890 several types were being manufactured the standard film size for cin cameras was quickly established as 35mm film and this remained in use until transition to digital cinematography other professional standard formats include 70 mm film and 16mm film whilst amateurs film makers used 9.5 mm film 8mm film or standard 8 and super 8 before the move into digital format
the size and complexity of cin cameras varies greatly depending on the uses required of the camera some professional equipment is very large and too heavy to be hand held whilst some amateur cameras were designed to be very small and light for single-handed operation
=== camcorders ===
a camcorder is an electronic device combining a video camera and a video recorder although marketing materials may use the colloquial term camcorder the name on the package and manual is often video camera recorder most devices capable of recording video are camera phones and digital cameras primarily intended for still pictures the term camcorder is used to describe a portable self-contained device with video capture and recording its primary function
=== professional video camera ===
a professional video camera (often called a television camera even though the use has spread beyond television) is a high-end device for creating electronic moving images (as opposed to a movie camera that earlier recorded the images on film) originally developed for use in television studios they are now also used for music videos direct-to-video movies corporate and educational videos marriage videos etc
these cameras earlier used vacuum tubes and later electronic sensors
=== digital camera ===
a digital camera (or digicam) is a camera that encodes digital images and videos digitally and stores them for later reproduction most cameras sold today are digital and digital cameras are incorporated into many devices ranging from mobile phones (called camera phones) to vehicles
digital and film cameras share an optical system typically using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup device the diaphragm and shutter admit the correct amount of light to the imager just as with film but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical however unlike film cameras digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded and store and delete images from memory most digital cameras can also record moving videos with sound some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other elementary image editing
consumers adopted digital cameras in 1990s professional video cameras transitioned to digital around the 2000s-2010s finally movie cameras transitioned to digital in the 2010s
