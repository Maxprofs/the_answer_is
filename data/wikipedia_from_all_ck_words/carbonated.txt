carbonation can refer to two chemical processes involving carbon dioxide
the dissolution in a liquid also known as fizz
the incorporation into chemical compounds
== dissolution in a liquidedit ==
the process usually involves carbon dioxide under high pressure when the pressure is reduced the carbon dioxide is released from the solution as small bubbles which causes the solution to become effervescent or fizzy a common example is the dissolving of carbon dioxide in water resulting in carbonated water
carbon dioxide is weakly soluble in water therefore it separates into a gas when the pressure is released
== incorporation into chemical compoundsedit ==
carbonation also describes the incorporation of carbon dioxide into chemical compounds this occurs in the following cases
in biochemistry
our carbon-based life originates from a carbonation reaction that is most often catalysed by the enzyme rubisco so important is this carbonation process that a significant fraction of leaf mass consists of this carbonating enzyme
in reinforced concrete construction
also known as neutralisation it is a chemical reaction between carbon dioxide in the air and calcium hydroxide and hydrated calcium silicate in the concrete
