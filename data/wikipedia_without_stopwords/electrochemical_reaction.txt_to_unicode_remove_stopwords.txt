term redox stands reductionoxidation refers electrochemical processes involving electron transfer molecule ion changing oxidation state reaction occur application external voltage release chemical energy oxidation reduction describe change oxidation state takes place atoms ions molecules involved electrochemical reaction formally oxidation state hypothetical charge atom would bonds atoms different elements ionic atom ion gives electron another atom ion oxidation state increase recipient negatively charged electron oxidation state decrease
example atomic sodium reacts atomic chlorine sodium donates one electron attains oxidation state chlorine accepts electron oxidation state reduced sign oxidation state positivenegative actually corresponds value ions electronic charge attraction differently charged sodium chlorine ions reason form ionic bond
loss electrons atom molecule called oxidation gain electrons reduction easily remembered use mnemonic devices two popular oil rig oxidation loss reduction gain leo lion says ger lose electrons oxidation gain electrons reduction oxidation reduction always occur paired fashion one species oxidized another reduced cases electrons shared covalent bonds atoms large differences electronegativity electron assigned atom largest electronegativity determining oxidation state
atom molecule loses electrons known reducing agent reductant substance accepts electrons called oxidizing agent oxidant thus oxidizing agent always reduced reaction reducing agent always oxidized oxygen common oxidizing agent one despite name oxidation reaction necessarily need involve oxygen fact fire fed oxidant oxygen fluorine fires often unquenchable fluorine even stronger oxidant higher electronegativity thus accepts electrons even better oxygen
reactions involving oxygen gain oxygen implies oxidation atom molecule oxygen added oxygen reduced organic compounds butane ethanol loss hydrogen implies oxidation molecule lost hydrogen reduced follows hydrogen donates electron covalent bonds nonmetals takes electron along lost conversely loss oxygen gain hydrogen implies reduction
