bind /band/ or named /nemdi/ is the most widely used domain name system (dns) software on the internet on unix-like operating systems it is the de facto standard
the software was originally designed at the university of california berkeley (ucb) in the early 1980s the name originates as an acronym of berkeley internet name domain reflecting the application's use within ucb the software consists most prominently of the dns server component called named a contracted form of name daemon in addition the suite contains various administration tools and a dns resolver interface library the latest version of bind is bind 9 first released in 2000
starting in 2009 the internet software consortium (isc) developed a new software suite initially called bind10 with release version 1.2.0 the project was renamed bundy to terminate isc involvement in the project
== database support ==
while earlier versions of bind offered no mechanism to store and retrieve zone data in anything other than flat text files in 2007 bind 9.4 dlz provided a compile-time option for zone storage in a variety of database formats including ldap berkeley db postgresql mysql and odbc
bind 10 planned to make the data store modular so that a variety of databases may be connected
== security ==
the bind 4 and bind 8 releases both had serious security vulnerabilities their use is strongly discouraged bind 9 was a complete rewrite in part to mitigate these ongoing security issues
security issues that are discovered in bind 9 are patched and publicly disclosed in keeping with common principles of open source software a complete list of security defects that have been discovered and disclosed in bind9 is maintained by internet systems consortium the current authors of the software
== history ==
originally written by four graduate students at the computer systems research group at the university of california berkeley (ucb) bind was first released with berkeley software distribution 4.3bsd paul vixie started maintaining it in 1988 while working for digital equipment corporation as of 2012 the internet systems consortium maintains updates and writes new versions of bind
bind was written by douglas terry mark painter david riggle and songnian zhou in the early 1980s at the university of california berkeley as a result of a darpa grant the acronym bind is for berkeley internet name domain from a technical paper published in 1984
versions of bind through 4.8.3 were maintained by the computer systems research group (csrg) at uc berkeley
in the mid-1980s paul vixie of dec took over bind development releasing versions 4.9 and 4.9.1 paul vixie continued to work on bind after leaving dec bind version 4.9.2 was sponsored by vixie enterprises vixie eventually founded the isc which became the entity responsible for bind versions starting with 4.9.3
bind 8 was released by isc in may 1997
version 9 was developed by nominum inc under an isc outsourcing contract and the first version was released october 9 2000 it was written from scratch in part to address the architectural difficulties with auditing the earlier bind code bases and also to support dnssec (dns security extensions) other important features of bind 9 include tsig nsupdate ipv6 rndc (remote name daemon control) views multiprocessor support and an improved portability architecture rndc uses a shared secret to provide encryption for local and remote terminals during each session the development of bind 9 took place under a combination of commercial and military contracts most of the features of bind 9 were funded by unix vendors who wanted to ensure that bind stayed competitive with microsoft's dns offerings the dnssec features were funded by the us military which regarded dns security as important bind 9 was released in september 2000
in 2009 isc started an effort to develop a new version of the software suite called bind10 in addition to dns service the bind10 suite also included ipv4 and ipv6 dhcp server components in april 2014 with the bind10 release 1.2.0 the isc concluded its development work of the project and renamed the project bundy moving the source code repository to github for further development by outside public efforts bundy is community-supported at the web site http://bundy-dns.de/ isc discontinued its involvement in the project due to cost-cutting measures the development of dhcp components was split off to become a new kea project
