human immunodeficiency virus infection acquired immune deficiency syndrome hivaids spectrum conditions often called hiv disease caused infection human immunodeficiency virus hiv following initial infection person may experience brief period influenzalike illness typically followed prolonged period without symptoms infection progresses interferes immune system making person much susceptible common infections like tuberculosis well opportunistic infections tumors usually affect people working immune systems late symptoms infection referred aids stage often complicated infection lung known pneumocystis pneumonia severe weight loss skin lesions caused kaposis sarcoma aidsdefining conditions
hiv transmitted primarily via unprotected sexual intercourse including anal oral sex contaminated blood transfusions hypodermic needles mother child pregnancy delivery breastfeeding bodily fluids saliva tears transmit hiv common methods hivaids prevention include encouraging practicing safe sex needleexchange programs treating infected cure vaccine however antiretroviral treatment slow course disease may lead nearnormal life expectancy antiretroviral treatment reduces risk death complications disease medications expensive side effects treatment recommended soon diagnosis made without treatment average survival time infection hiv estimated years depending hiv subtype
since discovery aids caused estimated million deaths worldwide resulted million deaths million people living hiv hivaids considered pandemica disease outbreak present large area actively spreading genetic research indicates hiv originated westcentral africa late th early th century aids first recognized united states centers disease control prevention cdc causehiv infectionwas identified early part decade
hivaids great impact society illness source discrimination disease also significant economic impacts many misconceptions hivaids belief transmitted casual nonsexual contact disease become subject many controversies involving religion attracted international medical political attention well largescale funding since identified
signs symptoms
three main stages hiv disease acute infection clinical latency aids
acute infection
initial period following contraction hiv called acute hiv primary hiv acute retroviral syndrome many individuals develop influenzalike illness mononucleosislike illness weeks post exposure others significant symptoms symptoms occur cases commonly include fever large tender lymph nodes throat inflammation rash headache andor sores mouth genitals rash occurs cases presents trunk maculopapular classically people also develop opportunistic infections stage gastrointestinal symptoms nausea vomiting diarrhea may occur may neurological symptoms peripheral neuropathy guillainbarre syndrome duration symptoms varies usually one two weeks
due nonspecific character symptoms often recognized signs hiv infection even cases get seen family doctor hospital often misdiagnosed one many common infectious diseases overlapping symptoms thus recommended hiv considered people presenting unexplained fever may risk factors infection
clinical latency
initial symptoms followed stage called clinical latency asymptomatic hiv chronic hiv without treatment second stage natural history hiv infection last three years years average eight years typically symptoms first near end stage many people experience fever weight loss gastrointestinal problems muscle pains people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy characterized unexplained nonpainful enlargement one group lymph nodes groin three six months
although hiv infected individuals detectable viral load absence treatment eventually progress aids small proportion retain high levels cd cells helper cells without antiretroviral therapy years individuals classified hiv controllers longterm nonprogressors ltnp another group consists maintain low undetectable viral load without antiretroviral treatment known elite controllers elite suppressors represent approximately infected persons
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids defined terms either cd cell count cells per l occurrence specific diseases association hiv infection absence specific treatment around half people infected hiv develop aids within ten years common initial conditions alert presence aids pneumocystis pneumonia cachexia form hiv wasting syndrome esophageal candidiasis common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections
opportunistic infections may caused bacteria viruses fungi parasites normally controlled immune system infections occur depends partly organisms common persons environment infections may affect nearly every organ system
people aids increased risk developing various viralinduced cancers including kaposis sarcoma burkitts lymphoma primary central nervous system lymphoma cervical cancer kaposis sarcoma common cancer occurring people hiv second common cancer lymphoma cause death nearly people aids initial sign aids cancers associated human herpesvirus cervical cancer occurs frequently aids association human papillomavirus hpv conjunctival cancer layer lines inner part eyelids white part eye also common hiv
additionally people aids frequently systemic symptoms prolonged fevers sweats particularly night swollen lymph nodes chills weakness unintended weight loss diarrhea another common symptom present people aids also affected diverse psychiatric neurological symptoms independent opportunistic infections cancers
transmission
hiv transmitted three main routes sexual contact exposure infected body fluids tissues mother child pregnancy delivery breastfeeding known vertical transmission risk acquiring hiv exposed feces nasal secretions saliva sputum sweat tears urine vomit unless contaminated blood possible coinfected one strain hiva condition known hiv superinfection
sexual
frequent mode transmission hiv sexual contact infected person majority transmissions worldwide occur heterosexual contacts ie sexual contacts people opposite sex however pattern transmission varies significantly among countries united states sexual transmission occurred men sex men population accounting new cases
regard unprotected heterosexual contacts estimates risk hiv transmission per sexual act appear four ten times higher lowincome countries highincome countries lowincome countries risk femaletomale transmission estimated per act maletofemale transmission per act equivalent estimates highincome countries per act femaletomale transmission per act maletofemale transmission risk transmission anal intercourse especially high estimated per act heterosexual homosexual contacts risk transmission oral sex relatively low still present risk receiving oral sex described nearly nil however cases reported peract risk estimated receptive oral intercourse settings involving prostitution low income countries risk femaletomale transmission estimated per act maletofemale transmission per act
risk transmission increases presence many sexually transmitted infections genital ulcers genital ulcers appear increase risk approximately fivefold sexually transmitted infections gonorrhea chlamydia trichomoniasis bacterial vaginosis associated somewhat smaller increases risk transmission
viral load infected person important risk factor sexual mothertochild transmission first months hiv infection persons infectiousness twelve times higher due high viral load person late stages infection rates transmission approximately eightfold greater
commercial sex workers including pornography increased rate hiv rough sex factor associated increased risk transmission sexual assault also believed carry increased risk hiv transmission condoms rarely worn physical trauma vagina rectum likely may greater risk concurrent sexually transmitted infections
body fluids
second frequent mode hiv transmission via blood blood products bloodborne transmission needlesharing intravenous drug use needle stick injury transfusion contaminated blood blood product medical injections unsterilised equipment risk sharing needle drug injection per act average risk acquiring hiv needle stick hivinfected person estimated per act risk following mucous membrane exposure infected blood per act united states intravenous drug users made new cases hiv areas people inject drugs hiv positive
hiv transmitted blood transfusions using infected blood developed countries risk acquiring hiv blood transfusion extremely low less one half million improved donor selection hiv screening performed example uk risk reported one five million united states one million low income countries half transfusions may appropriately screened estimated hiv infections areas come transfusion infected blood blood products representing global infections
unsafe medical injections play significant role hiv spread subsaharan africa infections region attributed medical syringe use world health organization estimates risk transmission result medical injection africa significant risks also associated invasive procedures assisted delivery dental care area world
people giving receiving tattoos piercings scarification theoretically risk infection confirmed cases documented possible mosquitoes insects transmit hiv
mothertochild
hiv transmitted mother child pregnancy delivery breast milk third common way hiv transmitted globally absence treatment risk transmission birth around also breastfeed vertical transmission accounted cases hiv children appropriate treatment risk mothertochild infection reduced preventive treatment involves mother taking antiretrovirals pregnancy delivery elective caesarean section avoiding breastfeeding administering antiretroviral drugs newborn antiretrovirals taken either mother infant decrease risk transmission breastfeed many measures however available developing world blood contaminates food prechewing may pose risk transmission
virology
hiv cause spectrum disease known hivaids hiv retrovirus primarily infects components human immune system cd cells macrophages dendritic cells directly indirectly destroys cd cells
hiv member genus lentivirus part family retroviridae lentiviruses share many morphological biological characteristics many species mammals infected lentiviruses characteristically responsible longduration illnesses long incubation period lentiviruses transmitted singlestranded positivesense enveloped rna viruses upon entry target cell viral rna genome converted reverse transcribed doublestranded dna virally encoded reverse transcriptase transported along viral genome virus particle resulting viral dna imported cell nucleus integrated cellular dna virally encoded integrase host cofactors integrated virus may become latent allowing virus host cell avoid detection immune system alternatively virus may transcribed producing new rna genomes viral proteins packaged released cell new virus particles begin replication cycle anew
hiv known spread cd cells two parallel routes cellfree spread celltocell spread ie employs hybrid spreading mechanisms cellfree spread virus particles bud infected cell enter bloodextracellular fluid infect another cell following chance encounter hiv also disseminate direct transmission one cell another process celltocell spread hybrid spreading mechanisms hiv contribute viruss ongoing replication antiretroviral therapies
two types hiv characterized hiv hiv hiv virus originally discovered initially referred also lav htlviii virulent infective cause majority hiv infections globally lower infectivity hiv compared hiv implies fewer people exposed hiv infected per exposure relatively poor capacity transmission hiv largely confined west africa
pathophysiology
virus enters body period rapid viral replication leading abundance virus peripheral blood primary infection level hiv may reach several million virus particles per milliliter blood response accompanied marked drop number circulating cd cells acute viremia almost invariably associated activation cd cells kill hivinfected cells subsequently antibody production seroconversion cd cell response thought important controlling virus levels peak decline cd cell counts recover good cd cell response linked slower disease progression better prognosis though eliminate virus
ultimately hiv causes aids depleting cd cells weakens immune system allows opportunistic infections cells essential immune response without body cannot fight infections kill cancerous cells mechanism cd cell depletion differs acute chronic phases acute phase hivinduced cell lysis killing infected cells cytotoxic cells accounts cd cell depletion although apoptosis may also factor chronic phase consequences generalized immune activation coupled gradual loss ability immune system generate new cells appear account slow decline cd cell numbers
although symptoms immune deficiency characteristic aids appear years person infected bulk cd cell loss occurs first weeks infection especially intestinal mucosa harbors majority lymphocytes found body reason preferential loss mucosal cd cells majority mucosal cd cells express ccr protein hiv uses coreceptor gain access cells whereas small fraction cd cells bloodstream specific genetic change alters ccr protein present chromosomes effectively prevents hiv infection
hiv seeks destroys ccr expressing cd cells acute infection vigorous immune response eventually controls infection initiates clinically latent phase cd cells mucosal tissues remain particularly affected continuous hiv replication causes state generalized immune activation persisting throughout chronic phase immune activation reflected increased activation state immune cells release proinflammatory cytokines results activity several hiv gene products immune response ongoing hiv replication also linked breakdown immune surveillance system gastrointestinal mucosal barrier caused depletion mucosal cd cells acute phase disease
diagnosis
hivaids diagnosed via laboratory testing staged based presence certain signs symptoms hiv screening recommended united states preventive services task force people years years age including pregnant women additionally testing recommended high risk includes anyone diagnosed sexually transmitted illness many areas world third hiv carriers discover infected advanced stage disease aids severe immunodeficiency become apparent
hiv testing
people infected hiv develop specific antibodies ie seroconvert within three twelve weeks initial infection diagnosis primary hiv seroconversion done measuring hivrna p antigen positive results obtained antibody pcr testing confirmed either different antibody pcr
antibody tests children younger months typically inaccurate due continued presence maternal antibodies thus hiv infection diagnosed pcr testing hiv rna dna via testing p antigen much world lacks access reliable pcr testing many places simply wait either symptoms develop child old enough accurate antibody testing subsaharan africa population aware hiv status men women subsaharan countries tested represented significant increase compared previous years
classifications
two main clinical staging systems used classify hiv hivrelated disease surveillance purposes disease staging system hiv infection disease cdc classification system hiv infection cdcs classification system frequently adopted developed countries since whos staging system require laboratory tests suited resourcerestricted conditions encountered developing countries also used help guide clinical management despite differences two systems allow comparison statistical purposes
world health organization first proposed definition aids since classification updated expanded several times recent version published system uses following categories
primary hiv infection may either asymptomatic associated acute retroviral syndrome
stage hiv infection asymptomatic cd cell count also known cd count greater per microlitre l cubic mm blood may include generalized lymph node enlargement
stage ii mild symptoms may include minor mucocutaneous manifestations recurrent upper respiratory tract infections cd count less l
stage iii advanced symptoms may include unexplained chronic diarrhea longer month severe bacterial infections including tuberculosis lung cd count less l
stage iv aids severe symptoms include toxoplasmosis brain candidiasis esophagus trachea bronchi lungs kaposis sarcoma cd count less l
united states center disease control prevention also created classification system hiv updated system classifies hiv infections based cd count clinical symptoms describes infection five groups greater six years age

prevention
sexual contact
consistent condom use reduces risk hiv transmission approximately long term condoms used consistently couple one person infected rate hiv infection less per year evidence suggest female condoms may provide equivalent level protection application vaginal gel containing tenofovir reverse transcriptase inhibitor immediately sex seems reduce infection rates approximately among african women contrast use spermicide nonoxynol may increase risk transmission due tendency cause vaginal rectal irritation
circumcision subsaharan africa reduces acquisition hiv heterosexual men months based studies world health organization unaids recommended male circumcision method preventing femaletomale hiv transmission whether protects maletofemale transmission disputed whether benefit developed countries among men sex men undetermined international antiviral society however recommend sexually active heterosexual males discussed option men sex men experts fear lower perception vulnerability among circumcised men may cause sexual risktaking behavior thus negating preventive effects
programs encouraging sexual abstinence appear affect subsequent hiv risk evidence benefit peer education equally poor comprehensive sexual education provided school may decrease high risk behavior substantial minority young people continues engage highrisk practices despite knowing hivaids underestimating risk becoming infected hiv voluntary counseling testing people hiv affect risky behavior test negative increase condom use test positive known whether treating sexually transmitted infections effective preventing hiv
preexposure
antiretroviral treatment among people hiv whose cd count cellsl effective way prevent hiv infection partner strategy known treatment prevention tasp tasp associated fold reduction transmission risk preexposure prophylaxis prep daily dose medications tenofovir without emtricitabine effective number groups including men sex men couples one hiv positive young heterosexuals africa may also effective intravenous drug users study finding decrease risk per person years
universal precautions within health care environment believed effective decreasing risk hiv intravenous drug use important risk factor harm reduction strategies needleexchange programmes opioid substitution therapy appear effective decreasing risk
postexposure
course antiretrovirals administered within hours exposure hivpositive blood genital secretions referred postexposure prophylaxis pep use single agent zidovudine reduces risk hiv infection fivefold following needlestick injury prevention regimen recommended united states consists three medicationstenofovir emtricitabine raltegraviras may reduce risk
pep treatment recommended sexual assault perpetrator known hiv positive controversial hiv status unknown duration treatment usually four weeks frequently associated adverse effectswhere zidovudine used cases result adverse effects nausea fatigue emotional distress headaches
mothertochild
programs prevent vertical transmission hiv mothers children reduce rates transmission primarily involves use combination antiviral medications pregnancy birth infant potentially includes bottle feeding rather breastfeeding replacement feeding acceptable feasible affordable sustainable safe mothers avoid breastfeeding infants however exclusive breastfeeding recommended first months life case exclusive breastfeeding carried provision extended antiretroviral prophylaxis infant decreases risk transmission cuba became first country world eradicate mothertochild transmission hiv
vaccination
currently licensed vaccine hiv aids effective vaccine trial date rv published found partial reduction risk transmission roughly stimulating hope research community developing truly effective vaccine trials rv vaccine ongoing
treatment
currently cure effective hiv vaccine treatment consists highly active antiretroviral therapy haart slows progression disease million people taking low middle income countries treatment also includes preventive active treatment opportunistic infections
antiviral therapy
current haart options combinations cocktails consisting least three medications belonging least two types classes antiretroviral agents initially treatment typically nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nnrti plus two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors nrtis typical nrtis include zidovudine azt tenofovir tdf lamivudine tc emtricitabine ftc combinations agents include protease inhibitors pi used regimen loses effectiveness
world health organization united states recommends antiretrovirals people ages including pregnant women soon diagnosis made regardless cd count treatment begun recommended continued without breaks holidays many people diagnosed treatment ideally begun desired outcome treatment long term plasma hivrna count copiesml levels determine treatment effective initially recommended four weeks levels fall copiesml checks every three six months typically adequate inadequate control deemed greater copiesml based criteria treatment effective people first year
benefits treatment include decreased risk progression aids decreased risk death developing world treatment also improves physical mental health treatment reduced risk acquiring tuberculosis additional benefits include decreased risk transmission disease sexual partners decrease mothertochild transmission effectiveness treatment depends large part compliance reasons nonadherence include poor access medical care inadequate social supports mental illness drug abuse complexity treatment regimens due pill numbers dosing frequency adverse effects may reduce adherence even though cost important issue medications needed taking low middle income countries rate adherence similar lowincome highincome countries
specific adverse events related antiretroviral agent taken relatively common adverse events include lipodystrophy syndrome dyslipidemia diabetes mellitus especially protease inhibitors common symptoms include diarrhea increased risk cardiovascular disease newer recommended treatments associated fewer adverse effects certain medications may associated birth defects therefore may unsuitable women hoping children
treatment recommendations children somewhat different adults world health organisation recommends treating children less years age children treated like adults united states guidelines recommend treating children less months age hiv rna counts greater copiesml one year five years age
opportunistic infections
measures prevent opportunistic infections effective many people hivaids addition improving current disease treatment antiretrovirals reduces risk developing additional opportunistic infections adults adolescents living hiv even antiretroviral therapy evidence active tuberculosis settings high tuberculosis burden receive isoniazid preventive therapy ipt tuberculin skin test used help decide ipt needed vaccination hepatitis b advised people risk hiv become infected however may also given infection trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole prophylaxis four six weeks age ceasing breastfeeding infants born hiv positive mothers recommended resource limited settings also recommended prevent pcp persons cd count cellsul previously pcp people substantial immunosuppression also advised receive prophylactic therapy toxoplasmosis cryptococcus meningitis appropriate preventive measures reduced rate infections
diet
world health organization issued recommendations regarding nutrient requirements hivaids generally healthy diet promoted evidence shown benefit micronutrient supplements evidence supplementation selenium mixed tentative evidence benefit evidence vitamin supplementation children reduces mortality improves growth africa nutritionally compromised pregnant lactating women multivitamin supplementation improved outcomes mothers children dietary intake micronutrients rda levels hivinfected adults recommended higher intake vitamin zinc iron produce adverse effects hiv positive adults recommended unless documented deficiency
alternative medicine
us approximately people hiv use various forms complementary alternative medicine even though effectiveness therapies established enough evidence support use herbal medicines insufficient evidence recommend support use medical cannabis try increase appetite weight gain
prognosis
hivaids become chronic rather acutely fatal disease many areas world prognosis varies people cd count viral load useful predicted outcomes without treatment average survival time infection hiv estimated years depending hiv subtype diagnosis aids treatment available survival ranges months haart appropriate prevention opportunistic infections reduces death rate raises life expectancy newly diagnosed young adult years two thirds nearly general population treatment started late infection prognosis good example treatment begun following diagnosis aids life expectancy years half infants born hiv die two years age without treatment
primary causes death hivaids opportunistic infections cancer frequently result progressive failure immune system risk cancer appears increase cd count l rate clinical disease progression varies widely individuals shown affected number factors persons susceptibility immune function access health care presence coinfections particular strain strains virus involved
tuberculosis coinfection one leading causes sickness death hivaids present third hiv infected people causing hiv related deaths hiv also one important risk factors tuberculosis hepatitis c another common coinfection disease increases progression two common cancers associated hivaids kaposis sarcoma aidsrelated nonhodgkins lymphoma
even antiretroviral treatment long term hivinfected people may experience neurocognitive disorders osteoporosis neuropathy cancers nephropathy cardiovascular disease conditions like lipodystrophy may caused hiv treatment

society culture
stigma
aids stigma exists around world variety ways including ostracism rejection discrimination avoidance hiv infected people compulsory hiv testing without prior consent protection confidentiality violence hiv infected individuals people perceived infected hiv quarantine hiv infected individuals stigmarelated violence fear violence prevents many people seeking hiv testing returning results securing treatment possibly turning could manageable chronic illness death sentence perpetuating spread hiv
aids stigma divided following three categories
instrumental aids stigmaa reflection fear apprehension likely associated deadly transmissible illness
symbolic aids stigmathe use hivaids express attitudes toward social groups lifestyles perceived associated disease
courtesy aids stigmastigmatization people connected issue hivaids hivpositive people
often aids stigma expressed conjunction one stigmas particularly associated homosexuality bisexuality promiscuity prostitution intravenous drug use
many developed countries association aids homosexuality bisexuality association correlated higher levels sexual prejudice antihomosexualbisexual attitudes also perceived association aids malemale sexual behavior including sex uninfected men however dominant mode spread worldwide hiv remains heterosexual transmission

economic impact
hivaids affects economics individuals countries gross domestic product affected countries decreased due lack human capital without proper nutrition health care medicine large numbers people die aidsrelated complications unable work also require significant medical care estimated million aids orphans many cared elderly grandparents
returning work beginning treatment hivaids difficult affected people often work less average worker unemployment people hivaids also associated suicidal ideation memory problems social isolation employment increases selfesteem sense dignity confidence quality life cochrane review found lowquality evidence antiretroviral treatment helps people hivaids work increases chance person hivaids employed
affecting mainly young adults aids reduces taxable population turn reducing resources available public expenditures education health services related aids resulting increasing pressure states finances slower growth economy causes slower growth tax base effect reinforced growing expenditures treating sick training replace sick workers sick pay caring aids orphans especially true sharp increase adult mortality shifts responsibility blame family government caring orphans
household level aids causes loss income increased spending healthcare study cte divoire showed households person hivaids spent twice much medical expenses households additional expenditure also leaves less income spend education personal family investment
religion aids
topic religion aids become highly controversial past twenty years primarily religious authorities publicly declared opposition use condoms religious approach prevent spread aids according report american health expert matthew hanley titled catholic church global aids crisis argues cultural changes needed including reemphasis fidelity within marriage sexual abstinence outside
religious organisations claimed prayer cure hivaids bbc reported churches london claiming prayer would cure aids hackneybased centre study sexual health hiv reported several people stopped taking medication sometimes direct advice pastor leading number deaths synagogue church nations advertise anointing water promote gods healing although group deny advising people stop taking medication
