a gill (/l/) is a respiratory organ found in many aquatic organisms that extracts dissolved oxygen from water and excretes carbon dioxide the gills of some species such as hermit crabs have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist the microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area to the external environment
many microscopic aquatic animals and some larger but inactive ones can absorb adequate oxygen through the entire surface of their bodies and so can respire adequately without a gill however more complex or more active aquatic organisms usually require a gill or gills
gills usually consist of thin filaments of tissue branches or slender tufted processes that have a highly folded surface to increase surface area a high surface area is crucial to the gas exchange of aquatic organisms as water contains only a small fraction of the dissolved oxygen that air does a cubic meter of air contains about 250 grams of oxygen at stp the concentration of oxygen in water is lower than air and it diffuses more slowly in fresh water the dissolved oxygen content is approximately 8 cm3/l compared to that of air which is 210 cm3/l water is 777 times more dense than air and is 100 times more viscous oxygen has a diffusion rate in air 10,000 times greater than in water the use of sac-like lungs to remove oxygen from water would not be efficient enough to sustain life rather than using lungs [g]asesous exchange takes place across the surface of highly vascularised gills over which a one-way current of water is kept flowing by a specialised pumping mechanism the density of the water prevents the gills from collapsing and lying on top of each other which is what happens when a fish is taken out of water.
with the exception of some aquatic insects the filaments and lamellae (folds) contain blood or coelomic fluid from which gases are exchanged through the thin walls the blood carries oxygen to other parts of the body carbon dioxide passes from the blood through the thin gill tissue into the water gills or gill-like organs located in different parts of the body are found in various groups of aquatic animals including mollusks crustaceans insects fish and amphibians
== vertebrate gillsedit ==
the gills of vertebrates typically develop in the walls of the pharynx along a series of gill slits opening to the exterior most species employ a countercurrent exchange system to enhance the diffusion of substances in and out of the gill with blood and water flowing in opposite directions to each other the gills are composed of comb-like filaments the gill lamellae which help increase their surface area for oxygen exchange
when a fish breathes it draws in a mouthful of water at regular intervals then it draws the sides of its throat together forcing the water through the gill openings so it passes over the gills to the outside fish gill slits may be the evolutionary ancestors of the tonsils thymus glands and eustachian tubes as well as many other structures derived from the embryonic branchial pouches

==== cartilaginous fishedit ====
sharks and rays typically have five pairs of gill slits that open directly to the outside of the body though some more primitive sharks have six pairs adjacent slits are separated by a cartilaginous gill arch from which projects a cartilaginous gill ray this gill ray is the support for the sheet-like interbranchial septum which the individual lamellae of the gills lie on either side of the base of the arch may also support gill rakers projections into the pharyngeal cavity that help to prevent large pieces of debris from damaging the delicate gills
a smaller opening the spiracle lies in the back of the first gill slit this bears a small pseudobranch that resembles a gill in structure but only receives blood already oxygenated by the true gills the spiracle is thought to be homologous to the ear opening in higher vertebrates
most sharks rely on ram ventilation forcing water into the mouth and over the gills by rapidly swimming forward in slow-moving or bottom-dwelling species especially among skates and rays the spiracle may be enlarged and the fish breathes by sucking water through this opening instead of through the mouth
chimaeras differ from other cartilagenous fish having lost both the spiracle and the fifth gill slit the remaining slits are covered by an operculum developed from the septum of the gill arch in front of the first gill
==== bony fishedit ====
in bony fish the gills lie in a branchial chamber covered by a bony operculum the great majority of bony fish species have five pairs of gills although a few have lost some over the course of evolution the operculum can be important in adjusting the pressure of water inside of the pharynx to allow proper ventilation of the gills so bony fish do not have to rely on ram ventilation (and hence near constant motion) to breathe valves inside the mouth keep the water from escaping
the gill arches of bony fish typically have no septum so the gills alone project from the arch supported by individual gill rays some species retain gill rakers though all but the most primitive bony fish lack spiracles the pseudobranch associated with them often remains being located at the base of the operculum this is however often greatly reduced consisting of a small mass of cells without any remaining gill-like structure
marine teleosts also use gills to excrete electrolytes the gills large surface area tends to create a problem for fish that seek to regulate the osmolarity of their internal fluids salt water is less dilute than these internal fluids so saltwater fish lose large quantities of water osmotically through their gills to regain the water they drink large amounts of sea water and excrete the salt fresh water is more dilute than the internal fluids of fish however so freshwater fish gain water osmotically through their gills
=== other vertebratesedit ===
lampreys and hagfish do not have gill slits as such instead the gills are contained in spherical pouches with a circular opening to the outside like the gill slits of higher fish each pouch contains two gills in some cases the openings may be fused together effectively forming an operculum lampreys have seven pairs of pouches while hagfishes may have six to fourteen depending on the species in the hagfish the pouches connect with the pharynx internally and a separate tube which has no respiratory tissue (the pharyngocutaneous duct) develops beneath the pharynx proper expelling ingested debris by closing a valve at its anterior end
tadpoles of amphibians have from three to five gill slits that do not contain actual gills usually no spiracle or true operculum is present though many species have operculum-like structures instead of internal gills they develop three feathery external gills that grow from the outer surface of the gill arches sometimes adults retain these but they usually disappear at metamorphosis lungfish larvae also have external gills as does the primitive ray-finned fish polypterus though the latter has a structure different from amphibians
=== branchiaedit ===
branchia (pl branchiae) is the naturalists name for gills galen observed that fish had multitudes of openings (foramina) big enough to admit gases but too fine to give passage to water pliny the elder held that fish respired by their gills but observed that aristotle was of another opinion the word branchia comes from the greek  gills plural of (in singular meaning a fin)
== invertebrate gillsedit ==
respiration in the echinodermata (includes starfish and sea urchins) is carried out using a very primitive version of gills called papulae these thin protuberances on the surface of the body contain diverticula of the water vascular system crustaceans molluscs and some aquatic insects have tufted gills or plate-like structures on the surfaces of their bodies
the gills of aquatic insects are tracheal but the air tubes are sealed commonly connected to thin external plates or tufted structures that allow diffusion the oxygen in these tubes is renewed through the gills in the larval dragon fly the wall of the caudal end of the alimentary tract (rectum) is richly supplied with tracheae as a rectal gill and water pumped into and out of the rectum provides oxygen to the closed tracheae
=== plastronedit ===
a plastron is a type of structural adaptation occurring among some aquatic arthropods (primarily insects) a form of physical gill which holds a thin film of atmospheric oxygen in an area with small openings called spiracles that connect to the tracheal system the plastron typically consists of dense patches of hydrophobic setae on the body which prevent water entry into the spiracles but may also involve scales or microscopic ridges projecting from the cuticle the physical properties of the interface between the trapped air film and surrounding water allow gas exchange through the spiracles almost as if the insect were in atmospheric air carbon dioxide diffuses into the surrounding water due to its high solubility while oxygen diffuses into the film as the concentration within the film has been reduced by respiration and nitrogen also diffuses out as its tension has been increased oxygen diffuses into the air film at a higher rate than nitrogen diffuses out however water surrounding the insect can become oxygen-depleted if there is no water movement so many such insects in still water actively direct a flow of water over their bodies
the physical gill mechanism allows aquatic insects with plastrons to remain constantly submerged examples include many beetles in the family elmidae aquatic weevils and true bugs in the family aphelocheiridae as well as at least one species of ricinuleid arachnid a somewhat similar mechanism is used by the diving bell spider which maintains an underwater bubble that exchanges gas like a plastron other diving insects (such as backswimmers and hydrophilid beetles) may carry trapped air bubbles but deplete the oxygen more quickly and thus need constant replenishment
