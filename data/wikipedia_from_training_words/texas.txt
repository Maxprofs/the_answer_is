due to its size and geologic features such as the balcones fault texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the american south and southwest although popularly associated with the southwestern deserts less than 10 percent of texas land area is desert most of the population centers are located in areas of former prairies grasslands forests and the coastline traveling from east to west one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods to rolling plains and rugged hills and finally the desert and mountains of the big bend
the term six flags over texas refers to several nations that have ruled over the territory spain was the first european country to claim the area of texas france held a short-lived colony in texas mexico controlled the territory until 1836 when texas won its independence becoming an independent republic in 1845 texas joined the united states as the 28th state the state's annexation set off a chain of events that caused the mexicanamerican war in 1846 a slave state texas declared its secession from the united states in early 1861 and officially joined the confederate states of america on march 2 of the same year after the consequent civil war and the restoration of its representation in the federal government texas entered a long period of economic stagnation
one texas industry that thrived after the civil war was cattle due to its long history as a center of the industry texas is associated with the image of the cowboy the state's economic fortunes changed in the early 20th century when oil discoveries initiated an economic boom in the state with strong investments in universities texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid-20th century as of 2010 it shares the top of the list of the most fortune 500 companies with california at 57 with a growing base of industry the state leads in many industries including agriculture petrochemicals energy computers and electronics aerospace and biomedical sciences texas has led the nation in export revenue since 2002 and has the second-highest gross state product
== etymologyedit ==
the name texas based on the caddo word tejas meaning friends or allies was applied by the spanish to the caddo themselves and to the region of their settlement in east texas
during spanish colonial rule the area was officially known as the nuevo reino de filipinas la provincia de texas
== geographyedit ==
texas is the second largest u.s state behind alaska with an area of 268,820 square miles (696,200 km2) though 10 percent larger than france and almost twice as large as germany or japan it ranks only 27th worldwide amongst country subdivisions by size if it were still an independent country texas would be the 40th largest behind chile and zambia
texas is in the south central part of the united states of america three of its borders are defined by rivers the rio grande forms a natural border with the mexican states of chihuahua coahuila nuevo len and tamaulipas to the south the red river forms a natural border with oklahoma and arkansas to the north the sabine river forms a natural border with louisiana to the east the texas panhandle has an eastern border with oklahoma at 100 w a northern border with oklahoma at 3630 n and a western border with new mexico at 103 w el paso lies on the state's western tip at 32 n and the rio grande
with 10 climatic regions 14 soil regions and 11 distinct ecological regions regional classification becomes problematic with differences in soils topography geology rainfall and plant and animal communities one classification system divides texas in order from southeast to west into the following gulf coastal plains interior lowlands great plains and basin and range province
the gulf coastal plains region wraps around the gulf of mexico on the southeast section of the state vegetation in this region consists of thick piney woods the interior lowlands region consists of gently rolling to hilly forested land and is part of a larger pine-hardwood forest
the great plains region in central texas is located in spans through the state's panhandle and llano estacado to the state's hill country near austin this region is dominated by prairie and steppe far west texas or the trans-pecos region is the state's basin and range province the most varied of the regions this area includes sand hills the stockton plateau desert valleys wooded mountain slopes and desert grasslands
texas has 3,700 named streams and 15 major rivers with the rio grande as the largest other major rivers include the pecos the brazos colorado and red river while texas has few natural lakes texans have built over 100 artificial reservoirs
the size and unique history of texas make its regional affiliation debatable it can be fairly considered a southern or a southwestern state or both the vast geographic economic and cultural diversity within the state itself prohibits easy categorization of the whole state into a recognized region of the united states notable extremes range from east texas which is often considered an extension of the deep south to far west texas which is generally acknowledged to be part of the interior southwest
=== geologyedit ===
texas is the southernmost part of the great plains which ends in the south against the folded sierra madre occidental of mexico the continental crust forms a stable mesoproterozoic craton which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the gulf of mexico the oldest rocks in texas date from the mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old
these precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks underlie most of the state and are exposed in three places llano uplift van horn and the franklin mountains near el paso sedimentary rocks overlay most of these ancient rocks the oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin or passive margin that developed during cambrian time
this margin existed until laurasia and gondwana collided in the pennsylvanian subperiod to form pangea this is the buried crest of the appalachian mountainsouachita mountains zone of pennsylvanian continental collision this orogenic crest is today buried beneath the dallaswacoaustinsan antonio trend
the late paleozoic mountains collapsed as rifting in the jurassic period began to open the gulf of mexico pangea began to break up in the triassic but seafloor spreading to form the gulf of mexico occurred only in the mid and late jurassic the shoreline shifted again to the eastern margin of the state and the gulf of mexico passive margin began to form today 9 to 12 miles (14 to 19 km) of sediments are buried beneath the texas continental shelf and a large proportion of remaining us oil reserves are located here at the start of its formation the incipient gulf of mexico basin was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of jurassic age these salt deposits formed salt dome diapirs and are found in east texas along the gulf coast
east texas outcrops consist of cretaceous and paleogene sediments which contain important deposits of eocene lignite the mississippian and pennsylvanian sediments in the north permian sediments in the west and cretaceous sediments in the east along the gulf coast and out on the texas continental shelf contain oil oligocene volcanic rocks are found in far west texas in the big bend area a blanket of miocene sediments known as the ogallala formation in the western high plains region is an important aquifer located far from an active plate tectonic boundary texas has no volcanoes and few earthquakes
=== wildlifeedit ===
a wide range of animals and insects live in texas it is the home to 65 species of mammals 213 species of reptiles and amphibians and the greatest diversity of bird life in the united states590 native species in all at least 12 species have been introduced and now reproduce freely in texas
texas plays host to several species of wasps texas is one of the regions that has the highest abundance of polistes exclamans additionally texas has provided an important ground for the study of polistes annularis
during the spring texas wildflowers such as the state flower the bluebonnet line highways throughout texas during the johnson administration the first lady lady bird johnson worked to draw attention to texas wildflowers
== climateedit ==
the large size of texas and its location at the intersection of multiple climate zones gives the state highly variable weather the panhandle of the state has colder winters than north texas while the gulf coast has mild winters texas has wide variations in precipitation patterns el paso on the western end of the state averages 8.7 inches (220 mm) of annual rainfall while parts of southeast texas average as much as 64 inches (1,600 mm) per year dallas in the north central region averages a more moderate 37 inches (940 mm) per year
snow falls multiple times each winter in the panhandle and mountainous areas of west texas once or twice a year in north texas and once every few years in central and east texas snow only falls south of san antonio or on the coast except in rare circumstances of note is the 2004 christmas eve snowstorm when 6 inches (150 mm) of snow fell as far south as kingsville where the average high temperature in december is 65 f
maximum temperatures in the summer months average from the 80s f (26 c) in the mountains of west texas and on galveston island to around 100 f (38 c) in the rio grande valley but most areas of texas see consistent summer high temperatures in the 90 f (32 c) range
night-time summer temperatures range from the upper 50s f (14 c) in the west texas mountains to 80 f (27 c) in galveston
the table below consists of averages for august (generally the warmest month) and january (generally the coldest) in selected cities in various regions of the state el paso and amarillo are exceptions with july and december respectively being the warmest and coldest months respectively but with august and january only being narrowly different
=== stormsedit ===
thunderstorms strike texas often especially the eastern and northern portions of the state tornado alley covers the northern section of texas the state experiences the most tornadoes in the united states an average of 139 a year these strike most frequently in north texas and the panhandle tornadoes in texas generally occur in the months of april may and june
some of the most destructive hurricanes in u.s history have impacted texas a hurricane in 1875 killed about 400 people in indianola followed by another hurricane in 1886 that destroyed the town these events allowed galveston to take over as the chief port city the 1900 galveston hurricane subsequently devastated that city killing about 8,000 people or possibly as many as 12,000 this makes it the deadliest natural disaster in u.s history
other devastating texas hurricanes include the 1915 galveston hurricane hurricane audrey in 1957 which killed over 600 people hurricane carla in 1961 hurricane beulah in 1967 hurricane alicia in 1983 hurricane rita in 2005 and hurricane ike in 2008 tropical storms have also caused their share of damage allison in 1989 and again during 2001 and claudette in 1979 among them
=== greenhouse gasesedit ===
texas emits the most greenhouse gases in the u.s the state emits nearly 1.5 trillion pounds (680 billion kg) of carbon dioxide annually as an independent nation texas would rank as the world's seventh-largest producer of greenhouse gases causes of the state's vast greenhouse gas emissions include the state's large number of coal power plants and the state's refining and manufacturing industries in 2010 there were 2,553 emission events which poured 44.6 million pounds of contaminants into the texas sky
== historyedit ==
=== pre-european eraedit ===
texas lies between two major cultural spheres of pre-columbian north america the southwestern and the plains areas archaeologists have found that three major indigenous cultures lived in this territory and reached their developmental peak before the first european contact these were
the pueblo from the upper rio grande region centered west of texas
the mississippian culture also known as mound builders which extended along the mississippi river valley east of texas and
the civilizations of mesoamerica centered south of texas influence of teotihuacan in northern mexico peaked around ad 500 and declined over the 8th to 10th centuries
no culture was dominant in the present-day texas region and many peoples inhabited the area native american tribes that lived inside the boundaries of present-day texas include the alabama apache atakapan bidai caddo coahuiltecan comanche choctaw coushatta hasinai jumano karankawa kickapoo kiowa tonkawa and wichita the name texas derives from tysha a word in the caddoan language of the hasinai which means friends or allies
whether a native american tribe was friendly or warlike was critical to the fates of european explorers and settlers in that land friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops prepare foods and hunt wild game warlike tribes made life difficult and dangerous for europeans through their attacks and resistance to the newcomers
=== colonizationedit ===
the first historical document related to texas was a map of the gulf coast created in 1519 by spanish explorer alonso lvarez de pineda nine years later shipwrecked spanish explorer lvar nez cabeza de vaca and his cohort became the first europeans in what is now texas cabeza de vaca reported that in 1528 when the spanish landed in the area half the natives died from a disease of the bowels and blamed us. cabeza de vaca also made observations about the way of life of the ignaces natives of texas they went about with a firebrand setting fire to the plains and timber so as to drive off the mosquitos and also to get lizards and similar things which they eat to come out of the soil in the same manner they kill deer encircling them with fires and they do it also to deprive the animals of pasture compelling them to go for food where the indians want.
francisco vzquez de coronado describes his 1541 encounter with two kinds of people travel around these plains with the cows one is called querechos and the others teyas they are very well built and painted and are enemies of each other they have no other settlement or location than comes from traveling around with the cows they kill all of these they wish and tan the hides with which they clothe themselves and make their tents and they eat the flesh sometimes even raw and they also even drink the blood when thirsty the tents they make are like field tents and they set them up over some poles they have made for this purpose which come together and are tied at the top and when they go from one place to another they carry them on some dogs they have of which they have many and they load them with the tents and poles and other things for the country is so level as i said that they can make use of these because they carry the poles dragging along on the ground the sun is what they worship most.
european powers ignored the area until accidentally settling there in 1685 miscalculations by ren-robert cavelier de la salle resulted in his establishing the colony of fort saint louis at matagorda bay rather than along the mississippi river the colony lasted only four years before succumbing to harsh conditions and hostile natives
in 1690 spanish authorities concerned that france posed competitive threat constructed several missions in east texas after native american resistance the spanish missionaries returned to mexico when france began settling louisiana mostly in the southern part of the state in 1716 spanish authorities responded by founding a new series of missions in east texas two years later they created san antonio as the first spanish civilian settlement in the area
hostile native tribes and distance from nearby spanish colonies discouraged settlers from moving to the area it was one of new spain's least populated provinces in 1749 the spanish peace treaty with the lipan apache angered many tribes including the comanche tonkawa and hasinai the comanche signed a treaty with spain in 1785 and later helped to defeat the lipan apache and karankawa tribes with more numerous missions being established priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes by the end of the 18th century only a few nomadic tribes had not converted to christianity
when the united states purchased louisiana from france in 1803 american authorities insisted that the agreement also included texas the boundary between new spain and the united states was finally set at the sabine river in 1819 at what is now the border between texas and louisiana eager for new land many united states settlers refused to recognize the agreement several filibusters raised armies to invade the area west of the sabine river in 1821 the mexican war of independence included the texas territory which became part of mexico due to its low population mexico made the area part of the state of coahuila y tejas
hoping that more settlers would reduce the near-constant comanche raids mexican texas liberalized its immigration policies to permit immigrants from outside mexico and spain under the mexican immigration system large swathes of land were allotted to empresarios who recruited settlers from the united states europe and the mexican interior the first grant to moses austin was passed to his son stephen f austin after his death
austin's settlers the old three hundred made places along the brazos river in 1822 twenty-three other empresarios brought settlers to the state the majority of whom were from the united states the population of texas grew rapidly in 1825 texas had about 3,500 people with most of mexican descent by 1834 the population had grown to about 37,800 people with only 7,800 of mexican descent
many immigrants openly flouted mexican law especially the prohibition against slavery combined with united states attempts to purchase texas mexican authorities decided in 1830 to prohibit continued immigration from the united states new laws also called for the enforcement of customs duties angering both native mexican citizens (tejanos) and recent immigrants
the anahuac disturbances in 1832 were the first open revolt against mexican rule and they coincided with a revolt in mexico against the nation's president texians sided with the federalists against the current government and drove all mexican soldiers out of east texas they took advantage of the lack of oversight to agitate for more political freedom texians met at the convention of 1832 to discuss requesting independent statehood among other issues the following year texians reiterated their demands at the convention of 1833
=== republicedit ===
within mexico tensions continued between federalists and centralists in early 1835 wary texians formed committees of correspondence and safety the unrest erupted into armed conflict in late 1835 at the battle of gonzales this launched the texas revolution and over the next two months the texians defeated all mexican troops in the region texians elected delegates to the consultation which created a provisional government the provisional government soon collapsed from infighting and texas was without clear governance for the first two months of 1836
during this time of political turmoil mexican president antonio lpez de santa anna personally led an army to end the revolt the mexican expedition was initially successful general jos de urrea defeated all the texian resistance along the coast culminating in the goliad massacre santa anna's forces after a thirteen-day siege overwhelmed texian defenders at the battle of the alamo news of the defeats sparked panic amongst texas settlers
the newly elected texian delegates to the convention of 1836 quickly signed a declaration of independence on march 2 forming the republic of texas after electing interim officers the convention disbanded the new government joined the other settlers in texas in the runaway scrape fleeing from the approaching mexican army after several weeks of retreat the texian army commanded by sam houston attacked and defeated santa anna's forces at the battle of san jacinto santa anna was captured and forced to sign the treaties of velasco ending the war
while texas had won their independence political battles raged between two factions of the new republic the nationalist faction led by mirabeau b lamar advocated the continued independence of texas the expulsion of the native americans and the expansion of the republic to the pacific ocean their opponents led by sam houston advocated the annexation of texas to the united states and peaceful co-existence with native americans the conflict between the factions was typified by an incident known as the texas archive war
mexico launched two small expeditions into texas in 1842 the town of san antonio was captured twice and texans were defeated in battle in the dawson massacre despite these successes mexico did not keep an occupying force in texas and the republic survived the republic's inability to defend itself added momentum to texas's eventual annexation into the united states
=== statehoodedit ===
as early as 1837 the republic made several attempts to negotiate annexation with the united states opposition within the republic from the nationalist faction along with strong abolitionist opposition within the united states slowed texas's admission into the union texas was finally annexed when the expansionist james k polk won the election of 1844 on december 29 1845 congress admitted texas to the u.s as a constituent state of the union
after texas's annexation mexico broke diplomatic relations with the united states while the united states claimed that texas's border stretched to the rio grande mexico claimed it was the nueces river while the former republic of texas could not enforce its border claims the united states had the military strength and the political will to do so president polk ordered general zachary taylor south to the rio grande on january 13 1846 a few months later mexican troops routed an american cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the thornton affair starting the mexicanamerican war the first battles of the war were fought in texas the siege of fort texas battle of palo alto and battle of resaca de la palma after these decisive victories the united states invaded mexican territory ending the fighting in texas
after a series of united states victories the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo ended the two-year war in return for us$18,250,000 mexico gave the u.s undisputed control of texas ceded the mexican cession in 1848 most of which today is called the american southwest and texas's borders were established at the rio grande
the compromise of 1850 set texas's boundaries at their present form u.s senator james pearce of maryland drafted the final proposal where texas ceded its claims to land which later became half of present-day new mexico a third of colorado and small portions of kansas oklahoma and wyoming to the federal government in return for the assumption of $10 million of the old republic's debt post-war texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state
they also brought or purchased enslaved african americans whose numbers tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860 from 58,000 to 182,566
=== civil war and reconstruction (18601900)edit ===
texas was at war again after the election of 1860 at this time blacks comprised 30 percent of the state's population and they were overwhelmingly enslaved when abraham lincoln was elected south carolina seceded from the union five other lower south states quickly followed a state convention considering secession opened in austin on january 28 1861 on february 1 by a vote of 1668 the convention adopted an ordinance of secession from the united states texas voters approved this ordinance on february 23 1861 texas joined the newly created confederate states of america on march 4 1861 ratifying the permanent c.s constitution on march 23
not all texans favored secession initially although many of the same would later support the southern cause texas's most notable unionist was the state governor sam houston not wanting to aggravate the situation houston refused two offers from president lincoln for union troops to keep him in office after refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the confederacy houston was deposed as governor
while far from the major battlefields of the american civil war texas contributed large numbers of men and equipment to the rest of the confederacy union troops briefly occupied the state's primary port galveston texas's border with mexico was known as the backdoor of the confederacy because trade occurred at the border bypassing the union blockade the confederacy repulsed all union attempts to shut down this route but texas's role as a supply state was marginalized in mid-1863 after the union capture of the mississippi river the final battle of the civil war was fought near brownsville texas at palmito ranch with a confederate victory
texas descended into anarchy for two months between the surrender of the army of northern virginia and the assumption of authority by union general gordon granger violence marked the early months of reconstruction juneteenth commemorates the announcement of the emancipation proclamation in galveston by general gordon granger almost two and a half years after the original announcement president johnson in 1866 declared the civilian government restored in texas despite not meeting reconstruction requirements congress resumed allowing elected texas representatives into the federal government in 1870 social volatility continued as the state struggled with agricultural depression and labor issues
=== 20th century to presentedit ===
in 1900 texas received the deadliest natural disaster in u.s history during the galveston hurricane on january 10 1901 the first major oil well in texas spindletop was found south of beaumont other fields were later discovered nearby in east texas west texas and under the gulf of mexico the resulting oil boom transformed texas oil production eventually averaged three million barrels per day at its peak in 1972
in 1901 the democratic-dominated state legislature passed a bill requiring payment of a poll tax for voting which effectively disenfranchised most blacks many poor whites and latinos establishing white primaries ensured minorities were excluded from the formal political process the number of voters dropped dramatically and the democrats crushed competition from the republican and populist parties
the great depression and the dust bowl dealt a double blow to the state's economy which had significantly improved since the civil war migrants abandoned the worst hit sections of texas during the dust bowl years especially from this period on blacks left texas in the great migration to get work in the northern united states or california and to escape the oppression of segregation in 1940 texas was 74 percent anglo 14.4 percent black and 11.5 percent hispanic
world war ii had a dramatic impact on texas as federal money poured in to build military bases munitions factories pow detention camps and army hospitals 750,000 young men left for service the cities exploded with new industry the colleges took on new roles and hundreds of thousands of poor farmers left for much better paying war jobs never to return to agriculture texas manufactured 3.1 percent of total united states military armaments produced during world war ii ranking eleventh among the 48 states
texas modernized and expanded its system of higher education through the 1960s the state created a comprehensive plan for higher education funded in large part by oil revenues and a central state apparatus designed to manage state institutions more efficiently these changes helped texas universities receive federal research funds
on november 22 1963 president john f kennedy was assassinated in dallas
== government and politicsedit ==
the current texas constitution was adopted in 1876 like many states it explicitly provides for a separation of powers the state's bill of rights is much larger than its federal counterpart and has provisions unique to texas
=== state governmentedit ===
texas has a plural executive branch system limiting the power of the governor which is a weak executive compared to some other states except for the secretary of state voters elect executive officers independently thus candidates are directly answerable to the public not the governor this election system has led to some executive branches split between parties and reduced the ability of the governor to carry out a program when republican president george w bush served as texas's governor the state had a democratic lieutenant governor bob bullock the executive branch positions consist of the governor lieutenant governor comptroller of public accounts land commissioner attorney general agriculture commissioner the three-member texas railroad commission the state board of education and the secretary of state
the bicameral texas legislature consists of the house of representatives with 150 members and a senate with 31 members the speaker of the house leads the house and the lieutenant governor the senate the legislature meets in regular session biennially for just over 100 days but the governor can call for special sessions as often as desired (notably the legislature cannot call itself into session) the state's fiscal year spans from the previous calendar year's september 1 to the current year's august 31 thus the fy 2015 dates from september 1 2014 through august 31 2015
the judiciary of texas is one of the most complex in the united states with many layers and overlapping jurisdictions texas has two courts of last resort the texas supreme court for civil cases and the texas court of criminal appeals except for some municipal benches partisan elections select judges at all levels of the judiciary the governor fills vacancies by appointment texas is notable for its use of capital punishment having led the country in executions since capital punishment was reinstated in the gregg v georgia case (see capital punishment in texas)
the texas ranger division of the texas department of public safety is a law enforcement agency with statewide jurisdiction over the years the texas rangers have investigated crimes ranging from murder to political corruption they have acted as riot police and as detectives protected the texas governor tracked down fugitives and functioned as a paramilitary force both for the republic and the state the texas rangers were unofficially created by stephen f austin in 1823 and formally constituted in 1835 the rangers were integral to several important events of texas history and some of the best-known criminal cases in the history of the old west
the texas constitution defines the responsibilities of county governments which serve as agents of the state what are called commissioners court and court judges are elected to serve as the administrative arm most cities in the state those over 5,000 in population have home-rule governments the vast majority of these have charters for council-manager forms of government by which voters elect council members who hire a professional city manager as operating officer
=== politicsedit ===
in the 1870s white democrats wrested power back in the state legislature from the biracial coalition at the end of reconstruction in the early 20th century the legislature passed bills to impose poll taxes followed by white primaries these measures effectively disfranchised most blacks poor whites and mexican americans in the 1890s 100,000 blacks voted in the state by 1906 only 5,000 could vote as a result the democratic party dominated texas politics from the end of reconstruction until after passage in the mid-1960s of the civil rights legislation enforcing constitutional rights establishing segregation and white supremacy the state's conservative voters had begun to support republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century after this period they supported republicans for local and state offices as well and most whites have become republican party members the party has attracted some minorities but many have continued to vote for democratic candidates
the texas political atmosphere leans towards fiscal and social conservatism since 1980 most texas voters have supported republican presidential candidates in 2000 and 2004 republican george w bush won texas with 60.1 percent of the vote partly due to his favorite son status as a former governor of the state john mccain won the state in 2008 but with a smaller margin of victory compared to bush at 55 percent of the vote austin dallas houston and san antonio consistently lean democratic in both local and statewide elections
counties along the rio grande next to the mexican border generally vote for democrats while most rural and suburban areas of texas vote republican
the 2003 texas redistricting of congressional districts led by the republican tom delay was called by the new york times an extreme case of partisan gerrymandering a group of democratic legislators the texas eleven fled the state in a quorum-busting effort to prevent the legislature from acting but was unsuccessful the state had already redistricted following the 2000 census despite these efforts the legislature passed a map heavily in favor of republicans but ignoring nearly one million new residents in the state career people at the department of justice objected to the plan as diluting the votes of african american and hispanic voters but political appointees overrode them legal challenges to the redistricting reached the national supreme court in the case league of united latin american citizens v perry but the 2006 ruling went in the republicans favor
as of the general elections of 2014 a large majority of the members of texas's u.s house delegation are republican along with both u.s senators in the 114th united states congress of the 36 congressional districts in texas 25 are held by republicans and 11 by democrats texas's senators are john cornyn and ted cruz since 1994 texans have not elected a democrat to a statewide office the state's democratic presence comes primarily from some minority groups in east texas and south texas as well as urban voters particularly in austin san antonio dallas houston beaumont and el paso
=== administrative divisionsedit ===
texas has 254 counties the most nationwide each county runs on commissioners court system consisting of four elected commissioners (one from each of four precincts in the county roughly divided according to population) and a county judge elected at large from the entire county county government runs similar to a weak mayor-council system the county judge has no veto authority but votes along with the other commissioners
although texas permits cities and counties to enter interlocal agreements to share services the state does not allow consolidated city-county governments nor does it have metropolitan governments counties are not granted home rule status their powers are strictly defined by state law the state does not have townships areas within a county are either incorporated or unincorporated incorporated areas are part of a municipality the county provides limited services to unincorporated areas and to some smaller incorporated areas municipalities are classified either general law cities or home rule a municipality may elect home rule status once it exceeds 5,000 population with voter approval
texas also permits the creation of special districts which provide limited services the most common is the school district but can also include hospital districts community college districts and utility districts (one utility district located near austin was the plaintiff in a landmark supreme court case involving the voting rights act)
