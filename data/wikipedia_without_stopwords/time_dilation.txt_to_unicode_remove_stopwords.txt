theory make clearer example time dilation could affect planned meetings astronauts advanced technologies greater travel speeds astronauts would set clocks count exactly years whereas mission control back earth might need count years astronauts would return earth mission aged one year less people staying earth local experience time passing never actually changes anyone words astronauts ship well mission control crew earth feel normal despite effects time dilation ie traveling party stationary living faster stood still counterparts motion live slower given moment
technology limiting velocities astronauts differences minuscule months international space station iss astronaut crew indeed aged less earth seconds nowhere near year disparity theoretical example effects would greater astronauts traveling nearer speed light ms instead actual speed speed orbiting iss ms
time dilation caused differences either gravity relative velocity case iss time slower due velocity circular orbit effect slightly reduced opposing effect less gravitational potential
relative velocity time dilation
two observers relative uniform motion uninfluenced gravitational mass point view others moving clock ticking slower rate local clock faster relative velocity greater magnitude time dilation case sometimes called special relativistic time dilation
instance two rocket ships b speeding past one another space would experience time dilation somehow clear view others ships crew would see others clocks movement going slowly inside frame reference ship everything moving normally everything ship b appears moving slowly vice versa
local perspective time registered clocks rest respect local frame reference far gravitational mass always appears pass rate words new ship ship c travels alongside ship rest relative ship point view ship new ship cs time would appear normal
question arises ship ship b think others time moving slower aged decided meet sophisticated understanding relative velocity time dilation seeming twin paradox turns paradox resolution paradox involves jump time result accelerated observer turning around similarly understanding twin paradox would help explain astronauts iss age slower eg seconds behind every six months even though experiencing relative velocity time dilation
gravitational time dilation
gravitational time dilation play iss astronauts opposite effect relative velocity time dilation simplify relative velocity gravity slow time increase velocity increased astronauts slowing time whereas gravity decreased speeding time astronauts experiencing less gravity earth nevertheless iss astronaut crew ultimately end slower time two opposing effects equally strong velocity time dilation explained making bigger difference slowing time timespeeding effects lowgravity would cancel timeslowing effects velocity unless iss orbited much farther earth
