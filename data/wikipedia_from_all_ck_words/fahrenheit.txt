fahrenheit (symbol f) is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by the german physicist daniel gabriel fahrenheit (16861736) after whom the scale is named there exist several accounts of how he originally defined his scale the lower defining point 0 degrees was established as the temperature of a solution of brine made from equal parts of ice and salt further limits were established as the melting point of water (32 degrees) and his best estimate of the average human body temperature (96 degrees about 2-1/2 degrees less than modern measurements) the scale is now usually defined by two fixed points the temperature at which water freezes into ice is defined as 32 degrees and the boiling point of water is defined to be 212 degrees a 180-degree separation as defined at sea level and standard atmospheric pressure
by the end of the 20th century fahrenheit was only used as the official temperature scale in the united states the bahamas belize the cayman islands and palau as well as being the most common unofficial scale in many of the current and former us unincorporated territories all other countries in the world now use the celsius scale defined since 1954 by absolute zero being -273.15 and the triple point of specially prepared water being at 0.01
== definition and conversions ==
on the fahrenheit scale the freezing point of water is 32 degrees fahrenheit (f) and the boiling point is 212 f (at standard atmospheric pressure) this puts the boiling and freezing points of water exactly 180 degrees apart therefore a degree on the fahrenheit scale is 1180 of the interval between the freezing point and the boiling point on the celsius scale the freezing and boiling points of water are 100 degrees apart a temperature interval of 1 f is equal to an interval of 59 degrees celsius the fahrenheit and celsius scales intersect at 40 (40 f and 40 c represent the same temperature)
absolute zero is 273.15 c or 459.67 f the rankine temperature scale uses degree intervals of the same size as those of the fahrenheit scale except that absolute zero is 0 rthe same way that the kelvin temperature scale matches the celsius scale except that absolute zero is 0 k
the fahrenheit scale uses the symbol to denote a point on the temperature scale (as does celsius) and the letter f to indicate the use of the fahrenheit scale (e.g gallium melts at 85.5763 f") as well as to denote a difference between temperatures or an uncertainty in temperature (e.g the output of the heat exchanger experiences an increase of 72 f and our standard uncertainty is 5 f")
for an exact conversion the following formulas can be applied
fahrenheit to celsius  (f 32) 1.8 =c
celsius to fahrenheit  (c 1.8) + 32 =f
an approximate conversion between degrees celsius and degrees fahrenheit is as follows
fahrenheit to celsius subtract 30 and halve the resulting number
celsius to fahrenheit double the number and add 30
this formula gives an answer correct to within 2.8 c from 1 f to 100 f and is exact at 50 f (calculations below)
((1 - 30) 2) - ((1 - 32) 1.8) = 2.72
((50 - 30) 2) - ((50 - 32) 1.8) = 0
((100 - 30) 2) - ((100 - 32) 1.8) = 2.77
== history ==
fahrenheit proposed his temperature scale in 1724 basing it on three reference points of temperature in his initial scale (which is not the final fahrenheit scale) the zero point is determined by placing the thermometer in brine he used a mixture of ice water and ammonium chloride a salt at a 1:1:1 ratio this is a frigorific mixture which stabilizes its temperature automatically that stable temperature was defined as 0 f (17.78 c) the second point at 32 degrees was a mixture of ice and water without the ammonium chloride at a 1:1 ratio the third point 96 degrees was approximately the human body temperature then called blood-heat
according to a story and trivia questions in germany fahrenheit actually chose the lowest air temperature measured in his hometown danzig in winter 1708/09 as 0 f and only later had the need to be able to make this value reproducible using brine this is one explanation given why 0 f is 17.78 c but the ammonium chloride cooling temperature actually is 3 c whereas that of nacl is 21.1 c the other explanation is that he did not have a good enough brine solution to obtain the eutectic equilibrium exactly (i.e he might have had a mixture of salts or it had not fully dissolved) in any case the definition of the fahrenheit scale has changed since
according to a letter fahrenheit wrote to his friend herman boerhaave his scale was built on the work of ole rmer whom he had met earlier in rmer's scale brine freezes at zero water freezes and melts at 7.5 degrees body temperature is 22.5 and water boils at 60 degrees fahrenheit multiplied each value by four in order to eliminate fractions and increase the granularity of the scale he then re-calibrated his scale using the melting point of ice and normal human body temperature (which were at 30 and 90 degrees) he adjusted the scale so that the melting point of ice would be 32 degrees and body temperature 96 degrees so that 64 intervals would separate the two allowing him to mark degree lines on his instruments by simply bisecting the interval six times (since 64 is 2 to the sixth power)
fahrenheit observed that water boils at about 212 degrees using this scale later other scientists decided to redefine the scale slightly to make the freezing point exactly 32 f and the boiling point exactly 212 f or 180 degrees higher it is for this reason that normal human body temperature is approximately 98 (oral temperature) on the revised scale (whereas it was 90 on fahrenheit's multiplication of rmer and 96 on his original scale)
the rankine temperature scale was based upon the fahrenheit temperature scale with its zero representing absolute zero instead
== usage ==
the fahrenheit scale was the primary temperature standard for climatic industrial and medical purposes in english-speaking countries until the 1960s in the late 1960s and 1970s the celsius scale replaced fahrenheit in almost all of those countrieswith the notable exception of the united statestypically during their metrication process
fahrenheit is used in the bahamas belize the cayman islands palau and the united states and associated territories of american samoa and the u.s virgin islands for everyday applications (although puerto rico and guam use celsius alongside fahrenheit as well) for example u.s weather forecasts food cooking and freezing temperatures are typically given in degrees fahrenheit scientists such as meteorologists use celsius or kelvin in all countries
early in the twentieth century halsey and dale suggested that the resistance to the use of centigrade (now celsius) system in the u.s included the larger size of each degree celsius and the lower zero point in the fahrenheit system
canada has passed legislation favoring the international system of units while also maintaining legal definitions for traditional canadian imperial units canadian weather reports are conveyed using degrees celsius with occasional reference to fahrenheit especially for cross-border broadcasts virtually all canadian ovens make legal use of the fahrenheit scale thermometers both digital and analog sold in canada usually employ both the celsius and fahrenheit scales also in some instances (swimming pool temperature or cooking temperatures for example) temperatures are still expressed in fahrenheit
within the european union it is mandatory to use kelvins or degrees celsius when quoting temperature for economic public health public safety and administrative purposes though degrees fahrenheit may be used alongside degrees celsius as a supplementary unit for example the laundry symbols used in the united kingdom follow the recommendations of iso 3758:2005 showing the temperature of the washing machine water in degrees celsius only the equivalent label in north america uses one to six dots to denote temperature with an optional temperature in degrees celsius
within the unregulated sector such as journalism the use of fahrenheit in the united kingdom follows no fixed pattern with degrees fahrenheit often appearing alongside degrees celsius the daily mail on its daily weather page quotes celsius first followed by fahrenheit in brackets the daily telegraph does not mention fahrenheit on its daily weather page while the times also has an all-metric daily weather page but has a celsius-to-fahrenheit conversion table when publishing news stories much of the uk press adopted a convention of using degrees celsius in headlines relating to low temperatures and fahrenheit for high temperatures in february 2006 the writer of an article in the times suggested that the rationale was one of emphasis 6 c sounds colder than 21 f and 94 f sounds more impressive than 34 c
== unicode representation of symbol ==
unicode provides the fahrenheit symbol at codepoint u+2109 degree fahrenheit however this is a compatibility character encoded for roundtrip compatibility with legacy encodings the unicode standard explicitly discourages the use of this character the sequence u+00b0 degree sign + u+0046 f latin capital letter f is preferred over u+2109 degree fahrenheit and those two sequences should be treated as identical for searching.
