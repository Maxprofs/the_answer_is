a hammer is a tool that delivers a blow (a sudden impact) to an object most hammers are hand tools used to drive nails fit parts forge metal and break apart objects hammers vary in shape size and structure depending on their purposes
hammers are basic tools in many trades the usual features are a head (most often made of steel) and a handle (also called a helve or haft) most hammers are hand tools but there are also many powered versions called power hammers (such as steam hammers and trip hammers) for heavier uses such as forging
some hammers have other names such as sledgehammer mallet and gavel the term hammer also applies to some other devices that deliver blows such as the hammer of a firearm or the hammer of a piano
== history ==
the use of simple hammers dates to about 2,600,000 bce when various shaped stones were used to strike wood bone or other stones to break them apart and shape them stones attached to sticks with strips of leather or animal sinew were being used as hammers with handles by about 30,000 bce during the middle of the paleolithic stone age
the hammer's archeological record shows that it may be the oldest tool for which definite evidence exists of its early existence
== construction and materials ==
a traditional hand-held hammer consists of a separate head and a handle fastened together by means of a special wedge made for the purpose or by glue or both this two-piece design is often used to combine a dense metallic striking head with a non-metallic mechanical-shock-absorbing handle (to reduce user fatigue from repeated strikes) if wood is used for the handle it is often hickory or ash which are tough and long-lasting materials that can dissipate shock waves from the hammer head rigid fiberglass resin may be used for the handle this material does not absorb water or decay but does not dissipate shock as well as wood
a loose hammer head is hazardous because it can literally fly off the handle when in use becoming a dangerous uncontrolled missile wooden handles can often be replaced when worn or damaged special kits are available covering a range of handle sizes and designs plus special wedges for attachment
some hammers are one-piece designs made primarily of a single material a one-piece metallic hammer may optionally have its handle coated or wrapped in a resilient material such as rubber for improved grip and reduced user fatigue
the hammer head may be surfaced with a variety of materials including brass bronze wood plastic rubber or leather some hammers have interchangeable striking surfaces which can be selected as needed or replaced when worn out
== designs and variations ==
a large hammer-like tool is a maul (commander beetle) a wood or rubber headed hammer is a mallet and a hammer-like tool with a cutting blade is usually called a hatchet the essential part of a hammer is the head a compact solid mass that is able to deliver the blow to the intended target without itself deforming the opposite side may have a ball shape as in the ball-peen hammer some upholstery hammers have a magnetized face to pick up tacks in the hatchet the hammer head is secondary to the cutting edge of the tool
the impact between steel hammer heads and the objects being hit can create sparks which may ignite flammable or explosive gases these are a hazard in some industries such as underground coal mining (methane gas) or in other hazardous environments such as petroleum refineries and chemical plants in these environments a variety of non-sparking metal tools are used primarily aluminium or beryllium copper hammers in recent years the handles have been made of durable plastic or rubber though wood is still widely used
=== hand-powered hammers ===
ball-peen hammer or mechanic's hammer

cross-peen hammer having one round face and one wedge-peen face
dead blow hammer delivers impact with very little recoil often due to a hollow head filled with lead shot or pellets
drilling hammer a short handled sledgehammer originally used for drilling in rock with a chisel the name usually refers to a hammer with a 2-to-4-pound (0.91 to 1.81 kg) head and a 10-inch (250 mm) handle also called a single-jack hammer because it was used by one person drilling holding the chisel in one hand and the hammer in the other in modern usage the term is mostly interchangeable with engineer's hammer although it can indicate a version with a slightly shorter handle
engineer's hammer a short-handled hammer originally an essential components of a railroad engineer's toolkit for working on steam locomotives typical weight is 24 lbs (0.91.8 kg) with a 1214 inch (3035 cm) handle originally these were often cross-peen hammers with one round face and one wedge-peen face but in modern usage the term primarily refers to hammers with two round faces

== physics of hammering ==
=== hammer as a force amplifier ===
a hammer is basically a force amplifier that works by converting mechanical work into kinetic energy and back
in the swing that precedes each blow the hammer head stores a certain amount of kinetic energyequal to the length d of the swing times the force f produced by the muscles of the arm and by gravity when the hammer strikes the head is stopped by an opposite force coming from the target equal and opposite to the force applied by the head to the target if the target is a hard and heavy object or if it is resting on some sort of anvil the head can travel only a very short distance d before stopping since the stopping force f times that distance must be equal to the head's kinetic energy it follows that f is much greater than the original driving force froughly by a factor d/d in this way great strength is not needed to produce a force strong enough to bend steel or crack the hardest stone
=== effect of the head's mass ===
the amount of energy delivered to the target by the hammer-blow is equivalent to one half the mass of the head times the square of the head's speed at the time of impact () while the energy delivered to the target increases linearly with mass it increases quadratically with the speed (see the effect of the handle below) high tech titanium heads are lighter and allow for longer handles thus increasing velocity and delivering more energy with less arm fatigue than that of a steel head hammer of the same weight
as hammers must be used in many circumstances where the position of the person using them cannot be taken for granted trade-offs are made for the sake of practicality in areas where one has plenty of room a long handle with a heavy head (like a sledge hammer) can deliver the maximum amount of energy to the target it is not practical to use such a large hammer for all tasks however and thus the overall design has been modified repeatedly to achieve the optimum utility in a wide variety of situations
=== effect of the handle ===
the handle of the hammer helps in several ways it keeps the user's hands away from the point of impact it provides a broad area that is better-suited for gripping by the hand most importantly it allows the user to maximize the speed of the head on each blow the primary constraint on additional handle length is the lack of space to swing the hammer this is why sledge hammers largely used in open spaces can have handles that are much longer than a standard carpenter's hammer the second most important constraint is more subtle even without considering the effects of fatigue the longer the handle the harder it is to guide the head of the hammer to its target at full speed
most designs are a compromise between practicality and energy efficiency with too long a handle the hammer is inefficient because it delivers force to the wrong place off-target with too short a handle the hammer is inefficient because it doesn't deliver enough force requiring more blows to complete a given task
modifications have also been made with respect to the effect of the hammer on the user a titanium head has about 3% recoil and can result in greater efficiency and less fatigue when compared to a steel head with up to 30% recoil handles made of shock-absorbing materials or varying angles attempt to make it easier for the user to continue to wield this age-old device even as nail guns and other powered drivers encroach on its traditional field of use
=== effect of gravity ===
gravity exerts a force on the hammer head if hammering downwards gravity increases the acceleration during the hammer stroke and increases the energy delivered with each blow if hammering upwards gravity reduces the acceleration during the hammer stroke and therefore reduces the energy delivered with each blow some hammering methods such as pile drivers rely entirely on gravity for acceleration on the down stroke
== ergonomics and injury risks ==
both manual and powered hammers can cause peripheral neuropathy or a variety of other ailments when used improperly awkward handles can cause repetitive stress injury (rsi) to hand and arm joints and uncontrolled shock waves from repeated impacts can injure nerves and the skeleton
== war hammers ==
a war hammer is a late medieval weapon of war intended for close combat action
== symbolic hammers ==
the hammer being one of the most used tools by homo sapiens has been used very much in symbols such as flags and heraldry in the middle ages it was used often in blacksmith guild logos as well as in many family symbols the hammer and pick is used as a symbol of mining
a well known symbol with a hammer in it is the hammer and sickle which was the symbol of the former soviet union and is very interlinked with communism and early socialism the hammer in this symbol represents the industrial working class (and the sickle represents the agricultural working class) the hammer is used in some coat of arms in (former) socialist countries like east germany similarly the hammer and sword symbolizes strasserism a strand of national socialism seeking to appeal to the working class
the gavel a small wooden mallet is used to symbolize a mandate to preside over a meeting or judicial proceeding and a graphic image of one is used as a symbol of legislative or judicial decision-making authority
in norse mythology thor the god of thunder and lightning wields a hammer named mjlnir many artifacts of decorative hammers have been found leading modern practitioners of this religion to often wear reproductions as a sign of their faith
