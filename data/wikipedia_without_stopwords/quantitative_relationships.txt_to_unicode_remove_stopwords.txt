social sciences quantitative research widely used psychology economics demography sociology marketing community health health human development gender political science less frequently anthropology history research mathematical sciences physics also quantitative definition though use term differs context social sciences term relates empirical methods originating philosophical positivism history statistics contrast qualitative research methods
qualitative methods produce information particular cases studied general conclusions hypotheses quantitative methods used verify hypotheses true
comprehensive analysis articles published top two american sociology journals found roughly two thirds articles used quantitative methods

quantitative research often contrasted qualitative research examination analysis interpretation observations purpose discovering underlying meanings patterns relationships including classifications types phenomena entities manner involve mathematical models approaches quantitative psychology first modeled quantitative approaches physical sciences gustav fechner work psychophysics built work ernst heinrich weber although distinction commonly drawn qualitative quantitative aspects scientific investigation argued two go hand hand example based analysis history science kuhn concludes large amounts qualitative work usually prerequisite fruitful quantification physical sciences qualitative research often used gain general sense phenomena form theories tested using quantitative research instance social sciences qualitative research methods often used gain better understanding things intentionality speech response researchee meaning persongroup say something mean kieron yeoman
although quantitative investigation world existed since people first began record events objects counted modern idea quantitative processes roots auguste comtes positivist framework positivism emphasized use scientific method observation empirically test hypotheses explaining predicting phenomena occurred positivist scholars like comte believed scientific methods rather previous spiritual explanations human behavior could advance
use statisticsedit
statistics widely used branch mathematics quantitative research outside physical sciences also finds applications within physical sciences statistical mechanics statistical methods used extensively within fields economics social sciences biology quantitative research using statistical methods starts collection data based hypothesis theory usually big sample data collected would require verification validation recording analysis take place software packages spss r typically used purpose causal relationships studied manipulating factors thought influence phenomena interest controlling variables relevant experimental outcomes field health example researchers might measure study relationship dietary intake measurable physiological effects weight loss controlling key variables exercise quantitatively based opinion surveys widely used media statistics proportion respondents favor position commonly reported opinion surveys respondents asked set structured questions responses tabulated field climate science researchers compile compare statistics temperature atmospheric concentrations carbon dioxide
empirical relationships associations also frequently studied using form general linear model nonlinear model using factor analysis fundamental principle quantitative research correlation imply causation although clive granger suggest series correlations imply degree causality principle follows fact always possible spurious relationship exists variables covariance found degree associations may examined combination continuous categorical variables using methods statistics
measurementedit
views regarding role measurement quantitative research somewhat divergent measurement often regarded means observations expressed numerically order investigate causal relations associations however argued measurement often plays important role quantitative research example kuhn argued within quantitative research results shown prove strange accepting theory based results quantitative data could prove natural phenomenon argued abnormalities interesting done process obtaining data seen

quantitative research may involve use proxies standins quantities cannot directly measured treering width example considered reliable proxy ambient environmental conditions warmth growing seasons amount rainfall although scientists cannot directly measure temperature past years treering width climate proxies used provide semiquantitative record average temperature northern hemisphere back ad used way proxy record tree ring width say reconstructs certain amount variance original record proxy may calibrated example period instrumental record determine much variation captured including whether short long term variation revealed case treering width different species different places may show less sensitivity say rainfall temperature reconstructing temperature record considerable skill selecting proxies well correlated desired variable
relationship qualitative methodsedit
physical biological sciences use either quantitative qualitative methods uncontroversial used appropriate social sciences particularly sociology social anthropology psychology use one type method matter controversy even ideology particular schools thought within discipline favouring one type method pouring scorn majority tendency throughout history social science however use eclectic approachesby combining methods qualitative methods might used understand meaning conclusions produced quantitative methods using quantitative methods possible give precise testable expression qualitative ideas combination quantitative qualitative data gathering often referred mixedmethods research
