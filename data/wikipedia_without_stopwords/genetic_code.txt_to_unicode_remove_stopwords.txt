salient features
sequence reading frame
codon defined initial nucleotide translation starts example string gggaaaccc read first position contains codons ggg aaa ccc read second position contains codons gga aac read starting third position gaa acc every sequence thus read three reading frames produce different amino acid sequence given example glylyspro glyasn gluthr respectively doublestranded dna six possible reading frames three forward orientation one strand three reverse opposite strand actual frame protein sequence translated defined start codon usually first aug codon mrna sequence
startstop codons

effect mutations
process dna replication errors occasionally occur polymerization second strand errors called mutations impact phenotype organism especially occur within protein coding sequence gene error rates usually low error every million basesdue proofreading ability dna polymerases
missense mutations nonsense mutations examples point mutations cause genetic diseases sicklecell disease thalassemia respectively clinically important missense mutations generally change properties coded amino acid residue basic acidic polar nonpolar whereas nonsense mutations result stop codon
mutations disrupt reading frame sequence indels insertions deletions nonmultiple nucleotide bases known frameshift mutations mutations usually result completely different translation original also likely cause stop codon read truncates creation protein mutations may impair function resulting protein thus rare vivo proteincoding sequences one reason inheritance frameshift mutations rare protein translated essential growth selective pressures organism faces absence functional protein may cause death organism viable frameshift mutations may result severe genetic diseases taysachs disease
although mutations change protein sequences harmful neutral mutations beneficial effect organism mutations may enable mutant organism withstand particular environmental stresses better wildtype organisms reproduce quickly cases mutation tend become common population natural selection viruses use rna genetic material rapid mutation rates advantage since viruses evolve constantly rapidly thus evade defensive responses eg human immune system large populations asexually reproducing organisms example e coli multiple beneficial mutations may cooccur phenomenon called clonal interference causes competition among mutations
