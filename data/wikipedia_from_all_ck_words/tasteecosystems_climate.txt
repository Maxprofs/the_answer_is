winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate climates between autumn and spring winter is caused by the axis of the earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from the sun different cultures define different dates as the start of winter and some use a definition based on weather when it is winter in the northern hemisphere it is summer in the southern hemisphere and vice versa in many regions winter is associated with snow and freezing temperatures the moment of winter solstice is when the sun's elevation with respect to the north or south pole is at its most negative value (that is the sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole) the earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice however and these depend on latitude due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the earth's elliptical orbit (see earliest and latest sunrise and sunset)
== etymology ==
the english word winter comes from the proto-indo-european word wend that stood for water
== cause ==
the tilt of the earth's axis relative to its orbital plane plays a big role in the weather the earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44 to the plane of its orbit and this causes different latitudes on the earth to directly face the sun as the earth moves through its orbit it is this variation that primarily brings about the seasons when it is winter in the northern hemisphere the southern hemisphere faces the sun more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the northern hemisphere conversely winter in the southern hemisphere occurs when the northern hemisphere is tilted more toward the sun from the perspective of an observer on the earth the winter sun has a lower maximum altitude in the sky than the summer sun
during winter in either hemisphere the lower altitude of the sun causes the sunlight to hit that hemisphere at an oblique angle in regions experiencing winter the same amount of solar radiation is spread out over a larger area this effect is compounded by the larger distance that the light must travel through the atmosphere allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more heat compared with these effects the changes in the distance of the earth from the sun are negligible
the manifestation of the meteorological winter (freezing temperatures) in the northerly snowprone parallels is highly variable depending on elevation position versus marine winds and the amount of precipitation a case of point is in canada which is a country normally associated with its tough winters winnipeg on the great plains at a relative distance from large bodies of water has a january high of 11.3 c (11.7 f) and a low of 21.4 c (6.5 f) in comparison vancouver on the coast with a marine influence from moderating pacific winds has a january low of 1.4 c (34.5 f) with days well above freezing at 6.9 c (44.4 f) both areas are on the 49th parallel north and in the same western half of the continent similar effects although less extreme differentials are being found in europe where the british isles do not have a single non-mountain station below freezing in mean temperatures in spite of their northerly position
== meteorological reckoning ==
meteorological winter is the method of measuring the winter season used by meteorologists based on sensible weather patterns for record keeping purposes so the start of meteorological winter varies with latitude winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures this corresponds to the months of december january and february in the northern hemisphere and june july and august in the southern hemisphere the coldest average temperatures of the season are typically experienced in january or february in the northern hemisphere and in june july or august in the southern hemisphere nighttime predominates in the winter season and in some regions winter has the highest rate of precipitation as well as prolonged dampness because of permanent snow cover or high precipitation rates coupled with low temperatures precluding evaporation blizzards often develop and cause many transportation delays diamond dust also known as ice needles or ice crystals forms at temperatures approaching 40 f (40 c) due to air with slightly higher moisture from aloft mixing with colder surface based air they are made of simple ice crystals that are hexagonal in shape the swedish meteorological institute (smhi) define winter as when the daily mean temperatures go below 0 c (32 f) for five consecutive days according to the smhi winter in scandinavia is more pronounced when atlantic lowpressure systems take more southerly and northerly routes leaving the path open for highpressure systems to come in and cold temperatures to occur as a result the coldest january on record in 1987 was also the sunniest in stockholm
accumulations of snow and ice are commonly associated with winter in the northern hemisphere due to the large land masses there in the southern hemisphere the more maritime climate and the relative lack of land south of 40s makes the winters milder thus snow and ice are less common in inhabited regions of the southern hemisphere in this region snow occurs every year in elevated regions such as the andes the great dividing range in australia and the mountains of new zealand and also occurs in the southerly patagonia region of south america snow occurs year-round in antarctica
== astronomical and other calendar-based reckoning ==
in the northern hemisphere some authorities define the period of winter based on astronomical fixed points (i.e based solely on the position of the earth in its orbit around the sun) regardless of weather conditions in one version of this definition winter begins at the winter solstice and ends at the vernal equinox these dates are somewhat later than those used to define the beginning and end of the meteorological winter usually considered to span the entirety of december january and february in the northern hemisphere and june july and august in the southern
astronomically the winter solstice being the day of the year which has fewest hours of daylight ought to be the middle of the season but seasonal lag means that the coldest period normally follows the solstice by a few weeks in some cultures the season is regarded as beginning at the solstice and ending on the following equinox in the northern hemisphere depending on the year this corresponds to the period between 21 or 22 december and 19 20 or 21 march in the uk meteorologists consider winter to be the three coldest months of december january and february
in scandinavia winter in one tradition begins on 14 october and ends on the last day of february in russia currently calendar winter starts on 1 december and lasts through to the end of february though traditionally it was reckoned from the christmas (25 december in julian calendar or 7 january in gregorian) until the annunciation (25 march in julian) in many countries in the southern hemisphere including australia new zealand and south africa winter begins on 1 june and ends on 31 august in celtic nations such as ireland (using the irish calendar) and in scandinavia the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter with the winter season beginning 1 november on all hallows or samhain winter ends and spring begins on imbolc or candlemas which is 1 or 2 february this system of seasons is based on the length of days exclusively (the three-month period of the shortest days and weakest solar radiation occurs during november december and january in the northern hemisphere and may june and july in the southern hemisphere.)
also many mainland european countries tend to recognize martinmas or st martin's day (11 november) as the first calendar day of winter the day falls at midpoint between the old julian equinox and solstice dates also valentine's day (14 february) is recognized by some countries as heralding the first rites of spring such as flowers blooming
in chinese astronomy and other east asian calendars winter is taken to commence on or around 7 november with the jiq (known as l dngliterally establishment of winter")
the three-month period associated with the coldest average temperatures typically begins somewhere in late november or early december in the northern hemisphere and lasts through late february or early march this thermological winter is earlier than the solstice delimited definition but later than the daylight (celtic) definition depending on seasonal lag this period will vary between climatic regions
cultural influences such as christmas creep may have led to the winter season being perceived as beginning earlier in recent years although high latitude countries like canada are usually well into their real winters before the december solstice
== ecological reckoning and activity ==
ecological reckoning of winter differs from calendar-based by avoiding the use of fixed dates it is one of six seasons recognized by most ecologists who customarily use the term hibernal for this period of the year (the other ecological seasons being prevernal vernal estival serotinal and autumnal) the hibernal season coincides with the main period of biological dormancy each year whose dates vary according to local and regional climates in temperate zones of the earth the appearance of flowering plants like the crocus can mark the change from ecological winter to the prevernal season as early as late january in mild temperate climates
to survive the harshness of winter many animals have developed different behavioral and morphological adaptations for overwintering
migration is a common effect of winter upon animals notably birds however the majority of birds do not migratethe cardinal and european robin for example some butterflies also migrate seasonally
hibernation is a state of reduced metabolic activity during the winter some animals sleep during winter and only come out when the warm weather returns e.g. gophers frogs snakes and bats
some animals store food for the winter and live on it instead of hibernating completely this is the case for squirrels beavers skunks badgers and raccoons
resistance is observed when an animal endures winter but changes in ways such as color and musculature the color of the fur or plumage changes to white (in order to be confused with snow) and thus retains its cryptic coloration year-round examples are the rock ptarmigan arctic fox weasel white-tailed jackrabbit and mountain hare
some fur-coated mammals grow a heavier coat during the winter this improves the heat-retention qualities of the fur the coat is then shed following the winter season to allow better cooling the heavier coat in winter made it a favorite season for trappers who sought more profitable skins
snow also affects the ways animals behave many take advantage of the insulating properties of snow by burrowing in it mice and voles typically live under the snow layer
some annual plants never survive the winter other annual plants require winter cold to complete their life cycle this is known as vernalization as for perennials many small ones profit from the insulating effects of snow by being buried in it larger plants particularly deciduous trees usually let their upper part go dormant but their roots are still protected by the snow layer few plants bloom in the winter one exception being the flowering plum which flowers in time for chinese new year the process by which plants become acclimated to cold weather is called hardening

1816 was the year without a summer in the northern hemisphere the unusual coolness of the winter of 18151816 and of the following summer was primarily due to the eruption of mount tambora in indonesia in april 1815 there were secondary effects from an unknown eruption or eruptions around 1810 and several smaller eruptions around the world between 1812 and 1814 the cumulative effects were worldwide but were especially strong in the eastern united states atlantic canada and northern europe frost formed in may in new england killing many newly planted crops and the summer never recovered snow fell in new york and maine in june and ice formed in lakes and rivers in july and august in the uk snow drifts remained on hills until late july and the thames froze in september agricultural crops failed and livestock died in much of the northern hemisphere resulting in food shortages and the worst famine of the 19th century
18871888 there were record cold temperatures in the upper midwest heavy snowfalls worldwide and amazing storms including the schoolhouse blizzard of 1888 (in the midwest in january) and the great blizzard of 1888 (in the eastern us and canada in march)
in europe the winters of early 1947 february 1956 19621963 19811982 and 20092010 were abnormally cold the uk winter of 19461947 started out relatively normal but became one of the snowiest uk winters to date with nearly continuous snowfall from late january until march
