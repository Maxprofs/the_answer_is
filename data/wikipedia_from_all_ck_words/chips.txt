chips is an american television drama series produced by mgm studios that originally aired on nbc from september 15 1977 to may 1 1983 chips followed the lives of two motorcycle police officers of the california highway patrol the series ran for 139 episodes over six seasons plus one reunion tv movie from october 27 1998
== synopsis ==
chips was a lightweight action crime drama which included elements of light comedy in every episode over-the-top freeway pileups which occurred in almost every episode were a signature of the show there was little if any actual violence on chips and the show can be classified as a light drama the episodes filled a standard hour-long time slot which at the time required 48 minutes of actual programming for filming traffic on los angeles freeways was non-existent and most chase scenes were done on back roads usually dirt roads
the show was created by rick rosner and starred erik estrada as macho rambunctious officer francis ("frank") llewellyn ponch poncherello and larry wilcox as his straitlaced partner officer jonathan jon baker with ponch the more trouble-prone of the pair and jon generally the more level-headed one trying to keep him out of trouble with the duo's gruff yet fatherly commanding officer sergeant joseph getraer (robert pine) the two were highway patrolmen of the central los angeles office of the california highway patrol (chp hence the name chips)
as real-life chp motor officers rarely ride in pairs in early episodes this was explained away by placing the trouble-prone ponch on probationary status with jon assigned as his field training officer eventually by the end of the first season this subplot faded away (ponch completed his probation) as audiences were used to seeing the two working as a team
=== a typical chips episode ===
chips episodes were usually a combination of light comedy and melodrama a typical episode would start with ponch and jon on routine patrol or being assigned to an interesting beat such as malibu or the sunset strip in roll call briefing sgt getraer would alert his officers to be on the lookout for a particular criminal operation such as people staging accidents as part of an insurance scam or punks breaking into cars a few interesting unrelated vignettes often transpired during routine traffic enforcement
a light-hearted subplot would also be included such as harlan trying to hide a stray dog from getraer at the office a more serious theme such as ponch trying to keep a kid from his old neighborhood out of a potential life of crime might also be included after a few failed attempts to apprehend the gang that had been menacing l.a.'s freeways the episode would invariably culminate in ponch and jon leading a chase of the suspects (often assisted by other members of their division) climaxing with a spectacular series of stunt vehicle crashes
the show then typically featured a dnouement of ponch and jon participating in a new activity (such as jet skiing or skydiving) designed to showcase the pair's glamorous southern california lifestyle often ponch would attempt to impress a woman he had met during the episode with his athletic prowess or disco dancing only to fail and provide jon getraer and others with many laughs as the preliminary end credits would start the image would freeze multiple times showing various characters laughing or otherwise enjoying the social scene
some of the more outlandish plots included ponch and his season 6 partner bobby nelson helping a girl who believed that she was being targeted by ufos and them racing against time to defuse a battery about to explode on an intelligent experimental police robot
chp officers rarely drew their guns in the series in the tv movie however guns were used more prominently especially in one of the final scenes in which jon and mcfall are held hostage on a tour bus the entire chp are shown holding guns at the bus
== production ==
according to a 1998 tv guide article show creator rick rosner was a reserve deputy with the los angeles county sheriff's department during a coffee break on an evening patrol shift in the mid-1970s he saw two young chp officers on motorcycles which gave him the idea for this series he later created 240-robert which seemed like a hybrid of chips and emergency
episodes occasionally reference jon baker's service in vietnam this makes his character one of the earliest regular (and one of the more positive) portrayals of a vietnam veteran on television larry wilcox served 13 months in vietnam as a marine artilleryman
though public perception links the later p-series kawasaki police special with the series in fact they rode the c-series kawasaki which had an oval windshield rather than the later model's fiberglass fairing
despite the ford motor company's credit as a vehicle provider for nearly 4 of the series 6 seasons cars and trucks were supplied by several manufacturers many of the police cars seen were dodge models
filming locations were generally in the san fernando valley of california freeway crashes were performed on recently constructed highways that were not yet open to the public for the first season the glendale freeway (highway 2) in montrose california was used after the first season the intersection of the foothill freeway (interstate 210) and the simi valley freeway (highway 118) in sylmar california were used for the racing scenes in the episode drive lady drive they used the riverside international raceway in riverside california
although doubles were used for far-off shots and various stunt or action sequences wilcox and estrada did a great deal of their own motorcycle riding and performed many smaller stunts themselves although wilcox emerged relatively injury-free estrada suffered various injuries several times throughout the run of the series in several early first season episodes a huge bruise or scar can be seen on his arm after he was flung from one of the motorcycles and skidded along the ground but his worst accident came when he was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident while filming a season three episode in august 1979 fracturing several ribs and breaking both wrists the accident and estrada's subsequent hospitalization was incorporated into the series storyline
prior to being cast in chips estrada had no experience with motorcycles so he underwent an intensive eight-week course learning how to ride in 2007 it was revealed that he did not hold a motorcycle license at the time chips was in production and only qualified for a license after three attempts while preparing for an appearance on the reality television show back to the grind
estrada and wilcox never drew their firearms over the course of the series (this did occur in the made-for-tv reunion movie chips 99.) the only character on the series depicted as drawing his firearm was baricza (brodie greer) and he did so three times the first was his radio car's ithaca 37 shotgun in season 1's episode rainy day where the chips conduct a felony traffic stop of a motorhome-based casino the second was in season 2's premiere peaks and valleys against two hillbillies armed with a tommy-gun and a double-barrel shotgun who had ambushed his unattended patrol car for fun here the action was only implied with his hand motion just below camera range the last was in season 4's karate in which a karate-trained car burglar (danny bonaduce) attacked him with a b but baricza drew his gun to stop bonaduce
nbc aired reruns of this series on its 1982 daytime schedule from april to september
during the original run of the series syndicated reruns of older episodes were retitled chips patrol to avoid confusion later syndicated reruns after the show went out of production reverted to the original title

=== cast changes ===
in the fifth season (19811982) estrada went on strike over a dispute over syndication profits as a result he did not appear in seven episodes for that period he was replaced by jenner (officer steve mcleish) despite their successful pairing on-screen wilcox and estrada did not always get along behind the camera however it was wilcox's falling-out with the producers over what he saw as continual favoritism toward estrada that saw wilcox not return for the sixth and final season wilcox was replaced by tom reilly (officer bobby nelson)
bruce penhall a native of balboa island newport beach and a motorcycle speedway rider who had won the 1981 and 1982 speedway world championships was also introduced as cadetprobationary officer bruce nelson bobby's younger brother in 198283 the season 6 episode speedway fever (aired november 7 1982) centered on penhall's character nelson winning the 1982 speedway world final at the los angeles memorial coliseum with scenes filmed in the pits during the meeting the episode also used television coverage of the final (with dubbed commentary) penhall later admitted that having a bodyguard and having to have makeup done in the pits in full view of his competitors at the world final only added to the pressure he was under both as a rider and a rookie actor and that it felt weird having to buddy up to ponch in front of the other riders while the world final was taking place in order to become a full-time member of the chips cast penhall had officially announced his retirement from speedway racing on the podium of the 1982 world final
estrada apparently did not approve of reilly's work ethic and was very displeased with reilly's real life arrest by the lapd for possession of controlled substances during a traffic stop as a result bobby was featured much less prominently in later episodes of the season with bruce taking his place for most of the remaining episodes
