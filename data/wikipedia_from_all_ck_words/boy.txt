a boy is a young male human usually a child or adolescent when he becomes an adult he is described as a man the most apparent difference between a boy and a girl is that a boy typically has a penis while girls have a vagina however some intersex children with ambiguous genitals and genetically female transgender children may also be classified or self-identify as a boy
the term boy is primarily used to indicate biological sex distinctions cultural gender role distinctions or both the latter most commonly applies to adult men either considered in some way immature or inferior in a position associated with aspects of boyhood or even without such boyish connotation as age-indiscriminate synonym the term can be joined with a variety of other words to form these gender-related labels as compound words
== etymology ==
the word boy comes from middle english boi boye ("boy servant") related to other germanic words for boy namely east frisian boi ("boy young man") and west frisian boai ("boy") although the exact etymology is obscure the english and frisian forms probably derive from an earlier anglo-frisian *b-ja ("little brother") a diminutive of the germanic root *b- ("brother male relation") from proto-indo-european *bh- *bht- ("father brother") the root is also found in flemish boe ("brother") norwegian dialectal boa ("brother") and through a reduplicated variant *b-b- in old norse bfi dutch boef (criminal) knave rogue german bube ("knave rogue boy") furthermore the word may be related to bia an anglo-saxon personal name
== characteristics of boys ==
ongoing debates about the influences of nature versus nurture in shaping the behavior of girls and boys raises questions about whether the roles played by boys are mainly the result of inborn differences or of socialization images of boys in art literature and popular culture often demonstrate assumptions about gender roles in some middle eastern cultures characteristics affirming boyhood include physiological features associated with prepubescence such as pubelessness and the inability to ejaculate an adult male human is a man but when age is not a crucial factor both terms can be interchangeable e.g. boys and their toys applies equally to adults and young boys just as are you mice or men? can also apply to young boys
the age boundary is not clear cut rather dependent on the context or even on individual circumstances a young man who has not assumed (or has been denied) the traditional roles of a man might also be called a boy it may feel uncomfortable to a young male upon being referred to as a man before he believes he has assumed these roles such as having a career a partner a household of his own fatherhood etc. though the addition of a jocular modifier such as young man or little man might lessen the dissonance conversely it may feel uncomfortable to a male to be called a boy if he believes he has assumed the traditional roles of a man in mother's/mama's boy the word emphatically implies a male (minor or adult in years) who is too immature to be independent
in some traditions boyhood is held to be exchanged for adult manhood or at least approach it significantly by certain -in se independent- acts assuming a role deemed to be typical for a normal man (though there are limits) as marriage fathering offspring or military service various cultural and/or religious rites of passage serve partially or specifically to mark the transition to manhood
there is often a number of traditional differences in attire between boys and adult men which may even give rise to a metaphoric term such as broekvent in dutch (i.e. a boy who has not yet graduated from shorts to trousers) and in what is socially accepted as appropriate behaviour e.g. boys may be publicly seen naked in cultures where men are not
== uses of the term boy and related terms ==
in english the words youth teenager and adolescent may refer to either male or female no gender-specific term exists for an intermediate stage between a boy and a man except young man although the term puberty for one who reached sexual reproductivity (or the legally assumed age e.g 14 for boys often set lower for girls) without being a legal adult yet stems from a latin word for boys only itself named after the accompanying male body hair pubes on face and genital region
many occasions occur when an adult male is commonly referred to as a boy a person's boyfriend or loverboy may be of any age this even applies to a working call-boy toyboy (though usually younger than the client as youth is generally considered attractive) reflecting the general aesthetic preference for youth one says pretty boy (e.g in the nickname of charles arthur pretty boy floyd who committed his first bank robbery at age 30) or adonis (name of a mythological youth) even when a male beauty is clearly of riper age in terms (used pejoratively or neutrally) for homosexuals such as batty boy (alongside batty man from bottom") or bum boy age is not essential but the connotation of immaturity can strengthen insulting use
a man's group of male friends etc engaged in male bonding are often called the boys it is most common to refer to men irrespective of age or even in an adult age group as boys in the context of a team (especially all-male) such as old boys for networking of adult men who attended the same school(s) as boys or as professional colleagues e.g the boys at the office - police station etc. (often all adults) the members of a student fraternity can be called frat(ernity) boys technically preferable to the pleonasm frat-bro(ther) and remain so for life as adults after graduation

in us urban particularly african american and latino slang the term boy is used with a possessive as meaning friend (my boy his boys) presumably as a reduction of homeboy originally a male from the same area
in some cases the word boy is used merely to designate the age of the (male) person irrespective of the function as in altar boy a minor acting as liturgical acolyte or in boy scouts an organisation specifically for boys thus the compound -man can then be replaced by -boy as in footboy or boy is simply added either as a prefix (e.g. in boy-racer) or as a suffix (e.g. in teddy boy)
an adult equivalent (with or without -man) is not to be expected when -boy designates an apprentice (for which some languages use a compound with the equivalent of boy e.g leerjongen learning boy in dutch) or lowest rank implying specific on the job training if promotion is to be obtained as in kitchen boy similarly schoolboy only applies to minors the modern near-synonym pupil originally designated a minor in roman law as being under a specific adult's authority as in loco parentis
expressions such as boys will be boys (i.e. a male always retains a tendency for boyish games or mischief) allude to stereotypically ascribed characteristics of boys and men in the term tomboy a woman's (according to the counterpart-gender stereotype) uncharacteristically bold nature is even described solely by comparing her to a boy
the use of boy (like kid) in (fantasy or descriptive) nicknames also for adult men (e.g shark boy for a wrestler with matching costume) may also connote to the informal or naughty image of boyhood
in such terms as city boy or home boy the age notion is at most anachronistic as they indicate any male who grew up (or by extension lived a long time) in a certain environment
