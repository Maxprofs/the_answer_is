the american goldfinch (spinus tristis) also known as the eastern goldfinch is a small north american bird in the finch family it is migratory ranging from mid-alberta to north carolina during the breeding season and from just south of the canadian border to mexico during the winter
the only finch in its subfamily to undergo a complete molt the american goldfinch displays sexual dimorphism in its coloration the male is a vibrant yellow in the summer and an olive color during the winter while the female is a dull yellow-brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer the male displays brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate
the american goldfinch is a granivore and adapted for the consumption of seedheads with a conical beak to remove the seeds and agile feet to grip the stems of seedheads while feeding it is a social bird and will gather in large flocks while feeding and migrating it may behave territorially during nest construction but this aggression is short-lived its breeding season is tied to the peak of food supply beginning in late july which is relatively late in the year for a finch this species is generally monogamous and produces one brood each year
human activity has generally benefited the american goldfinch it is often found in residential areas attracted to bird feeders which increase its survival rate in these areas deforestation also creates open meadow areas which are its preferred habitat
== taxonomy ==
the american goldfinch was one of the many species originally described by linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his work systema naturae it was initially included in the genus spinus a group containing new world goldfinches and siskins but in 1976 spinus was merged into the genus carduelis as a subgenus recent studies resurrect the genus spinus its closest relatives are the lesser goldfinch (s psaltria) lawrence's goldfinch (s lawrencei) and the siskins although it shares a name with the european goldfinch the two are in separate subgenera and are not directly related carduelis is derived from carduus the latin word for thistle the species name tristis is latin for sorrowful there are four recognized subspecies of the american goldfinch
s t tristis is the most common of the subspecies its summer range is from southern canada to colorado and east to the carolinas its winter range is from southern canada south to florida and central mexico
s t pallidus is differentiated from other subspecies by its paler body color stronger white markings and in males a larger black cap it is slightly larger than c t tristis the summer range is from british columbia to western ontario south to colorado and west to oregon in winter the range extends from southern canada and northern california south to mexico
s t jewetti is smaller and darker than the other subspecies it occurs on the coastal slope of the cascade mountains from southern british columbia to central california overlapping with the range of c t pallidus
s t salicamans occurs west of the sierra nevada range during the summer and in south and central baja california peninsula to the mojave desert and colorado desert in winter in winter the plumage of both sexes is browner than other subspecies and in summer the male's black cap is smaller than that of other subspecies this subspecies has been called the willow goldfinch
this seems to be the most ancient extant species of the meso american spinus/carduelis evolutive radiation whose parental species is carduelis/spinus lawrencei
== description ==
the american goldfinch is a small finch 1114 cm (4.35.5 in) long with a wingspan of 1922 cm (7.58.7 in) it weighs between 1120 g (0.390.71 oz) among standard measurements the wing chord is 6.5 to 7.8 cm (2.6 to 3.1 in) the tail is 4.2 to 5.1 cm (1.7 to 2.0 in) the culmen is 0.9 to 1.1 cm (0.35 to 0.43 in) and the tarsus is 1.2 to 1.4 cm (0.47 to 0.55 in) the beak is small conical and pink for most of the year but turns bright orange with the spring molt in both sexes the shape and size of the beak aid in the extraction of seeds from the seed heads of thistles sunflowers and other plants
the american goldfinch undergoes a molt in the spring and autumn it is the only cardueline finch to undergo a molt twice a year during the winter molt it sheds all its feathers in the spring it sheds all but the wing and tail feathers which are dark brown in the female and black in the male the markings on these feathers remain through each molt with bars on the wings and white under and at the edges of the short notched tail the sexual dimorphism displayed in plumage coloration is especially pronounced after the spring molt when the bright color of the male's summer plumage is needed to attract a mate
once the spring molt is complete the body of the male is a brilliant lemon yellow a color produced by carotenoid pigments from plant materials in its diet with a striking jet black cap and white rump that is visible during flight the female is mostly brown lighter on the underside with a yellow bib after the autumn molt the bright summer feathers are replaced by duller plumage becoming buff below and olive-brown above with a pale yellow face and bib the autumn plumage is almost identical in both sexes but the male has yellow shoulder patches in some winter ranges the goldfinches lose all traces of yellow becoming a predominantly medium tan-gray color with an olive tinge evident only on close viewing
the immature american goldfinch has a dull brown back and the underside is pale yellow the shoulders and tail are dull black with buff-colored rather than white markings on wings and rump this coloration is the same in both genders
the song of the american goldfinch is a series of musical warbles and twitters often with a long note a tsee-tsi-tsi-tsit call is often given in flight it may also be described as per-chic-o-ree while the female incubates the eggs she calls to her returning mate with a soft continuous teeteeteeteete sound the young begin to use a call of chick-kee or chick-wee shortly before fledging which they use until they have left the nest entirely there are two defense calls made by adults during nesting a sweeet call made to rally other goldfinches to the nest and distract predators and a bearbee used to signal to the nestlings to quiet them and get them to crouch down in the nest to become less conspicuous
== distribution and habitat ==
the american goldfinch prefers open country where weeds thrive such as fields meadows flood plains as well as roadsides orchards and gardens it may also be found in open deciduous and riparian woodlands and areas of secondary growth this habitat preference continues during the spring and autumn migrations
the summer breeding range stretches across north america from coast to coast it is bounded on the north by saskatchewan and stretches south across north america to north carolina on the east coast and northern california on the west coast the american goldfinch is a short-distance migrant moving south in response to colder weather and lessened food supply the migration is completed in compact flocks which travel in an erratic wavelike flight pattern
its winter range includes southern canada and stretches south through the united states to parts of mexico in winter in the northern part of its range the finch may move nearer to feeders if they are available in southern ranges during winter they remain in areas similar to the fields and flood plains where they live during the summer months
attempts were made to introduce the american goldfinch into bermuda in the 19th century and tahiti in 1938 but the species failed to become established
== behavior ==
the american goldfinch flies in a distinctive undulating pattern creating a wave-shaped path this normally consists of a series of wing beats to lift the bird then folding in the wings and gliding in an arc before repeating the pattern birds often vocalize during the flapping phase of the pattern and then go silent during the coasting phase the call made during flight is per-twee-twee-twee or ti-di-di-di punctuated by the silent periods
the american goldfinch is gregarious during the non-breeding season when it is often found in large flocks usually with other finches during the breeding season it lives in loose colonies while the nest is being constructed the male will act aggressively toward other males who intrude into his territory driving them away and the female reacts in the same way toward other females this aggressiveness subsides once the eggs have been laid
the american goldfinch does not act aggressively toward predators within its territory its only reaction is alarm calling predators include snakes weasels squirrels and blue jays which may destroy eggs or kill young and hawks and cats which pose a threat to both young and adults as of 2007 the oldest known american goldfinch was 10 years and 5 months old
=== diet ===
the american goldfinch is a diurnal feeder according to the cornell lab of ornithology the species is one of the strictest vegetarians in the bird world it is mainly granivorous but will occasionally eat insects which are also fed to its young to provide protein its diet consists of the seeds from a wide variety of annual plants often those of weeds grasses and trees such as thistle teasel dandelion ragweed mullein cosmos goatsbeard sunflower and alder however it also consumes tree buds maple sap and berries it will eat at bird feeders provided by humans particularly in the winter months preferring niger seed (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed)
unlike some finch species the american goldfinch uses its feet extensively in feeding it frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding in order to reach the seeds more easily in the spring the american goldfinch feeds on the catkins hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch this dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors increasing its chances of survival
=== reproduction ===
the american goldfinch begins its breeding season later in the year than any other finch and later than any other native north american bird besides occasionally the sedge wren this may be related to the abundance of seeds in the late summer months as seeds represent the majority of their diet
the courtship rituals of the american goldfinch include aerial maneuvers and singing by males who begin courtship in late july the flight displays begin as the male pursues the female who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns the male is able to signal his quality and fitness both in the short term (current body condition) and long term (genes) through ornamentation (bill color and plumage) if a female accepts the male as a mate the pair will fly in wide circles as the male warbles throughout the flight
once a male has found a mate he selects a territory marking the boundaries by warbling as he flies from perch to perch after circling the perimeter he performs two flight displays first repeating a low flat flight then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight tucking his wings close to his body plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward in a series of loops two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony perhaps to aid in defense against predators
the nest is built in late summer by the female in the branches of a deciduous shrub or tree at a height of up to 10 m (33 ft) the nest-building lasts approximately six days during which time the female works in 1040 minute increments the male frequently flies with the female as she collects nesting materials and though he may carry some materials back to the nest he leaves its construction to the female the outer shell of the nest is built of bark weeds vines and grass the inside diameter of the finished nest is about 6.5 cm (2.6 in) the rim is reinforced with bark bound by spiderwebs and caterpillar silk and the cup is lined with plant down from milkweed thistle or cattail the nest is so tightly woven that it can hold water and it is possible for nestlings to drown following a rainstorm if the parents do not cover the nest
american goldfinches lay four to six bluish-white eggs which are oval in shape and about 16 mm 12 mm (0.63 in 0.47 in) roughly the size of a peanut it is thought that they are laid during the night the eggs are incubated by the female alone though the male brings her food as she nests and most mating pairs raise only one brood each year
the chicks hatch 1214 days after incubation begins like all passerines the chicks are altricial they are born naked with reddish bodies pale grey down and closed eyes the mother bird feeds her young regurgitated seeds and insects as they grow the hatchlings develop quickly opening their eyes after three days and completing the growth of olive-brown juvenile plumage after 1115 days at which time they begin to practice short flights close to the nest for up to three weeks after fledging they are still fed by the male who locates them by listening for their fledging call the chicks stop giving this call when they become entirely independent
american goldfinches are occasionally victims of brood parasites particularly brown-headed cowbirds one study found that 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them american goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success this is despite the fact that the american goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites it is thought that the inability of brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough nutrition the seed-rich diet of american goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts
== relationship with humans ==
the american goldfinch is found in residential areas throughout its range backyard birders attract it using feeders containing nyjer thistle seed or by planting grasses and perennial plants such as zinnias cosmos bee balm or globe thistle which produce seedheads favored by finches although some controversy surrounds bird feeding (see bird feeder for details) an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species
the american goldfinch is not threatened by human activity and is widespread throughout its range the clearing of forests by humans though harmful to many species has benefited the american goldfinch clearing of woodlands causes declines in numbers of neotropical migrants while favoring short-distance migrants and permanent residents this benefits the american goldfinch both as a short-distance migrant and because the created open areas are the preferred environment of the bird where weeds thrive which produce the primary food source of the american goldfinch
== state bird ==
the american goldfinch is the state bird of iowa and new jersey where it is called the eastern goldfinch and washington where it is called the willow goldfinch it was chosen by schoolchildren in washington in 1951
