a film also called a movie motion picture or photoplay is a series of still images which when shown on a screen creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon this optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession a film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques by means of cgi and computer animation or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects the word cinema is often used to refer to the industry of films and filmmaking or to the art of filmmaking itself the contemporary definition of cinema is the art of simulating experiences to communicate ideas stories perceptions feelings beauty or atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed moving images along with other sensory stimulations
the process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry films were originally recorded onto plastic film which was shown through a movie projector onto a large screen (in other words a photochemistry process) the adoption of cgi-based special effects led to the use of digital intermediates most contemporary films are now fully digital through the entire process of production distribution and exhibition from start to finish films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack which is a graphic recording of the spoken words music and other sounds that accompany the images it runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it and is not projected
films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures they reflect those cultures and in turn affect them film is considered to be an important art form a source of popular entertainment and a powerful medium for educatingor indoctrinatingcitizens the visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into the language of the viewer some have criticized the film industry's glorification of violence and its sexist treatment of women
the individual images that make up a film are called frames during projection of traditional films a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame in turn is moved into position to be projected but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed the perception of motion is due to a psychological effect called phi phenomenon
the name film originates from the fact that photographic film (also called film stock) has historically been the medium for recording and displaying motion pictures many other terms exist for an individual motion picture including picture picture show moving picture photoplay and flick the most common term in the united states is movie while in europe film is preferred terms for the field in general include the big screen the silver screen the movies and cinema the latter is commonly used in scholarly texts and critical essays especially by european writers in early years the word sheet was sometimes used instead of screen
== historyedit ==
preceding film in origin by thousands of years early plays and dances had elements common to film scripts sets costumes production direction actors audiences storyboards and scores much terminology later used in film theory and criticism apply such as mise en scne (roughly the entire visual picture at any one time) owing to the lack of any technology for doing so the moving images and sounds could not be recorded for replaying as with film
the magic lantern probably created by christiaan huygens in 1650s could be used to project animation what was achieved by various types of mechanical slides typically two glass slides one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that was to move would be placed one on top of the other and projected together then the moving slide would be hand-operated either directly or by means of a lever or other mechanism chromotrope slides which produced eye-dazzling displays of continuously cycling abstract geometrical patterns and colors were operated by means of a small crank and pulley wheel that rotated a glass disc
in the mid-19th century inventions such as the phenakistoscope and zoetrope demonstrated that a carefully designed sequence of drawings showing phases of the changing appearance of objects in motion would appear to show the objects actually moving if they were displayed one after the other at a sufficiently rapid rate these devices relied on the phenomenon of persistence of vision to make the display appear continuous even though the observer's view was actually blocked as each drawing rotated into the location where its predecessor had just been glimpsed each sequence was limited to a small number of drawings usually twelve so it could only show endlessly repeating cyclical motions by the late 1880s the last major device of this type the praxinoscope had been elaborated into a form that employed a long coiled band containing hundreds of images painted on glass and used the elements of a magic lantern to project them onto a screen
the use of sequences of photographs in such devices was initially limited to a few experiments with subjects photographed in a series of poses because the available emulsions were not sensitive enough to allow the short exposures needed to photograph subjects that were actually moving the sensitivity was gradually improved and in the late 1870s eadweard muybridge created the first animated image sequences photographed in real-time a row of cameras was used each in turn capturing one image on a glass photographic plate so the total number of images in each sequence was limited by the number of cameras about two dozen at most muybridge used his system to analyze the movements of a wide variety of animal and human subjects hand-painted images based on the photographs were projected as moving images by means of his zoopraxiscope
by the end of the 1880s the introduction of lengths of celluloid photographic film and the invention of motion picture cameras which could photograph an indefinitely long rapid sequence of images using only one lens allowed several minutes of action to be captured and stored on a single compact reel of film some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a peep show device such as the kinetoscope others were intended for a projector mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into a projection lens so that these moving pictures could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire audience the first public exhibition of projected motion pictures in america was at koster and bial's music hall in new york city on the 23rd of april 1896
the earliest films were simply one static shot that showed an event or action with no editing or other cinematic techniques around the turn of the 20th century films started stringing several scenes together to tell a story the scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances and angles other techniques such as camera movement were developed as effective ways to tell a story with film until sound film became commercially practical in the late 1920s motion pictures were a purely visual art but these innovative silent films had gained a hold on the public imagination rather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector as an accompaniment theater owners hired a pianist or organist or in large urban theaters a full orchestra to play music that fit the mood of the film at any given moment by the early 1920s most films came with a prepared list of sheet music to be used for this purpose and complete film scores were composed for major productions
the rise of european cinema was interrupted by the outbreak of world war i while the film industry in the united states flourished with the rise of hollywood typified most prominently by the innovative work of d w griffith in the birth of a nation (1915) and intolerance (1916) however in the 1920s european filmmakers such as sergei eisenstein f w murnau and fritz lang in many ways inspired by the meteoric wartime progress of film through griffith along with the contributions of charles chaplin buster keaton and others quickly caught up with american film-making and continued to further advance the medium
in the 1920s the development of electronic sound recording technologies made it practical to incorporate a soundtrack of speech music and sound effects synchronized with the action on the screen the resulting sound films were initially distinguished from the usual silent moving pictures or movies by calling them talking pictures or talkies. the revolution they wrought was swift by 1930 silent film was practically extinct in the us and already being referred to as the old medium.
another major technological development was the introduction of natural color, which meant color that was photographically recorded from nature rather than added to black-and-white prints by hand-coloring stencil-coloring or other arbitrary procedures although the earliest processes typically yielded colors which were far from natural in appearance while the advent of sound films quickly made silent films and theater musicians obsolete color replaced black-and-white much more gradually the pivotal innovation was the introduction of the three-strip version of the technicolor process first used for animated cartoons in 1932 then also for live-action short films and isolated sequences in a few feature films then for an entire feature film becky sharp in 1935 the expense of the process was daunting but favorable public response in the form of increased box office receipts usually justified the added cost the number of films made in color slowly increased year after year
in the early 1950s the proliferation of black-and-white television started seriously depressing north american theater attendance in an attempt to lure audiences back into theaters bigger screens were installed widescreen processes polarized 3d projection and stereophonic sound were introduced and more films were made in color which soon became the rule rather than the exception some important mainstream hollywood films were still being made in black-and-white as late as the mid-1960s but they marked the end of an era color television receivers had been available in the us since the mid-1950s but at first they were very expensive and few broadcasts were in color during the 1960s prices gradually came down color broadcasts became common and sales boomed the overwhelming public verdict in favor of color was clear after the final flurry of black-and-white films had been released in mid-decade all hollywood studio productions were filmed in color with rare exceptions reluctantly made only at the insistence of star directors such as peter bogdanovich and martin scorsese
the decades following the decline of the studio system in the 1960s saw changes in the production and style of film various new wave movements (including the french new wave indian new wave japanese new wave and new hollywood) and the rise of film-school-educated independent filmmakers contributed to the changes the medium experienced in the latter half of the 20th century digital technology has been the driving force for change throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s digital 3d projection largely replaced earlier problem-prone 3d film systems and has become popular in the early 2010s
== film theoryedit ==
film theory seeks to develop concise and systematic concepts that apply to the study of film as art the concept of film as an art-form began with ricciotto canudo's the birth of the sixth art formalist film theory led by rudolf arnheim bla balzs and siegfried kracauer emphasized how film differed from reality and thus could be considered a valid fine art andr bazin reacted against this theory by arguing that film's artistic essence lay in its ability to mechanically reproduce reality not in its differences from reality and this gave rise to realist theory more recent analysis spurred by jacques lacan's psychoanalysis and ferdinand de saussure's semiotics among other things has given rise to psychoanalytical film theory structuralist film theory feminist film theory and others on the other hand critics from the analytical philosophy tradition influenced by wittgenstein try to clarify misconceptions used in theoretical studies and produce analysis of a film's vocabulary and its link to a form of life
=== languageedit ===
film is considered to have its own language james monaco wrote a classic text on film theory titled how to read a film, that addresses this director ingmar bergman famously said andrei tarkovsky for me is the greatest director the one who invented a new language true to the nature of film as it captures life as a reflection life as a dream. an example of the language is a sequence of back and forth images of one speaking actor's left profile followed by another speaking actor's right profile then a repetition of this which is a language understood by the audience to indicate a conversation this describes another theory of film the 180-degree rule as a visual story-telling device with an ability to place a viewer in a context of being psychologically present through the use of visual composition and editing the hollywood style includes this narrative theory due to the overwhelming practice of the rule by movie studios based in hollywood california during film's classical era another example of cinematic language is having a shot that zooms in on the forehead of an actor with an expression of silent reflection that cuts to a shot of a younger actor who vaguely resembles the first actor indicating that the first person is remembering a past self an edit of compositions that causes a time transition
=== montageedit ===
montage is the technique by which separate pieces of film are selected edited and then pieced together to make a new section of film a scene could show a man going into battle with flashbacks to his youth and to his home-life and with added special effects placed into the film after filming is complete as these were all filmed separately and perhaps with different actors the final version is called a montage
directors developed a theory of montage beginning with eisenstein and the complex juxtaposition of images in his film battleship potemkin incorporation of musical and visual counterpoint and scene development through mise en scene editing and effects has led to more complex techniques comparable to those used in opera and ballet
=== criticismedit ===
film criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films in general these works can be divided into two categories academic criticism by film scholars and journalistic film criticism that appears regularly in newspapers and other media
film critics working for newspapers magazines and broadcast media mainly review new releases normally they only see any given film once and have only a day or two to formulate opinions despite this critics have an important impact on films especially those of certain genres mass marketed action horror and comedy films tend not to be greatly affected by a critic's overall judgment of a film the plot summary and description of a film that makes up the majority of any film review can still have an important impact on whether people decide to see a film for prestige films such as most dramas the influence of reviews is extremely important poor reviews will often doom a film to obscurity and financial loss
the impact of a reviewer on a given film's box office performance is a matter of debate some claim that movie marketing is now so intense and well financed that reviewers cannot make an impact against it however the cataclysmic failure of some heavily-promoted films which were harshly reviewed as well as the unexpected success of critically praised independent films indicates that extreme critical reactions can have considerable influence others note that positive film reviews have been shown to spark interest in little-known films conversely there have been several films in which film companies have so little confidence that they refuse to give reviewers an advanced viewing to avoid widespread panning of the film however this usually backfires as reviewers are wise to the tactic and warn the public that the film may not be worth seeing and the films often do poorly as a result
it is argued that journalist film critics should only be known as film reviewers and true film critics are those who take a more academic approach to films this line of work is more often known as film theory or film studies these film critics attempt to come to understand how film and filming techniques work and what effect they have on people rather than having their works published in newspapers or appear on television their articles are published in scholarly journals or sometimes in up-market magazines they also tend to be affiliated with colleges or universities
== industryedit ==
the making and showing of motion pictures became a source of profit almost as soon as the process was invented upon seeing how successful their new invention and its product was in their native france the lumires quickly set about touring the continent to exhibit the first films privately to royalty and publicly to the masses in each country they would normally add new local scenes to their catalogue and quickly enough found local entrepreneurs in the various countries of europe to buy their equipment and photograph export import and screen additional product commercially the oberammergau passion play of 1898 was the first commercial motion picture ever produced other pictures soon followed and motion pictures became a separate industry that overshadowed the vaudeville world dedicated theaters and companies formed specifically to produce and distribute films while motion picture actors became major celebrities and commanded huge fees for their performances by 1917 charlie chaplin had a contract that called for an annual salary of one million dollars
from 1931 to 1956 film was also the only image storage and playback system for television programming until the introduction of videotape recorders
in the united states today much of the film industry is centered around hollywood california other regional centers exist in many parts of the world such as mumbai-centered bollywood the indian film industry's hindi cinema which produces the largest number of films in the world though the expense involved in making films has led cinema production to concentrate under the auspices of movie studios recent advances in affordable film making equipment have allowed independent film productions to flourish
profit is a key force in the industry due to the costly and risky nature of filmmaking many films have large cost overruns a notorious example being kevin costner's waterworld yet many filmmakers strive to create works of lasting social significance the academy awards (also known as the oscars") are the most prominent film awards in the united states providing recognition each year to films ostensibly based on their artistic merits
there is also a large industry for educational and instructional films made in lieu of or in addition to lectures and texts
== associated fieldsedit ==
derivative academic fields of study may both interact with and develop independently of filmmaking as in film theory and analysis fields of academic study have been created that are derivative or dependent on the existence of film such as film criticism film history divisions of film propaganda in authoritarian governments or psychological on subliminal effects (e.g. of a flashing soda can during a screening) these fields may further create derivative fields such as a movie review section in a newspaper or a television guide sub-industries can spin off from film such as popcorn makers and film-related toys (e.g. star wars figures) sub-industries of pre-existing industries may deal specifically with film such as product placement and other advertising within films
== terminology usededit ==
the terminology used for describing motion pictures varies considerably between british and american english in british usage the name of the medium is film the word movie is understood but seldom used additionally the pictures (plural) is used semi-frequently to refer to the place where movies are exhibited while in american english this may be called the movies but it is becoming outdated in other countries the place where movies are exhibited may be called a cinema or theatre
by contrast in the united states movie is the predominant form although the words film and movie are sometimes used interchangeably film is more often used when considering artistic theoretical or technical aspects as studies in a university class and movies more often refers to entertainment or commercial aspects as where to go for fun on a date for example a book titled how to read a film would be about the aesthetics or theory of film while let's go to the movies would be about the history of entertaining movies
further terminology is used to distinguish various forms and media of film industry motion pictures and moving pictures are frequently-used terms for film and movie productions specifically intended for theatrical exhibition such as for instance batman the motion picture dvd and videotape are video formats that can reproduce a photochemical film a reproduction based on such is called a transfer. after the advent of theatrical film as an industry the television industry began using videotape as a recording medium for many decades tape was solely an analog medium onto which moving images could be either recorded or transferred film and filming refer to the photochemical medium that chemically records a visual image and the act of recording respectively however the act of shooting images with other visual media such as with a digital camera is still called filming and the resulting works often called films as interchangeable to movies, despite not being shot on film silent films need not be utterly silent but are films and movies without an audible dialogue including those that have a musical accompaniment the word talkies, refers to the earliest sound films created to have audible dialogue recorded for playback along with the film regardless of a musical accompaniment cinema either broadly encompasses both films and movies or it is roughly synonymous with film and theatrical exhibition and both are capitalized when referring to a category of art the silver screen refers to the projection screen used to exhibit films and by extension is also used as a metonym for the entire film industry
widescreen refers to a larger width to height in the frame compared to earlier historic aspect ratios a feature-length film or feature film is of a conventional full length usually 60 minutes or more and can commercially stand by itself without other films in a ticketed screening a short is a film that is not as long as a feature-length film often screened with other shorts or preceding a feature-length film an independent is a film made outside of the conventional film industry
in u.s usage one talks of a screening or projection of a movie or video on a screen at a public or private theater. in british english a film showing happens at a cinema (never a theatre which is a different medium and place altogether) a cinema usually refers to an arena designed specifically to exhibit films where the screen is affixed to a wall while a theater usually refers to a place where live non-recorded action or combination thereof occurs from a podium or other type of stage including the amphitheater theaters can still screen movies in them though the theater would be retrofitted to do so one might propose going to the cinema when referring to the activity or sometimes to the pictures in british english whereas the u.s expression is usually going to the movies. a cinema usually shows a mass-marketed movie using a front-projection screen process with either a film projector or more recently with a digital projector but cinemas may also show theatrical movies from their home video transfers that include blu-ray disc dvd and videocassette when they possess sufficient projection quality or based upon need such as movies that exist only in their transferred state which may be due to the loss or deterioration of the film master and prints from which the movie originally existed due to the advent of digital film production and distribution physical film might be absent entirely a double feature is a screening of two independently-marketed stand-alone feature films a viewing is a watching of a film sales and at the box office refer to tickets sold at a theater or more currently rights sold for individual showings a release is the distribution and often simultaneous screening of a film a preview is a screening in advance of the main release
any film may also have a sequel which portrays events following those in the film bride of frankenstein is an early example when there are more films than one with the same characters story arcs or subject themes these movies become a series, such as the james bond series and existing outside of a specific story timeline usually does not exclude a film from being part of a series a trilogy is a set of three films such as the three films of the godfather series a quadrilogy is a set of four such as writer-director tony gilroy's the bourne identity film series and so forth a film that portrays events occurring earlier in a timeline with those in another film but is released after that film is sometimes called a prequel, an example being butch and sundance the early days
the credits, or end credits, is a list that gives credit to the people involved in the production of a film films from before the 1970s usually start a film with credits often ending with only a title card saying the end or some equivalent often an equivalent that depends on the language of the production from then onward a film's credits usually appear at the end of most films however films with credits that end a film often repeat some credits at or near the start of a film and therefore appear twice such as that film's acting leads while less frequently some appearing near or at the beginning only appear there not at the end which often happens to the director's credit the credits appearing at or near the beginning of a film are usually called titles or beginning titles.
a film's cast refers to a collection of the actors and actresses who appear or star, in a film a star is an actor or actress often a popular one who plays a central character in a film but occasionally the word can also express fame of members of the crew such as a director or other personality such as martin scorsese a crew is usually interpreted as the people involved in a film's physical construction outside of cast participation and it could include directors editors photographers grips gaffers set decorators prop masters and costume designers a person can both be part of a film's cast and crew such as woody allen who directed and starred as the protagonist in take the money and run
a post-credits scene is a scene shown after the end of the credits ferris bueller's day off has a post-credit scene in which ferris tells the audience that the film is over and they should go home
a film goer, movie goer, or film buff is a person who likes or often attends films and movies and any of these though more often the latter could also see oneself as a student to films and movies or the filmic process
=== previewedit ===
a preview performance refers to a showing of a film to a select audience usually for the purposes of corporate promotions before the public film premiere itself previews are sometimes used to judge audience reaction which if unexpectedly negative may result in recutting or even refilming certain sections (audience response)
=== trailer and teaseredit ===
trailers or previews are advertisements for films that will be shown in 1 to 3 months at a cinema back in the early days of cinema with theaters that had only 1 or 2 screens only certain trailers were shown for the films that were going to be shown there later when theaters added more screens or new theaters were built with a lot of screens all different trailers were shown even if they weren't going to play that film in that theater film studios realized that the more trailers that were shown (even if it wasn't going to be shown in that particular theater) the more patrons would go to a different theater to see the film when it came out the term trailer comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a film program that practice did not last long because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films ended but the name has stuck trailers are now shown before the film (or the a film in a double feature program) begins
film trailers are now also common on dvds and blu-ray discs as well as on the internet and mobile devices of some ten billion videos watched online annually film trailers rank third after news and user-created video
teasers are a much shorter preview that would last only 10 to 30 seconds teasers were used to get patrons excited about a film coming out about 6 to 12 months away
== education and propagandaedit ==
film is used for education and propaganda when the purpose is primarily educational a film is called an educational film examples are recordings of lectures and experiments or more marginally a film based on a classic novel
film may be propaganda in whole or in part such as the films made by leni riefenstahl in nazi germany us war film trailers during world war ii or artistic films made under stalin by eisenstein they may also be works of political protest as in the films of wajda or more subtly the films of andrei tarkovsky
the same film may be considered educational by some and propaganda by others
== productionedit ==
at its core the means to produce a film depend on the content the filmmaker wishes to show and the apparatus for displaying it the zoetrope merely requires a series of images on a strip of paper film production can therefore take as little as one person with a camera (or even without a camera as in stan brakhage's 1963 film mothlight) or thousands of actors extras and crewmembers for a live-action feature-length epic
the necessary steps for almost any film can be boiled down to conception planning execution revision and distribution the more involved the production the more significant each of the steps becomes in a typical production cycle of a hollywood-style film these main stages are defined as
development
pre-production
production
post-production
distribution
this production cycle usually takes three years the first year is taken up with development the second year comprises preproduction and production the third year post-production and distribution
the bigger the production the more resources it takes and the more important financing becomes most feature films are not only artistic works but for-profit business entities
=== crewedit ===
a film crew is a group of people hired by a film company employed during the production or photography phase for the purpose of producing a film or motion picture crew are distinguished from cast the actors who appear in front of the camera or provide voices for characters in the film the crew interacts with but is also distinct from the production staff consisting of producers managers company representatives their assistants and those whose primary responsibility falls in pre-production or post-production phases such as writers and editors communication between production and crew generally passes through the director and his/her staff of assistants medium-to-large crews are generally divided into departments with well defined hierarchies and standards for interaction and cooperation between the departments other than acting the crew handles everything in the photography phase props and costumes shooting sound electrics (i.e. lights) sets and production special effects caterers (known in the film industry as craft services") are usually not considered part of the crew
=== technologyedit ===
film stock consists of transparent celluloid acetate or polyester base coated with an emulsion containing light-sensitive chemicals cellulose nitrate was the first type of film base used to record motion pictures but due to its flammability was eventually replaced by safer materials stock widths and the film format for images on the reel have had a rich history though most large commercial films are still shot on (and distributed to theaters) as 35 mm prints originally moving picture film was shot and projected at various speeds using hand-cranked cameras and projectors though 1000 frames per minute (16 frame/s) is generally cited as a standard silent speed research indicates most films were shot between 16 frame/s and 23 frame/s and projected from 18 frame/s on up (often reels included instructions on how fast each scene should be shown) when sound film was introduced in the late 1920s a constant speed was required for the sound head 24 frames per second was chosen because it was the slowest (and thus cheapest) speed which allowed for sufficient sound quality improvements since the late 19th century include the mechanization of cameras allowing them to record at a consistent speed quiet camera design allowing sound recorded on-set to be usable without requiring large blimps to encase the camera the invention of more sophisticated filmstocks and lenses allowing directors to film in increasingly dim conditions and the development of synchronized sound allowing sound to be recorded at exactly the same speed as its corresponding action the soundtrack can be recorded separately from shooting the film but for live-action pictures many parts of the soundtrack are usually recorded simultaneously
as a medium film is not limited to motion pictures since the technology developed as the basis for photography it can be used to present a progressive sequence of still images in the form of a slideshow film has also been incorporated into multimedia presentations and often has importance as primary historical documentation however historic films have problems in terms of preservation and storage and the motion picture industry is exploring many alternatives most films on cellulose nitrate base have been copied onto modern safety films some studios save color films through the use of separation masters three b&w negatives each exposed through red green or blue filters (essentially a reverse of the technicolor process) digital methods have also been used to restore films although their continued obsolescence cycle makes them (as of 2006) a poor choice for long-term preservation film preservation of decaying film stock is a matter of concern to both film historians and archivists and to companies interested in preserving their existing products in order to make them available to future generations (and thereby increase revenue) preservation is generally a higher concern for nitrate and single-strip color films due to their high decay rates black-and-white films on safety bases and color films preserved on technicolor imbibition prints tend to keep up much better assuming proper handling and storage
some films in recent decades have been recorded using analog video technology similar to that used in television production modern digital video cameras and digital projectors are gaining ground as well these approaches are preferred by some film-makers especially because footage shot with digital cinema can be evaluated and edited with non-linear editing systems (nle) without waiting for the film stock to be processed the migration was gradual and as of 2005 most major motion pictures were still shot on film
=== independentedit ===
independent filmmaking often takes place outside of hollywood or other major studio systems an independent film (or indie film) is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a major film studio creative business and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century
on the business side the costs of big-budget studio films also leads to conservative choices in cast and crew there is a trend in hollywood towards co-financing (over two-thirds of the films put out by warner bros in 2000 were joint ventures up from 10% in 1987) a hopeful director is almost never given the opportunity to get a job on a big-budget studio film unless he or she has significant industry experience in film or television also the studios rarely produce films with unknown actors particularly in lead roles
before the advent of digital alternatives the cost of professional film equipment and stock was also a hurdle to being able to produce direct or star in a traditional studio film
but the advent of consumer camcorders in 1985 and more importantly the arrival of high-resolution digital video in the early 1990s have lowered the technology barrier to film production significantly both production and post-production costs have been significantly lowered today the hardware and software for post-production can be installed in a commodity-based personal computer technologies such as dvds firewire connections and a wide variety of professional and consumer-grade video editing software make film-making relatively inexpensive
since the introduction of dv technology the means of production have become more democratized filmmakers can conceivably shoot and edit a film create and edit the sound and music and mix the final cut on a home computer however while the means of production may be democratized financing distribution and marketing remain difficult to accomplish outside the traditional system most independent filmmakers rely on film festivals to get their films noticed and sold for distribution the arrival of internet-based video outlets such as youtube and veoh has further changed the film making landscape in ways that are still to be determined
=== open content filmedit ===
an open content film is much like an independent film but it is produced through open collaborations its source material is available under a license which is permissive enough to allow other parties to create fan fiction or derivative works than a traditional copyright like independent filmmaking open source filmmaking takes place outside of hollywood or other major studio systems
=== fan filmedit ===
a fan film is a film or video inspired by a film television program comic book or a similar source created by fans rather than by the source's copyright holders or creators fan filmmakers have traditionally been amateurs but some of the more notable films have actually been produced by professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels fan films vary tremendously in length from short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent motion pictures to rarer full-length motion pictures
== distributionedit ==
film distribution is the process through which a film is made available for viewing by an audience this is normally the task of a professional film distributor who would determine the marketing strategy of the film the media by which a film is to be exhibited or made available for viewing and may set the release date and other matters the film may be exhibited directly to the public either through a movie theater or television for personal home viewing (including dvd-video or blu-ray disc video-on-demand download television programs through broadcast syndication etc.)
other ways of distributing a film include rental or personal purchase of the film in a variety of media and formats such as vhs or dvd or internet download
== animationedit ==
animation is the technique in which each frame of a film is produced individually whether generated as a computer graphic or by photographing a drawn image or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit (see claymation and stop motion) and then photographing the result with a special animation camera when the frames are strung together and the resulting film is viewed at a speed of 16 or more frames per second there is an illusion of continuous movement (due to the phi phenomenon) generating such a film is very labor-intensive and tedious though the development of computer animation has greatly sped up the process
because animation is very time-consuming and often very expensive to produce the majority of animation for tv and films comes from professional animation studios however the field of independent animation has existed at least since the 1950s with animation being produced by independent studios (and sometimes by a single person) several independent animation producers have gone on to enter the professional animation industry
limited animation is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of animation by using short cuts in the animation process this method was pioneered by upa and popularized by hanna-barbera in the united states and by osamu tezuka in japan and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from movie theaters to television
although most animation studios are now using digital technologies in their productions there is a specific style of animation that depends on film camera-less animation made famous by film-makers like norman mclaren len lye and stan brakhage is painted and drawn directly onto pieces of film and then run through a projector

while motion picture films have been around for more than a century film is still a relative newcomer in the pantheon of fine arts in the 1950s when television became widely available industry analysts predicted the demise of local cinemas despite competition from television's increasing technological sophistication over the 1960s and 1970s such as the development of color television and large screens motion picture cinemas continued in fact with the rise of television's predominance film began to become more respected as an artistic medium by contrast due the low general opinion of the quality of average television content in the 1980s when the widespread availability of inexpensive videocassette recorders enabled people to select films for home viewing industry analysts again wrongly predicted the death of the local cinemas
in the 1990s and 2000s the development of dvd players home theater amplification systems with surround sound and subwoofers and large lcd or plasma screens enabled people to select and view films at home with greatly improved audio and visual reproduction these new technologies provided audio and visual that in the past only local cinemas had been able to provide a large clear widescreen presentation of a film with a full-range high-quality multi-speaker sound system once again industry analysts predicted the demise of the local cinema local cinemas will be changing in the 21st century and moving towards digital screens a new approach which will allow for easier and quicker distribution of films (via satellite or hard disks) a development which may give local theaters a reprieve from their predicted demise the cinema now faces a new challenge from home video by the likes of a new high definition (hd) format blu-ray which can provide full hd 1080p video playback at near cinema quality video formats are gradually catching up with the resolutions and quality that film offers 1080p in blu-ray offers a pixel resolution of 19201080 a leap from the dvd offering of 720480 and the 330480 offered by the first home video standard vhs ultra hd a future digital video format will offer a resolution of 76804320
however the nature and structure of film prevents an apples-to-apples comparison with regard to resolution the resolving power of film and its ability to capture an image which can later be scanned to a digital format will ensure that film remains a viable medium for some time to come currently the super-16 format is seeing use as a capture medium with digital scanning and post-production providing good results
despite the rise of all-new technologies the development of the home video market and a surge of online copyright infringement 2007 was a record year in film that showed the highest ever box-office grosses many expected film to suffer as a result of the effects listed above but it has flourished strengthening film studio expectations for the future
