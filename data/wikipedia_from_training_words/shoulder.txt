the human shoulder is made up of three bones the clavicle (collarbone) the scapula (shoulder blade) and the humerus (upper arm bone) as well as associated muscles ligaments and tendons the articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joints the shoulder joint also known as the glenohumeral joint is the major joint of the shoulder but can more broadly include the acromioclavicular joint in human anatomy the shoulder joint comprises the part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula the head sitting in the glenoid cavity the shoulder is the group of structures in the region of the joint
there are two kinds of cartilage in the joint the first type is the white hyaline cartilage on the ends of the bones (called articular cartilage) which allows the bones to glide and move on each other when this type of cartilage starts to wear out (a process called arthritis) the joint becomes painful and stiff the glenoid labrum is the second kind of cartilage in the shoulder which is distinctly different from the articular cartilage this cartilage is more fibrous or rigid than the cartilage on the ends of the ball and socket also this cartilage is also found only around the socket where it is attached
the shoulder must be mobile enough for the wide range actions of the arms and hands but also stable enough to allow for actions such as lifting pushing and pulling the compromise between mobility and stability results in a large number of shoulder problems not faced by other joints such as the hip
== structures ==
=== bones ===
bone is living tissue that makes up the body's skeleton providing shape and support the bones that form the shoulder are the clavicle humerus and scapula the latter providing the glenoid cavity acromion and coracoid processes these three bones create a ball-and-socket glenohumeral joint that gives the shoulder its wide range of motion in three different planes in order for this joint to be operational ligaments muscles and tendons must support the bone and maintain the relationship of one to another joints are formed by the ligamentous connection between two adjacent bones examples of both ligaments and joints are demonstrated by the glenohumeral acromiclavicular and sternoclavicular regions
=== joints ===
the joints of the shoulder are the shoulder joint (or glenohumeral joint) and the acromioclavicular joint another joint in the shoulder is the sternoclavicular joint that articulates with the sternum and clavicle
==== shoulder joint ====
the shoulder joint (also known as the glenohumeral joint) is the main joint of the shoulder it is a ball and socket joint that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body it is formed by the articulation between the head of the humerus and the lateral scapula (specifically-the glenoid cavity of the scapula) the ball of the joint is the rounded medial anterior surface of the humerus and the socket is formed by the glenoid cavity the dish-shaped portion of the lateral scapula the shallowness of the cavity and relatively loose connections between the shoulder and the rest of the body allows the arm to have tremendous mobility at the expense of being much easier to dislocate than most other joints in the body there is an approximately 4-to-1 disproportion in size between the large head of the humerus and the shallow glenoid cavity.the glenoid cavity is made deeper by the addition of the fibrocartilaginous ring of the glenoid labrum
the capsule is a soft tissue envelope that encircles the glenohumeral joint and attaches to the scapula humerus and head of the biceps it is lined by a thin smooth synovial membrane this capsule is strengthened by the coracohumeral ligament which attaches the coracoid process of the scapula to the greater tubercle of the humerus there are also three other ligaments attaching the lesser tubercle of the humerus to lateral scapula and are collectively called the glenohumeral ligaments
the transverse humeral ligament which passes from the lesser tubercle to the greater tubercle of humerus covers the intertubercular groove in which the long head of biceps brachii travels
==== sternoclavicular joint ====
the sternoclavicular occurs at the medial end of the clavicle with the manubrium or top most portion of the sternum the clavicle is triangular and rounded and the manubrium is convex the two bones articulate the joint consists of a tight capsule and complete intra-articular disc which ensures stability of the joint the costoclavicular ligament is the main limitation to movement therefore the main stabilizer of the joint a fibrocartilaginous disc present at the joint increases the range of movement sternoclavicular dislocation is rare but may result from direct trauma to the clavicle or indirect forces applied to the shoulder posterior dislocations deserve special attention as they have the potential to be life-threatening because of the risk of damage to vital structures in the mediastinum
=== muscles ===
==== major muscles ====
the muscles that are responsible for movement in the shoulder attach to the scapula humerus and clavicle the muscles that surround the shoulder form the shoulder cap and underarm
==== rotator cuff ====
the muscles of the rotator cuff are supraspinatus subscapularis infraspinatus and teres minor all contributing to the stability of the shoulder the cuff adheres to the glenohumeral capsule and attaches to the humeral head the upper edge of the subscapularis tendon and anterior edge of the supraspinatus muscle delineate a triangular space at the humeral head called the rotator interval the cuff plays two main roles
stabilizes the glenohumeral joint
rotates the humerus outward (external rotation)
the cuff centers the humeral head in the glenoid cavity and prevents upward migration of the humeral head caused by the pull of the deltoid muscle at the beginning of arm elevation furthermore the infraspinatus and the teres minor along with the anterior fibers of the deltoid muscle are responsible for external rotation of the arm
the four tendons of these muscles converge to form the rotator cuff tendon these tendinous insertions along with the articular capsule the coracohumeral ligament and the glenohumeral ligament complex blend into a confluent sheet before insertion into the humeral tuberosities the insertion site of the rotator cuff tendon at the greater tuberosity is often referred to as the footprint the infraspinatus and teres minor fuse near their musculotendinous junctions while the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons join as a sheath that surrounds the biceps tendon at the entrance of the bicipital groove the supraspinatus is most commonly involved in a rotator cuff tear
the insertions sites of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons have been further described as a five-layer structure providing a glimpse into the various types of tears that can form given the different fiber characteristics of each layer
== function ==
=== movements ===
the muscles and joints of the shoulder allow it to move through a remarkable range of motion making it one of the most mobile joints in the human body the shoulder can abduct adduct rotate be raised in front of and behind the torso and move through a full 360 in the sagittal plane this tremendous range of motion also makes the shoulder extremely unstable far more prone to dislocation and injury than other joints
the following describes the terms used for different movements of the shoulder
=== rotator cuff ===
the rotator cuff is an anatomical term given to the group of muscles and their tendons that act to stabilize the shoulder it is composed of the tendons and muscles (supraspinatus infraspinatus teres minor and subscapularis) that hold the head of the humerus (ball) in the glenoid cavity (socket)
two filmy sac-like structures called bursae permit smooth gliding between bone muscle and tendon they cushion and protect the rotator cuff from the bony arch of the acromion
== clinical significance ==
shoulder problems including pain are one of the more common reasons for physician visits for musculoskeletal symptoms the shoulder is the most movable joint in the body however it is an unstable joint because of the range of motion allowed this instability increases the likelihood of joint injury often leading to a degenerative process in which tissues break down and no longer function well major injuries to the shoulder include rotator cuff tear and bone fractures of one or more of the bones of the shoulder
=== fracture ===
shoulder fractures include
clavicle fracture
scapular fracture
proximal humerus fracture
=== shoulder imaging ===
there are several ways to depict the structures of the shoulder which consist of muscles tendons bones cartilage and soft tissue when deciding which medical imaging technique should be used there are a couple of factors that need to be taken into account firstly one has to consider the suspected clinical diagnosis together with the knowledge of the advantages and limitations of the various medical imaging techniques ( i.e conventional radiography ultrasound computer tomography and magnetic resonance) one has to make an informed decision which technique would best suit the specific situation
hodler et al recommend to start scanning with conventional x-rays taken from at least two planes since this method gives a wide first impression and even has the chance of exposing any frequent shoulder pathologies i.e decompensated rotator cuff tears tendinitis calcarea dislocations fractures usures and/or osteophytes furthermore x-rays are required for the planning of an optimal ct or mr image
conventional x-rays and ultrasonography are the primary tools used to confirm a diagnosis of injuries sustained to the rotator cuff for extended clinical questions imaging through magnetic resonance with or without intraarticular contrast agent is indicated
the conventional invasive arthrography is now-a-days being replaced by the non-invasive mri and us and is used as an imaging reserve for patients who are contraindicated for mri for example pacemaker-carriers with an unclear and unsure ultrasonography
=== conventional x-rays ===
==== a.-p.-projection 40 posterior oblique after grashey ====
the body has to be rotated about 30 to 45 degrees towards the shoulder to be imaged and the standing or sitting patient lets the arm hang
this method allows the diagnostician to judge
the joint gap and the vertical alignment towards the socket
the humerus head should be aligned in the neutral position and external rotation in a way towards the socket that a fictive continuous line can be seen this line is called bandi line otherwise known as the mnard-shenton line a discontinuous line alludes to a cranial decentralization of the humerus head
==== transaxillary projection ====
the arm should be abducted 80 to 100 degrees at a precise defined scapular or frontal plane
this method allows the diagnostician to judge
the horizontal alignment of the humerus head in respect to the socket and the lateral clavicle in respect to the acromion
lesions of the anterior and posterior socket border or of the tuberculum minus
the eventual non-closure of the acromial apophysis
the coraco-humeral interval
==== y-projection ====
the lateral contour of the shoulder should be positioned in front of the film in a way that the longitudinal axis of the scapula continues parallel to the path of the rays
this method allows the diagnostician to judge
the horizontal centralization of the humerus head and socket
the osseous margins of the coraco-acromial arch and hence the supraspinatus outlet canal
the shape of the acromion
this y-projection can be traced back to wijnblaths 1933 published cavitas-en-face projection
it must be pointed out that this projection has a low tolerance for errors and accordingly needs proper execution
=== ultrasound ===
there are several solid advantages of ultrasound it is relatively cheap does not emit any radiation is accessible is capable of visualizing tissue function in real time and allows to the performing of provocative maneuvers in order to replicate the patients pain those apparent benefits have helped ultrasound become a common initial choice for assessing tendons and soft tissues limitations include for example the high degree of operator dependence and the inability to define pathologies in bones one also has to have an extensive anatomical knowledge of the examined region and keep an open mind to normal variations and artifacts created during the scan
although musculoskeletal ultrasound training like medical training in general is a lifelong process kissin et al suggest that rheumatologists who taught themselves how to manipulate ultrasound can use it just as well as international musculo-skeletal ultrasound experts to diagnose common rheumatic conditions
after the introduction of high-frequency transducers in the mid-eighties ultrasound has become a conventional tool for taking accurate and precise images of the shoulder to support diagnosis
adequate for the examination are high-resolution high-frequency transducers with a transmission frequency of 5 7.5 and 10 mhz to improve the focus on structures close to the skin an additional water start-up length is advisable during the examination the patient is asked to be seated the affected arm is then adducted and the elbow is bent to 90 degrees slow and cautious passive lateral and/or medial rotations have the effect of being able to visualize different sections of the shoulder in order to also demonstrate those parts which are hidden under the acromion in the neutral position a maximum medial rotation with hyperextension behind the back is required
to avoid the different tendon echogenicities caused by different instrument settings middleton compared the tendons echogenicity with that of the deltoid muscle which is still lege artis
usually the echogenicity compared to the deltoid muscle is homogeneous intensified without dorsal echo extinction variability with reduced or intensified echo has also been found in healthy tendons bilateral comparison is very helpful when distinguishing and setting boundaries between physiological variants and a possible pathological finding degenerative changes at the rotator cuff often are found on both sides of the body consequently unilateral differences rather point to a pathological source and bilateral changes rather to a physiological variation
in addition a dynamic examination can help to differentiate between an ultrasound artifact and a real pathology
to accurately evaluate the echogenicity of an ultrasound one has to take into account the physical laws of reflection absorption and dispersion it is at all times important to acknowledge that the structures in the joint of the shoulder are not aligned in the transversal coronal or sagittal plane and that therefore during imaging of the shoulder the transducer head has to be hold perpendicularly or parallel to the structures of interest otherwise the appearing echogenicity may not be evaluated
==== orientation-aid for the longitudinal plane ====
as an aid to orientation it is advisable to begin the examination with the delineation of the acromion as it is easy to palpate and it has an identifiable echo extinction to adjust the longitudinal plane image the way it is known in the x-rays and the physical examination the acromion has to be visible at the image border
==== orientation-aid for the transversal plane ====
again it is advantageous to start above the acromion and then move the transducer to the humerus the acromion echo extinction disappears and the wheel-like figure with almost concentric projection of the deltoid muscle supraspinatus muscle tendon and humeral head-outline turns up as soon as the transducer is directed perpendicularly and parallel to the acromion edge using the anterior transversal plane one can depict the intraarticular part of the long head of the biceps brachii muscle additionally one can use the posterior transversal plane to depict the intersection of the infraspinatus muscle tendon and the posterior edge of the cavity
=== mri ===
orthopedics established early the mri as the tool of choice for joint- and soft tissue-imaging because its non-invasiveness the lack of radiation exposure multi planar slicing possibilities and the high soft tissue contrast
the mr imaging should provide joint details to the treating orthopedist to help him diagnose and decide the next appropriate therapeutic step to examine the shoulder the patient is lying and the concerned arm is in lateral rotation for signal detection it is recommended to use a surface-coil to find pathologies of the rotator cuff in the basic diagnostic investigation t2-weighted sequences with fat-suppression or stir sequences have proven value in general the examination should occur in the following three main planes axial oblique coronal and sagittal
most morphological changes and injuries are sustained to the supraspinatus tendon traumatic rotator cuff changes are often located antero-superior meanwhile degenerative changes more likely are supero-posterior
tendons are predominantly composed of dense collagen fiber bundles because of their extreme short t2-relaxation time they appear typically signal-weak respectively dark degenerative changes inflammations and also partial and complete tears cause loss of the original tendon structure fatty deposits mucous degeneration and hemorrhages lead to an increased intratendinal t1-image edema formations inflammatory changes and ruptures increase the signals in a t2-weighted image
==== magic angle artifact ====
erickson et al noticed and described a typical artifact and gave the phenomenon the name magic angle the magic angle describes a changed t2-relaxation time depending on the spatial orientation of the tissue to the main magnetic field if parts of the tendon are located at the area of the magic angle at 55 degrees to the main magnetic field their t2-relaxation time gets influenced and the signal heavily intensified unluckily these artifacts occupy similar areas where clinical relevant pathologies are found to avoid a wrong diagnosis it is recommended to exclude this phenomenon in a case of doubt through a heavy t2-weighted sequence or an additional fat-suppression at a proton weighted sequence
==== mra ====
while using mri true lesions at the rotator interval region between the parts of the supraspinatus and subscapularis are all but impossible to distinguish from normal synovium and capsule
in 1999 weishaupt d et al reached through two readers a significant better visibility of pully lesions at the rotator interval and the expected location of the reflection pulley of the long biceps and subscapularis tendon on parasagittal (reader1/reader2 sensitivity 86%/100% specificity 90%/70%) and axial (reader1/reader2 sensitivity 86%/93% specificity 90%/80%) mra images
when examining the rotator cuff the mra has a couple of advantages compared to the native mri through a fat suppressed t2-weighted spin echo mra can reproduce an extreme high fat-water-contrast which helps to detect water-deposits with better damage diagnosis in structurally changed collagen fiber bundles
== in other animals ==
tetrapod forelimbs are characterised by a high degree of mobility in the shoulder-thorax connection lacking a solid skeletal connection between the shoulder girdle and the vertebral column the forelimb's attachment to the trunk is instead mainly controlled by serratus lateralis and levator scapulae depending on locomotor style a bone connects the shoulder girdle to the trunk in some animals the coracoid bone in reptiles and birds and the clavicle in primates and bats but cursorial mammals lack this bone
in primates the shoulder shows characteristics that differ from other mammals including a well developed clavicle a dorsally shifted scapula with prominent acromion and spine and a humerus featuring a straight shaft and a spherical head
