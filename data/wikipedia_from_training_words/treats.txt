== background ==
hampton's translation of ibsen's a doll's house was a huge success he noted however that in the 1970s there were probably as many women trapped in unsatisfactory relationships with abusive men as in the 1870s and that ibsen's play was no longer provocative enough treats was an instant box office success at the royal court and in the west end
in 2007 it was revived in london at the garrick theatre with a cast including billie piper her real-life husband laurence fox and kris marshall
