terminology
cranial nerves generally named according structure function example olfactory nerve supplies smell facial nerve vii supplies motor innervation face latin lingua franca common language study anatomy nerves first documented recorded discussed many nerves maintain latin greek names including trochlear nerve iv named according structure supplies muscle attaches pulley greek trochlea trigeminal nerve v named accordance three components latin trigeminus meaning triplets vagus nerve x named wandering course latin vagus
cranial nerves numbered based rostralcaudal frontback position viewing brain brain carefully removed skull nerves typically visible numeric order one rude mnemonic used remember cranial nerves oh oh oh touch feel virgins girl vagina hymen
cranial nerves paths within outside skull paths within skull called intracranial paths outside skull called extracranial many holes skull called foramina nerves exit skull cranial nerves paired means occur right left sides body muscle skin additional function supplied nerve side body side originates referred ipsilateral function function opposite side origin nerve known contralateral function
intracranial course

ganglia
cranial nerves sensory parasympathetic ganglia collections cell bodies neurons located outside brain inside outside skull
sensory ganglia directly correspondent dorsal root ganglia spinal nerves known cranial sensory ganglia sensory ganglia exist nerves sensory function v vii viii ix x also parasympathetic ganglia part autonomic nervous system cranial nerves iii vii ix x
trigeminal ganglia trigeminal nerve v occupies space dura mater called trigeminal cave ganglion contains cell bodies sensory fibers three branches trigeminal nerve
geniculate ganglion facial nerve vii found nerve enters facial canal contains cell bodies sensory fibers facial nerve
superior inferior ganglia glossopharyngeal nerve ix located nerve passes jugular foramen contain cell bodies sensory fibers nerve
inferior ganglion vagus nerve nodose ganglion located jugular foramen contains cell bodies sensory fibers vagus nerve x
exiting skull extracranial course
emerging brain cranial nerves travel within skull must leave bony compartment order reach destinations often nerves pass holes skull called foramina travel destinations nerves pass bony canals longer pathways enclosed bone foramina canals may contain one cranial nerve may also contain blood vessels
olfactory nerve actually composed many small separate nerve fibers passes perforations cribiform plate part ethmoid bone fibers terminate upper part nasal cavity function convey impulses containing information odors brain
optic nerve ii passes optic foramen sphenoid bone travels eye conveys visual information brain
oculomotor nerve iii trochlear nerve iv abducens nerve vi ophthalmic branch trigeminal nerve v travel cavernous sinus superior orbital fissure passing skull orbit nerves control small muscles move eye also provide sensory innervation eye orbit
maxillary division trigeminal nerve v passes foramen rotundum sphenoid bone supply skin middle face
mandibular division trigeminal nerve v passes foramen ovale sphenoid bone supply lower face sensory innervation nerve also sends branches almost muscles control chewing
facial nerve vii vestibulocochlear nerve viii enter internal auditory canal temporal bone facial nerve reaches side face using stylomastoid foramen also temporal bone fibers spread reach control muscles facial expression vestibulocochlear nerve reaches organs control balance hearing temporal bone therefore reach external surface skull
glossopharyngeal ix vagus x accessory nerve xi leave skull via jugular foramen enter neck glossopharyngeal nerve provides innervation upper throat back tongue vagus provides innervation muscles voicebox continues downward supply parasympathetic innervation chest abdomen accessory nerve controls two muscles neck shoulder
hypoglossal nerve xii exits skull using hypoglossal canal occipital bone reaches tongue control almost muscles involved movements organ
function
cranial nerves provide motor sensory innervation mainly structures within head neck sensory innervation includes general sensation temperature touch special innervation taste vision smell balance hearing
vagus nerve x provides sensory autonomic parasympatheic motor innervation structures neck also organs chest abdomen
smell
olfactory nerve conveys sense smell
damage olfactory nerve cause inability smell anosmia distortion sense smell parosmia distortion lack taste suspicion change sense smell nostril tested substances known odors coffee soap intensely smelling substances example ammonia may lead activation pain receptors nociceptors trigeminal nerve located nasal cavity confound olfactory testing
vision ii
optic nerve ii transmits visual information
damage optic nerve ii affects specific aspects vision depend location lesion person may able see objects left right sides homonymous hemianopsia may difficulty seeing objects outer visual fields bitemporal hemianopsia optic chiasm involved vision may tested examining visual field examining retina ophthalmoscope using process known funduscopy visual field testing may used pinpoint structural lesions optic nerve along visual pathways
eye movement iii iv vi
oculomotor nerve iii trochlear nerve iv abducens nerve vi coordinate eye movement
damage nerves iii iv vi may affect movement eyeball globe one eye may affected either case double vision diplopia likely occur movements eyes longer synchronized nerves iii iv vi tested observing eye follows object different directions object may finger pin may moved different directions test pursuit velocity eyes work together likely cause damage specific cranial nerve nuclei
damage oculomotor nerve iii cause double vision diplopia inability coordinate movements eyes strabismus also eyelid drooping ptosis pupil dilation mydriasis lesions may also lead inability open eye due paralysis levator palpebrae muscle individuals suffering lesion oculomotor nerve may compensate tilting heads alleviate symptoms due paralysis one eye muscles controls
damage trochlear nerve iv also cause diplopia eye adducted elevated result eye move downwards properly especially downwards inward position due impairment superior oblique muscle innervated trochlear nerve
damage abducens nerve vi also result diplopia due impairment lateral rectus muscle innervated abducens nerve
trigeminal nerve v
trigeminal nerve v composed three distinct parts ophthalmic v maxillary v mandibular v nerves combined nerves provide sensation skin face also controls muscles mastication chewing conditions affecting trigeminal nerve v include trigeminal neuralgia cluster headache trigeminal zoster trigeminal neuralgia occurs later life middle age onwards often age condition typically associated strong pain distributed area innervated maxillary mandibular nerve divisions trigeminal nerve v v
facial expression vii
lesions facial nerve vii may manifest facial palsy person unable move muscles one sides face common generally temporarily facial palsy known bells palsy bells palsy result idiopathic unknown unilateral lower motor neuron lesion facial nerve characterized inability move ipsilateral muscles facial expression including elevation eyebrow furrowing forehead patients bells palsy often drooping mouth affected side often trouble chewing buccinator muscle affected
hearing balance viii
vestibulocochlear nerve viii splits vestibular cochlear nerve vestibular part responsible innervating vestibules semicircular canal inner ear structure transmits information balance important component vestibuloocular reflex keeps head stable allows eyes track moving objects cochlear nerve transmits information cochlea allowing sound heard
damaged vestibular nerve may give rise sensation spinning dizziness function vestibular nerve may tested putting cold warm water ears watching eye movements caloric stimulation damage vestibulocochlear nerve also present repetitive involuntary eye movements nystagmus particularly looking horizontal plane damage cochlear nerve cause partial complete deafness affected ear
oral sensation taste salivation ix
glossopharyngeal nerve ix innervates stylopharyngeus muscle provides sensory innervation oropharynx back tongue glossopharyngeal nerve also provides parasympathetic innervation parotid gland unilateral absence gag reflex suggests lesion glossopharyngeal nerve ix perhaps vagus nerve x

history
