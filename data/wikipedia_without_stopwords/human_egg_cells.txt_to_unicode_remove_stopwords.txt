vitrification latin vitreum glass via french vitrifier transformation substance glass ceramics impermeability water
descriptionedit
vitrification characteristic amorphous materials disordered systems occurs bonding elementary particles atoms molecules forming blocks becomes higher certain threshold value thermal fluctuations break bonds therefore lower temperature higher degree connectivity amorphous materials characteristic threshold temperature termed glass transition temperature tg tg amorphous materials glassy whereas tg molten
usually achieved rapidly cooling liquid glass transition certain chemical reactions also result glasses important application vitrification antifreezelike liquid cryopreservation
wider sense embedding material glassy matrix also called vitrification important application vitrification radioactive waste obtain stable compound suitable ultimate disposal

vitrification progressive partial fusion clay body result firing process vitrification proceeds proportion glassy bond increases apparent porosity fired product becomes progressively lower vitreous bodies open porosity may either opaque translucent context zero porosity may defined less water absorption however various standard procedures define conditions water absorption example astm state term vitreous generally signifies less absorption except floor wall tile lowvoltage electrical insulators considered vitreous water absorption
glazing alone make pottery impermeable water porcelain bone china sanitaryware examples vitrified pottery impermeable even without glaze stoneware may vitrified semivitrified latter type would impermeable without glaze
examplesedit
sucrose cooled slowly results crystal sugar rock candy cooled rapidly form syrupy cotton candy candyfloss process vitrification solid waste exposed heat converted sort glasslike substance
vitrification also occur starting liquid water usually rapid cooling introduction agents suppress formation ice crystals contrast ordinary freezing results ice crystal formation additives used cryobiology produced naturally organisms living polar regions called cryoprotectants
arctic frogs ectotherms naturally produce glycerol glucose livers reduce ice formation glucose used cryoprotectant arctic frogs massive amounts glucose released low temperature special form insulin allows extra glucose enter cells frog rewarms spring extra glucose must rapidly eliminated stored arctic insects also use sugars cryoprotectants arctic fish use antifreeze proteins sometimes appended sugars cryoprotectants
applicationsedit
ordinary sodalime glass used windows drinking containers created addition sodium carbonate lime calcium oxide silicon dioxide without additives silicon dioxide require high temperature obtain melt subsequently slow cooling glass
vitrification proven technique disposal longterm storage nuclear waste hazardous wastes method called geomelting waste mixed glassforming chemicals furnace form molten glass solidifies canisters thereby immobilizing waste final waste form resembles obsidian nonleaching durable material effectively traps waste inside waste stored relatively long periods form without concern air groundwater contamination bulk vitrification uses electrodes melt soil wastes lay buried hardened waste may disinterred less danger widespread contamination according pacific northwest national labs vitrification locks dangerous materials stable glass form last thousands years
ethylene glycol used automotive antifreeze propylene glycol used reduce ice crystals ice cream making smoother
vitrification cryopreservation used common method preserve example human egg cells oocytes oocyte cryopreservation embryos embryo cryopreservation years glycerol used cryobiology cryoprotectant blood cells bull sperm allowing storage liquid nitrogen temperatures however glycerol cannot used protect whole organs damage instead many biotechnology companies researching development cryoprotectants suitable uses successful discovery may eventually make possible bulk cryogenic storage banking transplantable human xenobiotic organs substantial step direction already occurred twentyfirst century medicine vitrified rabbit kidney c proprietary vitrification cocktail upon rewarming kidney successfully transplanted rabbit complete functionality viability able sustain rabbit indefinitely sole functioning kidney
currently vitrification techniques applied brains neurovitrification alcor upper body cryonics institute research progress organizations apply vitrification whole body
