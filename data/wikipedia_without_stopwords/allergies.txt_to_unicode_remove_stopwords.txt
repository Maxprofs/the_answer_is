allergies also known allergic diseases number conditions caused hypersensitivity immune system something environment usually causes little problem people diseases include hay fever food allergies atopic dermatitis allergic asthma anaphylaxis symptoms may include red eyes itchy rash runny nose shortness breath swelling food intolerances food poisoning separate conditions
common allergens include pollen food metals substances may also cause problems food insect stings medications common causes severe reactions development due genetic environmental factors underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin e antibodies ige part bodys immune system binding allergen receptor mast cells basophils triggers release inflammatory chemicals histamine diagnosis typically based persons medical history testing skin blood may useful certain cases positive tests however may mean significant allergy substance question
early exposure potential allergens may protective treatments allergies include avoiding known allergens use medications steroids antihistamines severe reactions injectable adrenaline epinephrine recommended allergen immunotherapy gradually exposes people larger larger amounts allergen useful types allergies hay fever reactions insect bites use food allergies unclear
allergies common developed world people affected allergic rhinitis people least one food allergy atopic dermatitis point time depending country people asthma anaphylaxis occurs people rates many allergic diseases appear increasing word allergy first used clemens von pirquet
signs symptoms
many allergens dust pollen airborne particles cases symptoms arise areas contact air eyes nose lungs instance allergic rhinitis also known hay fever causes irritation nose sneezing itching redness eyes inhaled allergens also lead increased production mucus lungs shortness breath coughing wheezing
aside ambient allergens allergic reactions result foods insect stings reactions medications like aspirin antibiotics penicillin symptoms food allergy include abdominal pain bloating vomiting diarrhea itchy skin swelling skin hives food allergies rarely cause respiratory asthmatic reactions rhinitis insect stings antibiotics certain medicines produce systemic allergic response also called anaphylaxis multiple organ systems affected including digestive system respiratory system circulatory system depending rate severity cause cutaneous reactions bronchoconstriction edema hypotension coma even death type reaction triggered suddenly onset delayed severity type allergic response often requires injections epinephrine sometimes device known epipen twinject autoinjector nature anaphylaxis reaction seem subsiding may recur throughout prolonged period time
substances come contact skin latex also common causes allergic reactions known contact dermatitis eczema skin allergies frequently cause rashes swelling inflammation within skin known wheal flare reaction characteristic hives angioedema
cause
risk factors allergy placed two general categories namely host environmental factors host factors include heredity sex race age heredity far significant however recent increases incidence allergic disorders cannot explained genetic factors alone four major environmental candidates alterations exposure infectious diseases early childhood environmental pollution allergen levels dietary changes
foods
wide variety foods cause allergic reactions allergic responses foods caused cows milk soy eggs wheat peanuts tree nuts fish shellfish food allergies affecting less person per population may considered rare
common food allergy us population sensitivity crustacea although peanut allergies notorious severity peanut allergies common food allergy adults children severe lifethreatening reactions may triggered allergens common combined asthma
rates allergies differ adults children peanut allergies sometimes outgrown children egg allergies affect one two percent children outgrown twothirds children age sensitivity usually proteins white rather yolk
milkprotein allergies common children approximately milkprotein reactions immunoglobulin emediated remaining usually attributable inflammation colon people unable tolerate milk goats sheep well cows many also unable tolerate dairy products cheese roughly children milk allergy reaction beef beef contains small amount protein present cows milk lactose intolerance common reaction milk form allergy rather due absence enzyme digestive tract
tree nut allergies may allergic one many tree nuts including pecans pistachios pine nuts walnuts also seeds including sesame seeds poppy seeds contain oils protein present may elicit allergic reaction
allergens transferred one food another genetic engineering however genetic modification also remove allergens little research done natural variation allergen concentrations unmodified crops
nonfood proteins
latex trigger igemediated cutaneous respiratory systemic reaction prevalence latex allergy general population believed less one percent hospital study surgical patients percent reported latex sensitivity although sensitivity among healthcare workers higher seven ten percent researchers attribute higher level exposure healthcare workers areas significant airborne latex allergens operating rooms intensivecare units dental suites latexrich environments may sensitize healthcare workers regularly inhale allergenic proteins
prevalent response latex allergic contact dermatitis delayed hypersensitive reaction appearing dry crusted lesions reaction usually lasts hours sweating rubbing area glove aggravates lesions possibly leading ulcerations anaphylactic reactions occur often sensitive patients exposed surgeons latex gloves abdominal surgery mucosal exposures dental procedures also produce systemic reactions
latex banana sensitivity may crossreact furthermore latex allergy may also sensitivities avocado kiwifruit chestnut people often perioral itching local urticaria occasionally foodinduced allergies induced systemic responses researchers suspect crossreactivity latex banana avocado kiwifruit chestnut occurs latex proteins structurally homologous plant proteins
medications
people report allergic penicillin however turn serious allergies occur
toxins interacting proteins
another nonfood protein reaction urushiolinduced contact dermatitis originates contact poison ivy eastern poison oak western poison oak poison sumac urushiol protein acts hapten chemically reacts binds changes shape integral membrane proteins exposed skin cells immune system recognize affected cells normal parts body causing tcellmediated immune response poisonous plants sumac virulent resulting dermatological response reaction urushiol membrane proteins includes redness swelling papules vesicles blisters streaking
estimates vary percentage population immune system response approximately percent population strong allergic response urushiol general approximately percent percent adults develop rash exposed milligrams gr purified urushiol people sensitive takes molecular trace skin initiate allergic reaction
genetics
allergic diseases strongly familial identical twins likely allergic diseases time allergy occurs time nonidentical twins allergic parents likely allergic children childrens allergies likely severe children nonallergic parents allergies however consistent along genealogies parents allergic peanuts may children allergic ragweed seems likelihood developing allergies inherited related irregularity immune system specific allergen
risk allergic sensitization development allergies varies age young children risk several studies shown ige levels highest childhood fall rapidly ages years peak prevalence hay fever highest children young adults incidence asthma highest children
overall boys higher risk developing allergies girls although diseases namely asthma young adults females likely affected differences sexes tend decrease adulthood
ethnicity may play role allergies however racial factors difficult separate environmental influences changes due migration suggested different genetic loci responsible asthma specific people european hispanic asian african origins
hygiene hypothesis
allergic diseases caused inappropriate immunological responses harmless antigens driven thmediated immune response many bacteria viruses elicit thmediated immune response downregulates th responses first proposed mechanism action hygiene hypothesis insufficient stimulation th arm immune system leads overactive th arm turn leads allergic disease words individuals living sterile environment exposed enough pathogens keep immune system busy since bodies evolved deal certain level pathogens exposed level immune system attack harmless antigens thus normally benign microbial objects like pollen trigger immune response
hygiene hypothesis developed explain observation hay fever eczema allergic diseases less common children larger families presumed exposed infectious agents siblings children families one child hygiene hypothesis extensively investigated immunologists epidemiologists become important theoretical framework study allergic disorders used explain increase allergic diseases seen since industrialization higher incidence allergic diseases developed countries hygiene hypothesis expanded include exposure symbiotic bacteria parasites important modulators immune system development along infectious agents
epidemiological data support hygiene hypothesis studies shown various immunological autoimmune diseases much less common developing world industrialized world immigrants industrialized world developing world increasingly develop immunological disorders relation length time since arrival industrialized world longitudinal studies third world demonstrate increase immunological disorders country grows affluent presumed cleaner use antibiotics first year life linked asthma allergic diseases use antibacterial cleaning products also associated higher incidence asthma birth caesarean section rather vaginal birth
stress
chronic stress aggravate allergic conditions attributed helper thpredominant response driven suppression interleukin autonomic nervous system hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis stress management highly susceptible individuals may improve symptoms
environmental factors
international differences associated number individuals within population allergy allergic diseases common industrialized countries countries traditional agricultural higher rate allergic disease urban populations versus rural populations although differences becoming less defined
alterations exposure microorganisms another plausible explanation present increase atopic allergy endotoxin exposure reduces release inflammatory cytokines tnf ifn interleukin interleukin white blood cells leukocytes circulate blood certain microbesensing proteins known tolllike receptors found surface cells body also thought involved processes
gutworms similar parasites present untreated drinking water developing countries present water developed countries routine chlorination purification drinking water supplies recent research shown common parasites intestinal worms eg hookworms secrete chemicals gut wall hence bloodstream suppress immune system prevent body attacking parasite gives rise new slant hygiene hypothesis theory coevolution man parasites led immune system functions correctly presence parasites without immune system becomes unbalanced oversensitive particular research suggests allergies may coincide delayed establishment gut flora infants however research support theory conflicting studies performed china ethiopia showing increase allergy people infected intestinal worms clinical trials initiated test effectiveness certain worms treating allergies may term parasite could turn inappropriate fact hitherto unsuspected symbiosis work information topic see helminthic therapy
pathophysiology
acute response
early stages allergy type hypersensitivity reaction allergen encountered first time presented professional antigenpresenting cell causes response type immune cell called th lymphocyte belongs subset cells produce cytokine called interleukin il th cells interact lymphocytes called b cells whose role production antibodies coupled signals provided il interaction stimulates b cell begin production large amount particular type antibody known ige secreted ige circulates blood binds igespecific receptor kind fc receptor called fcri surface kinds immune cells called mast cells basophils involved acute inflammatory response igecoated cells stage sensitized allergen
later exposure allergen occurs allergen bind ige molecules held surface mast cells basophils crosslinking ige fc receptors occurs one igereceptor complex interacts allergenic molecule activates sensitized cell activated mast cells basophils undergo process called degranulation release histamine inflammatory chemical mediators cytokines interleukins leukotrienes prostaglandins granules surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects vasodilation mucous secretion nerve stimulation smooth muscle contraction results rhinorrhea itchiness dyspnea anaphylaxis depending individual allergen mode introduction symptoms systemwide classical anaphylaxis localized particular body systems asthma localized respiratory system eczema localized dermis
latephase response
chemical mediators acute response subside latephase responses often occur due migration leukocytes neutrophils lymphocytes eosinophils macrophages initial site reaction usually seen hours original reaction cytokines mast cells may play role persistence longterm effects latephase responses seen asthma slightly different seen allergic responses although still caused release mediators eosinophils still dependent activity th cells
allergic contact dermatitis
although allergic contact dermatitis termed allergic reaction usually refers type hypersensitivity pathophysiology actually involves reaction correctly corresponds type iv hypersensitivity reaction type iv hypersensitivity activation certain types cells cd destroy target cells contact well activated macrophages produce hydrolytic enzymes
diagnosis
effective management allergic diseases relies ability make accurate diagnosis allergy testing help confirm rule allergies correct diagnosis counseling avoidance advice based valid allergy test results reduces incidence symptoms need medications improves quality life assess presence allergenspecific ige antibodies two different methods used skin prick test allergy blood test methods recommended similar diagnostic value
skin prick tests blood tests equally costeffective health economic evidence shows tests costeffective compared test also early accurate diagnoses save cost due reduced consultations referrals secondary care misdiagnosis emergency admissions
allergy undergoes dynamic changes time regular allergy testing relevant allergens provides information patient management changed order improve health quality life annual testing often practice determining whether allergy milk egg soy wheat outgrown testing interval extended years allergy peanut tree nuts fish crustacean shellfish results followup testing guide decisionmaking regarding whether safe introduce reintroduce allergenic food diet
skin prick testing
skin testing also known puncture testing prick testing due series tiny punctures pricks made patients skin small amounts suspected allergens andor extracts eg pollen grass mite proteins peanut extract introduced sites skin marked pen dye inkdye carefully selected lest cause allergic response small plastic metal device used puncture prick skin sometimes allergens injected intradermally patients skin needle syringe common areas testing include inside forearm back
patient allergic substance visible inflammatory reaction usually occur within minutes response range slight reddening skin fullblown hive called wheal flare sensitive patients similar mosquito bite interpretation results skin prick test normally done allergists scale severity meaning borderline reactivity large reaction increasingly allergists measuring recording diameter wheal flare reaction interpretation welltrained allergists often guided relevant literature patients may believe determined allergic sensitivity observation skin test shown much better patient observation detect allergy
serious lifethreatening anaphylactic reaction brought patient evaluation allergists prefer initial blood test prior performing skin prick test skin tests may option patient widespread skin disease taken antihistamines last several days
patch testing
patch testing method used determine specific substance causes allergic inflammation skin tests delayed reactions used help ascertain cause skin contact allergy contact dermatitis adhesive patches usually treated number common allergic chemicals skin sensitizers applied back skin examined possible local reactions least twice usually hours application patch two three days later
blood testing
allergy blood test quick simple ordered licensed health care provider eg allergy specialist gp ped unlike skinprick testing blood test performed irrespective age skin condition medication symptom disease activity pregnancy adults children age take allergy blood test babies young children single needle stick allergy blood testing often gentle several skin tests
allergy blood test available laboratories sample patients blood sent laboratory analysis results sent back days later multiple allergens detected single blood sample allergy blood tests safe since person exposed allergens testing procedure
test measures concentration specific ige antibodies blood quantitative ige test results increase possibility ranking different substances may affect symptoms rule thumb higher ige antibody value greater likelihood symptoms allergens found low levels today result symptoms nevertheless help predict future symptom development quantitative allergy blood result help determine patient allergic help predict follow disease development estimate risk severe reaction explain crossreactivity
low total ige level adequate rule sensitization commonly inhaled allergens statistical methods roc curves predictive value calculations likelihood ratios used examine relationship various testing methods methods shown patients high total ige high probability allergic sensitization investigation allergy tests specific ige antibodies carefully chosen allergens often warranted
challenge testing challenge testing small amounts suspected allergen introduced body orally inhalation via routes except testing food medication allergies challenges rarely performed type testing chosen must closely supervised allergist
eliminationchallenge tests testing method used often foods medicines patient suspected allergen instructed modify diet totally avoid allergen set time patient experiences significant improvement may challenged reintroducing allergen see symptoms reproduced
unreliable tests types allergy testing methods unreliable including applied kinesiology allergy testing muscle relaxation cytotoxicity testing urine autoinjection skin titration rinkel method provocative neutralization subcutaneous testing sublingual provocation
differential diagnosis
diagnosis allergic disease confirmed possible causes presenting symptoms considered vasomotor rhinitis example one many maladies shares symptoms allergic rhinitis underscoring need professional differential diagnosis diagnosis asthma rhinitis anaphylaxis allergic disease made several methods discovering causative agent allergy
prevention
consumption various foods pregnancy linked eczema include celery citrus fruit raw pepper margarine vegetable oil high intake antioxidants zinc selenium pregnancy may help prevent allergies linked reduced risk childhoodonset asthma wheezing eczema research needs conducted probiotic supplements taken pregnancy infancy may help prevent atopic dermatitis birth early introduction solid food high diversity week could increase childs risk allergies studies suggest introduction solid food avoidance highly allergenic food peanuts first year help allergy prevention
management
management allergies typically involves avoiding triggers allergy medications improve symptoms allergen immunotherapy may useful types allergies
medication
several medications maybe used block action allergic mediators prevent activation cells degranulation processes include antihistamines glucocorticoids epinephrine mast cell stabilizers antileukotriene agents common treatments allergic diseases anticholinergics decongestants compounds thought impair eosinophil chemotaxis also commonly used epinephrine important anaphylaxis
immunotherapy
allergen immunotherapy useful environmental allergies allergies insect bites asthma benefit food allergies unclear thus recommended immunotherapy involves exposing people larger larger amounts allergen affect change immune systems response
metaanalyses found injections allergens skin effective treatment allergic rhinitis children asthma benefits may last years treatment stopped generally safe effective allergic rhinitis conjunctivitis allergic forms asthma stinging insects
evidence also supports use sublingual immunotherapy rhinitis asthma less strong seasonal allergies benefit small form allergen given tongue people often prefer injections immunotherapy recommended standalone treatment asthma
alternative medicine
experimental treatment enzyme potentiated desensitization epd tried decades generally accepted effective epd uses dilutions allergen enzyme betaglucuronidase tregulatory lymphocytes supposed respond favoring desensitization downregulation rather sensitization epd also tried treatment autoimmune diseases evidence show effectiveness
review found effectiveness homeopathic treatments difference compared placebo authors concluded based rigorous clinical trials types homeopathy childhood adolescence ailments convincing evidence supports use homeopathic treatments
epidemiology
allergic diseases hay fever asthma increased western world past decades increases allergic asthma atopic disorders industrialized nations estimated began increases occurring although suggest steady rise sensitization occurring since number new cases per year atopy developing countries general remained much lower
changing frequency
although genetic factors govern susceptibility atopic disease increases atopy occurred within short time frame explained genetic change population thus pointing environmental lifestyle changes several hypotheses identified explain increased rate increased exposure perennial allergens due housing changes increasing time spent indoors changes cleanliness hygiene resulted decreased activation common immune control mechanism coupled dietary changes obesity decline physical exercise hygiene hypothesis maintains high living standards hygienic conditions exposes children fewer infections thought reduced bacterial viral infections early life direct maturing immune system away th type responses leading unrestrained th responses allow increase allergy
changes rates types infection alone however unable explain observed increase allergic disease recent evidence focused attention importance gastrointestinal microbial environment evidence shown exposure food fecaloral pathogens hepatitis toxoplasma gondii helicobacter pylori also tend prevalent developing countries reduce overall risk atopy increased rate parasitic infections associated decreased prevalence asthma speculated infections exert effect critically altering thth regulation important elements newer hygiene hypotheses also include exposure endotoxins exposure pets growing farm
history
concept allergy originally introduced viennese pediatrician clemens von pirquet noted patients hypersensitive normally innocuous entities dust pollen certain foods pirquet called phenomenon allergy ancient greek words allos meaning ergon meaning work
forms hypersensitivity used classified allergies thought caused improper activation immune system later became clear several different disease mechanisms implicated common link disordered activation immune system new classification scheme designed philip gell robin coombs described four types hypersensitivity reactions known type type iv hypersensitivity new classification word allergy restricted type hypersensitivities also called immediate hypersensitivity characterized rapidly developing reactions
major breakthrough understanding mechanisms allergy discovery antibody class labeled immunoglobulin e ige kimishige ishizaka coworkers first isolate describe ige
