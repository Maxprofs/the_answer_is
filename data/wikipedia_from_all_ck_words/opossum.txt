the opossums also known by their scientific name didelphimorphia /dadlfmrfi/) make up the largest order of marsupials in the western hemisphere including 103 or more species in 19 genera of south american ancestry they entered north america following the connection of the two continents their unspecialized biology flexible diet and reproductive habits make them successful colonizers and survivors in diverse locations and conditions
== etymologyedit ==
the word opossum is borrowed from the virginia algonquian (powhatan) language and was first recorded between 1607 and 1611 by the jamestown colonists john smith (as opassom") and william strachey (as aposoum") the word ultimately derives from the proto-algonquian word *wap- aemw meaning white dog or white beast/animal
they are also commonly called possums particularly in the southern united states and midwest the term possum was borrowed into use to describe distantly related australian marsupials (specifically those of the suborder phalangeriformes) when australia became known to europeans
== characteristicsedit ==
didelphimorphs are small to medium-sized marsupials ranging in size from a large house cat to a small mouse they tend to be semi-arboreal omnivores although there are many exceptions most members of this taxon have long snouts a narrow braincase and a prominent sagittal crest the dental formula is 5.1.3.44.1.3.4 by mammalian standards this is an unusually full jaw the incisors are very small the canines large and the molars are tricuspid
didelphimorphs have a plantigrade stance (feet flat on the ground) and the hind feet have an opposable digit with no claw like some new world monkeys opossums have prehensile tails like all marsupials the fur consists of awn hair only and the females have a pouch the tail and parts of the feet bear scutes the stomach is simple with a small cecum notably the male opossum has a forked penis bearing twin glandes
opossums have a remarkably robust immune system and show partial or total immunity to the venom of rattlesnakes cottonmouths and other pit vipers opossums are about eight times less likely to carry rabies than wild dogs and about one in eight hundred opossums is infected with this virus
although all living opossums are essentially opportunistic omnivores different species vary in the amount of meat and vegetation they include in their diet members of the caluromyinae are essentially frugivorous whereas the lutrine opossum and patagonian opossum primarily feed on other animals the yapok (chironectes minimus) is particularly unusual as it is the only living semi-aquatic marsupial using its webbed hindlimbs to dive in search of freshwater mollusks and crayfish most opossums are scansorial well-adapted to life in the trees or on the ground but members of the caluromyinae and glironiinae are primarily arboreal whereas species of metachirus monodelphis and to a lesser degree didelphis show adaptations for life on the ground
=== reproduction and life cycleedit ===
as a marsupial the opossum has a reproductive system including a divided uterus and marsupium which is the pouch the average estrous cycle of the opossum is about 28 days opossums do possess a placenta but it is short-lived simple in structure and unlike that of placental mammals is not fully functional the young are therefore born at a very early stage although the gestation period is similar to many other small marsupials at only 12 to 14 days once born the offspring must find their way into the marsupium to hold on to and nurse from a teat
female opossums often give birth to very large numbers of young most of which fail to attach to a teat although as many as thirteen young can attach and therefore survive depending on species the young are weaned between 70 and 125 days when they detach from the teat and leave the pouch the opossum lifespan is unusually short for a mammal of its size usually only two to four years senescence is rapid
the species are moderately sexually dimorphic with males usually being slightly larger much heavier and having larger canines than females the largest difference between the opossum and non-marsupial mammals is the bifurcated penis of the male and bifurcated vagina of the female (the source of the term didelphimorph, from the greek didelphys, meaning double-wombed) opossum spermatozoa exhibit sperm-pairing forming conjugate pairs in the epididymis this may ensure that flagella movement can be accurately coordinated for maximal motility conjugate pairs dissociate into separate spermatozoa before fertilization
=== behavioredit ===
opossums are usually solitary and nomadic staying in one area as long as food and water are easily available some families will group together in ready-made burrows or even under houses though they will temporarily occupy abandoned burrows they do not dig or put much effort into building their own as nocturnal animals they favor dark secure areas these areas may be below ground or above
when threatened or harmed they will play possum mimicking the appearance and smell of a sick or dead animal this physiological response is involuntary (like fainting) rather than a conscious act in the case of baby opossums however the brain does not always react this way at the appropriate moment and therefore they often fail to play dead when threatened when an opossum is playing possum the animal's lips are drawn back the teeth are bared saliva foams around the mouth the eyes close or half-close and a foul-smelling fluid is secreted from the anal glands the stiff curled form can be prodded turned over and even carried away without reaction the animal will typically regain consciousness after a period of between 40 minutes and 4 hours a process that begins with slight twitching of the ears
adult opossums do not hang from trees by their tails as sometimes depicted though babies may dangle temporarily their semi-prehensile tails are not strong enough to support a mature adult's weight instead the opossum uses its tail as a brace and a fifth limb when climbing the tail is occasionally used as a grip to carry bunches of leaves or bedding materials to the nest a mother will sometimes carry her young upon her back where they will cling tightly even when she is climbing or running
threatened opossums (especially males) will growl deeply raising their pitch as the threat becomes more urgent males make a clicking smack noise out of the side of their mouths as they wander in search of a mate and females will sometimes repeat the sound in return when separated or distressed baby opossums will make a sneezing noise to signal their mother if threatened the baby will open its mouth and quietly hiss until the threat is gone
=== biochemistryedit ===
opossums are remarkably resistant to snake venom ricin and botulinum
== habitatedit ==
opossums can be found throughout north america but are considered an invasive species in place such as southern ontario and british columbia
== in hunting and foodwaysedit ==
the virginia opossum was once widely hunted and consumed in the united states
in dominica grenada and trinidad the common opossum or manicou is popular and can only be hunted during certain times of the year owing to overhunting the meat is traditionally prepared by smoking then stewing it is light and fine-grained but the musk glands must be removed as part of preparation the meat can be used in place of rabbit and chicken in recipes historically hunters in the caribbean would place a barrel with fresh or rotten fruit to attract opossums that would feed on the fruit or insects
in mexico opossums are known as tlacuache or tlacuatzin their tails are eaten as a folk remedy to improve fertility
opossum oil (possum grease) is high in essential fatty acids and has been used as a chest rub and a carrier for arthritis remedies given as topical salves
opossum pelts have long been part of the fur trade
