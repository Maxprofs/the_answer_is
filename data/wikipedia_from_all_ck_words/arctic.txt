the arctic (/rktk/ or /rtk/) is a polar region located at the northernmost part of the earth the arctic consists of the arctic ocean and parts of alaska (united states) canada finland greenland (denmark) iceland norway russia and sweden the arctic region consists of a vast ocean with a seasonally varying ice cover surrounded by treeless permafrost the area can be defined as north of the arctic circle (66 33'n) the approximate limit of the midnight sun and the polar night alternatively it can be defined as the region where the average temperature for the warmest month (july) is below 10 c (50 f) the northernmost tree line roughly follows the isotherm at the boundary of this region
socially and politically the arctic region includes the northern territories of the eight arctic states although by natural science definitions much of this territory is considered subarctic the arctic region is a unique area among earth's ecosystems for example the cultures in the region and the arctic indigenous peoples have adapted to its cold and extreme conditions in recent years the extent of the sea ice has declined life in the arctic includes organisms living in the ice zooplankton and phytoplankton fish and marine mammals birds land animals plants and human societies
== etymology ==
the word arctic comes from the greek word (arktikos) near the bear northern and that from the word (arktos) meaning bear the name refers either to the constellation ursa major the great bear which is prominent in the northern portion of the celestial sphere or to the constellation ursa minor the little bear which contains polaris the pole star also known as the north star
== climate ==
the arctic's climate is characterized by cold winters and cool summers precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow the arctic's annual precipitation is low with most of the area receiving less than 50 cm (20 in) high winds often stir up snow creating the illusion of continuous snowfall average winter temperatures can be as low as 40 c (40 f) and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately 68 c (90 f) coastal arctic climates are moderated by oceanic influences having generally warmer temperatures and heavier snowfalls than the colder and drier interior areas the arctic is affected by current global warming leading to arctic sea ice shrinkage and arctic methane release
due to the poleward migration of the planet's isotherms (about 35 mi (56 km) per decade during the past 30 years as a consequence of global warming) the arctic region (as defined by tree line and temperature) is currently shrinking perhaps the most spectacular result of arctic shrinkage is sea ice loss there is a large variance in predictions of arctic sea ice loss with models showing near-complete to complete loss in september from 2040 to some time well beyond 2100 about half of the analyzed models show near-complete to complete sea ice loss in september by the year 2100
ole henrik ellestad a professor ii and former director of research said that media skips over the expedition report ([from] 1923) from captain martin ingebrigtsen who had sailed in the arctic since 1867 the arctic was not the one that he had known the glaciers on svalbard had receded several kilometers - fauna and flora had changed significantly the sea north of svalbard was ten degrees [celsius] warmer and white fish was gone from the regular fiskeplasser [or fish places"] and yet the warm period continued with the well known 1930s with the gulf stream warmest around 1945 one hundred ships sailed thru the north east passage in 1940 - four in 2014
== flora and fauna ==
=== plants ===
arctic vegetation is composed of plants such as dwarf shrubs graminoids herbs lichens and mosses which all grow relatively close to the ground forming tundra as one moves northward the amount of warmth available for plant growth decreases considerably in the northernmost areas plants are at their metabolic limits and small differences in the total amount of summer warmth make large differences in the amount of energy available for maintenance growth and reproduction colder summer temperatures cause the size abundance productivity and variety of plants to decrease trees cannot grow in the arctic but in its warmest parts shrubs are common and can reach 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in height sedges mosses and lichens can form thick layers in the coldest parts of the arctic much of the ground is bare non-vascular plants such as lichens and mosses predominate along with a few scattered grasses and forbs (like the arctic poppy)
=== animals ===
herbivores on the tundra include the arctic hare lemming muskox and caribou they are preyed on by the snowy owl arctic fox and wolf the polar bear is also a predator though it prefers to hunt for marine life from the ice there are also many birds and marine species endemic to the colder regions other land animals include wolverines ermines and arctic ground squirrels marine mammals include seals walrus and several species of cetaceanbaleen whales and also narwhals killer whales and belugas an excellent and famous example of a ring seal ring species exists and has been described around the arctic circle in the form of the larus gulls
== natural resources ==
the arctic includes sizable natural resources (oil gas minerals fresh water fish and if the subarctic is included forest) to which modern technology and the economic opening up of russia have given significant new opportunities the interest of the tourism industry is also on the increase
the arctic is one of the last and most extensive continuous wilderness areas in the world and its significance in preserving biodiversity and genotypes is considerable the increasing presence of humans fragments vital habitats the arctic is particularly susceptible to the abrasion of groundcover and to the disturbance of the rare reproduction places of the animals that are characteristic to the region the arctic also holds 1/5 of the earth's water supply
== palaeontology ==
during the cretaceous time period the arctic still had seasonal snows though only a light dusting and not enough to permanently hinder plant growth animals such as the chasmosaurus hypacrosaurus troodon and edmontosaurus may have all migrated north to take advantage of the summer growing season and migrated south to warmer climes when the winter came a similar situation may also have been found amongst dinosaurs that lived in antarctic regions such as the muttaburrasaurus of australia
== indigenous population ==
the earliest inhabitants of north america's central and eastern arctic are referred to as the arctic small tool tradition (ast) and existed c 2500 bc ast consisted of several paleo-eskimo cultures including the independence cultures and pre-dorset culture the dorset culture (inuktitut tuniit or tunit) refers to the next inhabitants of central and eastern arctic the dorset culture evolved because of technological and economic changes during the period of 1050550 bc with the exception of the quebec/labrador peninsula the dorset culture vanished around 1500 ad supported by genetic testing evidence shows that descendants of the dorset culture known as the sadlermiut survived in aivilik southampton and coats islands until the beginning of the 20th century
the dorset/thule culture transition dates around the 9th10th centuries scientists theorize that there may have been cross-contact of the two cultures with sharing of technology such as fashioning harpoon heads or the thule may have found dorset remnants and adapted their ways with the predecessor culture others believe the thule displaced the dorset by 1300 the inuit present-day arctic inhabitants and descendants of thule culture had settled in west greenland and moved into east greenland over the following century over time the inuit have migrated throughout the arctic regions of canada greenland russia and the united states
other circumpolar north indigenous peoples include the buryat chukchi evenks inupiat khanty koryaks nenets sami yukaghir and yupik the yupik still refer to themselves as eskimo which means snowshoe netters not raw meat eaters as it is sometimes mistakenly translated
== international cooperation and politics ==
the eight arctic nations (canada denmark (greenland & the faroe islands) finland iceland norway sweden russia and usa) are all members of the arctic council as are organizations representing six indigenous populations the council operates on consensus basis mostly dealing with environmental treaties and not addressing boundary or resource disputes
though arctic policy priorities differ every arctic nation is concerned about sovereignty/defense resource development shipping routes and environmental protection much work remains on regulatory agreements regarding shipping tourism and resource development in arctic waters
research in the arctic has long been a collaborative international effort evidenced perhaps most notably by the international polar year the international arctic science committee hundreds of scientists and specialists of the arctic council and the barents euro-arctic council are more examples of collaborative international arctic research
=== territorial claims ===
no country owns the geographic north pole or the region of the arctic ocean surrounding it the surrounding six arctic states that border the arctic oceancanada denmark (via greenland) iceland norway russia and the united statesare limited to a 200 nautical miles (370 km 230 mi) economic zone around their coasts two arctic states (finland and sweden) do not border the arctic ocean
upon ratification of the united nations convention on the law of the sea a country has ten years to make claims to an extended continental shelf beyond its 200 nautical mile zone due to this norway (which ratified the convention in 1996) russia (ratified in 1997) canada (ratified in 2003) and denmark (ratified in 2004) launched projects to establish claims that certain sectors of the arctic seabed should belong to their territories
on 2 august 2007 two russian bathyscaphes mir-1 and mir-2 for the first time in history descended to the arctic seabed beneath the north pole and placed there a russian flag made of rust-proof titanium alloy the mission was a scientific expedition but the flag-placing during arktika 2007 raised concerns of a race for control of the arctic's vast petroleum resources
foreign ministers and other officials representing canada denmark norway russia and the united states met in ilulissat greenland on 28 may 2008 at the arctic ocean conference and announced the ilulissat declaration blocking any new comprehensive international legal regime to govern the arctic ocean, and pledging the orderly settlement of any possible overlapping claims.
as of 2012 denmark is claiming the continental shelf between greenland and the north pole the russian federation is claiming a large swath of seabed along the lomonosov ridge but confined to its sector of the arctic
=== exploration ===
since 1937 the whole arctic region has been extensively explored by soviet and russian manned drifting ice stations between 1937 and 1991 88 international polar crews established and occupied scientific settlements on the drift ice and were carried thousands of kilometers by the ice flow
=== pollution ===
the arctic is comparatively clean although there are certain ecologically difficult localized pollution problems that present a serious threat to people's health living around these pollution sources due to the prevailing worldwide sea and air currents the arctic area is the fallout region for long-range transport pollutants and in some places the concentrations exceed the levels of densely populated urban areas an example of this is the phenomenon of arctic haze which is commonly blamed on long-range pollutants another example is with the bioaccumulation of pcb's (polychlorinated biphenyls) in arctic wildlife and people
=== preservation ===
there have been many proposals to preserve the arctic over the years most recently a group of stars at the rio earth summit on 21 june 2012 proposed protecting the arctic similar to the antarctic protection the initial focus of the campaign will be a un resolution creating a global sanctuary around the pole and a ban on oil drilling and unsustainable fishing in the arctic
== climate change ==
the arctic is especially vulnerable to the effects of any climate change as has become apparent with the reduction of sea ice in recent years climate models predict much greater warming in the arctic than the global average resulting in significant international attention to the region in particular there are concerns that arctic shrinkage a consequence of melting glaciers and other ice in greenland could soon contribute to a substantial rise in sea levels worldwide the climate models on which the ipcc report number 4 is based give a range of predictions of arctic sea ice loss showing near-complete to complete loss in september anywhere from 2040 to some time well beyond 2100 about half of the analyzed models show near-complete to complete sea ice loss in september by the year 2100 more recently the catlin arctic survey concluded that summer ice loss would occur around 2029 it has been apparent though since 2007 that those models grossly underestimate sea ice loss
as can be seen in the two plot at the right since about 1995 to 2000 all three size numbers of the arctic sea ice shield (extent area and volume) are decreasing in an accelerated way this downward movement is modulated by statistical variations which lead to considerable media attention when a new record has been reached
concerning melting records 2012 was a productive year thus corroborating the tendency of the past decade this may have been furthered by a strong summer storm cyclone a rare event in the arctic which spread the already very thin ice and caused mixing of the cold surface waters with deeper warmer water layers according to the university of bremen in september 2011 the arctic ice cap was smaller than ever recorded (the satellite measurements started in the 1970s) arctic ice is declining in area and thinning arctic temperatures have risen more than twice as fast as the global average over the past half century the speed of change has shocked scientists if current trends continue a largely ice-free arctic in the summer is likely within 30 years up to 40 years earlier than was anticipated by the ipcc fourth assessment report
as the volume of sea ice until recently could not be measured by remote sensing as easy as its extent numerical models have been made to estimate the ice thickness field between known points which then is summed up to yield ice volume the resulting volume over time reveals a much stronger loss of ice than ice extent studies suggest
the current arctic shrinkage is leading to fears of arctic methane release release of methane stored in permafrost could cause abrupt and severe global warming as methane is a potent greenhouse gas on millennial time-scales decomposition of methane hydrates in the arctic seabed could also amplify global warming previous methane release events have been linked to the great dying a mass extinction event at the boundary of the permian and triassic and the paleoceneeocene thermal maximum in which temperatures abruptly increased
apart from concerns regarding the detrimental effects of warming in the arctic some potential opportunities have gained attention the melting of the ice is making the northwest passage the shipping routes through the northernmost latitudes more navigable raising the possibility that the arctic region will become a prime trade route in addition it is believed that the arctic seabed may contain substantial oil fields which may become accessible if the ice covering them melts these factors have led to recent international debates as to which nations can claim sovereignty or ownership over the waters of the arctic
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration's arctic report card presents annually updated peer-reviewed information on recent observations of environmental conditions in the arctic relative to historical records
participation in international cooperation on climate change can be enhanced by monetary transfers market-based mechanisms technology transfer and trade-related measures.
