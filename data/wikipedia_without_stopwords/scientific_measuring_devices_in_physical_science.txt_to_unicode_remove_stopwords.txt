science systematic enterprise builds organizes knowledge form testable explanations predictions universe older closely related meaning science also refers body knowledge type rationally explained reliably applied
contemporary science typically subdivided natural sciences study material world social sciences study people societies formal sciences like mathematics formal sciences often excluded depend empirical observations disciplines use science like engineering medicine may also considered applied sciences
classical antiquity th century science type knowledge closely linked philosophy fact west early modern period terms science natural philosophy sometimes used interchangeably refer study natural phenomena
th th centuries scientists increasingly sought formulate knowledge terms laws nature course th century word science became increasingly associated scientific method disciplined way study natural world including physics chemistry geology biology th century also term scientist began applied sought knowledge understanding nature
history
science broad sense existed modern era many historical civilizations modern science distinct approach successful results modern science defines science strictest sense term
science original sense word type knowledge rather specialized word pursuit knowledge particular one types knowledge people communicate share example knowledge working natural things gathered long recorded history led development complex abstract thinking shown construction complex calendars techniques making poisonous plants edible buildings pyramids however consistent conscientious distinction made knowledge things true every community types communal knowledge mythologies legal systems
antiquity
invention discovery concept nature ancient greek phusis presocratic philosophers words tend used describe natural way plant grows way example one tribe worships particular god reason claimed men first philosophers strict sense also first people clearly distinguish nature convention science therefore distinguished knowledge nature things true every community name specialized pursuit knowledge philosophy realm first philosopherphysicists mainly speculators theorists particularly interested astronomy contrast trying use knowledge nature imitate nature artifice technology greek techn seen classical scientists appropriate interest lower class artisans clearcut distinction formal eon empirical science doxa made presocratic philosopher parmenides fl late sixth early fifth century bce although work peri physeos poem may viewed epistemological essay essay method natural science parmenides may refer formal system calculus describe nature precisely natural languages physis may identical
major turning point history early philosophical science controversial successful attempt socrates apply philosophy study human things including human nature nature political communities human knowledge criticized older type study physics purely speculative lacking selfcriticism particularly concerned early physicists treated nature could assumed intelligent order explaining things merely terms motion matter study human things realm mythology tradition socrates executed aristotle later created less controversial systematic programme socratic philosophy teleological humancentred rejected many conclusions earlier scientists example physics sun goes around earth many things part nature humans thing formal cause final cause role rational cosmic order motion change described actualization potentials already things according types things socratics insisted philosophy used consider practical question best way live human study aristotle divided ethics political philosophy argue types applied science
aristotle maintained sharp distinction science practical knowledge artisans treating theoretical speculation highest type human activity practical thinking good living something less lofty knowledge artisans something suitable lower classes contrast modern science aristotles influential emphasis upon theoretical steps deducing universal rules raw data treat gathering experience raw data part science
medieval science
late antiquity early middle ages aristotelian approach inquiries natural phenomena used ancient knowledge lost cases kept obscurity fall roman empire periodic political struggles however general fields science natural philosophy called much general knowledge ancient world remained preserved though works early latin encyclopedists like isidore seville also byzantine empire many greek science texts preserved syriac translations done groups nestorians monophysites many translated later arabic caliphate many types classical learning preserved cases improved upon house wisdom established abbasidera baghdad iraq considered major intellectual center islamic golden age muslim scholars alkindi ibn sahl baghdad ibn alhaytham cairo flourished ninth thirteenth centuries mongol sack baghdad ibn alhaytham known later west alhazen furthered aristotelian viewpoint emphasizing experimental data later medieval period demand translations grew example toledo school translators western europeans began collecting texts written latin also latin translations greek arabic hebrew texts aristotle ptolemy euclid preserved houses wisdom sought amongst catholic scholars europe alhazens de aspectibus directly influenced roger bacon th century england argued experimental science demonstrated alhazen late middle ages synthesis catholicism aristotelianism known scholasticism flourishing western europe become new geographic center science aspects scholasticism criticized th th centuries

scientific method
scientific method seeks explain events nature reproducible way explanatory thought experiment hypothesis put forward explanation using principles parsimony also known occams razor generally expected seek consiliencefitting well accepted facts related phenomena new explanation used make falsifiable predictions testable experiment observation predictions posted confirming experiment observation sought proof tampering occurred disproof prediction evidence progress done partly observation natural phenomena also experimentation tries simulate natural events controlled conditions appropriate discipline observational sciences astronomy geology predicted observation might take place controlled experiment experimentation especially important science help establish causal relationships avoid correlation fallacy
hypothesis proves unsatisfactory either modified discarded hypothesis survived testing may become adopted framework scientific theory logically reasoned selfconsistent model framework describing behavior certain natural phenomena theory typically describes behavior much broader sets phenomena hypothesis commonly large number hypotheses logically bound together single theory thus theory hypothesis explaining various hypotheses vein theories formulated according scientific principles hypotheses addition testing hypotheses scientists may also generate model based observed phenomena attempt describe depict phenomenon terms logical physical mathematical representation generate new hypotheses tested
performing experiments test hypotheses scientists may preference one outcome another important ensure science whole eliminate bias achieved careful experimental design transparency thorough peer review process experimental results well conclusions results experiment announced published normal practice independent researchers doublecheck research performed follow performing similar experiments determine dependable results might taken entirety scientific method allows highly creative problem solving minimizing effects subjective bias part users namely confirmation bias
mathematics formal sciences
mathematics essential sciences one important function mathematics science role plays expression scientific models observing collecting measurements well hypothesizing predicting often require extensive use mathematics arithmetic algebra geometry trigonometry calculus example essential physics virtually every branch mathematics applications science including pure areas number theory topology
statistical methods mathematical techniques summarizing analyzing data allow scientists assess level reliability range variation experimental results statistical analysis plays fundamental role many areas natural sciences social sciences
computational science applies computing power simulate realworld situations enabling better understanding scientific problems formal mathematics alone achieve according society industrial applied mathematics computation important theory experiment advancing scientific knowledge
whether mathematics properly classified science matter debate thinkers see mathematicians scientists regarding physical experiments inessential mathematical proofs equivalent experiments others see mathematics science since require experimental test theories hypotheses mathematical theorems formulas obtained logical derivations presume axiomatic systems rather combination empirical observation logical reasoning come known scientific method general mathematics classified formal science natural social sciences classified empirical sciences

practical impacts scientific research
discoveries fundamental science worldchanging example
scientific community
scientific community group interacting scientists includes many subcommunities working particular scientific fields within particular institutions interdisciplinary crossinstitutional activities also significant
branches fields
scientific fields commonly divided two major groups natural sciences study natural phenomena including biological life social sciences study human behavior societies groupings empirical sciences means knowledge must based observable phenomena capable tested validity researchers working conditions also related disciplines grouped interdisciplinary applied sciences engineering medicine within categories specialized scientific fields include parts scientific disciplines often possess nomenclature expertise
mathematics classified formal science similarities differences empirical sciences natural social sciences similar empirical sciences involves objective careful systematic study area knowledge different method verifying knowledge using priori rather empirical methods formal sciences also include statistics logic vital empirical sciences major advances formal science often led major advances empirical sciences formal sciences essential formation hypotheses theories laws discovering describing things work natural sciences people think act social sciences
apart broad meaning word science sometimes may specifically refer fundamental sciences maths natural sciences alone science schools faculties within many institutions separate medicine engineering applied science
institutions
learned societies communication promotion scientific thought experimentation existed since renaissance period oldest surviving institution italian accademia dei lincei established respective national academies science distinguished institutions exist number countries beginning british royal society french acadmie des sciences
international scientific organizations international council science since formed promote cooperation scientific communities different nations many governments dedicated agencies support scientific research prominent scientific organizations include national science foundation us national scientific technical research council argentina academies science many nations csiro australia centre national de la recherche scientifique france max planck society deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft germany spain csic
literature
enormous range scientific literature published scientific journals communicate document results research carried universities various research institutions serving archival record science first scientific journals journal des savans followed philosophical transactions began publication since time total number active periodicals steadily increased one estimate number scientific technical journals publication united states national library medicine currently indexes journals contain articles topics related life sciences although journals languages percent indexed articles published english
scientific journals cover single scientific field publish research within field research normally expressed form scientific paper science become pervasive modern societies generally considered necessary communicate achievements news ambitions scientists wider populace
science magazines new scientist science vie scientific american cater needs much wider readership provide nontechnical summary popular areas research including notable discoveries advances certain fields research science books engage interest many people tangentially science fiction genre primarily fantastic nature engages public imagination transmits ideas methods science
recent efforts intensify develop links science nonscientific disciplines literature specifically poetry include creative writing science resource developed royal literary fund
science society
women science
science traditionally maledominated field notable exceptions women historically faced considerable discrimination science much areas maledominated societies frequently passed job opportunities denied credit work example christine ladd able enter phd program c ladd christine kitty ladd completed requirements awarded degree career spanned algebra logic see truth table color vision psychology work preceded notable researchers like ludwig wittgenstein charles sanders peirce achievements women science attributed defiance traditional role laborers within domestic sphere
late th century active recruitment women elimination institutional discrimination basis sex greatly increased number female scientists large gender disparities remain fields half new biologists female phds physics given men feminists claim result culture rather innate difference sexes experiments shown parents challenge explain boys girls asking reflect deeply logically early part st century america women earned bachelors degrees masters degrees phds science engineering fields women earning half degrees three fields psychology social sciences biology however comes physical sciences geosciences math engineering computer science women earned less half degrees however lifestyle choice also plays major role female engagement science women young children less likely take tenuretrack positions due worklife balance issues female graduate students interest careers research declines dramatically course graduate school whereas male colleagues remains unchanged
science policy
science policy area public policy concerned policies affect conduct scientific enterprise including research funding often pursuance national policy goals technological innovation promote commercial product development weapons development health care environmental monitoring science policy also refers act applying scientific knowledge consensus development public policies science policy thus deals entire domain issues involve natural sciences accordance public policy concerned wellbeing citizens science policys goal consider science technology best serve public
state policy influenced funding public works science thousands years dating least time mohists inspired study logic period hundred schools thought study defensive fortifications warring states period china great britain governmental approval royal society th century recognized scientific community exists day professionalization science begun th century partly enabled creation scientific organizations national academy sciences kaiser wilhelm institute state funding universities respective nations public policy directly affect funding capital equipment intellectual infrastructure industrial research providing tax incentives organizations fund research vannevar bush director office scientific research development united states government forerunner national science foundation wrote july science proper concern government
science technology research often funded competitive process potential research projects evaluated promising receive funding processes run government corporations foundations allocate scarce funds total research funding developed countries gdp oecd around twothirds research development scientific technical fields carried industry respectively universities government government funding proportion certain industries higher dominates research social science humanities similarly exceptions eg biotechnology government provides bulk funds basic scientific research commercial research development researchoriented corporations focus heavily nearterm commercialisation possibilities rather bluesky ideas technologies nuclear fusion
media perspectives
mass media face number pressures prevent accurately depicting competing scientific claims terms credibility within scientific community whole determining much weight give different sides scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding matter journalists real scientific knowledge even beat reporters know great deal certain scientific issues may ignorant scientific issues suddenly asked cover
political usage
many issues damage relationship science media use science scientific arguments politicians broad generalisation many politicians seek certainties facts whilst scientists typically offer probabilities caveats however politicians ability heard mass media frequently distorts scientific understanding public examples britain include controversy mmr inoculation forced resignation government minister edwina currie revealing high probability battery farmed eggs contaminated salmonella
john horgan chris mooney researchers us canada described scientific certainty argumentation methods scams organization think tank makes goal cast doubt supported science conflicts political agendas hank campbell microbiologist alex berezow described feelgood fallacies used politics politicians frame positions way makes people feel good supporting certain policies even scientific evidence shows need worry need dramatic change current programs
science public
various activities developed approximate general public sciencescientists science outreach public awareness science science communication science festivals citizen science science journalism public science popular science etc see science public related concepts science represented stem fields
philosophy science
working scientists usually take granted set basic assumptions needed justify scientific method objective reality shared rational observers objective reality governed natural laws laws discovered means systematic observation experimentation philosophy science seeks deep understanding underlying assumptions mean whether valid
belief scientific theories represent metaphysical reality known realism contrasted antirealism view success science depend accurate unobservable entities electrons one form antirealism idealism belief mind consciousness basic essence mind generates reality idealistic world view true one mind need true minds
different schools thought philosophy science popular position empiricism holds knowledge created process involving observation scientific theories result generalizations observations empiricism generally encompasses inductivism position tries explain way general theories justified finite number observations humans make hence finite amount empirical evidence available confirm scientific theories necessary number predictions theories make infinite means cannot known finite amount evidence using deductive logic many versions empiricism exist predominant ones bayesianism hypotheticodeductive method
empiricism stood contrast rationalism position originally associated descartes holds knowledge created human intellect observation critical rationalism contrasting thcentury approach science first defined austrianbritish philosopher karl popper popper rejected way empiricism describes connection theory observation claimed theories generated observation observation made light theories way theory affected observation comes conflict popper proposed replacing verifiability falsifiability landmark scientific theories replacing induction falsification empirical method popper claimed actually one universal method specific science negative method criticism trial error covers products human mind including science mathematics philosophy art
another approach instrumentalism colloquially termed shut calculate emphasizes utility theories instruments explaining predicting phenomena views scientific theories black boxes input initial conditions output predictions relevant consequences theoretical entities logical structure claimed something simply ignored scientists shouldnt make fuss see interpretations quantum mechanics close instrumentalism constructive empiricism according main criterion success scientific theory whether says observable entities true
paul k feyerabend advanced idea epistemological anarchism holds useful exceptionfree methodological rules governing progress science growth knowledge idea science operate according universal fixed rules unrealistic pernicious detrimental science feyerabend advocates treating science ideology alongside others religion magic mythology considers dominance science society authoritarian unjustified also contended along imre lakatos demarcation problem distinguishing science pseudoscience objective grounds possible thus fatal notion science running according fixed universal rules feyerabend also stated science evidence philosophical precepts particularly notion uniformity law uniformity process across time space
finally another approach often cited debates scientific skepticism controversial movements like scientific creationism methodological naturalism main point difference natural supernatural explanations made science restricted methodologically natural explanations restriction merely methodological rather ontological means science consider supernatural explanations claim wrong either instead supernatural explanations left matter personal belief outside scope science methodological naturalism maintains proper science requires strict adherence empirical study independent verification process properly developing evaluating explanations observable phenomena absence standards arguments authority biased observational studies common fallacies frequently cited supporters methodological naturalism characteristic nonscience criticize
certainty science
scientific theory empirical always open falsification new evidence presented theory ever considered strictly certain science accepts concept fallibilism philosopher science karl popper sharply distinguishes truth certainty writes scientific knowledge consists search truth search certainty human knowledge fallible therefore uncertain
new scientific knowledge rarely results vast changes understanding according psychologist keith stanovich may medias overuse words like breakthrough leads public imagine science constantly proving everything thought true false famous cases theory relativity required complete reconceptualization extreme exceptions knowledge science gained gradual synthesis information different experiments various researchers across different branches science like climb leap theories vary extent tested verified well acceptance scientific community example heliocentric theory theory evolution relativity theory germ theory still bear name theory even though practice considered factual philosopher barry stroud adds although best definition knowledge contested skeptical entertaining possibility one incorrect compatible correct ironically scientist adhering proper scientific approaches doubt even possess truth fallibilist c peirce argued inquiry struggle resolve actual doubt merely quarrelsome verbal hyperbolic doubt fruitlessbut also inquirer try attain genuine doubt rather resting uncritically common sense held successful sciences trust single chain inference stronger weakest link cable multiple various arguments intimately connected
stanovich also asserts science avoids searching magic bullet avoids singlecause fallacy means scientist would ask merely cause rather significant causes especially case macroscopic fields science eg psychology cosmology course research often analyzes factors always added long list factors important consider example knowing details persons genetics history upbringing current situation may explain behaviour deep understanding variables combined predictive
