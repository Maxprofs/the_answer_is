hunting relies heavily vision mantises primarily diurnal many species however fly night may attracted artificial lights nocturnal flight especially important males locating lessmobile females detecting pheromones flying night exposes mantises fewer bird predators diurnal flight would many mantises also auditory thoracic organ helps avoid bats detecting echolocation calls responding evasively
mantis thorax consists prothorax mesothorax metathorax species apart genus mantoida prothorax bears head fore legs much longer two thoracic segments prothorax also flexibly articulated allowing wide range movements head fore limbs remainder body remains less immobile

reproduction life historyedit
mating season temperate climates typically takes place autumn tropical areas mating occur anytime year mate following courtship male usually leaps onto females back clasping thorax wing bases fore legs arches abdomen deposit store sperm special chamber near tip females abdomen female lays eggs depending species eggs typically deposited frothy mass produced glands abdomen froth hardens creating protective capsule together egg mass called ootheca depending species ootheca attached flat surface wrapped around plant even deposited ground despite versatility durability eggs often preyed especially several species parasitoid wasps species mostly ground bark mantises family tarachodidae mother guards eggs cryptic tarachodes maurus positions bark abdomen covering egg capsule ambushing passing prey moving little eggs hatch unique reproductive strategy adopted brunners stick mantis southern united states males ever found species females breed parthenogenetically temperate climates adults survive winter eggs undergo diapause hatching spring

sexual cannibalismedit
sexual cannibalism common among predatory species mantises captivity sometimes observed field quarter malefemale encounters results males eaten female around predatory species mantises participate sexual cannibalism adult males typically outnumber females first numbers may fairly equivalent later adult stage possibly females selectively eat smaller males tenodera sinensis males escape cannibalism encounter female since multiple matings occur probability males cannibalized increases cumulatively
female may begin feeding biting males head regular prey mating begun males movements may become even vigorous delivery sperm early researchers thought copulatory movement controlled ganglion abdomen head removal males head reproductive strategy females enhance fertilization obtaining sustenance later behavior appeared artifact intrusive laboratory observation whether behavior natural field also result distractions caused human observer remains controversial mantises highly visual organisms notice disturbance laboratory field bright lights moving scientists chinese mantises fed ad libitum hungry actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior left undisturbed male engages female courtship dance change interest feeding mating circumstances female known respond defensive deimatic display flashing colored eyespots inside front legs
reason sexual cannibalism debated consider submissive males gain selective advantage producing offspring theory supported quantifiable increase duration copulation among males cannibalized cases doubling duration chance fertilization contrasted study males seen approach hungry females caution shown remain mounted hungry females longer time indicating males actively avoid cannibalism may mate multiple females study also found hungry females generally attracted fewer males well fed act dismounting copulation dangerous males time females frequently cannibalize mates increase mounting duration appears indicate males wait opportune time dismount female hungry likely cannibalize mate
