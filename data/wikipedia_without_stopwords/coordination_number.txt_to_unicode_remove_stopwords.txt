chemistry crystallography materials science coordination number central atom molecule crystal number near neighbours number determined somewhat differently molecules crystals
molecules polyatomic ions coordination number atom determined simply counting atoms bonded either single multiple bonds example crnhclbr cr central cation coordination number

usage quasicrystal liquid disordered systems
coordination number systems disorder cannot precisely defined
first coordination number defined using radial distribution function
rightmost position starting whereon approximately zero first minimum therefore area first peak
second coordination number defined similarly
alternative definitions coordination number found literature essence main idea one definition follows denote position first peak
first coordination shell spherical shell radius around central particle investigation
