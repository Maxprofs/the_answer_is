in an interview about the album with the harvard crimson diana hubbard explained her motivation and inspiration for the album she said she wanted to compose music that is felt but not heard and attempted to revitalize the romantic aspects to jazz she said that her work was not trying to be any structured thing in all of us we have the dreamer
hubbard characterized her composition style as impressionistic paintings in music in an interview with the st petersburg times she commented my music is for the time when people want to turn out the lights listen and escape into another world  to dream places  to little magical places in which the listener can participate and become involved. regarding a potential audience hubbard said my music is for intelligent listeners who don't mind if i change chords and are willing to see what happens next. explaining why written text did not accompany the songs hubbard said i wrote lots of poetry but somehow it didn't feel right to have lyrics with the pieces i'd rather leave that slot open for the listener.
she wrote liner notes for each piece in the album describing exactly what type of vision she was attempting to evoke with her compositions for her description of the first track on the album rose coloured lights hubbard wrote that the picture she was trying to bring about for the listener was a yacht in the mediterranean leaning over a rail at night thinking the whole spectrum of love the champagne of c'est la vie in a million stories...

== reception ==
billboard highlighted the album in its column billboard's top album picks in the section first time around billboard described the album as a light classics pop lp and noted the music is mostly soft and pretty drawing from many ethnic sources. the sarasota herald-tribune described the album as an instrumental with a medieval quality in the all-encompassing and sometimes mysterious sound of strings piano and rhythm section the repetitive phrasing and rolling melody are synthesized tone and nuance. the st petersburg times described hubbard's piano compositions as fresh haunting melodies
in a review of the album for the harvard crimson thomas m levenson wrote hubbard's music does not as a result offend the listener it's not execrable it is just extraordinarily dull as a pianist/composer hubbard sounds like bruckner rewritten for the dentist's office. don lewis reviewed the album for the milwaukee journal and commented it's peaceful attractive music even though after a while it sounds like many of miss hubbard's compositions are swatches from the same bolt of cloth.
rose coloured lights was issued as a single on waterhouse 15003 and hit #40 on the billboard adult contemporary chart in 1980
