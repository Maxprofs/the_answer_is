=== etymology of siam"edit ===
the country has always been called mueang thai by its citizens by others it is known by the exonym siam (thai rtgs sayam pronounced [sjm] also spelled siem sym or syma) the word siam has been identified with the sanskrit yma ( meaning dark or brown") the names shan and a-hom seem to be variants of the same word the word yma is possibly not its origin but a learned and artificial distortion
the signature of king mongkut (r 1851 1868) reads sppm (somdet phra poramenthra maha) mongkut king of siam giving it official status until 23 june 1939 when it was changed to thailand thailand was renamed siam from 1945 to 11 may 1949 after which it again reverted to thailand
=== etymology of thailand"edit ===
according to george cds the word thai () means free man in the thai language differentiating the thai from the natives encompassed in thai society as serfs. a famous thai scholar argued that thai () simply means people or human being since his investigation shows that in some rural areas the word thai was used instead of the usual thai word khon () for people
while thai people will often refer to their country using the polite form prathet thai (thai ) they most commonly use the more colloquial term mueang thai (thai ) or simply thai the word mueang archaically a city-state commonly used to refer to a city or town as the centre of a region ratcha anachak thai (thai ) means kingdom of thailand or kingdom of thai etymologically its components are ratcha (sanskrit raja king royal realm")  -ana- (pali authority command power itself from an old indo-aryan form j of the same meaning) -chak (from sanskrit cakra- wheel a symbol of power and rule) the thai national anthem (thai ) written by luang saranupraphan during the extremely patriotic 1930s refers to the thai nation as prathet thai (thai ) the first line of the national anthem is prathet thai ruam lueat nuea chat chuea thai (thai ) thailand is the unity of thai flesh and blood.
== historyedit ==
there is evidence of human habitation in thailand that has been dated at 40,000 years before the present with stone artefacts dated to this period at tham lod rockshelter in mae hong son similar to other regions in southeast asia thailand was heavily influenced by the culture and religions of india starting with the kingdom of funan around the 1st century ce to the khmer empire
indian influence on thai culture was partly the result of direct contact with indian settlers but mainly it was brought about indirectly via the indianized kingdoms of dvaravati srivijaya and cambodia e:a voretzsch believes that buddhism must have been flowing into siam from india in the time of the indian emperor ashoka of the maurya empire and far on into the first millennium after christ later thailand was influenced by the south indian pallava dynasty and north indian gupta empire
according to george cds the thai first enter history of farther india in the eleventh century with the mention of syam slaves or prisoners of war in champa epigraphy and in the twelfth century the bas-reliefs of angkor wat where a group of warriors are described as syam additionally the mongols after the seizure of ta-li on january 7 1253 and the pacification of yunnan in 1257 did not look with disfavor on the creation of a series of thai principalities at the expense of the old indianized kingdoms. the menam basin was originally populated by the mons and the location of dvaravati in the 7th century followed by the khmer empire in the 11th the history of the yuan mentions an embassy from the kingdom of sukhothai in 1282 in 1287 three thai chiefs mangrai ngam muang and ram khamhaeng formed a strong pact of friendship
after the fall of the khmer empire in the 13th century various states thrived there established by the various tai peoples mons khmers chams and ethnic malays as seen through the numerous archaeological sites and artefacts that are scattered throughout the siamese landscape prior to the 12th century however the first thai or siamese state is traditionally considered to be the buddhist sukhothai kingdom which was founded in 1238
following the decline and fall of the khmer empire in the 13th15th century the buddhist tai kingdoms of sukhothai lanna and lan xang (now laos) were on the rise however a century later the power of sukhothai was overshadowed by the new kingdom of ayutthaya established in the mid-14th century in the lower chao phraya river or menam area
ayutthaya's expansion centred along the menam while in the northern valleys the lanna kingdom and other small tai city-states ruled the area in 1431 the khmer abandoned angkor after ayutthaya forces invaded the city thailand retained a tradition of trade with its neighbouring states from china to india persia and arab lands ayutthaya became one of the most vibrant trading centres in asia european traders arrived in the 16th century beginning with the portuguese followed by the french dutch and english the burmesesiamese war (17651767) left ayutthaya burned and sacked by king hsinbyushin
after the fall of ayutthaya in 1767 to the burmese taksin moved the capital to thonburi for approximately 15 years the current rattanakosin era of thai history began in 1782 following the establishment of bangkok as capital of the chakri dynasty under king rama i the great according to the encyclopdia britannica a quarter to a third of the population of some areas of thailand and burma were slaves in the 17th through the 19th centuries.
despite european pressure thailand is the only southeast asian nation to never have been colonised this has been ascribed to the long succession of able rulers in the past four centuries who exploited the rivalry and tension between french indochina and the british empire as a result the country remained a buffer state between parts of southeast asia that were colonised by the two colonial powers great britain and france western influence nevertheless led to many reforms in the 19th century and major concessions most notably the loss of a large territory on the east side of the mekong to the french and the step-by-step absorption by britain of the shan and karen people areas and malay peninsula
=== 20th centuryedit ===
the losses initially included penang and eventually culminated in the loss of four predominantly ethnic-malay southern provinces which later became malaysia's four northern states under the anglo-siamese treaty of 1909
in 1932 a bloodless revolution carried out by the khana ratsadon group of military and civilian officials resulted in a transition of power when king prajadhipok was forced to grant the people of siam their first constitution thereby ending centuries of absolute monarchy
in 1939 the name of the kingdom siam was changed to thailand
=== world war iiedit ===
during world war ii the empire of japan demanded the right to move troops across thailand to the malayan frontier the japanese invasion of thailand on 8 december 1941 occurred in co-ordination with attacks throughout asia and engaged the royal thai army for six to eight hours before plaek phibunsongkhram ordered an armistice shortly thereafter japan was granted free passage and on 21 december 1941 thailand and japan signed a military alliance with a secret protocol wherein tokyo agreed to help thailand regain territories lost to the british and french
subsequently thailand declared war on the united states and the united kingdom on 25 january 1942 and undertook to assist japan in its war against the allies while at the same time maintaining an active anti-japanese free thai movement approximately 200,000 asian labourers (mainly romusha) and 60,000 allied prisoners of war (pows) worked on the burma railway which is commonly known as the death railway
after the war thailand emerged as an ally of the united states as with many of the developing nations during the cold war thailand then went through decades of political instability characterised by a number of coups d'tat as one military regime replaced another but eventually progressed towards a stable prosperous democracy in the 1980s
== politics and governmentedit ==
the politics of thailand is currently conducted within the framework of a constitutional monarchy whereby the prime minister is the head of government and a hereditary monarch is head of state the judiciary is supposed to be independent of the executive and the legislative branches although judicial rulings are suspected of being based on political considerations rather than on existing law
=== constitutional historyedit ===
since the political reform of the absolute monarchy in 1932 thailand has had 19 constitutions and charters throughout this time the form of government has ranged from military dictatorship to electoral democracy but all governments have acknowledged a hereditary monarch as the head of state
=== 28 june 1932edit ===
prior to 1932 the kingdom of siam did not possess a legislature as all legislative powers were vested in the person of the monarch this had been the case since the foundation of the sukhothai kingdom in the 12th century as the king was seen as a dharmaraja or king who rules in accordance with dharma (the buddhist law of righteousness) however on 24 june 1932 a group of civilians and military officers calling themselves the khana ratsadon (or people's party) carried out a bloodless revolution in which the 150 years of absolute rule of the chakri dynasty ended in its stead the group advocated a constitutional form of monarchy with an elected legislature
the draft constitution of 1932 signed by king prajadhipok created thailand's first legislature a people's assembly with 70 appointed members the assembly met for the first time on 28 june 1932 in the ananta samakhom throne hall the khana ratsadon decided that the people were not yet ready for an elected assembly they later changed their minds by the time the permanent constitution came into force in december of that year elections were scheduled for 15 november 1933 the new constitution changed the composition of the assembly to 78 directly elected and 78 appointed (by the khana ratsadon) together totalling 156 members
=== 1932 to 1972edit ===
the history of thailand from 1932 to 1973 was dominated by military dictatorships which were in power for much of the period the main personalities of the period were the dictator luang phibunsongkhram (better known as phibun) who allied the country with japan during the second world war and the civilian politician pridi phanomyong who founded thammasat university and was briefly the prime minister after the war the japanese invasion of thailand occurred on 8 december 1941
a succession of military dictators followed pridi's ousting phibun again sarit dhanarajata and thanom kittikachorn under whom traditional authoritarian rule was combined with increasing modernisation and westernisation under the influence of the us the end of the period was marked by thanom's resignation following a massacre of pro-democracy protesters led by thammasat students thanom misread the situation as a coup d'tat and fled leaving the country leaderless hm appointed thammasat university chancellor sanya dharmasakti pm by royal command for events subsequent to the abdication of the king including the name change of 1939 up to the coup d'tat of 1957 see plaek pibulsonggram

many human rights were explicitly acknowledged and measures were established to increase the stability of elected governments the house was elected by the first past the post system where only one candidate with a simple majority could be elected in one constituency the senate was elected based on the provincial system where one province could return more than one senator depending on its population size
the two houses of the national assembly have two different terms in accordance with the constitution the senate is elected to a six-year term while the house is elected to a four-year term overall the term of the national assembly is based on that of the house the national assembly each year will sit in two sessions an ordinary session and a legislative session the first session of the national assembly must take place within thirty days after the general election of the house of representatives the first session must be opened by the king in person by reading a speech from the throne this ceremony is held in the ananta samakhom throne hall he may also appoint the crown prince or a representative to carry out this duty it is also the duty of the king to prorogue sessions through a royal decree when the house term expires the king also has the prerogative to call extraordinary sessions and prolong sessions upon advice of the house of representatives

totalling 513,120 square kilometres (198,120 sq mi) thailand is the world's 51st-largest country by total area it is slightly smaller than yemen and slightly larger than spain
thailand comprises several distinct geographic regions partly corresponding to the provincial groups the north of the country is the mountainous area of the thai highlands with the highest point being doi inthanon in the thanon thong chai range at 2,565 metres (8,415 ft) above sea level the northeast isan consists of the khorat plateau bordered to the east by the mekong river the centre of the country is dominated by the predominantly flat chao phraya river valley which runs into the gulf of thailand
southern thailand consists of the narrow kra isthmus that widens into the malay peninsula politically there are six geographical regions which differ from the others in population basic resources natural features and level of social and economic development the diversity of the regions is the most pronounced attribute of thailand's physical setting
the chao phraya and the mekong river are the indispensable water courses of rural thailand industrial scale production of crops use both rivers and their tributaries the gulf of thailand covers 320,000 square kilometres (124,000 sq mi) and is fed by the chao phraya mae klong bang pakong and tapi rivers it contributes to the tourism sector owing to its clear shallow waters along the coasts in the southern region and the kra isthmus the eastern shore of the gulf of thailand is an industrial centre of thailand with the kingdom's premier deepwater port in sattahip and its busiest commercial port laem chabang

poaching of protected species remains a major problem hunters have decimated the populations of tigers leopards and other large cats for their valuable pelts many animals (including tigers bears crocodiles and king cobras) are farmed or hunted for their meat which is considered a delicacy and for their supposed medicinal properties although such trade is illegal the famous bangkok market chatuchak is still known for the sale of endangered species
the practice of keeping wild animals as pets threatens several species baby animals are typically captured and sold which often requires killing the mother once in captivity and out of their natural habitat many pets die or fail to reproduce affected populations include the asiatic black bear malayan sun bear white-handed lar pileated gibbon and binturong

thailand experienced the world's highest economic growth rate from 1985 to 1996 averaging 12.4% annually in 1997 increased pressure on the baht a year in which the economy contracted by 1.9% led to a crisis that uncovered financial sector weaknesses and forced the chavalit yongchaiyudh administration to float the currency prime minister chavalit yongchaiyudh was forced to resign after his cabinet came under fire for its slow response to the economic crisis the baht was pegged at 25 to the us dollar from 1978 to 1997 the baht reached its lowest point of 56 to the us dollar in january 1998 and the economy contracted by 10.8% that year triggering the asian financial crisis
thailand's economy started to recover in 1999 expanding 4.24.4% in 2000 thanks largely to strong exports growth (2.2%) was dampened by the softening of the global economy in 2001 but picked up in the subsequent years owing to strong growth in asia a relatively weak baht encouraging exports and increased domestic spending as a result of several mega projects and incentives of prime minister thaksin shinawatra known as thaksinomics growth in 2002 2003 and 2004 was 57% annually
