solar humidificationdehumidification method hdh thermal water desalination method based evaporation sea water brackish water consecutive condensation generated humid air mostly ambient pressure process mimics natural water cycle much shorter time frame
simplest configuration implemented solar still evaporating sea water inside glass covered box condensing water vapor lower side glass cover sophisticated designs separate solar heat gain section evaporationcondensation chamber optimized design comprises separated evaporation condensation sections significant part heat consumed evaporation regained condensation example optimized thermal desalination cycle multipleeffect humidification meh method transportation
solar humidification takes place every greenhouse water evaporates surfaces soil water plants thermal input way humidification process naturally integrated within architecture greenhouse several companies like seawater greenhouse utilize inherent feature greenhouse order conduct desalination inside atmosphere facility integrated biotectural system ibts greenhouse mimics natural process cloud formation respectively desalination exactly
