sight
sight vision adjectival form visualoptical capability eyes focus detect images visible light photoreceptors retina eye generates electrical nerve impulses varying colors hues brightness two types photoreceptors rods cones rods sensitive light distinguish colors cones distinguish colors less sensitive dim light disagreement whether constitutes one two three senses neuroanatomists generally regard two senses given different receptors responsible perception color brightness argue stereopsis perception depth using eyes also constitutes sense generally regarded cognitive postsensory function visual cortex brain patterns objects images recognized interpreted based previously learned information called visual memory
inability see called blindness blindness may result damage eyeball especially retina damage optic nerve connects eye brain andor stroke infarcts brain temporary permanent blindness caused poisons medications
people blind degradation damage visual cortex still functional eyes actually capable level vision reaction visual stimuli conscious perception known blindsight people blindsight usually aware reacting visual sources instead unconsciously adapt behaviour stimulus
