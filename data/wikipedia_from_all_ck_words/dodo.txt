the dodo (raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of mauritius east of madagascar in the indian ocean its closest genetic relative was the also extinct rodrigues solitaire the two forming the subfamily raphinae of the family of pigeons and doves the closest extant relative of the dodo is the nicobar pigeon a white dodo was once incorrectly thought to have existed on the nearby island of runion
subfossil remains show the dodo was about 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) tall and may have weighed 10.621.1 kg (2347 lb) in the wild the dodo's appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings paintings and written accounts from the 17th century because these vary considerably and because only some illustrations are known to have been drawn from live specimens its exact appearance in life remains unresolved similarly little is known with certainty about its habitat and behaviour it has been depicted with brownish-grey plumage yellow feet a tuft of tail feathers a grey naked head and a black yellow and green beak it used gizzard stones to help digest its food which is thought to have included fruits and its main habitat is believed to have been the woods in the drier coastal areas of mauritius one account states its clutch consisted of a single egg it is presumed that the dodo became flightless because of the ready availability of abundant food sources and a relative absence of predators on mauritius
the first recorded mention of the dodo was by dutch sailors in 1598 in the following years the bird was hunted by sailors their domesticated animals and invasive species introduced during that time the last widely accepted sighting of a dodo was in 1662 its extinction was not immediately noticed and some considered it to be a mythical creature in the 19th century research was conducted on a small quantity of remains of four specimens that had been brought to europe in the early 17th century among these is a dried head the only soft tissue of the dodo that remains today since then a large amount of subfossil material has been collected from mauritius mostly from the mare aux songes swamp the extinction of the dodo within less than a century of its discovery called attention to the previously unrecognised problem of human involvement in the disappearance of entire species the dodo achieved widespread recognition from its role in the story of alice in wonderland and it has since become a fixture in popular culture often as a symbol of extinction and obsolescence it is frequently used as a mascot on mauritius
== taxonomyedit ==
the dodo was variously declared a small ostrich a rail an albatross or a vulture by early scientists in 1842 johannes theodor reinhardt proposed that dodos were ground pigeons based on studies of a dodo skull he had discovered in the royal danish collection at copenhagen this view was met with ridicule but was later supported by hugh edwin strickland and alexander gordon melville in their 1848 monograph the dodo and its kindred which attempted to separate myth from reality after dissecting the preserved head and foot of the specimen at the oxford university museum and comparing it with the few remains then available of the extinct rodrigues solitaire (pezophaps solitaria) they concluded that the two were closely related strickland stated that although not identical these birds shared many distinguishing features of the leg bones otherwise known only in pigeons
strickland and melville established that the dodo was anatomically similar to pigeons in many features they pointed to the very short keratinous portion of the beak with its long slender naked basal part other pigeons also have bare skin around their eyes almost reaching their beak as in dodos the forehead was high in relation to the beak and the nostril was located low on the middle of the beak and surrounded by skin a combination of features shared only with pigeons the legs of the dodo were generally more similar to those of terrestrial pigeons than of other birds both in their scales and in their skeletal features depictions of the large crop hinted at a relationship with pigeons in which this feature is more developed than in other birds pigeons generally have very small clutches and the dodo is said to have laid a single egg like pigeons the dodo lacked the vomer and septum of the nostrils and it shared details in the mandible the zygomatic bone the palate and the hallux the dodo differed from other pigeons mainly in the small size of the wings and the large size of the beak in proportion to the rest of the cranium
throughout the 19th century several species were classified as congeneric with the dodo including the rodrigues solitaire and the runion solitaire as didus solitarius and raphus solitarius respectively (didus and raphus being names for the dodo genus used by different authors of the time) an atypical 17th-century description of a dodo and bones found on rodrigues now known to have belonged to the rodrigues solitaire led abraham dee bartlett to name a new species didus nazarenus in 1852 based on solitaire remains it is now a synonym of that species crude drawings of the red rail of mauritius were also misinterpreted as dodo species didus broeckii and didus herberti
=== etymologyedit ===
one of the original names for the dodo was the dutch walghvogel first used in the journal of vice admiral wybrand van warwijck who visited mauritius during the second dutch expedition to indonesia in 1598 walghe means tasteless insipid or sickly and vogel means bird the name was translated into german as walchstk or walchvgel by jakob friedlib the original dutch report titled waarachtige beschryving was lost but the english translation survived
another account from that voyage perhaps the first to mention the dodo states that the portuguese referred to them as penguins the meaning may not have been derived from penguin (the portuguese referred to them as fotilicaios at the time) but from pinion a reference to the small wings the crew of the dutch ship gelderland referred to the bird as dronte (meaning swollen") in 1602 a name that is still used in some languages this crew also called them griff-eendt and kermisgans in reference to fowl fattened for the kermesse festival in amsterdam which was held the day after they anchored on mauritius
the etymology of the word dodo is unclear some ascribe it to the dutch word dodoor for sluggard but it is more probably related to dodaars which means either fat-arse or knot-arse referring to the knot of feathers on the hind end the first record of the word dodaars is in captain willem van west-zanen's journal in 1602 the english writer sir thomas herbert was the first to use the word dodo in print in his 1634 travelogue claiming it was referred to as such by the portuguese who had visited mauritius in 1507 another englishman emmanuel altham had used the word in a 1628 letter in which he also claimed the origin was portuguese the name dodar was introduced into english at the same time as dodo but was only used until the 18th century as far as is known the portuguese never mentioned the bird nevertheless some sources still state that the word dodo derives from the portuguese word doudo (currently doido) meaning fool or crazy it has also been suggested that dodo was an onomatopoeic approximation of the bird's call a two-note pigeon-like sound resembling doo-doo
the latin name cucullatus ("hooded") was first used by juan eusebio nieremberg in 1635 as cygnus cucullatus in reference to carolus clusius's 1605 depiction of a dodo in his 18th-century classic work systema naturae carl linnaeus used cucullatus as the specific name but combined it with the genus name struthio (ostrich) mathurin jacques brisson coined the genus name raphus (referring to the bustards) in 1760 resulting in the current name raphus cucullatus in 1766 linnaeus coined the new binomial didus ineptus (meaning inept dodo") this has become a synonym of the earlier name because of nomenclatural priority
=== evolutionedit ===
for many years the dodo and the rodrigues solitaire were placed in a family of their own the raphidae (formerly dididae) because their exact relationships with other pigeons were unresolved each was also placed in its own monotypic family (raphidae and pezophapidae respectively) as it was thought that they had evolved their similar features independently osteological and molecular data has since led to the dissolution of the family raphidae and the dodo and solitaire are now placed in their own subfamily raphinae in the family columbidae
comparison of mitochondrial cytochrome b and 12s rrna sequences isolated from a dodo tarsal and a rodrigues solitaire femur confirmed their close relationship and their placement within the columbidae the genetic evidence was interpreted as showing the southeast asian nicobar pigeon to be their closest living relative followed by the crowned pigeons of new guinea and the superficially dodo-like tooth-billed pigeon from samoa the generic name of the latter is didunculus ("little dodo") and it was called dodlet by richard owen the following cladogram from shapiro and colleagues (2002) shows the dodo's closest relationships within the columbidae a clade consisting of generally ground-dwelling island endemics
a similar cladogram was published in 2007 inverting the placement of goura and dicunculus and including the pheasant pigeon and the thick-billed ground pigeon at the base of the clade based on behavioural and morphological evidence jolyon c parish proposed that the dodo and rodrigues solitaire should be placed in the gourinae subfamily along with the groura pigeons and others in agreement with the genetic evidence in 2014 dna of the only known specimen of the recently extinct spotted green pigeon (caloenas maculata) was analysed and it was found to be a close relative of the nicobar pigeon and thus also the dodo and rodrigues solitaire
the 2002 study indicated that the ancestors of the dodo and the solitaire diverged around the paleogene-neogene boundary the mascarene islands (mauritius runion and rodrigues) are of volcanic origin and are less than 10 million years old therefore the ancestors of both birds probably remained capable of flight for a considerable time after the separation of their lineage the ancestors of the raphines may have dispersed from southeast asia by island hopping the lack of mammalian herbivores competing for resources on these islands allowed the solitaire and the dodo to attain very large sizes the dna obtained from the oxford specimen is degraded and no usable dna has been extracted from subfossil remains so these findings still need to be independently verified the dodo lost the ability to fly owing to the lack of mammalian predators on mauritius another large flightless pigeon the viti levu giant pigeon (natunaornis gigoura) was described in 2001 from subfossil material from fiji it was only slightly smaller than the dodo and the solitaire and it too is thought to have been related to the crowned pigeons
== descriptionedit ==
as no complete dodo specimens exist its external appearance such as plumage and colouration is hard to determine illustrations and written accounts of encounters with the dodo between its discovery and its extinction (15981662) are the primary evidence for its external appearance according to most representations the dodo had greyish or brownish plumage with lighter primary feathers and a tuft of curly light feathers high on its rear end the head was grey and naked the beak green black and yellow and the legs were stout and yellowish with black claws the bird was sexually dimorphic males were larger and had proportionally longer beaks the beak was up to 23 centimetres (9.1 in) in length and had a hooked point
subfossil remains and remnants of the birds that were brought to europe in the 17th century show that they were very large birds 1 metre (3 feet 3 inches) tall and possibly weighing up to 23 kilograms (51 lb) the higher weights have been attributed to birds in captivity weights in the wild were estimated to have been in the range 10.621.1 kg (2347 lb) a later estimate gives an average weight as low as 10.2 kg (22 lb) this has been questioned and there is still some controversy it has been suggested that the weight depended on the season and that individuals were fat during cool seasons but less so during hot a study of the few remaining feathers on the oxford specimen head showed that they were pennaceous rather than plumaceous (downy) and most similar to those of other pigeons
many of the skeletal features that distinguish the dodo and the rodrigues solitaire its closest relative from pigeons have been attributed to their flightlessness the pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted pigeons to support the higher weight and the pectoral region and the small wings were paedomorphic meaning that they were underdeveloped and retained juvenile features the skull trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic meaning that they changed considerably with age the dodo shared several other traits with the rodrigues solitaire such as features of the skull pelvis and sternum as well as their large size it differed in other aspects such as being more robust and shorter than the solitaire having a larger skull and beak a rounded skull roof and smaller orbits the dodo's neck and legs were proportionally shorter and it did not possess an equivalent to the knob present on the solitaire's wrists
=== contemporary descriptionsedit ===
most contemporary descriptions of the dodo are found in ship's logs and journals of the dutch east india company vessels that docked in mauritius when the dutch empire ruled the island these records were used as guides for future voyages few contemporary accounts are reliable as many seem to be based on earlier accounts and none were written by scientists
one of the earliest accounts from van warwijck's 1598 journal describes the bird thus
one of the most detailed descriptions is by sir thomas herbert in a relation of some yeares travaille into afrique and the greater asia from 1634
=== contemporary depictionsedit ===
the travel journal of the dutch ship gelderland (16011603) rediscovered in the 1860s contains the only known sketches of living or recently killed specimens drawn on mauritius they have been attributed to the professional artist joris joostensz laerle who also drew other now-extinct mauritian birds and to a second less refined artist apart from these sketches it is unknown how many of the twenty or so 17th-century illustrations of the dodos were drawn from life or from stuffed specimens which affects their reliability
all post-1638 depictions appear to be based on earlier images around the time reports mentioning dodos became rarer differences in the depictions led authors such as anthonie cornelis oudemans and masauji hachisuka to speculate about sexual dimorphism ontogenic traits seasonal variation and even the existence of different species but these theories are not accepted today because details such as markings of the beak the form of the tail feathers and colouration vary from account to account it is impossible to determine the exact morphology of these features whether they signal age or sex or if they even reflect reality dodo specialist julian hume argued that the nostrils of the living dodo would have been slits as seen in the gelderland cornelis saftleven crocker art gallery and ustad mansur images according to this claim the gaping nostrils often seen in paintings indicate that taxidermy specimens were used as models
the traditional image of the dodo is of a very fat and clumsy bird but this view may be exaggerated the general opinion of scientists today is that many old european depictions were based on overfed captive birds or crudely stuffed specimens it has also been suggested that the images might show dodos with puffed feathers as part of display behaviour the dutch painter roelant savery was the most prolific and influential illustrator of the dodo having made at least ten depictions often showing it in the lower corners a famous painting of his from 1626 now called edwards's dodo as it was once owned by the ornithologist george edwards has since become the standard image of a dodo it is housed in the natural history museum london the image shows a particularly fat bird and is the source for many other dodo illustrations
an indian mughal painting rediscovered in st petersburg in the 1950s shows a dodo along with native indian birds it depicts a slimmer brownish bird and its discoverer a iwanow and dodo specialist julian hume regard it as one of the most accurate depictions of the living dodo the surrounding birds are clearly identifiable and depicted with appropriate colouring it is believed to be from the 17th century and has been attributed to artist ustad mansur the bird depicted probably lived in the menagerie of mughal emperor jahangir located in surat where english traveller peter mundy also claimed to have seen dodos in 2014 another indian illustration of a dodo was reported but it was found to be derivative of an 1836 german illustration
== behaviour and ecologyedit ==
little is known of the behaviour of the dodo as most contemporary descriptions are very brief based on weight estimates it has been suggested the male could reach the age of 21 and the female 17 studies of the cantilever strength of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast unlike the rodrigues solitaire there is no evidence that the dodo used its wings in intraspecific combat though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison the dodo may instead have used its large hooked beak in territorial disputes since mauritius receives more rainfall and has less seasonal variation than rodrigues which would have affected the availability of resources on the island the dodo would have less reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour the rodrigues solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two
the preferred habitat of the dodo is unknown but old descriptions suggest that it inhabited the woods on the drier coastal areas of south and west mauritius this view is supported by the fact that the mare aux songes swamp is close to the sea in south-eastern mauritius such a limited distribution across the island could well have contributed to its extinction a 1601 map from the gelderland journal shows a small island off the coast of mauritius where dodos were caught julian hume has suggested this island was in tamarin bay on the west coast of mauritius subfossil bones have also been found inside caves in highland areas indicating that it once occurred on mountains work at the mare aux songes swamp has shown that its habitat was dominated by tambalacoque and pandanus trees and endemic palms
many endemic species of mauritius became extinct after the arrival of humans so the ecosystem of the island is badly damaged and hard to reconstruct before humans arrived mauritius was entirely covered in forests but very little remains of them today because of deforestation the surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened the dodo lived alongside other recently extinct mauritian birds such as the flightless red rail the broad-billed parrot the mascarene grey parakeet the mauritius blue pigeon the mauritius owl the mascarene coot the mauritian shelduck the mauritian duck and the mauritius night heron extinct mauritian reptiles include the saddle-backed mauritius giant tortoise the domed mauritius giant tortoise the mauritian giant skink and the round island burrowing boa the small mauritian flying fox and the snail tropidophora carinata lived on mauritius and runion but vanished from both islands some plants such as casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid have also become extinct
=== dietedit ===
a 1631 dutch document rediscovered in 1887 but now lost is the only account of the dodo's diet and also mentions that it used its beak for defence
in addition to fallen fruits the dodo probably subsisted on nuts seeds bulbs and roots it has also been suggested that the dodo might have eaten crabs and shellfish like their relatives the crowned pigeons its feeding habits must have been versatile since captive specimens were probably given a wide range of food on the long sea journeys anthonie oudemans suggested that as mauritius has marked dry and wet seasons the dodo probably fattened itself on ripe fruits at the end of the wet season to survive the dry season when food was scarce contemporary reports describe the bird's greedy appetite france staub suggested that they mainly fed on palm fruits and he attempted to correlate the fat-cycle of the dodo with the fruiting regime of the palms
several contemporary sources state that the dodo used gastroliths (gizzard stones) to aid digestion the english writer sir hamon l'estrange witnessed a live bird in london and described it as follows
it is not known how the young were fed but related pigeons provide crop milk contemporary depictions show a large crop which was probably used to add space for food storage and to produce crop milk it has been suggested that the maximum size attained by the dodo and the solitaire was limited by the amount of crop milk they could produce for their young during early growth
in 1973 the tambalacoque also known as the dodo tree was thought to be dying out on mauritus to which it is endemic there were supposedly only 13 specimens left all estimated to be about 300 years old stanley temple hypothesised that it depended on the dodo for its propagation and that its seeds would germinate only after passing through the bird's digestive tract he claimed that the tambalacoque was now nearly coextinct because of the disappearance of the dodo temple overlooked reports from the 1940s that found that tambalacoque seeds germinated albeit very rarely without being abraded during digestion others have contested his hypothesis and suggested that the decline of the tree was exaggerated or seeds were also distributed by other extinct animals such as cylindraspis tortoises fruit bats or the broad-billed parrot according to wendy strahm and anthony cheke two experts in the ecology of the mascarene islands the tree while rare has germinated since the demise of the dodo and numbers several hundred not 13 as claimed by temple hence discrediting temple's view as to the dodo and the tree's sole survival relationship
it has been suggested that the broad-billed parrot may have depended on dodos and cylindraspis tortoises to eat palm fruits and excrete their seeds which became food for the parrots anodorhynchus macaws depended on now-extinct south american megafauna in the same way but now rely on domesticated cattle for this service
=== reproductionedit ===
as it was flightless and terrestrial and there were no mammalian predators or other kinds of natural enemy on mauritius the dodo probably nested on the ground the account by franois cauche from 1651 is the only description of the egg and the call
cauche's account is problematic since it also mentions that the bird he was describing had three toes and no tongue unlike dodos this led some to believe that cauche was describing a new species of dodo ("didus nazarenus") the description was most probably mingled with that of a cassowary and cauche's writings have other inconsistencies a mention of a young ostrich taken on board a ship in 1617 is the only other reference to a possible juvenile dodo an egg claimed to be that of a dodo is stored in the museum of east london south africa it was donated by marjorie courtenay-latimer whose great aunt had received it from a captain who claimed to have found it in a swamp on mauritius in 2010 the curator of the museum proposed using genetic studies to determine its authenticity it may instead be an aberrant ostrich egg
because of the possible single-egg clutch and the bird's large size it has been proposed that the dodo was k-selected meaning that it produced a low number of altricial offspring which required parental care until they matured some evidence including the large size and the fact that tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates indicates that the bird may have had a protracted development period the fact that no juvenile dodos have been found in the mare aux songes swamp where most dodo remains have been excavated may indicate that they produced little offspring that they matured rapidly that the breeding grounds were far away from the swamp or that the risk of miring was seasonal
== relationship with humansedit ==
mauritius had previously been visited by arab vessels in the middle ages and portuguese ships between 1507 and 1513 but was settled by neither no records of dodos by these are known although the portuguese name for mauritius cerne (swan) island may have been a reference to dodos the dutch empire acquired mauritius in 1598 renaming it after maurice of nassau and it was used for the provisioning of trade vessels of the dutch east india company henceforward the earliest known accounts of the dodo were provided by dutch travelers during the second dutch expedition to indonesia led by admiral jacob van neck in 1598 they appear in reports published in 1601 which also contain the first published illustration of the bird since the first sailors to visit mauritius had been at sea for a long time their interest in these large birds was mainly culinary the 1602 journal by willem van west-zanen of the ship bruin-vis mentions that 2425 dodos were hunted for food which were so large that two could scarcely be consumed at mealtime their remains being preserved by salting an illustration made for the 1648 published version of this journal showing the killing of dodos a dugong and possibly a mascarene grey parakeet was captioned with a dutch poem here in hugh strickland's 1848 translation
some early travellers found dodo meat unsavoury and preferred to eat parrots and pigeons others described it as tough but good some hunted dodos only for their gizzards as this was considered the most delicious part of the bird dodos were easy to catch but hunters had to be careful not to be bitten by their powerful beaks
the appearance of the dodo and the red rail led peter mundy to speculate 230 years before charles darwin's theory of evolution
=== dodos transported abroadedit ===
the dodo was found interesting enough that living specimens were sent to europe and the east the number of transported dodos that reached their destinations alive is uncertain and it is unknown how they relate to contemporary depictions and the few non-fossil remains in european museums based on a combination of contemporary accounts paintings and specimens julian hume has inferred that at least eleven transported dodos reached their destinations alive
hamon l'estrange's description of a dodo that he saw in london in 1638 is the only account that specifically mentions a live specimen in europe in 1626 adriaen van de venne drew a dodo that he claimed to have seen in amsterdam but he did not mention if it was alive and his depiction is reminiscent of savery's edwards's dodo two live specimens were seen by peter mundy in surat india between 1628 and 1634 one of which may have been the individual painted by ustad mansur around 1625 in 1628 emmanuel altham visited mauritius and sent a letter to his brother in england
whether the dodo survived the journey is unknown and the letter was destroyed by fire in the 19th century the earliest known picture of a dodo specimen in europe is from a c 1610 collection of paintings depicting animals in the royal menagerie of emperor rudolph ii in prague this collection includes paintings of other mauritian animals as well including a red rail the dodo which may be a juvenile seems to have been dried or embalmed and had probably lived in the emperor's zoo for a while together with the other animals that whole stuffed dodos were present in europe indicates they had been brought alive and died there it is unlikely that taxidermists were on board the visiting ships and spirits were not yet used to preserve biological specimens most tropical specimens were preserved as dried heads and feet
one dodo was reportedly sent as far as nagasaki japan in 1647 but it was long unknown whether it arrived contemporary documents first published in 2014 proved the story and showed that it had arrived alive it was meant as a gift and despite its rarity was considered of equal value to a white deer and a bezoar stone it is the last recorded live dodo in captivity
=== extinctionedit ===
like many animals that evolved in isolation from significant predators the dodo was entirely fearless of humans this fearlessness and its inability to fly made the dodo easy prey for sailors although some scattered reports describe mass killings of dodos for ships provisions archaeological investigations have found scant evidence of human predation bones of at least two dodos were found in caves at baie du cap that sheltered fugitive slaves and convicts in the 17th century which would not have been easily accessible to dodos because of the high broken terrain the human population on mauritius (an area of 1,860 km2 or 720 sq mi) never exceeded 50 people in the 17th century but they introduced other animals including dogs pigs cats rats and crab-eating macaques which plundered dodo nests and competed for the limited food resources at the same time humans destroyed the forest habitat of the dodos the impact of the introduced animals on the dodo population especially the pigs and macaques is currently considered more severe than that of hunting rats were perhaps not much of a threat to the nests since dodos would have been used to dealing with local land crabs
it has been suggested that the dodo may already have been rare or localised before the arrival of humans on mauritius since it would have been unlikely to become extinct so rapidly if it had occupied all the remote areas of the island a 2005 expedition found subfossil remains of dodos and other animals killed by a flash flood such mass mortalities would have further jeopardised a species already in danger of becoming extinct
some controversy surrounds the date of their extinction the last widely accepted record of a dodo sighting is the 1662 report by shipwrecked mariner volkert evertsz of the dutch ship arnhem who described birds caught on a small islet off mauritius now suggested to be amber island
the dodos on this islet may not necessarily have been the last members of the species the last claimed sighting of a dodo was reported in the hunting records of isaac johannes lamotius in 1688 statistical analysis of these records by roberts and solow gives a new estimated extinction date of 1693 with a 95% confidence interval of 16881715 the authors also pointed out that because the last sighting before 1662 was in 1638 the dodo was probably already quite rare by the 1660s and thus a disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave cannot be dismissed out of hand
anthony cheke pointed out that some descriptions after 1662 use the names dodo and dodaers when referring to the red rail indicating that they had been transferred to it after the disappearance of the dodo itself cheke therefore points to the 1662 description as the last credible observation a 1668 account by english traveller john marshall who used the names dodo and red hen interchangeably for the red rail mentioned that the meat was hard which echoes the description of the meat in the 1681 account even the 1662 account has been questioned by errol fuller as the reaction to distress cries matches what was described for the red rail until this explanation was proposed a description of dodos from 1681 was thought to be the last account and that date still has proponents recently accessible dutch manuscripts indicate that no dodos were seen by settlers in 16641674 it is unlikely the issue will ever be resolved unless late reports mentioning the name alongside a physical description are rediscovered the iucn red list accepts cheke's rationale for choosing the 1662 date taking all subsequent reports to refer to red rails in any case the dodo was probably extinct by 1700 about a century after its discovery in 1598 the dutch left mauritius in 1710 but by then the dodo and most of the large terrestrial vertebrates there had become extinct
even though the rareness of the dodo was reported already in the 17th century its extinction was not recognised until the 19th century this was partly because for religious reasons extinction was not believed possible until later proved so by georges cuvier and partly because many scientists doubted that the dodo had ever existed it seemed altogether too strange a creature and many believed it a myth the bird was first used as an example of human-induced extinction in penny magazine in 1833
== physical remainsedit ==
=== 17th-century specimensedit ===
the only extant remains of dodos taken to europe in the 17th century are a dried head and foot in the oxford university museum of natural history a foot once housed in the british museum but now lost a skull in the university of copenhagen zoological museum and an upper jaw and leg bones in the national museum prague the last two were rediscovered and identified as dodo remains in the mid-19th century several stuffed dodos were also mentioned in old museum inventories but none are known to have survived apart from these remains a dried foot which belonged to the dutch professor pieter pauw was mentioned by carolus clusius in 1605 its provenance is unknown and it is now lost but it may have been collected during the van neck voyage
the only known soft tissue remains the oxford head (specimen oum 11605) and foot belonged to the last known stuffed dodo which was first mentioned as part of the tradescant collection in 1656 and was moved to the ashmolean museum in 1659 it has been suggested that this might be the remains of the bird that hamon l'estrange saw in london many sources state that the museum burned the stuffed dodo around 1755 because of severe decay saving only the head and leg statute 8 of the museum states that as any particular grows old and perishing the keeper may remove it into one of the closets or other repository and some other to be substituted. the deliberate destruction of the specimen is now believed to be a myth it was removed from exhibition to preserve what remained of it this remaining soft tissue has since degraded further the head was dissected by strickland and melville separating the skin from the skull in two halves the foot is in a skeletal state with only scraps of skin and tendons very few feathers remain on the head it is probably a female as the foot is 11% smaller and more gracile than that of the london specimen yet appears to be fully grown
the dried london foot first mentioned in 1665 and transferred to the british museum in the 18th century was displayed next to savery's edwards's dodo painting until the 1840s and it too was dissected by strickland and melville it was not posed in a standing posture which suggests that it was severed from a fresh specimen not a mounted one by 1896 it was mentioned as being without its integuments and only the bones are believed to remain today though its present whereabouts are unknown
the copenhagen skull (specimen zmuc 90-806) is known to have been part of the collection of bernardus paludanus in enkhuizen until 1651 when it was moved to the museum in gottorf castle schleswig after the castle was occupied by danish forces in 1702 the museum collection was assimilated into the royal danish collection the skull was rediscovered by j t reinhardt in 1840 based on its history it may be the oldest known surviving remains of a dodo brought to europe in the 17th century it is 13 mm (0.51 in) shorter than the oxford skull and may have belonged to a female it was mummified but the skin has perished
the front part of a skull (specimen nmp p6v-004389) and some leg bones in the national museum of prague were found in 1850 among the remains of the bhmisches museum it may be what remains of one of the stuffed dodos known to have been at the menagerie of emperor rudolph ii possibly the specimen painted by hoefnagel or savery there

until 1860 the only known dodo remains were the four incomplete 17th-century specimens philip burnard ayres found the first subfossil bones in 1860 which were sent to richard owen at the british museum who did not publish the findings in 1863 owen requested the mauritian bishop vincent ryan to spread word that he should be informed if any dodo bones were found in 1865 george clark the government schoolmaster at mahbourg finally found an abundance of subfossil dodo bones in the swamp of mare aux songes in southern mauritius after a 30-year search inspired by strickland and melville's monograph in 1866 clark explained his procedure to the ibis an ornithology journal he had sent his coolies to wade through the centre of the swamp feeling for bones with their feet at first they found few bones until they cut away herbage that covered the deepest part of the swamp where they found many fossils the swamp yielded the remains of over 300 dodos but very few skull and wing bones possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was trapped the situation is similar to many finds of moa remains in new zealand marshes most dodo remains from the mare aux songes have a medium to dark brown colouration
clark's reports about the finds rekindled interest in the bird sir richard owen and alfred newton both wanted to be first to describe the post-cranial anatomy of the dodo and owen bought a shipment of dodo bones originally meant for newton which led to rivalry between the two owen described the bones in memoir on the dodo in october 1866 but erroneously based his reconstruction on the edwards's dodo painting by savery making it too squat and obese in 1869 he received more bones and corrected its stance making it more upright newton moved his focus to the runion solitaire instead the remaining bones not sold to owen or newton were auctioned off or donated to museums in 1889 thodor sauzier was commissioned to explore the historical souvenirs of mauritius and find more dodo remains in the mare aux songes he was successful and also found remains of other extinct species
in october 2005 after a hundred years of neglect a part of the mare aux songes swamp was excavated by an international team of researchers to prevent malaria the british had covered the swamp with hard core during their rule over mauritius which had to be removed many remains were found including bones of at least 17 dodos in various stages of maturity (though no juveniles) and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird which have been preserved in their natural position these findings were made public in december 2005 in the naturalis museum in leiden 63% of the fossils found in the swamp belonged to turtles of the extinct cylindraspis genus and 7.1% belonged to dodos which had been deposited within several centuries 4,000 years ago subsequent excavations suggested that dodos and other animals became mired in the mare aux songes while trying to reach water during a long period of severe drought about 4,200 years ago furthermore cyanobacteria thrived in the conditions created by the excrements of animals gathered around the swamp which died of intoxication dehydration trampling and miring though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations of the swamp few were found during the 19th century probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting in june 2007 adventurers exploring a cave in mauritius discovered the most complete and best-preserved dodo skeleton ever found the specimen was nicknamed fred after the finder
louis etienne thirioux an amateur naturalist at port louis also found many dodo remains around 1900 from several locations they included the first articulated specimen which is also the only subfossil dodo found outside the mare aux songes and the only remains of a juvenile specimen a now lost tarsometatarsus the former specimen was found in 1904 in a cave near le pouce mountain and is the only complete skeleton of an individual dodo and includes the only preserved kneecaps of the bird thirioux donated it to the museum desjardins (now natural history museum at mauritius institute) where it is still on display in 2014 this specimen was the basis for the first 3-d reconstruction of a complete dodo skeleton by using 3-d laser scanning technology the reconstruction was displayed in berlin at the 74th annual meeting of the society of vertebrate palaeontology
worldwide 26 museums have significant holdings of dodo material almost all found in the mare aux songes the natural history museum american museum of natural history cambridge university museum of zoology the senckenberg museum and others have almost complete skeletons assembled from the dissociated subfossil remains of several individuals in 2011 a wooden box containing dodo bones from the edwardian era was rediscovered at the grant museum at university college london during preparations for a move they had been stored with crocodile bones until then
== the white dodoedit ==
the supposed white dodo (or solitaire") of runion is now considered an erroneous conjecture based on contemporary reports of the runion ibis and 17th-century paintings of white dodo-like birds by pieter withoos and pieter holsteyn that surfaced in the 19th century the confusion began when willem ysbrandtszoon bontekoe who visited runion around 1619 mentioned fat flightless birds that he referred to as dod-eersen in his journal though without mentioning their colouration when the journal was published in 1646 it was accompanied by an engraving of a dodo from savery's crocker art gallery sketch a white stocky and flightless bird was first mentioned as part of the runion fauna by chief officer j tatton in 1625 sporadic mentions were subsequently made by sieur dubois and other contemporary writers
baron edmond de slys longchamps coined the name raphus solitarius for these birds in 1848 as he believed the accounts referred to a species of dodo when 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists it was assumed they depicted these birds anthonie cornelis oudemans suggested that the discrepancy between the paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the rodrigues solitaire as it was referred to by the same name or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island
the pieter withoos painting which was discovered first appears to be based on an earlier painting by pieter holsteyn three versions of which are known to have existed according to hume cheke and valledor de lozoya it appears that all depictions of white dodos were based on roelant savery's 1611 painting landscape with orpheus and the animals or on copies of it the painting shows a whitish specimen and was apparently based on a stuffed specimen then in prague a walghvogel described as having a dirty off-white colouring was mentioned in an inventory of specimens in the prague collection of the holy roman emperor rudolf ii to whom savery was contracted at the time (16071611) savery's several later images all show greyish birds possibly because he had by then seen another specimen cheke and hume believe the painted specimen was white owing to albinism valledor de lozoya has instead suggested that the light plumage was a juvenile trait a result of bleaching of old taxidermy specimens or simply artistic license
in 1987 scientists described fossils of a recently extinct species of ibis from runion with a relatively short beak borbonibis latipes before a connection to the solitaire reports had been made cheke suggested to one of the authors francois moutou that the fossils may have been of the runion solitaire and this suggestion was published in 1995 the ibis was reassigned to the genus threskiornis now combined with the specific epithet solitarius from the binomial r solitarius birds of this genus are also white and black with slender beaks fitting the old descriptions of the runion solitaire no fossil remains of dodo-like birds have ever been found on the island
== cultural significanceedit ==
the dodo's significance as one of the best-known extinct animals and its singular appearance led to its use in literature and popular culture as a symbol of an outdated concept or object as in the expression dead as a dodo, which has come to mean unquestionably dead or obsolete similarly the phrase to go the way of the dodo means to become extinct or obsolete to fall out of common usage or practice or to become a thing of the past in 1865 the same year that george clark started to publish reports about excavated dodo fossils the newly vindicated bird was featured as a character in lewis carroll's alice's adventures in wonderland it is thought that he included the dodo because he identified with it and had adopted the name as a nickname for himself because of his stammer which made him accidentally introduce himself as do-do-dodgson his legal surname the book's popularity made the dodo a well-known icon of extinction even before its extinction the dodo was frequently featured in european literature and was used as symbol for exotic lands and of gluttony due to its apparent fatness
the dodo appears frequently in works of popular fiction and is used as a mascot for many kinds of products especially in mauritius the dodo appears as a supporter on the coat of arms of mauritius it is also used as a watermark on all mauritian rupee banknotes a smiling dodo is the symbol of the brasseries de bourbon a popular brewer on runion whose emblem displays the white species once thought to have lived there
the dodo is used to promote the protection of endangered species by environmental organisations such as the durrell wildlife conservation trust and the durrell wildlife park in 2011 the nephilid spider nephilengys dodo which inhabits the same woods as the dodo once did was named after the bird to raise awareness of the urgent need for protection of the mauritius biota the center for biological diversity gives an annual rubber dodo award to those who have done the most to destroy wild places species and biological diversity
the name dodo has been immortalised by scientists naming genetic elements honoring the dodo's flightless nature a fruitfly gene within a region of a chromosome required for flying ability was named dodo in addition a defective transposable element family from phytophthora infestans was named dodopi as it contained mutations that eliminated the element's ability to jump to new locations in a chromosome
in 2009 a previously unpublished 17th-century dutch illustration of a dodo went for sale at christie's and was expected to sell for 6,000 it is unknown whether the illustration was based on a specimen or on a previous image it sold for 44,450
the poet hilaire belloc included the following poem about the dodo in his bad child's book of beasts from 1896
