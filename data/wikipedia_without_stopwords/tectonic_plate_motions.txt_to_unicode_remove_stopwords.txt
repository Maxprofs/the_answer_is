life main scientific contributions
earned masters university warsaw poland doctorate technical sciences academy mines metallurgy cracow poland dziewonski taught university texas dallas several years settling harvard
dziewonski collaborators laid foundation understanding tectonic plate motions exploring convection currents earths mantle radial maps seismic property variations based measurements seismic waves studies led development preliminary reference earth model prem collaboration anderson prem establishes accurate radial model earth seismic velocities attenuation density
since led two original powerful research efforts extended radial models fully threedimensional along way mapping interpreting four grand structures four include two regions higherthanaverage wavespeed inferred cold sinking mantle one western edge americas southern eurasia two features largescale regions slowerthanaverage wavespeed inferred hot rising superplumes located bottom mantle middle pacific ocean africa
research direction determined orientation magnitude deformation significant earthquakes wellrecorded results known harvard cmts centroid moment tensor solutions continued today lamontdoherty earth observatory goran ekstrom global cmt project
