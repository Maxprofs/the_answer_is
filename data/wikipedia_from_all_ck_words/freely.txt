a controlled-access highway is a type of highway which has been designed for high-speed vehicular traffic with all traffic flow and ingress/egress regulated common english terms are freeway (in the us) motorway (in the uk) and expressway (in many asian countries) terms in other languages sometimes seen in english include spanish autopista or autova (depending on whether it has toll or not) french autoroute german autobahn or italian autostrada other similar terms include expressway interstate and parkway they may also be called limited-access highways although this term can also refer to a class of highway with somewhat less isolation from other traffic conversely some of the united states use controlled access to describe a non-limited-access road entrances to which are controlled by the state
a controlled-access highway provides an unhindered flow of traffic with no traffic signals intersections or property access they are free of any at-grade crossings with other roads railways or pedestrian paths which are instead carried by overpasses and underpasses across the highway entrances and exits to the highway are provided at interchanges by slip roads (ramps) which allow for speed changes between the highway and arterial roads and collector roads on the controlled-access highway opposing directions of travel are generally separated by a median strip or central reservation containing a traffic barrier or grass elimination of the sources of potential conflicts with other directions of travelers dramatically improves safety and capacity
controlled-access highways evolved during the first half of the 20th century italy opened its first autostrada in 1924 connecting milan to varese (a8) germany began to build its first 30-kilometre (19 mi) autobahn controlled-access highway without speed limits (then referred to as a dual highway) in 1932 between cologne and bonn (now a555) it then rapidly constructed a nationwide system of such roads in anticipation of their use in the second world war the first north american freeways (known as parkways) opened in the new york city area in the 1920s britain heavily influenced by the railways did not build its first motorway the preston by-pass (m6) until 1958
most technologically advanced nations feature an extensive network of freeways or motorways to provide high-capacity urban travel or high-speed rural travel or both many have a national-level or even international-level (e.g european e route) system of route numbering

== historyedit ==
controlled-access highways as they exist today evolved during the first half of the 20th century the long island motor parkway opened in 1908 as a private venture was the world's first limited-access roadway it included many modern features including banked turns guard rails and reinforced concrete tarmac
modern controlled-access highways originated in the early 1920s in response to the rapidly increasing use of the automobile the demand for faster movement between cities and as a consequence of improvements in paving processes techniques and materials these original high-speed roads were referred to as dual highways and while divided bore little resemblance to the highways of today opened in 1921 the avus in berlin is the oldest controlled-access highway in europe although it was initially opened as a race track
the first dual highway opened in italy in 1924 between milan and varese and now forms parts of the a8 and a9 motorways this highway while divided contained only one lane in each direction and no interchanges shortly thereafter in 1924 the bronx river parkway was opened to traffic the bronx river parkway was the first road in north america to utilize a median strip to separate the opposing lanes to be constructed through a park and where intersecting streets crossed over bridges
the southern state parkway opened in 1927 and the long island motor parkway was closed in 1937 and replaced by the northern state parkway which opened in 1931 and its continuation the grand central parkway opened in 1936 construction of the bonn-cologne autobahn began in 1929 and was opened in 1932 by the mayor of cologne
in canada the first cityto-city controlled-access road was the queen elizabeth way which featured a cloverleaf and trumpet interchange when it opened in 1937 and until the second world war boasted the longest illuminated stretch of roadway built a decade later the first section of highway 401 was opened based on earlier designs it has since gone on to become the busiest highway in the world
the word freeway was first used in february 1930 by edward m bassett bassett argued that roads should be classified into three basic types highways parkways and freeways in bassett's zoning and property law-based system abutting property owners have the rights of light air and access to highways but not parkways and freeways the latter two are distinguished in that the purpose of a parkway is recreation while the purpose of a freeway is movement thus as originally conceived a freeway is simply a strip of public land devoted to movement to which abutting property owners do not have rights of light air or access
== designedit ==
freeways by definition have no at-grade intersections with other roads railroads or multi-use trails movable bridges such as the interstate bridge on interstate 5 between oregon and washington do require drivers to stop for ship traffic
the crossing of freeways by other routes is typically achieved with grade separation either in the form of underpasses or overpasses in addition to sidewalks (pavements) attached to roads that cross a freeway specialized pedestrian footbridges or tunnels may also be provided these structures enable pedestrians and cyclists to cross the freeway at that point without a detour to the nearest road crossing
access to freeways is typically provided only at grade-separated interchanges though lower-standard right-in/right-out access can be used for direct connections to side roads in many cases sophisticated interchanges allow for smooth uninterrupted transitions between intersecting freeways and busy arterial roads however sometimes it is necessary to exit onto a surface road to transfer from one freeway to another one example in the united states (notorious for the resulting congestion) is the connection from interstate 70 to the pennsylvania turnpike (interstate 70 and interstate 76) through the town of breezewood pennsylvania
speed limits are generally higher on freeways and are occasionally nonexistent (as on much of germany's autobahn network) because higher speeds reduce decision time freeways are usually equipped with a larger number of guide signs than other roads and the signs themselves are physically larger guide signs are often mounted on overpasses or overhead gantries so that drivers can see where each lane goes exit numbers are commonly derived from the exit's distance in miles or kilometers from the start of the freeway in some areas there are public rest areas or service areas on freeways as well as emergency phones on the shoulder at regular intervals
in the united states mileposts start at the southern or westernmost point on the freeway (either its terminus or the state line) california ohio and nevada use postmile systems in which the markers indicate mileage through the state's individual counties however nevada and ohio and some freeways that pass through kern county california also use the standard milepost system concurrently with their respective postmile systems
=== cross sectionsedit ===
two-lane freeways often undivided are sometimes built when traffic volumes are low or right-of-way is limited they may be designed for easy conversion to one side of a four-lane freeway (most of the bert t combs mountain parkway in eastern kentucky is two lanes but work has begun to make all of it four-lane.) these are often called super two roads otherwise freeways typically have at least two lanes in each direction some busy ones can have as many as 16 or more lanes in total
in san diego california interstate 5 has a similar system of express and local lanes for a maximum width of 21 lanes on a 3.2-kilometre (2 mi) segment between interstate 805 and california state route 56 in mississauga ontario highway 401 uses collector-express lanes for a total of 18 lanes through its intersection with highway 403/highway 410 and highway 427
these wide freeways may use separate collector and express lanes to separate through traffic from local traffic or special high-occupancy vehicle lanes either as a special restriction on the innermost lane or a separate roadway to encourage carpooling these hov lanes or roadways open to all traffic can be reversible lanes providing more capacity in the direction of heavy traffic and reversing direction before traffic switches sometimes a collector/distributor road a shorter version of a local lane shifts weaving between closely spaced interchanges to a separate roadway or altogether eliminates it
in some parts of the world notably parts of the us frontage roads form an integral part of the freeway system these parallel surface roads provide a transition between high-speed through traffic and local traffic frequent slip-ramps provide access between the freeway and the frontage road which in turn provides direct access to local roads and businesses
except on some two-lane freeways (and very rarely on wider freeways) a median separates the opposite directions of traffic this strip may be as simple as a grassy area or may include a crash barrier such as a jersey barrier or an ontario tall wall to prevent head-on collisions on some freeways the two carriageways are built on different alignments this may be done to make use of available corridors in a mountainous area or to provide narrower corridors through dense urban areas
=== control of accessedit ===
control of access relates to a legal status which limits the types of vehicles that can use a highway as well as a road design that limits the points at which they can access it
freeways are usually limited to motor vehicles of a minimum power or weight signs may prohibit cyclists pedestrians and equestrians and impose a minimum speed it is possible for non-motorized traffic to use facilities within the same right-of-way such as sidewalks constructed along freeway-standard bridges and multi-use paths next to freeways such as the suncoast trail along the suncoast parkway in florida
in some us jurisdictions especially where freeways replace existing roads non-motorized access on freeways is permitted different states of the united states have different laws cycling on freeways in arizona may be prohibited only where there is an alternative route judged equal or better for cycling wyoming the least populated state allows cycling on all freeways oregon allows bicycles except on specific urban freeways in portland and medford
in countries such as the united kingdom new motorways require an act of parliament to ensure restricted right of way since upgrading an existing road (the queen's highway") to a full motorway will result in extinguishing the right of access of certain groups such as pedestrians cyclists and slow-moving traffic many controlled access roads are not full motorways in some cases motorways are linked by short stretches of road where alternative rights of way are not practicable such as the dartford crossing (the furthest downstream public crossing of the river thames) or where it was not economic to build a motorway alongside the existing road such as the former cumberland gap the a1 is a good example of piece-wise upgrading to motorway standardas of january 2013 the 639-kilometre-long (397 mi) route had five stretches of motorway (designated as a1(m))
continental european non-motorway dual carriageways can have limits as high as 110130 kilometres per hour (6881 mph) us route 23 (us 23) in ohio has a speed limit as high as 65 mph (105 km/h) but isn't legally a freeway-class road since it has no disclaimers saying that low-speed vehicles are prohibited it also has at-grade intersections like expressway-class roadways
research shows 85 percent of motor vehicle-bicycle crashes follow turning or crossing at intersections freeway travel eliminates almost all those conflicts save at entrance and exit rampswhich at least on those freeways where cycling has not been banned have sufficient room and sight for cyclists and motorists an analysis of crashes in arizona showed no safety problems with cycling on freeways fewer than one motor vehicle-bicycle crash a year was recorded on nearly 3,200 shoulder kilometres (2,000 mi) open to cyclists in arizona
major arterial roads will often have partial access control meaning that side roads will intersect the main road at grade instead of using interchanges but driveways may not connect directly to the main road and drivers must use intersecting roads to access adjacent land there may be occasional interchanges with other major arterials examples include us 23 between sr 15's eastern terminus and delaware ohio along with sr 15 between its eastern terminus and i-75 us 30 sr 29/us 33 and us 35 in western and central ohio this type of road is sometimes called an expressway
=== construction techniquesedit ===
the most frequent way freeways are laid out is usually by building them from the ground up after things such as forestry or buildings are cleared away sometimes they deplete farmland but other methods have been developed for economic social and even environmental reasons
full freeways are sometimes made by converting at-grade expressways or by replacing at-grade intersections with overpasses however any at-grade intersection that ends a freeway remains often when there is a two-lane undivided freeway or expressway it is converted by constructing a twin corridor on the side by leaving a median between the two travel directions the opposing side for the old two-way corridor becomes a passing lane
other techniques involve building a new carriageway on the side of a divided highway that has a lot of private access on one side and sometimes has long driveways on the other side since an easement for widening comes into place especially in rural areas
when a third carriageway is added sometimes it can shift a directional carriageway by 50200 feet (1561 m) (or maybe more depending on land availability) as a way to retain private access on one side that favors over the other other methods involve constructing a service drive that shortens the long driveways (typically by less than 100 metres (330 ft))
== intersections and access pointsedit ==
an intersection is a highway layout that permits traffic from one controlled-access highway to access another and vice versa whereas an access point is a highway layout where traffic from a distributor or local road can join a controlled-access highway some countries such as the united kingdom do not distinguish between the two but other such as germany make a distinction using the word kreuz (cross) for the former and ausfahrt (exit) for the other in all cases one road crosses the other via a bridge
the inter-connecting roads or slip-roads which link the two roads can follow any one of a number of patterns the actual pattern is determined by a number of factors including local topology traffic density land cost building costs type of road etc in some jurisdictions feeder/distributor lanes are common especially for cloverleaf interchanges in others such as the united kingdom where the roundabout interchange is common feeder/distributor lanes are seldom seen
a few of the more common types of junction are shown below
== safetyedit ==
motorways are the safest roads by design while accounting for more than one quarter of all kilometres driven they contributed only 8% of the total number of european road deaths in 2006 germany's federal highway research institute provided international road traffic and accident database (irtad) statistics for the year 2010 comparing overall fatality rates with motorway rates
there are many differences between countries in their geography economy traffic growth highway system size degree of urbanization and motorization etc. all of which need to be taken into consideration when comparisons are made
the german autobahn network illustrates the safety trade-offs of controlled access highways the injury crash rate is very low on autobahns while 22 people died per 1000 injury crashesalthough autobahns have a lower rate than the 29 deaths per 1,000 injury accidents on conventional rural roads the rate is higher than the risk on urban roads speeds are higher on rural roads and autobahns than urban roads increasing the severity potential of a crash

== environmental effectsedit ==
controlled-access highways have been constructed both between major cities as well as within them leading to the sprawling suburban development found near most modern cities highways have been heavily criticized by environmentalists urbanists and preservationists for the noise pollution and economic shifts they bring additionally they have been criticized by the driving public for the inefficiency with which they handle peak hour traffic
often rural highways open up vast areas to economic development and municipal services generally raising property values in contrast to this above-grade highways in urban areas are often a source of lowered property values contributing to urban decay even with overpasses and underpasses neighbourhoods are dividedespecially impoverished ones where residents are less likely to own a car or to have the political and economic influence to resist construction efforts beginning in the early 1970s the us congress identified freeways and other urban highways as responsible for most of the noise exposure of the us population subsequently computer models were developed to analyze freeway noise and aid in their design to help minimize noise exposure
some cities have implemented freeway removal policies in which freeways have even been demolished and reclaimed as boulevards or parks notably in seoul (cheonggyecheon) portland (harbor drive) new york city (west side highway) boston (central artery) san francisco (embarcadero freeway) and milwaukee (park east freeway)
an alternative to surface or above ground freeway construction has been the construction of underground urban freeways using tunnelling technologies this has been extremely successful in the australian cities of sydney (which has five such freeways) melbourne (which has two such freeways) and brisbane (which has three such freeways) this has had the benefit of removing traffic from surface roads and in the case of melbourne's eastlink motorway has helped preserve an ecologically sensitive area from destruction
other australian cities face similar problems (lack of available land cost of home acquisition aesthetic problems and community opposition) brisbane which also has to contend with physical boundaries (the river) and heavy population increases has embraced underground tunnel freeways there are currently two open to traffic (clem jones tunnel (clem7) and airport link) one under construction (legacy way) and one (east-west link) is currently in planning all of the tunnels are designed to act as an inner-city ring road or bypass system and include provisions for public transport whether underground or in reclaimed space on the surface in canada the extension of highway 401 into detroit known as the herb gray parkway has been designed with numerous tunnels and underpasses which provide land for parks and recreational uses
freeway opponents have found that freeway expansion is often self-defeating expansion simply generates more traffic that is even if traffic congestion is initially shifted from local streets to a new or widened freeway people will begin to run errands and commute to more remote locations over time the freeway and its environs become congested again as both the average number and distance of trips increases this idea is known as induced demand
urban planning experts such as drusilla van hengel joseph dimento and sherry ryan argue that although properly designed and maintained freeways may be convenient and safe at least in comparison to uncontrolled roads they may not expand recreation employment and education opportunities equally for different ethnic groups or for people located in certain neighborhoods of a given city still they may open new markets to some small businesses
construction of urban freeways for the us interstate highway system which began in the late 1950s led to the demolition of thousands of city blocks and the dislocation of many more thousands of people the citizens of many inner city areas responded with the freeway and expressway revolts through the study of washington's response it can be shown that the most effective changes came not from executive or legislative action but instead from policy implementation one of the foremost rationales for the creation of the united states department of transportation (usdot) was that an agency was needed to mediate between the conflicting interests of interstates and cities initially these policies came as regulation of the state highway departments over time usdot officials re-focused highway building from a national level to the local scale with this shift of perspective came an encouragement for alternative transportation and locally based planning agencies
at present freeway expansion has largely stalled in the united states due to a multitude of factors that converged in the 1970s higher due process requirements prior to taking of private property increasing land values increasing costs for construction materials local opposition to new freeways in urban cores the passage of the national environmental policy act (which imposed the requirement that each new federally funded project must have an environmental impact statement or report) and falling gas tax revenues as a result of the nature of the flat-cent tax (it is not automatically adjusted for inflation) the tax revolt movement and growing popular support for high-speed mass transit in lieu of new freeways
== route numberingedit ==
=== united kingdomedit ===
==== great britainedit ====
in england and wales the numbers of major motorways followed a numbering system separate to that of the a-road network though based on the same principle of zones running clockwise from the m1 the zones were defined for zones 1 to 4 based on the proposed m2 m3 and m4 motorways the m5 and m6 numbers were reserved for the other two planned long distance motorways the preston bypass the uk's first motorway should have been numbered a6(m) under the scheme decided upon but it was decided to keep the number m6 as had already been applied certain portions or bypasses of a-roads may be designated as motorways the name of these portions being given the suffix (m) an example is the a1(m)
in scotland where the scottish office (superseded by the scottish government in 1999) rather than the ministry of transport and civil aviation had the decision there is no zonal pattern but rather the a-road rule is strictly enforced it was decided to reserve the numbers 7 8 and 9 for scotland the m8 follows the route of the a8 and the a90 became part of the m90 when the a90 was re-routed along the path of the a85
==== northern irelandedit ====
in northern ireland a distinct numbering system is used which is separate from the rest of the united kingdom though the classification of roads along the lines of a b and c is universal throughout the uk and the isle of man according to a written answer to a parliamentary question to the northern ireland minister for regional development there is no known reason as to how northern ireland's road numbering system was devised however motorways as in the rest of the uk are numbered m with the two major motorways coming from belfast being numbered m1 and m2 the m12 is a short spur of the m1 with the m22 being a short continuation (originally intended to be a spur) of the m2 there are two other motorways the short m3 the m5 and a motorway section of the a8 road known as the a8(m)
=== republic of irelandedit ===
in the republic of ireland motorway and national road numbering is quite different from the uk convention since the passage of the roads act 1993 all motorways are part of or form national primary roads these routes are numbered in series (usually radiating anti-clockwise from dublin starting with the n1/m1) using numbers from 1 to 33 (and separately from the series 50) motorways use the number of the route of which they form part with an m prefix rather than n for national road (or in theory rather than r for regional road) in most cases the motorway has been built as a bypass of a road previously forming the national road (e.g the m7 bypassing roads previously forming the n7)the bypassed roads are reclassified as regional roads although updated signposting may not be provided for some time and adherence to signage colour conventions is lax (regional roads have black-on-white directional signage national routes use white-on-green)
under the previous legislation the local government (roads and motorways) act 1974 motorways theoretically existed independently to national roads however the short sections of motorway opened during this act except for the m50 always took their number from the national road that they were bypassing the older road was not downgraded at this point (indeed regional roads were not legislated for at this stage) older signage at certain junctions on the m7 and m11 can be seen reflecting this earlier scheme where for example n11 and m11 can be seen coexisting
the m50 an entirely new national road is an exception to the normal inheritance process as it does not replace a road previously carrying an n number the m50 was nevertheless legislated in 1994 as the n50 route (it had only a short section of non-motorway section form the junction 11 tallaght to junction 12 firhouse until its extension as the southern cross motorway) the m50's designation was chosen as a recognisable number as of 2010 the n34 is the next unused national primary road designation in theory a motorway in ireland could form part of a regional road
=== elsewhereedit ===
in hungary similar to ireland motorway numbers can be derived from the original national highway numbers (17) with an m prefix attached e.g m7 is on the route of the old highway 7 from budapest towards lake balaton and croatia new motorways not following the original budapest-centred radial highway system get numbers m8 m9 etc. or m0 in the case of the ring road around budapest
also in the netherlands motorway numbers can be derived from the original national highway numbers but with an a (autosnelweg) prefix attached like a9
in germany federal motorways have the prefix a (autobahn) if the following number is an odd number the motorway generally follows a northsouth direction even-numbered motorways generally follow an eastwest direction other controlled-access (dual carriageways) in germany can be federal highways (bundesstraen) state highways (landesstraen) district highways (kreisstraen) and city highways (stadtstraen) each with their own numbering system
in new zealand as well as in the scandinavian countries in finland brazil and russia motorway numbers are also derived from the state highway route that they form a part of but unlike hungary and ireland they are not distinguished from non motorway sections of the same state highway route in the cases where a new motorway acts as a bypass of a state highway route the original state highway is either stripped of that status or renumbered a low road number means a road suitable for long distance driving in switzerland as of april 2011 there are 1,763.6 kilometres (1,095.9 mi) of a planned 1,893.5 kilometres (1,176.6 mi) of motorway completed the country is mountainous with a high proportion of tunnels there are 220 totaling 200 kilometres (120 mi) which is over 12% of the total motorway length
in australia motorway numbering varies from state to state currently most states are adopting numbering systems with the prefix m for motorways
in pakistan motorways are denoted with the prefix m
in belgium motorways but also some dual carriageways have numbers preceded by an a however those that also have an e-number are generally referenced with that one city ring and bypasses have numbers preceded by an r these also can be either motorways or dual carriageways
== regional variationedit ==
while the design characteristics listed above are generally applicable around the globe every jurisdiction provides its own specifications and design criteria for controlled-access highways

==== belgiumedit ====
in 1937 the first motorway between brussels and ostend was completed following the example of neighbouring countries such as germany it mainly served local industries and tourism as a connection between the capital city and a coastal region however the second world war and the reparation of the complete road network after the war caused a serious delay in the creation of other motorways in 1949 the first plans were made to build a complete motorway network of 930 kilometres (580 mi) that would be integrated with the neighbouring networks although the plans were ready the construction of the motorway network was much slower than in neighbouring countries because the project was deemed not to be urgent
because of economic growth in the 1960s more citizens could afford cars and the call for good-quality roads was higher than ever before in each year between 1965 and 1973 over 100 kilometres (62 mi) of motorway were built at the end of the 1970s the construction of motorways slowed down again for reasons of cost combined with an economic crisis more expensive fuel and changing public opinion in the following years the only investments done were to complete already started motorway constructions but most important cities were already connected in 1981 the responsibilities for construction and maintenance of the motorways shifted from the federal to the regional governments this sometimes caused tensions between the governments for example the part of the ring road around brussels that crosses wallonian territory has never been finished since only flanders suffers from the unfinished ring
belgium today has the longest total motorway length per area unit of any country in the world most of the motorway system has at least three lanes in each direction and almost all motorways have overhead lighting even in rural areas however the dense population in belgium and the still unfinished state of some motorways like the ring roads around brussels and antwerp cause major traffic congestion on motorways on an average monday morning in 2012 there was a total of 356 kilometres (221 mi) of traffic jams and the longest traffic jam of the year was 1,258 kilometres (782 mi) purely on the motorways
==== bulgariaedit ====
legislation in bulgaria defines two types of highways motorways (a avtomagistrala) and expressways (  skorosten pat) the main differences are that motorways have emergency lanes and the maximum allowed speed limit is 140 km/h (87 mph) while expressways do not have emergency lanes and the speed limit is 120 km/h (75 mph) as of july 2013 618 kilometres (384 mi) of motorways are in service with another 141 kilometres (88 mi) under various stages of construction more than 400 kilometres (250 mi) are planned also several expressways are planned
==== croatiaedit ====
==== denmarkedit ====
denmark has a well covered motorway system today which has been difficult to build due to the county's geography with many islands the longest bridges are the great belt and the resund bridges to skne (scania) in southern sweden both are motorways with dual electrical train tracks added a motorway tunnel across the fehmarn belt to germany is planned around copenhagen two ring motorways have been built even roads with fewer than 10,000 vehicles per day have been built in the most northern part of jutland this was done to assure that all ferry traffic is directed to the motorway system as soon as possible
==== finlandedit ====
finland has 863 kilometres (536 mi) of motorway which is only a small proportion of the whole highway network more than half of the length of the motorway network consists of six radial motorways originating in helsinki to kirkkonummi (lnsivyl) turku (vt1/e18) tampere (vt3/e12) tuusula heinola (vt4/e75) and hamina (vt7/e18) these roads have a total length of 653 kilometres (406 mi) the other motorways are rather short sections close to the biggest cities often designed to be bypasses the motorway section on national roads 4 and 29 between simo and tornio is said to be the northernmost motorway in the world
finnish motorways do not have a separate road numbering scheme instead they carry national highway numbers in addition to signposted motorways there are also some limited-access two-lane expressways and other grade-separated four-lane expressways (perhaps the most significant example being ring iii near helsinki)

the autoroute system in france consists largely of toll roads except around large cities and in parts of the north it is a network of 11,882 kilometres (7,383 mi) worth of motorways autoroute destinations are shown in blue while destinations reached through a combination of autoroutes are shown with an added autoroute logo toll autoroutes are signalled with the word page (toll)
==== germanyedit ====
germany's network of controlled-access expressways includes federal autobahnen and bundesstraen as well as landesstraen (state highways) kreisstraen (district highways) and gemeindestraen (municipal highways) the federal autobahn network has a total length of 12,917 kilometres (8,026 mi) in 2014 making it one of the densest networks in the world the german autobahns have no general speed limit (though about 47% of the total length is subject to local and/or conditional limits) but the advisory speed limit (richtgeschwindigkeit) is 130 km/h (81 mph) the lower class expressways usually have speed limits of 120 km/h (75 mph) or lower

in ireland the local government (roads and motorways) act 1974 made motorways possible although the first section the m7 naas bypass did not open until 1983 the first section of the m50 opened in 1990 a part of which was ireland's first toll motorway the west-link however it would be the 1990s before substantial sections of motorway were opened in ireland with the first completed motorwaythe 83-kilometre (52 mi) m1 motorwaybeing finished in 2005
under the transport 21 infrastructural plan motorways or high quality dual carriageways were built between dublin and the major cities of cork galway limerick and waterford by the end of 2010 other shorter sections of motorway either have been or will be built on some other main routes in 2007 legislation (the roads bill 2007) was created to allow existing roads be designated motorways by order because previously legislation allowed only for newly built roads to be designated motorways
as a result most hqdcs nationwide (other than some sections near dublin on the n4 and n7 which did not fully meet motorway standards) were reclassified as motorways the first stage in this process occurred when all the hqdc schemes open or under construction on the n7 and n8 and between kinnegad and athlone on the n6 and kilcullen and south of carlow on the n9 were reclassified motorway on 24 september 2008 further sections of dual carriageway were reclassified in 2009
as of december 2011 the republic of ireland has around 1,017 kilometres (632 mi) of motorways
==== italyedit ====
the world's first motorway was the autostrada dei laghi inaugurated on 21 september 1924 in milan it linked milan to varese it was then extended to como near the border with switzerland inaugurated on 28 june 1925 piero puricelli the engineer who designed this new type of road decided to cover the expenses by introducing a toll
other motorways built before the second world war in italy were naples-pompeii florence-pisa padua-venice milan-turin milan-bergamo-brescia and rome-ostia
type b highways (or strada extraurbana principale) commonly but unofficially known as superstrada are divided highways with at least two lanes for each direction a paved shoulder on the right no cross-traffic and no at-grade intersections access restrictions on such highways are exactly the same as on autostrade as is the signage at the beginning and the end of the highway (the only differences being the background colours and the maximum speed limit blue instead of green and 110 kmph instead of 130 kmph)
==== netherlandsedit ====
roads in the netherlands include at least 2,758 kilometres (1,714 mi) of motorways and expressways and with a motorway density of 64 kilometres per 1,000 km2 (103 mi/1,000 mi2) the country has one of the densest motorway networks in the world about 2,500 kilometres (1,600 mi) are fully constructed to motorway standards these are called autosnelweg or simply snelweg and numbered and signposted with an a and up to three digits like a12
they are consistently built with at least two carriageways guard rails and interchanges with grade separation since september 2012 the nationwide maximum speed has been raised to 130 km/h (81 mph) but on many stretches speed is still limited to 120 or 100 km/h (75 or 62 mph) dutch motorways may only be used by motor vehicles both capable and legally allowed to go at least 60 km/h (37 mph)
dutch roads are used with a very high intensity in relation to the network length and traffic congestion is common due to the country's high population density therefore since 1979 large portions of the motorway network have been equipped with variable message signs and dynamic electronic signalization these signs can show a lower speed limit as low as 50 km/h (31 mph) to optimize the flow of heavy traffic and a variety of other communications additionally there are peak rushhour or plus lanes which allow motorists to use the hard shoulder as an extra traffic lane in case of congestion these extra lanes are observed by cctv cameras from a traffic control center
less common but increasingly separate roadways are created for local / regional traffic and long distance traffic this way the number of weaving motions across lanes is reduced and the traffic capacity per lane of the road is optimised a special feature of dutch motorways is the use of porous asphalt concrete which allows water to drain efficiently and even in heavy rain no water will splash up in contrast to concrete or other road surfaces the netherlands is the only country that uses pac this extensively and the goal is to cover 100% of the motorways with pac in spite of the high costs of construction and maintenance all in all the netherlands has one of the more advanced motorway networks in the world
==== norwayedit ====
norway has (2015) 459 kilometres (285 mi) of motorways in addition to 422 kilometres (262 mi) of roads (in norwegian motortrafikkveier) where pedestrians bicycles etc are forbidden though with a bit lower standard than true motorway most of the network serves the big cities chiefly oslo and bergen see also the e6 e18 and the e39 most motorways use four-ramp parclo interchanges or a diamond interchange with roundabouts the first motorway was built in 1964 just outside oslo the motorways road pattern layout is similar to those in the us and canada featuring a yellow stripe towards the median and white stripes between the lanes and on the edge the speed limits are 90110 kilometres per hour (5668 mph)
==== polandedit ====
the highways in poland are divided into motorways and expressways as of january 2015 there are 1,553 kilometres (965 mi) of motorways (autostrady singular autostrada) and 1,473 kilometres (915 mi) of expressways (drogi ekspresowe singular droga ekspresowa)
motorways in poland are limited-access roads which can be only dual carriageways as of may 2013 there were 1,370 kilometres (851 mi) of motorways in poland additionally there were also 237 kilometres (147 mi) of motorways under construction (may 2013)
expressways in poland are limited-access roads which can be dual or single carriageways as of may 2013 there were 1,055 kilometres (656 mi) of expressways in poland there were about 440 kilometres (273 mi) of expressways in various stages of construction the start of an expressway in poland is marked with sign of white car on blue background while number sign for an expressway is of red background and white letters with the letter s preceding a number
on 15 may 2004 the regulation of the council of ministers (on the network of motorways and express roads) referred to a network of motorways and expressways in poland totaling about 7,200 kilometres (4,470 mi) (including about 2,000 kilometres (1,240 mi) of motorways) regulation from february 2007 added roads s2 and s79 to the list regulation from october 2009 supplemented plans with road s61
==== portugaledit ====
portugal was the third country in europeafter italy and germanyto build a motorway (portuguese autoestrada plural autoestradas) opening in 1944 the lisbon-estdio nacional section of the present a5 (autoestrada da costa do estoril)
additional motorway sections were built in the 1960s 1970s and early 1980s however the large-scale building of motorways started only in the late 1980s currently portugal has a very well-developed network of motorways with about a 3,000-kilometre (1,900 mi) extension that connects all the highly populated coastal regions of the country and the main cities of the less populous interior this means that 87% of the portuguese population lives less than 15 minutes driving time from a motorway access
most of the portuguese motorways are tolled but during the late 1990s and the 2000s a number of non-tolled motorways were built these being classified as scut (sem custos para o utilizador no costs for the user) for economic reasons the scut concept was abolished between 2010 and 2011 today these motorways charge users having only electronic tolls former scut motorways can only be used by vehicles equipped with electronic payment devices or vehicles registered in the system
portuguese motorways form an independent network (rede nacional de autoestradas national motorway network) that overlaps with the fundamental and complementary subnetworks of the national highway network (rede rodoviria nacional) each motorway section overlapping with the fundamental subnetwork is part of an ip (itinerrio principal principal route) and each motorway section overlapping with the complementary subnetwork is part of an ic (itinerrio complementar complementary route) thus a motorway can overlap with sections of different ip or ic routes and on the other hand an ip or ic route can overlap with sections of different motorways an example is a22 motorway which overlaps with sections of ip1 and of ic4 routes another example is ip1 route which overlaps with sections of the a22 a2 a12 a1 and a3 motorways
the national motorway network has a proper numbering system in which each motorway has a number prefixed by the letter a in most cases a motorway signage indicates only its a number the number of the ip or ic of which a motorway section is part is not signed except in some short motorways which lack a proper a number
==== romaniaedit ====
the first motorway in romania was completed in 1972 linking bucharest and piteti as of july 2015 romania has 707 kilometres (439 mi) of motorways in use with another 176 kilometres (109 mi) under construction the romanian government has adopted a general master plan for transport that was approved by the european union in july 2015 containing the strategy for expanding the road (including motorway) network until 2040 using eu funding
==== spainedit ====
the spanish network of autopistas and autovias has a length of 16,583 kilometres (10,304 mi) autopistas are specifically reserved for automobile travel so all vehicles not able to sustain at least 60 km/h (37 mph) are banned from them general speed limits are mandated by the spanish traffic law as 60120 km/h (3775 mph) specific limits may be imposed based on road meteorological or traffic conditions spanish legislation requires an alternate route to be provided for slower vehicles many but not all autopistas are toll roads which also mandates an alternate toll-free route under the spanish laws
==== swedenedit ====
sweden has the largest motorway network in scandinavia (2,050 kilometres 1,270 mi) it is however unevenly allocated most motorways are located in the south of the country where the population density is the highest
the first motorway in sweden opened in 1953 between lund and malm four-lane expressways had been built before an early example is e20 between gothenburg and alingss built in the early 1940s most of the current network was built in the 1970s and 1990s
a swedish highway that has a significant portion of the swedish motorway network is e4 which runs from the border city of tornio in finland to helsingborg in scania e4 is the main route that connects the capital stockholm with scania and the rest of the european continent via e20 over the resund bridge all of e4 south of the city gvle is of motorway standard with only the part passing ljungby (32 km) left currently in expressway standard upgrade to motorway standard will start in 2017 the part of e4 that runs through western stockholm is called essingeleden and is the busiest road in sweden
other highways that have a significant portion of motorway standard is e6 e20 e18 and e22 motorways in sweden are however not restricted to european routes so called riksvgar and other regional road types can also be of motorway standard an example of this is riksvg 40 riksvg 40 is the main link between the largest cities in the country stockholm and gothenburg notably not even the majority of the european route- network in sweden is motorway or even have expressway standard all of this is because road numbering and road standard is separate in sweden as in the rest of scandinavia
==== united kingdomedit ====
===== great britainedit =====
a map shewing future pattern of principal national routes was issued by the ministry of war transport in 1946 shortly before the law that allowed roads to be restricted to specified classes of vehicle (the special roads act 1949) was passed the first section of motorway the m6 preston bypass opened in 1958 followed by the first major section of motorway (the m1 between crick and berrygrove) which opened in 1959 from then onwards motorways opened on a regular basis right into the 1980s by 1972 the first 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) of motorway had been built
whilst roads outside of urban areas continued to be built throughout the 1970s opposition to urban routes became more pronounced most notably plans by the greater london council for a series of ringways were cancelled following extensive road protests and a rise in costs in 1986 the compromised single-ring m25 motorway was completed in 1996 the total length of motorways reached 2,000 miles (3,200 km)
motorways in great britain will nearly always have the following characteristics
no traffic lights (except occasionally on slip roads prior to the main carriageway)
exit is nearly always via a numbered junction and slip road only with minor rare exceptions
pedestrians cyclists and vehicles below a specific engine size are banned
there is a central reservation separating traffic flowing in opposing directions (the only exception to this is the a38 (m) in birmingham where the central reservation is replaced by another lane in which the direction of traffic changes depending on the time of day there was another small spur motorway near manchester with no solid central reservation but this was declassified as a motorway in the 2000s.)
no roundabouts on the main carriageway (this is only the case however on motorways beginning with m (so called m class)) in the case of upgraded a roads ending with m there are numerous cases of roundabouts on the main carriageway in all m class motorways bar two there are no roundabouts except where they mark the point at which the numbered motorway in question ends or the motorway designation ends the only exceptions in great britain to this are the m271 in southampton which has a roundabout on the main carriageway where it meets the m27 but then continues as the m271 after the junction this motorway has been criticised as being illegal and as undermining the meaning of an m class motorway the second exception came about as a result of renumbering sections of the m62 and m66 motorways near manchester as the m60 to form a ring around the city what was formerly the junction between the m62 and m66 now involves the clockwise m60 negotiating a roundabout while traffic for the eastbound m62 and northbound m66 carries straight on from the m60 this junction known as simister island has also been criticised for the presence of a roundabout and the numbered route turning off
===== northern irelandedit =====
legal authority existed in the special roads act (northern ireland) 1963 similar to that in the 1949 act the first motorway to open was the m1 motorway though it did so under temporary powers until the special roads act had been passed work on the motorways continued until the 1970s when the oil crisis and the troubles both intervened causing the abandonment of many schemes
=== other countries in the worldedit ===
==== australiaedit ====
most of australia's capital cities feature a motorway network within their urban areas sydney melbourne brisbane and perth while canberra adelaide hobart and the regional centres of newcastle geelong gold coast and wollongong feature a selection of limited-access routes outside these areas traffic volumes do not generally demand motorway-standard access although heavily trafficked regional corridors such as sydneynewcastle (m1 pacific motorway) brisbanegold coast (m1 pacific motorway) melbournegeelong (m1 princes freeway) perth-mandurah (sr2 kwinana freeway) and that form part of major long-distance routes feature high-standard motorway links
the m31 hume highway/freeway connecting sydney and melbourne and the m23 federal highway spur route that connects canberra with sydney are the only major interstate highways that are completed to a continuous dual carriageway standard in addition construction on the a1/m1 pacific highway connecting sydney and brisbane is underway to upgrade the m1 to dual carriageway highway there are also plans to upgrade the a25 barton highway another spur off the m31 that connects canberra with melbourne to a dual carriageway highway
although these inter-city highways are dual carriageway they are not all controlled access highways most of these inter-city highways have driveways to adjacent property and at-grade junctions with smaller roads
unlike many other countries some of australia's motorways are being opened to cyclists as the respective state governments upgrade their state's motorways bicycle lanes are being added and/or shoulders widened alongside the motorways
==== braziledit ====
although some 11,000 kilometres (6,800 mi) of brazilian highway is built to motorway-standard there is no distinct designation for controlled-access highways in the brazilian federal and state highway systems the term autoestrada (portuguese for motorway") is not commonly used in brazil the terms estrada ("road") and especially rodovia ("highway") are instead preferred nevertheless the most technically advanced motorways in brazil are defined class 0 motorways by the national department of transport infrastructure (dnit) these motorways are built to safely allow for vehicular speeds of up to 130 km/h (81 mph)) in mountainous terrain the maximum allowable grade is 5% and maximum allowable radius is 665 metres (2,182 ft) (with 12% super-elevation)
so paulo state with 4,700 kilometres (2,900 mi) of motorway has the most in the country it is also the state with more highways conceded to the private sector resulting in the highest value of toll fares per kilometer of highway
brazil's first motorway the rodovia anhanguera was completed in 1953 as an upgrade of the earlier single-carriageway highway that same year construction of the second carriageway of rodovia anchieta began motorway construction most projects in the form of upgrades of older single-carriageway highways quickened in the following decades the current class 0 motorways include rodovia dos bandeirantes rodovia dos imigrantes rodovia castelo branco rodovia ayrton senna/carvalho pinto rodovia osvaldo aranha (also known as free-way") and so paulo's metropolitan beltway rodoanel mario covas all modern post-70's highways meeting modern european standards other stretches of highway such as the under-construction south br-101 and rodovia rgis bittencourt are of older design standards
==== canadaedit ====
canada has no current national system for controlled-access highways with the exception of the trans canada highway all highways including the controlled-access ones are under provincial jurisdiction the largest networks in the country are in ontario (400-series highways) and quebec (autoroutes of quebec) these roads are influenced by and have influenced us standards but have design innovations and differences the total length of dual-carriageways with controlled access in canada is 6,350 kilometres (3,950 mi) of which 564 kilometres (350 mi) are in british columbia 642 kilometres (399 mi) in alberta 59 kilometres (37 mi) in saskatchewan 2,135 kilometres (1,327 mi) in ontario 1,941 kilometres (1,206 mi) in quebec and 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) in the maritimes
==== chinaedit ====
the national trunk highway system (nths) expressway network of the people's republic of china is the longest in the world the total length of china's expressways was 111,950 kilometres (69,560 mi) by the end of 2014 only in 2012 12,409 kilometres (7,711 mi) of expressways were added to this network
expressways in china are a fairly recent addition to a complicated network of roads according to chinese government sources china did not have any expressways before 1988 one of the earliest expressways nationwide was the jingshi expressway between beijing and shijiazhuang in hebei province this expressway now forms part of the jingzhu expressway currently one of the longest expressways nationwide at over 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi)
==== el salvadoredit ====
the rn-21 (eastwest boulevard monseor romero) is the very first freeway to be built in el salvador and in central america the freeway passes the northern area of the city of santa tecla la libertad it has a small portion serving antiguo cuscatlan la libertad and merges with the rn-5 (eastwest boulevard de los proceres/autopista del aeropuerto) in san salvador the total length of the rn-21 is 9.35 kilometres (5.81 mi) and is currently working as a traffic reliever in the metropolitan area the rn-21 was named in honor of the first mayor of san salvador diego de holguin due to political reasons it was renamed to boulevard monseor romero in honor to scar romero the first phase of the highway was completed in 2009 and the second phase was completed and opened in november 2012
==== hong kongedit ====
in hong kong major motorways are numbered from 1 to 10 in addition to their names speed limits on expressways typically range from 50 to 110 km/h (31 to 68 mph)
==== indiaedit ====
expressways in india make up more than 942 kilometres (585 mi) of the indian national highway system on which they are the highest class of road the national highways development project is underway to add an additional 18,637 kilometres (11,580 mi) of expressways to the network by the year 2022 the national highways network of india is a network of highways that is managed and maintained by agencies of the government of india currently india has 71,000 kilometres (44,000 mi) of national highways out of which more than 16,000 kilometres (9,900 mi) are four- or six-laned and remaining 55,000 kilometres (34,000 mi) are two-laned the national highway system of india consists of approximately 10,000 km (6,200 mi) of four-laned highways that collect toll from users but do not have control of access and cannot be called expressways currently a massive project is underway to expand the highway network and the government of india plans to add an additional 18,637 km (11,580 mi) of expressways to the network by the year 2022 these roads will be access-controlled roads and will feature between four and six lanes with 3,530 km (2,190 mi) km to come up by 2015 the ministry of road transport and highways is in the process of preparing a draft for creation of a national expressways authority of india (neai) on the lines of the national highways authority of india (nhai)
the ministry of road transport and highways has proposed a green-field access-controlled expressways network across india study was conducted on identifying stretches on which new expressways can be constructed but as of now no further action has been taken on the indian national expressways network report
==== indonesiaedit ====
in indonesia the expressway is more known as toll road indonesia has 1,710 km expressway length so far almost 70% of its expressways are in java island
in 2009 the indonesian government had planned to expand more expressway network in java island by connecting merak to banyuwangi which is the total length of trans-java toll road including the java big cities expressway such as jakarta surabaya bandung and its complements is more than 1,000 kilometers the indonesian government also had planned to build the trans-sumatra toll road that connects banda aceh to bakauheni along 2,700 kilometers in 2012 the government will allocate rp 150 trillion rupiah for the construction of the toll roads there are three stage of construction of trans-sumatra toll road which is expected to connected together in 2025 the other islands in indonesia such as kalimantan sulawesi also has begun constructed its expressways including connecting manado to makassar in sulawesi and also pontianak to balikpapan in kalimantan however there is still no plans to build an expressway in papua due to its slow population growth indonesia is expected to have at least 7,000 kilometers expressway in 2030
==== iranedit ====
the history of freeways in iran goes back to before the iranian revolution the first freeway in iran was built at that time between tehran and karaj with additional construction and the studies of many other freeways started as well today iran has about 2,160 kilometres (1,340 mi) of freeway
==== israeledit ====
controlled-access highways in israel are designated by a blue colour blue highways are completely grade-separated but may include bus stops and other elements that may slow down traffic on the right lane
==== japanedit ====
national expressways ( ksoku jidsha kokud) make up the majority of controlled-access highways in japan the network boasts an uninterrupted link between aomori prefecture at the northern part of honsh and kagoshima prefecture at the southern part of kysh linking shikoku as well additional expressways serve travellers in hokkaid and on okinawa island although those are not connected to the honsh-kysh-shikoku grid expressways have a combined length of 8,050 kilometres (5,000 mi) as of april 2012
==== koreaedit ====
since gyeongin expressway linking seoul and incheon opened in 1968 national expressway system in south korea has been expanded into 36 routes with total length of 4,044 kilometres (2,513 mi) as of 2012 most of expressways are four-lane roads while 1,030 kilometres (640 mi) (26%) have six to ten lanes speed limit is typically 100 km/h (62 mph) for routes with four or more lanes and 80 km/h (50 mph) for two-lane routes some northsouth routes including some sections of gyeongbu expressway have limit of 110 km/h (68 mph)
expressways in south korea were originally numbered in order of construction since 24 august 2001 they have been numbered in a scheme somewhat similar to that of the interstate highway system in the united states furthermore the symbols of the south korean highways are similar to the us red white and blue
arterial routes are designated by two-digit numbers with north-south routes having odd numbers and east-west routes having even numbers primary routes (i.e major thoroughfares) have 5 or 0 as their last digit while secondary routes end in other digits
branch routes have three-digit route numbers where the first two digits match the route number of an arterial route this differs from the american system whose last two digits match the primary route
belt lines have three-digit route numbers where the first digit matches the respective city's postal code this also differs from american numbering
route numbers in the range 7099 are not used in south korea they are reserved for designations in the event of korean reunification
the gyeongbu expressway kept its route 1 designation as it is south korea's first and most important expressway
==== malaysiaedit ====
the malaysian expressway system (malay sistem lebuhraya malaysia) which begins with the north-south expressway (nse) is currently in the process of being substantially developed these expressways are built by private companies under the supervision of the government highway authority malaysian highway authority
the expressway network of malaysia is considered the best expressway network in southeast asia and also in asia after china and japan and also the fifth in the world they were 30 expressways in the country and the total length is 1,821 kilometres (1,132 mi) and another 219.3 kilometres (136.3 mi) is still under construction the closed toll expressway system is similar to the japanese expressway system and chinese expressway system all malaysian toll expressways are controlled-access highway and managed in the build-operate-transfer (bot) system
malaysian expressways exist in both west malaysia and east malaysia however the former are better-connected the north-south expressway passes through all the major cities and conurbations in west malaysia such as penang ipoh the klang valley and johor bahru the pan borneo highway connects the malaysian states of sabah and sarawak with brunei
==== new zealandedit ====
the term motorway in new zealand encompasses multilane divided freeways as well as narrower 2-4-lane undivided expressways with varying degrees of grade separation the term motorway describes the legal traffic restrictions rather than the type of road
new zealand's motorway network is small due to the nation's low population density and low traffic volumes making it uneconomical to build controlled-access highways outside the major urban centres
new zealand's first motorway opened in december 1950 near wellington running from johnsonville to tawa this five-kilometre (3.1 mi) motorway now forms the southern part of the johnsonville-porirua motorway and part of state highway 1 auckland's first stretch of motorway was opened in 1953 between ellerslie and mount wellington (between present-day exit 435 and exit 438) and now forms part of the southern motorway
most major urban areas in new zealand feature limited-access highways auckland wellington christchurch and dunedin contain motorways with only auckland having a substantial motorway network
==== pakistanedit ====
pakistan has a network of high-quality international-standard limited access (or access-controlled) motorways and expressways which are maintained and operated by the national highway authority pakistan also has the second largest network of motorways in south asia just behind india in august 2012 operational motorways and expressways in pakistan had a combined length of 679.5 kilometres (422.2 mi) with another 1,261 kilometres (784 mi) under construction nha plans to construct an additional 1,915 kilometres (1,190 mi) of motorways in the next 10 years
pakistan's motorways are part of pakistan's national trade corridor project that aims to link pakistan's three arabian sea ports of karachi port qasim and gwadar to the rest of the country and further on with afghanistan central asia and china
pakistan's first motorway the m2 was inaugurated in november 1997 the m2 is a 367-kilometre-long (228 mi) six-lane motorway that links pakistan's federal capital islamabad with punjab's provincial capital lahore since the completion of the m2 two additional motorways have become operational these are the 54-kilometre (34 mi) four-lane (with capacity to increase to six lanes) m3 (pindi bhattian-faisalabad) which links the m2 to faisalabad and the 154-kilometre (96 mi) six-lane m1 (peshawar-swabi-islamabad)
under-construction motorways include
(karachilahore motorway) (klm) estimated to be completed in 2017 with a total length of 1,152 kilometres (716 mi)
m4 (faisalabad-multan) estimated to be completed in 2015 with a total length of 233 kilometres (145 mi)
m8 (ratoderogwadar) estimated to be completed in 2016 with a total length of 892 kilometres (554 mi)
m9 (hyderabadkarachi) estimated to be completed in 2016 with a total length of 136 kilometres (85 mi)
planned motorways include
m5 (multandera ghazi khan) with a total length of 80 kilometres (50 mi)
m6 (dera ghazi khanratodero) with a total length of 365 kilometres (227 mi)
m7 (daduhub) with a total length of 270 kilometres (170 mi)
==== singaporeedit ====
the expressways of singapore are special roads that allow motorists to travel quickly from one urban area to another all of them are dual carriageways with grade-separated access they usually have three to four lanes in each direction although there are two-lane carriageways at many expresswayexpressway intersections and five-lane carriageways in some places there are ten expressways including the new marina coastal expressway studies about the feasibility of additional expressways are ongoing
construction on the first expressway the pan island expressway started in 1966 as of 2014 there are 163 kilometres (101 mi) of expressways in singapore
the singaporean expressway networks are connected with malaysian expressway networks via ayer rajah expressway (connects with the second link expressway in malaysia) and bukit timah expressway (connects with the skudai highway via johorsingapore causeway)
==== south africaedit ====
in south africa the term freeway differs from most other parts of the world a freeway is a road where certain restrictions apply the following are forbidden from using a freeway
a vehicle drawn by an animal
a pedal cycle (such as a bicycle)
a motorcycle having an engine with a cylinder capacity not exceeding 50 cm3 or that is propelled by electrical power
a motor tricycle or motor quadrucycle
pedestrians
drivers may not use hand signals on a freeway (except in emergencies) and the minimum speed on a freeway is 60 km/h (37 mph) drivers in the rightmost lane of multi-carriageway freeways must move to the left if a faster vehicle approaches from behind to overtake
despite popular opinion that freeway means a road with at least two carriageways single carriageway freeways exist as is evidenced by the statement that the roads include 1,400 km [870 mi] of dual carriageway freeway 440 km [270 mi] of single carriageway freeway and 5,300 km [3,300 mi] of single carriage main road with unlimited access. the afrikaans translation of freeway is snelweg (literally fast road or expressway)
==== sri lankaedit ====
sri lanka currently has over 150 kilometres (93 mi) of designated expressways serving the southern part of the country the first stage of the e01 expressway (southern expressway) which opened in 2011 was sri lanka's first expressway spanning a distance of 95.3 kilometres (59.2 mi) the second stage of the southern expressway opened in 2014 and extends to matara the e03 expressway (colombokatunayake expressway) opened in 2013 and connects sri lanka's largest city colombo with the bandaranaike international airport covering a distance of 25.8 kilometres (16.0 mi) all e-grade highways in sri lanka are access controlled toll roads with speeds limits in the range of 80110 km/h (5068 mph) the network is to be expanded to 350 kilometres (220 mi) by 2019
operational (fully or partially) 
e01 (kottawa-matara)
e02 (kottawa-kerawalapitiya)
e03 (colombo-katunayake)
planned 
e04 (enderamulla-kurunegala-kandy)
e06 (kahatuduwa-pelmadulla)
colombo metropolitan expressway (colombo fort to peliyagoda connecting colombo with the e03 expressway (sri lanka) colombo-katunayaka expressway.)
==== thailandedit ====
the thai motorway network is an intercity motorway network that spans 145 kilometres (90 mi) it is to be extended to over 4,000 kilometres (2,500 mi) according to the master plan
thailand's motorway network is considered to be separate from thailand's expressway network which is the system of usually elevated expressways within greater bangkok thailand also has a provincial highway network
the thai highway network spans over 70,000 kilometres (43,000 mi) across all regions of thailand these highways however are often dual carriageways with frequent u-turn lanes and intersections slowing down traffic coupled with the increase in the number of vehicles and the demand for a limited-access motorway the thai government issued a cabinet resolution in 1997 detailing the motorway construction master plan some upgraded sections of highway are being turned into a motorway while other motorways are being purpose-built
==== turkeyedit ====
motorways (turkish otoyol) of turkey are a network in constant development some motorways require toll (using only rfid methods) mostly six lanes wide illuminated and with a 120 km/h (75 mph) speed limit in 2013 the motorways were 2,155 kilometres (1,339 mi) long in total
==== united statesedit ====
in the united states a freeway is defined by the federal government's manual on uniform traffic control devices as a divided highway with full control of access this means two things first adjoining property owners do not have a legal right of access meaning that they cannot connect their lands to the highway by constructing driveways although frontage roads provide access to properties adjacent to a freeway in many places when an existing road is converted into a freeway all existing driveways must be removed and access to adjacent private lands must be blocked with fences or walls
second traffic on a freeway is free-flowing all cross-traffic (and left-turning traffic) is relegated to overpasses or underpasses so that there are no traffic conflicts on the main line of the highway which must be regulated by traffic lights stop signs or other traffic control devices achieving such free flow requires the construction of many overpasses underpasses and ramp systems the advantage of grade-separated interchanges is that freeway drivers can almost always maintain their speed at junctions since they do not need to yield to vehicles crossing perpendicular to mainline traffic
in contrast an expressway is defined as a divided highway with partial control of access expressways may have driveways and at-grade intersections though these are usually less numerous than on ordinary arterial roads
this distinction was apparently first developed in 1949 by the special committee on nomenclature of what is now the american association of state highway and transportation officials in turn the definitions were incorporated into aashto's official standards book the manual on uniform traffic control devices which would become the national standards book of usdot under a 1966 federal statute the same distinction has also been codified into the statutory law of eight states california minnesota mississippi missouri nebraska north dakota ohio and wisconsin
however each state codified the federal distinction slightly differently california expressways do not necessarily have to be divided though they must have at least partial access control for both terms to apply in wisconsin a divided highway must be at least four lanes wide and in missouri both terms apply only to divided highways at least 16 kilometres (10 mi) long that are not part of the interstate highway system in north dakota and mississippi expressways may have full or partial access control and generally have grade separations at intersections a freeway is then defined as an expressway with full access control ohio's statute is similar but instead of the vague word generally it imposes a requirement that 50% of an expressway's intersections must be grade-separated for the term to apply only minnesota enacted the exact mutcd definitions in may 2008
the term expressway is also used for what the federal government calls freeways where the terms are distinguished freeways can be characterized as expressways upgraded to full access control while not all expressways are freeways
examples in the united states of roads which are technically expressways (under the federal definition) but contain the word freeway in their names state fair freeway in kansas chino valley freeway in california rockaway freeway in new york and shenango valley freeway (a portion of us 62) in pennsylvania
unlike in some jurisdictions not all freeways in the us are part of a single national freeway network (although together with non-freeways they form the national highway system) for example many state highways such as california state route 99 have significant freeway sections many sections of the older united states numbered highways network have been upgraded to freeways but have kept their existing us highway numbers
