a road is a thoroughfare route or way on land between two places that has been paved or otherwise improved to allow travel by foot or some other form of conveyance including a horse cart bicycle or motor vehicle
roads consist of one or two roadways (british english carriageways) each with one or more lanes and any associated sidewalks (british english pavement) and road verges
roads that are available for use by the public may be referred to as public roads or as highways
== definitionsedit ==
the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) defines a road as a line of communication (travelled way) using a stabilized base other than rails or air strips open to public traffic primarily for the use of road motor vehicles running on their own wheels, which includes bridges tunnels supporting structures junctions crossings interchanges and toll roads but not cycle paths.
in urban areas roads may diverge through a city or village and be named as streets serving a dual function as urban space easement and route modern roads are normally smoothed paved or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal construction or maintenance
=== united statesedit ===
in the united states laws distinguish between public roads which are open to public use and private roads which are privately controlled

in the united kingdom there is some ambiguity between the terms highway and road the highway code details rules for road users for the purposes of the english law highways act 1980 which covers england and wales but not scotland or northern ireland the term road is defined to be any length of highway or of any other road to which the public has access and includes bridges over which a road passes. this includes footpaths bridleways and cycle tracks and also road and driveways on private land and many car parks vehicle excise duty a road use tax is payable on some vehicles used on the public road
the definition of a road depends on the definition of a highway however there is no formal definition for a highway in the relevant act a 1984 ruling said the land over which a public right of way exists is known as a highway and although most highways have been made up into roads and most easements of way exist over footpaths the presence or absence of a made road has nothing to do with the distinction another legal view is that while a highway historically included footpaths bridleways driftways etc. it can now be used to mean those ways that allow the movement of motor-vehicles and the term rights of way can be used to cover the wider usage
== historyedit ==
the assertion that the first pathways were the trails made by animals has not been universally accepted in many cases animals do not follow constant paths others believe that some roads originated from following animal trails the icknield way is given as an example of this type of road origination where man and animal both selected the same natural line by about 10,000 bc rough roads/pathways were used by human travelers
the world's oldest known paved road was laid in egypt some time between 2600 and 2200 bc
stone-paved streets are found in the city of ur in the middle east dating back to 4000 bc
corduroy roads (log roads) are found dating to 4000 bc in glastonbury england
the sweet track a timber track causeway in england is one of the oldest engineered roads discovered and the oldest timber trackway discovered in northern europe built in winter 3807 bc or spring 3806 bc tree-ring dating (dendrochronology) enabled very precise dating it was claimed to be the oldest road in the world until the 2009 discovery of a 6,000-year-old trackway in plumstead london
brick-paved streets were used in india as early as 3000 bc 
in 500 bc darius i the great started an extensive road system for persia (iran) including the royal road which was one of the finest highways of its time the road remained in use after roman times
in ancient times transport by river was far easier and faster than transport by road especially considering the cost of road construction and the difference in carrying capacity between carts and river barges a hybrid of road transport and ship transport beginning in about 1740 is the horse-drawn boat in which the horse follows a cleared path along the river bank
from about 312 bc the roman empire built straight strong stone roman roads throughout europe and north africa in support of its military campaigns at its peak the roman empire was connected by 29 major roads moving out from rome and covering 78,000 kilometers or 52,964 roman miles of paved roads
in the 8th century ad many roads were built throughout the arab empire the most sophisticated roads were those in baghdad which were paved with tar tar was derived from petroleum accessed from oil fields in the region through the chemical process of destructive distillation
the highways act 1555 in britain transferred responsibility for maintaining roads from government to local parishes this resulted in a poor and variable state of roads to remedy this the first of the turnpike trusts was established around 1706 to build good roads and collect tolls from passing vehicles eventually there were approximately 1,100 trusts in britain and some 36,800 km (22,870 miles) of engineered roads the rebecca riots in carmarthenshire and rhayader from 1839 to 1844 contributed to a royal commission that led to the demise of the system in 1844 which coincided with the development of the uk railway system

== constructionedit ==
road construction requires the creation of a continuous right-of-way overcoming geographic obstacles and having grades low enough to permit vehicle or foot travel (pg15) and may be required to meet standards set by law or official guidelines the process is often begun with the removal of earth and rock by digging or blasting construction of embankments bridges and tunnels and removal of vegetation (this may involve deforestation) and followed by the laying of pavement material a variety of road building equipment is employed in road building
after design approval planning legal and environmental considerations have been addressed alignment of the road is set out by a surveyor the radii and gradient are designed and staked out to best suit the natural ground levels and minimize the amount of cut and fill (page34) great care is taken to preserve reference benchmarks (page59)
roads are designed and built for primary use by vehicular and pedestrian traffic storm drainage and environmental considerations are a major concern erosion and sediment controls are constructed to prevent detrimental effects drainage lines are laid with sealed joints in the road easement with runoff coefficients and characteristics adequate for the land zoning and storm water system drainage systems must be capable of carrying the ultimate design flow from the upstream catchment with approval for the outfall from the appropriate authority to a watercourse creek river or the sea for drainage discharge (page38 to 40)
a borrow pit (source for obtaining fill gravel and rock) and a water source should be located near or in reasonable distance to the road construction site approval from local authorities may be required to draw water or for working (crushing and screening) of materials for construction needs the top soil and vegetation is removed from the borrow pit and stockpiled for subsequent rehabilitation of the extraction area side slopes in the excavation area not steeper than one vertical to two horizontal for safety reasons (page 53 to 56 )
old road surfaces fences and buildings may need to be removed before construction can begin trees in the road construction area may be marked for retention these protected trees should not have the topsoil within the area of the tree's drip line removed and the area should be kept clear of construction material and equipment compensation or replacement may be required if a protected tree is damaged much of the vegetation may be mulched and put aside for use during reinstatement the topsoil is usually stripped and stockpiled nearby for rehabilitation of newly constructed embankments along the road stumps and roots are removed and holes filled as required before the earthwork begins final rehabilitation after road construction is completed will include seeding planting watering and other activities to reinstate the area to be consistent with the untouched surrounding areas (page 66 to 67 )
processes during earthwork include excavation removal of material to spoil filling compacting construction and trimming if rock or other unsuitable material is discovered it is removed moisture content is managed and replaced with standard fill compacted to meet the design requirements (generally 90-95% relative compaction) blasting is not frequently used to excavate the road bed as the intact rock structure forms an ideal road base when a depression must be filled to come up to the road grade the native bed is compacted after the topsoil has been removed the fill is made by the compacted layer method where a layer of fill is spread then compacted to specifications under saturated conditions the process is repeated until the desired grade is reached (page 68 to 69 )
general fill material should be free of organics meet minimum california bearing ratio (cbr) results and have a low plasticity index the lower fill generally comprises sand or a sand-rich mixture with fine gravel which acts as an inhibitor to the growth of plants or other vegetable matter the compacted fill also serves as lower-stratum drainage select second fill (sieved) should be composed of gravel decomposed rock or broken rock below a specified particle size and be free of large lumps of clay sand clay fill may also be used the road bed must be proof rolled after each layer of fill is compacted if a roller passes over an area without creating visible deformation or spring the section is deemed to comply (page 70 to 72 )
geosynthetics such as geotextiles geogrids and geocells are frequently used in the various pavement layers to improve road quality these materials and methods are used in low-traffic private roadways as well as public roads and highways geosynthetics perform four main functions in roads separation reinforcement filtration and drainage which increase the pavement performance reduce construction costs and decrease maintenance
the completed road way is finished by paving or left with a gravel or other natural surface the type of road surface is dependent on economic factors and expected usage safety improvements such as traffic signs crash barriers raised pavement markers and other forms of road surface marking are installed
according to a may 2009 report by the american association of state highway and transportation officials (aashto) and tripa national transportation research organizationdriving on rough roads costs the average american motorist approximately $400 a year in extra vehicle operating costs drivers living in urban areas with populations more than 250,000 are paying upwards of $750 more annually because of accelerated vehicle deterioration increased maintenance additional fuel consumption and tire wear caused by poor road conditions
when a single carriageway road is converted into dual carriageway by building a second separate carriageway alongside the first it is usually referred to as duplication twinning or doubling the original carriageway is changed from two-way to become one-way while the new carriageway is one-way in the opposite direction in the same way as converting railway lines from single track to double track the new carriageway is not always constructed directly alongside the existing carriageway
== maintenanceedit ==
like all structures roads deteriorate over time deterioration is primarily due to accumulated damage from vehicles however environmental effects such as frost heaves thermal cracking and oxidation often contribute according to a series of experiments carried out in the late 1950s called the aasho road test it was empirically determined that the effective damage done to the road is roughly proportional to the fourth power of axle weight a typical tractor-trailer weighing 80,000 pounds (36.287 t) with 8,000 pounds (3.629 t) on the steer axle and 36,000 pounds (16.329 t) on both of the tandem axle groups is expected to do 7,800 times more damage than a passenger vehicle with 2,000 pounds (0.907 t) on each axle potholes on roads are caused by rain damage and vehicle braking or related construction works
pavements are designed for an expected service life or design life in some parts of the united kingdom the standard design life is 40 years for new bitumen and concrete pavement maintenance is considered in the whole life cost of the road with service at 10 20 and 30 year milestones roads can be and are designed for a variety of lives (8- 15- 30- and 60-year designs) when pavement lasts longer than its intended life it may have been overbuilt and the original costs may have been too high when a pavement fails before its intended design life the owner may have excessive repair and rehabilitation costs some asphalt pavements are designed as perpetual pavements with an expected structural life in excess of 50 years
many asphalt pavements built over 35 years ago despite not being specifically designed as a perpetual pavement have remained in good condition long past their design life many concrete pavements built since the 1950s have significantly outlived their intended design lives some roads like chicago illinois's wacker drive a major two-level viaduct in the downtown area are being rebuilt with a designed service life of 100 years
virtually all roads require some form of maintenance before they come to the end of their service life pro-active agencies use pavement management techniques to continually monitor road conditions and schedule preventive maintenance treatments as needed to prolong the lifespan of their roads technically advanced agencies monitor the road network surface condition with sophisticated equipment such as laser/inertial profilometers these measurements include road curvature cross slope asperity roughness rutting and texture this data is fed into a pavement management system which recommends the best maintenance or construction treatment to correct the damage that has occurred
maintenance treatments for asphalt concrete generally include thin asphalt overlays crack sealing surface rejuvenating fog sealing micro milling or diamond grinding and surface treatments thin surfacing preserves protects and improves the functional condition of the road while reducing the need for routing maintenance leading to extended service life without increasing structural capacity
maintenance for the older concrete pavements that develop faults includes the technique called dowel bar retrofit this involves cutting slots in the pavement at each joint placing dowel bars in the slots then filling them with concrete patching material this method can extend the life of the concrete pavement for another 15 years
failure to maintain roads properly can create significant costs to society in a 2009 report released by the american association of state highway and transportation officials (usa) about 50% of the roads in the usa are in bad condition with urban areas worse the report estimates that urban drivers pay an average of $746/year on vehicle repairs while the average us motorist pays about $335/year in contrast the average motorist pays about $171/year in road maintenance taxes (based on 600 gallons/year and $0.285/gallon tax)
=== slab stabilizationedit ===
distress and serviceability loss on concrete roads can be caused by loss of support due to voids beneath the concrete pavement slabs the voids usually occur near cracks or joints due to surface water infiltration the most common causes of voids are pumping consolidation subgrade failure and bridge approach failure slab stabilization is a non-destructive method of solving this problem and is usually employed with other concrete pavement restoration (cpr) methods including patching and diamond grinding the technique restores support to concrete slabs by filing small voids that develop underneath the concrete slab at joints cracks or the pavement edge
the process consists of pumping a cementitous grout or polyurethane mixture through holes drilled through the slab the grout can fill small voids beneath the slab and/or sub-base the grout also displaces free water and helps keep water from saturating and weakening support under the joints and slab edge after stabilization is complete the three steps for this method after finding the voids are locating and drilling holes grout injection and post-testing the stabilized slabs
slab stabilization does not correct depressions increase the design structural capacity stop erosion or eliminate faulting it does however restore the slab support therefore decreasing deflections under the load stabilization should only be performed at joints and cracks where loss of support exists visual inspection is the simplest manner to find voids signs that repair is needed are transverse joint faulting corner breaks and shoulder drop off and lines at or near joints and cracks deflection testing is another common procedure utilized to locate voids it is recommended to do this testing at night as during cooler temperatures joints open aggregate interlock diminishes and load deflections are at their highest
=== testingedit ===
ground penetrating radar pulses electromagnetic waves into the pavement and measures and graphically displays the reflected signal this can reveal voids and other defects
the epoxy/core test detects voids by visual and mechanical methods it consists of drilling a 25 to 50 millimeter hole through the pavement into the sub-base with a dry-bit roto-hammer next a two-part epoxy is poured into the holedyed for visual clarity once the epoxy hardens technicians drill through the hole if a void is present the epoxy will stick to the core and provide physical evidence
common stabilization materials include pozzolan-cement grout and polyurethane the requirements for slab stabilization are strength and the ability to flow into or expand to fill small voids colloidal mixing equipment is necessary to use the pozzolan-cement grouts the contractor must place the grout using a positive-displacement injection pump or a non-pulsing progressive cavity pump a drill is also necessary but it must produce a clean hole with no surface spalling or breakouts the injection devices must include a grout packer capable of sealing the hole the injection device must also have a return hose or a fast-control reverse switch in case workers detect slab movement on the uplift gauge the uplift beam helps to monitor the slab deflection and has to have sensitive dial gauges
=== joint sealingedit ===
also called joint and crack repair this methods purpose is to minimize infiltration of surface water and incompressible material into the joint system joint sealants are also used to reduce dowel bar corrosion in concrete pavement restoration (cpr) techniques successful resealing consists of old sealant removal shaping and cleaning the reservoir installing the backer rod and installing the sealant sawing manual removal plowing and cutting are methods used to remove the old sealant saws are used to shape the reservoir when cleaning the reservoir no dust dirt or traces of old sealant should remain thus it is recommended to water wash sand-blast and then air blow to remove any sand dirt or dust the backer rod installation requires a double-wheeled steel roller to insert the rod to the desired depth after inserting the backer rod the sealant is placed into the joint there are various materials to choose for this method including hot pour bituminous liquid silicone and preformed compression seals
== safety considerationsedit ==
careful design and construction of roads can increase road traffic safety and reduce the harm (deaths injuries and property damage) on the highway system from traffic collisions
on neighborhood roads traffic calming safety barriers pedestrian crossings and cycle lanes can all protect pedestrians and cyclists
lane markers in some countries and states are marked with cat's eyes or botts dots bright reflectors that do not fade like paint botts dots are not used where it is icy in the winter because frost and snowplows can break the glue that holds them to the road although they can be embedded in short shallow trenches carved in the roadway as is done in the mountainous regions of california
for major roads risk can be reduced by providing limited access from properties and local roads grade separated junctions and median dividers between opposite-direction traffic to reduce likelihood of head-on collisions
the placement of energy attenuation devices (e.g guardrails wide grassy areas sand barrels) is also common some road fixtures such as road signs and fire hydrants are designed to collapse on impact light poles are designed to break at the base rather than violently stop a car that hits them highway authorities may also remove larger trees from the immediate vicinity of the road during heavy rains if the elevation of the road surface isn't higher than the surrounding landscape it may result in flooding
== environmental performanceedit ==
careful design and construction of a road can reduce any negative environmental impacts
water management systems can be used to reduce the effect of pollutants from roads rainwater and snowmelt running off of roads tends to pick up gasoline motor oil heavy metals trash and other pollutants and result in water pollution road runoff is a major source of nickel copper zinc cadmium lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) which are created as combustion byproducts of gasoline and other fossil fuels
de-icing chemicals and sand can run off into roadsides contaminate groundwater and pollute surface waters and road salts can be toxic to sensitive plants and animals sand applied to icy roads can be ground up by traffic into fine particulates and contribute to air pollution sand can alter stream bed environments causing stress for the plants and animals that live there
roads are a chief source of environmental noise generation in the early 1970s it was recognized that design of roads can be conducted to influence and minimize noise generation noise barriers are used to reduce noise pollution in particular where roads are located close to built-up areas regulations can restrict the use of engine braking
motor vehicle emissions contribute air pollution concentrations of air pollutants and adverse respiratory health effects are greater near the road than at some distance away from the road road dust kicked up by vehicles may trigger allergic reactions in addition on-road transportation greenhouse gas emissions are the largest single cause of climate change scientists say
== regulationedit ==
=== right- and left-hand trafficedit ===
traffic flows on the right or on the left side of the road depending on the country in countries where traffic flows on the right traffic signs are mostly on the right side of the road roundabouts and traffic circles go counter-clockwise/anti-clockwise and pedestrians crossing a two-way road should watch out for traffic from the left first in countries where traffic flows on the left the reverse is true
about 33% of the world by population drive on the left and 67% keep right by road distances about 28% drive on the left and 72% on the right even though originally most traffic drove on the left worldwide
== economicsedit ==
transport economics is used to understand both the relationship between the transport system and the wider economy and the complex network effects when there are multiple paths and competing modes for both personal and freight (road/rail/air/ferry) and where induced demand can result in increased on decreased transport levels when road provision is increased by building new roads or decreased (for example california state route 480) roads are generally built and maintained by the public sector using taxation although implementation may be through private contractors) or occasionally using road tolls
public-private partnerships are a way for communities to address the rising cost by injecting private funds into the infrastructure there are four main ones
design/build
design/build/operate/maintain
design/build/finance/operate
build/own/operate
economics and society depend heavily on efficient roads in the european union (eu) 44% of all goods are moved by trucks over roads and 85% of all people are transported by cars buses or coaches on roads the term was also commonly used to refer to roadsteads waterways that lent themselves to use by shipping
