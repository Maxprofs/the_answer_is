sunedit
sun gtype mainsequence star contains almost percent mass solar system
planetsedit
planets large enough achieved hydrostatic equilibrium cleared neighborhoods similar objects four terrestrial planets mercury venus earth mars four giant planets divided two gas giants jupiter saturn two ice giants uranus neptune excluding sun four giant planets account percent mass bodies solar system
dwarf planetsedit
iau internationally recognized authority assigning designations celestial bodies defines dwarf planets bodies large enough achieved hydrostatic equilibrium cleared neighbourhoods similar objects since five dwarf planets recognized iau ceres orbits asteroid belt orbits mars jupiter others orbit beyond neptune subclassified plutoids
mostlikely additional dwarf planetsedit
transneptunian objects theoretically large enough dwarf planets dozens could included quaoar orcus known moons allowed mass systems determined massive kg recommendation iau draft proposal sufficient classification dwarf planet
satellitesedit
natural satellites solar system known massive enough close hydrostatic equilibrium alan stern calls satellite planets however several equilibrium longer include moons listed saturn apart titan rhea moons equilibrium longer round saturns phoebe included satellites listed first order sun second order parent body
