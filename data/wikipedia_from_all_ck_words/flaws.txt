a flag is a piece of fabric (most often rectangular or quadrilateral) with a distinctive design that is used as a symbol as a signaling device or as decoration the term flag is also used to refer to the graphic design employed and flags have since evolved into a general tool for rudimentary signalling and identification especially in environments where communication is similarly challenging (such as the maritime environment where semaphore is used) national flags are potent patriotic symbols with varied wide-ranging interpretations often including strong military associations due to their original and ongoing military uses flags are also used in messaging advertising or for other decorative purposes the study of flags is known as vexillology from the latin word vexillum meaning flag or banner
due to the use of flags by military units flag is also used as the name of some military units a flag (arabic ) is equivalent to a brigade in arab countries and in spain a flag (spanish bandera) is a battalion-equivalent in the spanish legion
== history ==
in antiquity field signs or standards were used in warfare that can be categorized as vexilloid or flag-like examples include the sassanid battle standard derafsh kaviani and the standards of the roman legions such as the eagle of augustus caesar's xth legion or the dragon standard of the sarmatians the latter was let fly freely in the wind carried by a horseman but judging from depictions it was more similar to an elongated dragon kite than to a simple flag
during the high middle ages flags came to be used primarily as a heraldic device in battle allowing more easily to identify a knight than only from the heraldic device painted on the shield already during the high medieval period and increasingly during the late middle ages city states and communes such as those of the old swiss confederacy also began to use flags as field signs regimental flags for individual units became commonplace during the early modern period
during the peak of the age of sail beginning in the early 17th century it was customary (and later a legal requirement) for ships to carry flags designating their nationality these flags eventually evolved into the national flags and maritime flags of today flags also became the preferred means of communications at sea resulting in various systems of flag signals see international maritime signal flags
use of flags outside of military or naval context begins only with the rise of nationalist sentiment by the end of the 18th century the earliest national flags date to that period and during the 19th century it became common for every sovereign state to introduce a national flag
== national flags ==
one of the most popular uses of a flag is to symbolize a nation or country some national flags have been particularly inspirational to other nations countries or subnational entities in the design of their own flags some prominent examples include
the flag of denmark the dannebrog is attested in 1478 it inspired the cross design of the other nordic countries norway sweden finland iceland and regional scandinavian flags for the faroe islands land scania and bornholm as well as flags for the non-scandinavian shetland and orkney
the flag of the netherlands is the oldest tricolour its three colors of red white and blue go back to charlemagne's time the 9th century the coastal region of what today is the netherlands was then known for its cloth in these colors maps from the early 16th century already put flags in these colors next to this region like texeira's map of 1520 a century before that during the 15th century the three colors were mentioned as the coastal signals for this area with the 3 bands straight or diagonal single or doubled as state flag it first appeared around 1572 as the prince's flag in orangewhiteblue soon the more famous redwhiteblue began appearing becoming the prevalent version from around 1630 orange made a come back during the civil war of the late 18th century signifying the orangist or pro-stadtholder party during ww2 the pro-nazi nsb used it any symbolism has been added later to the three colors although the orange comes from the house of orange-nassau surprisingly this use of orange comes from nassau which today uses orange-blue not from orange which today uses red-blue however the usual way to show the link with the house of orange-nassau is the orange pennant above the red-white-blue
it's said that the dutch tricolor has inspired many flags but most notably those of russia new york city and south africa (the 192894 flag as well the current flag) as the probable inspiration for the russian flag it is the source too for the pan-slavic colors red white and blue adopted by many slavic states and peoples as their symbols examples slovakia serbia and slovenia
the national flag of france was designed in 1794 as a forerunner of revolution france's tri-colour flag style has been adopted by other nations examples italy costa rica dominican republic ireland haiti romania mexico etc
the union flag (union jack) of the united kingdom is the most commonly used british colonies typically flew a flag based on one of the ensigns based on this flag and many former colonies have retained the design to acknowledge their cultural history examples australia fiji new zealand tuvalu and also the canadian provinces of manitoba ontario and british columbia and the american state of hawaii see commons:flags based on british ensigns
the flag of the united states is nicknamed the stars and stripes or old glory some nations imitated this flag so as to symbolize their similarity to the united states and/or the american revolution examples liberia chile uruguay taiwan (roc) malaysia and the french region of brittany
the original tricolor flag of iran the source for the pan-iranian colors green white and red adopted by many indo-iranian or aryan states and peoples as their symbols examples tajikistan kurdistan republic of ararat talysh-mughan
ethiopia was seen as a model by emerging african states of the 1950s and 1960s as it was one of the oldest independent states in africa accordingly its flag became the source of the pan-african colors or rasta colors examples benin togo senegal ghana mali guinea
the flag of turkey which is very similar to last flag of the old ottoman empire has been an inspiration for the flag designs of many other muslim nations during the time of the ottomans the crescent began to be associated with islam and this is reflected on the flags of algeria azerbaijan comoros libya mauritania pakistan and tunisia
the pan-arab colors green white red and black are derived from the flag of the great arab revolt as seen on the flags of jordan libya kuwait sudan syria the united arab emirates western sahara egypt iraq yemen and palestine
the soviet flag with its golden symbols of the hammer and sickle on a red field was an inspiration to flags of other communist states such as east germany people's republic of china vietnam angola afghanistan (19781980) and mozambique
the flag of venezuela created by francisco de miranda to represent the independence movement in venezuela that later gave birth to the gran colombia inspired the flags of colombia and ecuador both sharing three bands of yellow blue and red with the flag of venezuela
the flag of argentina created by manuel belgrano during the war of independence was the inspiration for the united provinces of central america's flag which in turn was the origin for the flags of guatemala honduras el salvador and nicaragua
flags of native american nations in the united states are common and many tribes have chosen a flag as their symbol of choice
national flag designs are often used to signify nationality in other forms such as flag patches
=== civil flags ===
a civil flag is a version of the national flag that is flown by civilians on non-government installations or craft the use of civil flags was more common in the past in order to denote buildings or ships that were not manned by the military in some countries the civil flag is the same as the war flag or state flag but without the coat of arms such as in the case of spain and in others it's an alteration of the war flag
=== war flags ===
several countries (including the united kingdom and the soviet union) have had unique flags flown by their armed forces rather than the national flag
other countries armed forces (such as those of the united states or switzerland) use their standard national flag the philippines armed forces may use their standard national flag but during times of war the flag is turned upside down bulgaria's flag is also turned upside down during times of war these are also considered war flags though the terminology only applies to the flag's military usage
large versions of the war flag flown on the warships of countries navies are known as battle ensigns in war waving a white flag is a banner of truce or surrender
four distinctive african flags currently in the collection of the national maritime museum in britain were flown in action by itsekiri ships under the control of nana olomu during conflict in the late 19th century one is the flag generally known as the benin flag and one is referred to as nana olomu's flag
=== international flags ===
among international flags are the flag of the united nations the olympic flag and the paralympic flag
== at sea ==
flags are particularly important at sea where they can mean the difference between life and death and consequently where the rules and regulations for the flying of flags are strictly enforced a national flag flown at sea is known as an ensign a courteous peaceable merchant ship or yacht customarily flies its ensign (in the usual ensign position) together with the flag of whatever nation it is currently visiting at the mast (known as a courtesy flag) to fly one's ensign alone in foreign waters a foreign port or in the face of a foreign warship traditionally indicates a willingness to fight with cannon for the right to do so as of 2009 this custom is still taken seriously by many naval and port authorities and is readily enforced in many parts of the world by boarding confiscation and other civil penalties
in some countries yacht ensigns are different from merchant ensigns in order to signal that the yacht is not carrying cargo that requires a customs declaration carrying commercial cargo on a boat with a yacht ensign is deemed to be smuggling in many jurisdictions there is a system of international maritime signal flags for numerals and letters of the alphabet each flag or pennant has a specific meaning when flown individually as well semaphore flags can be used to communicate on an ad hoc basis from ship to ship over short distances traditionally a vessel flying under the courtesy flag of a specific nation regardless of the vessel's country of registry is considered to be operating under the law of her host nation
another category of maritime flag flown by some united states government ships is the distinguishing mark although the united states coast guard has its own service ensign all other u.s government ships fly the national ensign their service ensign following united states navy practice to distinguish themselves from ships of the navy such ships historically have flown their parent organization's flag from a forward mast as a distinguishing mark today for example commissioned ships of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) fly the noaa flag as a distinguishing mark
== shapes and designs ==
flags are usually rectangular in shape (often in the ratio 2:3 1:2 or 3:5) but may be of any shape or size that is practical for flying including square triangular or swallow tailed a more unusual flag shape is that of the flag of nepal which is in the shape of two stacked triangles other unusual flag shapes include the flag of ohio and the flag of tampa
many flags are dyed through and through to be inexpensive to manufacture such that the reverse side is the mirror image of the obverse (front) side generally the side displayed when the flag is flying from the observer's point of view from left the side of the pole to right this presents two possibilities
if the design is symmetrical in an axis parallel to the flag pole obverse and reverse will be identical despite the mirror-reversal such as the indian flag or canadian flag
if not the obverse and reverse will present two variants of the same design one with the hoist on the left (usually considered the obverse side see flag illustrations) the other with the hoist on the right (usually considered the reverse side of the flag) this is very common and usually not disturbing if there is no text in the design see also us reverse side flag
some complex flag designs are not intended for through and through implementation requiring separate obverse and reverse sides if made correctly in these cases there is a design element (usually text) which is not symmetric and should be read in the same direction regardless of whether the hoist is to the viewer's left or right these cases can be divided into two types
the same (asymmetric) design may be duplicated on both sides such flags can be manufactured by creating two identical through and through flags and then sewing them back to back though this can affect the resulting combination's responsiveness to the wind depictions of such flags may be marked with the symbol  indicating the reverse is congruent to (rather than a mirror image of) the obverse
rarely the reverse design may differ in whole or in part from that of the obverse examples of flags whose reverse differs from the obverse include the flag of paraguay the flag of oregon and the historical flag of the soviet union depictions of such flags may be marked with the symbol 
common designs on flags include crosses stripes and divisions of the surface or field into bands or quarterspatterns and principles mainly derived from heraldry a heraldic coat of arms may also be flown as a banner of arms as is done on both the state flag of maryland and the flag of kiribati
the de jure flag of libya under muammar gaddafi which consisted of a rectangular field of green was for a long period the only national flag using a single color and no design or insignia however other historical states have also used flags without designs or insignia such as the soviet republic of hungary whose flag was a plain field of red
colors are normally described with common names such as red but may be further specified using colorimetry
the largest flag flown from a flagpole worldwide according to guinness world records is the flag of mexico flown in piedras negras mexico this flag was about 2,058 m2 (22,150 sq ft) the largest flag ever made was the flag of qatar the flag which measures at 101,978 m2 (1,097,680 sq ft) was completed in december 2013 in doha
=== vertical flags ===
vertical flags are sometimes used in lieu of the standard horizontal flag in central and eastern europe particularly in the german-speaking countries this practice came about because the relatively brisk wind needed to display horizontal flags is not common in these countries
the standard horizontal flag (no 1 in the preceding illustration) is nonetheless the form most often used even in these countries
the vertical flag (german hochformatflagge or knatterflagge no 2) is a vertical form of the standard flag the flag's design may remain unchanged (no 2a) or it may change e.g by changing horizontal stripes to vertical ones (no 2b) if the flag carries an emblem it may remain centered or may be shifted slightly upwards
the vertical flag for hoisting from a beam (german auslegerflagge or galgenflagge no 3) is additionally attached to a horizontal beam ensuring that it is fully displayed even if there is no wind
the vertical flag for hoisting from a horizontal pole (german hngeflagge no 4) is hoisted from a horizontal pole normally attached to a building the topmost stripe on the horizontal version of the flag faces away from the building
the vertical flag for hoisting from a crossbar or banner (german bannerflagge no 5) is firmly attached to a horizontal crossbar from which it is hoisted either by a vertical pole (no 5a) or a horizontal one (no 5b) the topmost stripe on the horizontal version of the flag normally faces to the left
== religious flags ==
flags can play many different roles in religion in buddhism prayer flags are used usually in sets of five differently colored flags many national flags and other flags include religious symbols such as the cross the crescent or a reference to a patron saint flags are also adopted by religious groups and flags such as the jain flag and the christian flag are used to represent a whole religion
== linguistic flags ==
as languages rarely have a flag designed to represent them it is a common but unofficial practice to use national flags to identify them the practice is deprecated because it is often considered insulting and because flags tend to evoke feelings other than the intended meaning examples of such use include
representing language skills of an individual like a staff member of a company
displaying available languages on a multilingual website or software
though this can be done in an uncontroversial manner in some cases this can easily lead to some problems for certain languages
languages generating language dispute such as romanian and moldavian which some consider two different languages and
languages spoken in more than one country such as english or arabic
in this second case common solutions include symbolising these languages by
the flag of the country where the language originated
the flag of the country having the largest number of native speakers
a mixed flag of the both (when this is not the same)
the flag of the country most identified with that language in a specific region (e.g portuguese language flag of portugal in europe and flag of brazil in south america) a portugal-brazil mixed flag usually divided diagonally is also a possibility
thus on the internet it is common to see the english language associated with the flag of the united kingdom or sometimes the flag of england the flag of the united states or a u.s.-uk mixed flag usually divided diagonally
== in sports ==
because of their ease of signalling and identification flags are often used in sports

in water sports such as wakeboarding and water-skiing an orange flag is held in between runs to indicate someone is in the water
in golf the hole is marked with a flag the flagpole is designed to fit centered within the base of the hole and is removable many courses will use color-coded flags to determine a hole location at the front middle or rear of the green however color-coded flags are not used in the professional tours
flag poles with flags of all shapes and sizes are used by marching bands drum corps and winter guard teams use flags as a method of visual enhancement in performances
== diplomatic flags ==

some of these political flags have become national flags such as the red flag of the soviet union and national socialist banners for nazi germany the present flag of portugal is based on what had been the political flag of the portuguese republican party previous to the 5 october 1910 revolution which brought this party to power

the current tallest flagpole in the united states (and the tallest containing an american flag) is a 400 ft (120 m) pole completed near memorial day 2014 and custom-made with a large 11 feet (3.4 m) base in concrete by wind turbine manufacturer broadwind energy which is situated on the north side of the acuity insurance headquarters campus along interstate 43 in sheboygan wisconsin and is visible from cedar grove the pole will hold a 220-pound flag for pleasant conditions and a thicker 350-pound flag for harsh weather acuity had made three separate attempts in the 2000s at the tallest flagpole which were all removed due to collapses or wind-swaying following the example of a nearby perkins location which had put up a flag visible on their property from the wi 28 exit
=== design ===
flagpoles can be designed in one piece with a taper (typically a steel taper or a greek entasis taper) or be made from multiple pieces to make them able to expand in the united states ansi/naamm guide specification fp-1001-97 covers the engineering design of metal flagpoles to ensure safety
