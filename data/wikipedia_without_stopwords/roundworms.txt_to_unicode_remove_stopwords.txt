nematode systematicsedit
due lack knowledge regarding many nematodes systematics contentious earliest influential classification proposed chitwood chitwoodlater revised chitwoodwho divided phylum twothe aphasmidia phasmidia later renamed adenophorea gland bearers secernentea secretors respectively secernentea share several characteristics including presence phasmids pair sensory organs located lateral posterior region used basis division scheme adhered many later classifications though adenophorea uniform group
initial dna sequence studies suggested existence five clades
dorylaimida
enoplia
spirurina
tylenchina
rhabditina

anatomyedit
nematodes slender worms typically approximately m thick least mm less mm long smallest nematodes microscopic freeliving species reach much cm parasitic species larger still reaching meter length body often ornamented ridges rings bristles distinctive structures
head nematode relatively distinct whereas rest body bilaterally symmetrical head radially symmetrical sensory bristles many cases solid headshields radiating outwards around mouth mouth either three six lips often bear series teeth inner edges adhesive caudal gland often found tip tail
epidermis either syncytium single layer cells covered thick collagenous cuticle cuticle often complex structure may two three distinct layers underneath epidermis lies layer longitudinal muscle cells relatively rigid cuticle works muscles create hydroskeleton nematodes lack circumferential muscles projections run inner surface muscle cells towards nerve cords unique arrangement animal kingdom nerve cells normally extend fibres muscles rather vice versa
digestive systemedit
oral cavity lined cuticle often strengthened ridges structures especially carnivorous species may bear number teeth mouth often includes sharp stylet animal thrust prey species stylet hollow used suck liquids plants animals
oral cavity opens muscular sucking pharynx also lined cuticle digestive glands found region gut producing enzymes start break food styletbearing species may even injected prey
stomach pharynx connecting directly muscleless intestine forms main length gut produces enzymes also absorbs nutrients single cell thick lining last portion intestine lined cuticle forming rectum expels waste anus front tip tail movement food digestive system result body movements worm intestine valves sphincters either end help control movement food body
excretory systemedit
nitrogenous waste excreted form ammonia body wall associated specific organs however structures excreting salt maintain osmoregulation typically complex
many marine nematodes one two unicellular renette glands excrete salt pore underside animal close pharynx nematodes specialised cells replaced organ consisting two parallel ducts connected single transverse duct transverse duct opens common canal runs excretory pore
nervous systemedit
four peripheral nerves run length body dorsal ventral lateral surfaces nerve lies within cord connective tissue lying beneath cuticle muscle cells ventral nerve largest double structure forward excretory pore dorsal nerve responsible motor control lateral nerves sensory ventral combines functions
nervous system also place nematode body contains cilia nonmotile sensory function
anterior end animal nerves branch dense circular nerve ring surrounding pharynx serving brain smaller nerves run forward ring supply sensory organs head
bodies nematodes covered numerous sensory bristles papillae together provide sense touch behind sensory bristles head lie two small pits amphids well supplied nerve cells probably chemoreception organs aquatic nematodes possess appear pigmented eyespots unclear whether actually sensory nature
reproductionedit
nematode species dioecious separate male female individuals sexes possess one two tubular gonads males sperm produced end gonad migrate along length mature testes open relatively wide sperm duct glandular muscular ejaculatory duct associated cloaca females ovaries open oviduct glandular uterus uteri open common vagina usually located middle ventral surface
reproduction usually sexual males usually smaller females often much smaller often characteristically bent tail holding female copulation one chitinized spicules move cloaca inserted genital pore female amoeboid sperm crawl along spicule female worm nematode sperm thought eukaryotic cell without globular protein gactin
eggs may embryonated unembryonated passed female meaning fertilized eggs may yet developed species known ovoviviparous eggs protected outer shell secreted uterus freeliving roundworms eggs hatch larvae appear essentially identical adults except underdeveloped reproductive system parasitic roundworms life cycle often much complicated
nematodes whole possess wide range modes reproduction nematodes heterorhabditis spp undergo process called endotokia matricida intrauterine birth causing maternal death nematodes hermaphroditic keep selffertilized eggs inside uterus hatch juvenile nematodes ingest parent nematode process significantly promoted environments low food supply
nematode model species caenorhabditis elegans c briggsae exhibit androdioecy rare among animals single genus meloidogyne rootknot nematodes exhibit range reproductive modes including sexual reproduction facultative sexuality generations reproduce asexually meiotic mitotic parthenogenesis
genus mesorhabditis exhibits unusual form parthenogenesis spermproducing males copulate females sperm fuse ovum contact sperm essential ovum begin dividing fusion cells male contributes genetic material offspring essentially clones female
freeliving speciesedit
freeliving species development usually consists four molts cuticle growth different species feed materials varied algae fungi small animals fecal matter dead organisms living tissues freeliving marine nematodes important abundant members meiobenthos play important role decomposition process aid recycling nutrients marine environments sensitive changes environment caused pollution one roundworm note caenorhabditis elegans lives soil found much use model organism c elegans entire genome sequenced well developmental fate every cell determined every neuron mapped
parasitic speciesedit
nematodes commonly parasitic humans include ascarids ascaris filarias hookworms pinworms enterobius whipworms trichuris trichiura species trichinella spiralis commonly known trichina worm occurs rats pigs humans responsible disease trichinosis baylisascaris usually infests wild animals deadly humans well dirofilaria immitis known causing heartworm disease inhabiting hearts arteries lungs dogs cats haemonchus contortus one abundant infectious agents sheep around world causing great economic damage sheep contrast entomopathogenic nematodes parasitize insects mostly considered beneficial humans attack beneficial insects
