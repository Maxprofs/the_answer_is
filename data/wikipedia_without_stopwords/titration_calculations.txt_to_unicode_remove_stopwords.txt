procedure
typical titration begins beaker erlenmeyer flask containing precise volume analyte small amount indicator phenolphthalein placed underneath calibrated burette chemistry pipetting syringe containing titrant small volumes titrant added analyte indicator indicator changes color reaction titrant saturation threshold reflecting arrival endpoint titration depending endpoint desired single drops less single drop titrant make difference permanent temporary change indicator endpoint reaction reached volume reactant consumed measured used calculate concentration analyte
ca concentration analyte typically molarity ct concentration titrant typically molarity vt volume titrant used typically liters m mole ratio analyte reactant balanced chemical equation va volume analyte used typically liters
preparation techniques
typical titrations require titrant analyte liquid solution form though solids usually dissolved aqueous solution solvents glacial acetic acid ethanol used special purposes petrochemistry concentrated analytes often diluted improve accuracy
many nonacidbase titrations require constant ph throughout reaction therefore buffer solution may added titration chamber maintain ph
instances two reactants sample may react titrant one desired analyte separate masking solution may added reaction chamber masks unwanted ion
redox reactions may require heating sample solution titrating solution still hot increase reaction rate instance oxidation oxalate solutions requires heating c f maintain reasonable rate reaction
titration curves
titration curve curve plane whose xcoordinate volume titrant added since beginning titration whose ycoordinate concentration analyte corresponding stage titration acidbase titration ycoordinate usually ph solution
