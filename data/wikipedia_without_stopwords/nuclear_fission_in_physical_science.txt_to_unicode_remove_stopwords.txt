musical instrument instrument created adapted make musical sounds principle object produces sound musical instrumentit purpose object becomes musical instrument history musical instruments dates beginnings human culture early musical instruments may used ritual trumpet signal success hunt drum religious ceremony cultures eventually developed composition performance melodies entertainment musical instruments evolved step changing applications
date origin first device considered musical instrument disputed oldest object scholars refer musical instrument simple flute dates back far years consensus dates early flutes years ago however historians believe determining specific time musical instrument invention impossible due subjectivity definition relative instability materials used make many early musical instruments made animal skins bone wood nondurable materials
musical instruments developed independently many populated regions world however contact among civilizations caused rapid spread adaptation instruments places far origin middle ages instruments mesopotamia maritime southeast asia europeans played instruments north africa development americas occurred slower pace cultures north central south america shared musical instruments musical instrument development slowed many areas dominated occident
musical instrument classification discipline right many systems classification used years instruments classified effective range material composition size etc however common academic method hornbostelsachs uses means produce sound academic study musical instruments called organology
definition basic operation
musical instrument makes sounds humans moved making sounds bodiesfor example clappingto using objects create music sounds musical instruments born primitive instruments probably designed emulate natural sounds purpose ritual rather entertainment concept melody artistic pursuit musical composition unknown early players musical instruments player sounding flute signal start hunt without thought modern notion making music
musical instruments constructed broad array styles shapes using many different materials early musical instruments made found objects shells plant parts instruments evolved selection quality materials virtually every material nature used least one culture make musical instruments one plays musical instrument interacting wayfor example plucking strings string instrument
archaeology

history
scholars agree completely reliable methods determining exact chronology musical instruments across cultures comparing organizing instruments based complexity misleading since advancements musical instruments sometimes reduced complexity example construction early slit drums involved felling hollowing large trees later slit drums made opening bamboo stalks much simpler task
german musicologist curt sachs one prominent musicologists musical ethnologists modern times argues misleading arrange development musical instruments workmanship since cultures advance different rates access different raw materials maintains example contemporary anthropologists comparing musical instruments two cultures existed time differed organization culture handicraft cannot determine instruments primitive ordering instruments geography also totally reliable cannot always determined cultures contacted one another shared knowledge
sachs proposed geographical chronology approximately preferable however due limited subjectivity beyond one follow overall development musical instruments time period
science marking order musical instrument development relies archaeological artifacts artistic depictions literary references since data one research path inconclusive three paths provide better historical picture

modern
renaissance
musical instrument development dominated occident indeed profound changes occurred renaissance period instruments took purposes accompanying singing dance performers used solo instruments keyboards lutes developed polyphonic instruments composers arranged increasingly complex pieces using advanced tablature composers also began designing pieces music specific instruments latter half sixteenth century orchestration came common practice method writing music variety instruments composers specified orchestration individual performers applied discretion polyphonic style dominated popular music instrument makers responded accordingly
beginning rate development musical instruments increased earnest compositions demanded dynamic sounds people also began writing books creating playing cataloging musical instruments first book sebastian virdungs treatise musica getuscht und ausgezogen english music germanized abstracted virdungs work noted particularly thorough including descriptions irregular instruments hunters horns cow bells though virdung critical books followed including arnolt schlicks spiegel der orgelmacher und organisten english mirror organ makers organ players following year treatise organ building organ playing instructional books references published renaissance era one noted detailed description depiction wind stringed instruments including relative sizes book syntagma musicum michael praetorius considered authoritative reference sixteenth century musical instruments
sixteenth century musical instrument builders gave instruments violin classical shapes retain today emphasis aesthetic beauty also developedlisteners pleased physical appearance instrument sound therefore builders paid special attention materials workmanship instruments became collectibles homes museums period makers began constructing instruments type various sizes meet demand consorts ensembles playing works written groups instruments
instrument builders developed features endure today example organs multiple keyboards pedals already existed first organs solo stops emerged early fifteenth century stops meant produce mixture timbres development needed complexity music time trumpets evolved modern form improve portability players used mutes properly blend chamber music
baroque
beginning seventeenth century composers began creating works emotional style felt monophonic style better suited emotional music wrote musical parts instruments would complement singing human voice result many instruments incapable larger ranges dynamics therefore seen unemotional fell favor one instrument shawm bowed instruments violin viola baryton various lutes dominated popular music beginning around however lute disappeared musical compositions favor rising popularity guitar prevalence string orchestras rose wind instruments flute oboe bassoon readmitted counteract monotony hearing strings
midseventeenth century known hunters horn underwent transformation art instrument consisting lengthened tube narrower bore wider bell much wider range details transformation unclear modern horn colloquially french horn emerged slide trumpet appeared variation includes longthroated mouthpiece slid allowing player infinite adjustments pitch variation trumpet unpopular due difficulty involved playing organs underwent tonal changes baroque period manufacturers abraham jordan london made stops expressive added devices expressive pedals sachs viewed trend degeneration general organ sound
classical romantic
classical romantic periods music lasting roughly great deal musical instruments capable producing new timbres higher volume developed introduced popular music design changes broadened quality timbres allowed instruments produce wider variety expression large orchestras rose popularity parallel composers determined produce entire orchestral scores made use expressive abilities modern instruments since instruments involved collaborations much larger scale designs evolve accommodate demands orchestra
instruments also become louder fill larger halls heard sizable orchestras flutes bowed instruments underwent many modifications design changesmost unsuccessfulin efforts increase volume instruments changed could play parts scores trumpets traditionally defective rangethey incapable producing certain notes precision new instruments clarinet saxophone tuba became fixtures orchestras instruments clarinet also grew entire families instruments capable different ranges small clarinets normal clarinets bass clarinets
accompanying changes timbre volume shift typical pitch used tune instruments instruments meant play together orchestra must tuned standard lest produce audibly different sounds playing notes beginning average concert pitch began rising low vibrations high vienna different regions countries even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards making orchestral collaboration challenge despite even efforts two organized international summits attended noted composers like hector berlioz standard could agreed upon
twentieth century present
evolution traditional musical instruments slowed beginning twentieth century instruments like violin flute french horn harp largely manufactured throughout eighteenth nineteenth centuries gradual iterations emerge example new violin family began provide differently sized violins expand range available sounds slowdown development practical response concurrent slowdown orchestra venue size despite trend traditional instruments development new musical instruments exploded twentieth century sheer variety instruments developed overshadows prior period
proliferation electricity twentieth century lead creation entirely new category musical instruments electronic instruments electrophones vast majority electrophones produced first half twentieth century sachs called electromechanical instruments words mechanical parts produce sound vibrations vibrations picked amplified electrical components examples electromechanical instruments include hammond organs electric guitars sachs also defined subcategory radioelectric instruments theremin produces music players hand movements around two antennas
latter half twentieth century saw gradual evolution synthesizersinstruments artificially produce sound using analog digital circuits microchips late bob moog inventors began era development commercial synthesizers one first instruments moog synthesizer modern proliferation computers microchips spawned entire industry around electronic musical instruments
classification
many different methods classifying musical instruments various methods examine aspects physical properties instrument material color shape etc use instrument means music produced instrument range instrument instruments place orchestra ensemble methods specific geographic area cultural group developed serve unique classification requirements group problem specialized classification schemes tend break applied outside original area example system based instrument use would fail culture invented new use instrument scholars recognize hornbostelsachs system applies culture important provides possible classification instrument
ancient systems
ancient system named natya shastra written sage bharata muni dating bc ad divides instruments four main classification groups instruments sound produced vibrating strings percussion instruments skin heads instruments sound produced vibrating columns air solid nonskin percussion instruments system adapted degree thcentury europe johannes de muris used terms tensibilia stringed instruments inflatibilia wind instruments percussibilia percussion instruments victorcharles mahillon adapted natya shastra assigned greek labels four classifications chordophones stringed instruments membranophones skinhead percussion instruments aerophones wind instruments autophones nonskin percussion instruments
hornbostelsachs
erich von hornbostel curt sachs adopted mahillons scheme published extensive new scheme classification zeitschrift fr ethnologie hornbostel sachs used mahillons system replaced term autophone idiophone
original hornbostelsachs system classified instruments four main groups
idiophones produce sound vibrating primary body instrument sorted concussion percussion shaken scraped split plucked idiophones claves xylophone guiro slit drum mbira rattle
membranophones produce sound vibrating stretched membrane may drums sorted shape shell struck hand stick rubbed kazoos instruments use stretched membrane primary sound simply modify sound produced another way also considered membranophones
chordophones produce sound vibrating one strings sorted according relationship strings sounding board chamber example strings laid parallel sounding board neck instrument zither whether plucked like autoharp struck hammers like piano instrument strings parallel sounding board chamber strings extend past board neck instrument lute whether sound chamber constructed wood like guitar uses membrane like banjo
aerophones produce sound vibrating column air sorted free aerophones bullroarer whip move freely air flutes cause air pass sharp edge reed instruments use vibrating reed lipvibrated aerophones trumpets lips function vibrating reeds
sachs later added fifth category electrophones theremins produce sound electronic means within category many subgroups system criticised revised years remains widely used ethnomusicologists organologists
schaeffner
andre schaeffner curator muse de lhomme disagreed hornbostelsachs system developed system schaeffner believed pure physics musical instrument rather specific construction playing method always determine classification hornbostelsachs example divide aerophones basis sound production membranophones basis shape instrument system divided instruments two categories instruments solid vibrating bodies instruments containing vibrating air
range
musical instruments also often classified musical range comparison instruments family exercise useful placing instruments context orchestra ensemble
terms named singing voice classifications
soprano instruments flute violin soprano saxophone trumpet clarinet oboe piccolo
alto instruments alto saxophone french horn english horn viola alto horn
tenor instruments trombone tenor saxophone guitar tenor drum
baritone instruments bassoon baritone saxophone bass clarinet cello baritone horn euphonium
bass instruments double bass bass guitar bass saxophone tuba bass drum
instruments fall one category example cello may considered tenor baritone bass depending music fits ensemble trombone may alto tenor baritone bass french horn bass baritone tenor alto depending range played many instruments range part name soprano saxophone tenor saxophone baritone horn alto flute bass guitar etc additional adjectives describe instruments soprano range bass example sopranino saxophone contrabass clarinet used name instrument terms relative describing instruments range comparison instruments family comparison human voice range instruments families example bass flutes range c f bass clarinet plays one octave lower
construction
materials used making musical instruments vary greatly culture application many materials special significance owing source rarity cultures worked substances human body instruments ancient mexico example material drums made might contain actual human body parts obtained sacrificial offerings new guinea drum makers would mix human blood adhesive used attach membrane mulberry trees held high regard china owing mythological significanceinstrument makers would hence use make zithers yakuts believe making drums trees struck lightning gives special connection nature
musical instrument construction specialized trade requires years training practice sometimes apprenticeship makers musical instruments specialize one genre instruments example luthier makes stringed instruments make one type instrument piano whatever instrument constructed instrument maker must consider materials construction technique decoration creating balanced instrument functional aesthetically pleasing builders focused artistic approach develop experimental musical instruments often meant individual playing styles developed builder
user interfaces
regardless sound instrument produced many musical instruments keyboard userinterface keyboard instruments instruments played musical keyboard every key generates one sounds keyboard instruments extra means pedals piano stops pedal keyboard organ manipulate sounds may produce sound wind fanned organ pumped accordion vibrating strings either hammered piano plucked harpsichord electronic means synthesizer way sometimes instruments usually keyboard glockenspiel fitted one though moving parts struck mallets held players hands physical arrangement keys produce soundwaves similar manner
