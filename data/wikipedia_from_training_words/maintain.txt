maintenance repair and operations (mro) or maintenance repair and overhaul involves fixing any sort of mechanical plumbing or electrical device should it become out of order or broken (known as repair unscheduled or casualty maintenance) it also includes performing routine actions which keep the device in working order (known as scheduled maintenance) or prevent trouble from arising (preventive maintenance) mro may be defined as all actions which have the objective of retaining or restoring an item in or to a state in which it can perform its required function the actions include the combination of all technical and corresponding administrative managerial and supervision actions.
mro operations can be categorised by whether the product remains the property of the customer i.e a service is being offered or whether the product is bought by the reprocessing organisation and sold to any customer wishing to make the purchase (guadette 2002) in the former case it may be a backshop operation within a larger organization or smaller operation
the former of these represents a closed loop supply chain and usually has the scope of maintenance repair or overhaul of the product the latter of the categorisations is an open loop supply chain and is typified by refurbishment and remanufacture the main characteristic of the closed loop system is that the demand for a product is matched with the supply of a used product neglecting asset write-offs and exceptional activities the total population of the product between the customer and the service provider remains constant
== engineering ==
in telecommunication commercial real estate and engineering in general the term maintenance has the following meanings
any activity such as tests measurements replacements adjustments and repairs intended to retain or restore a functional unit in or to a specified state in which the unit can perform its required functions
for material all action taken to retain material in a serviceable condition or to restore it to serviceability it includes inspection testing servicing classification as to serviceability repair rebuilding and reclamation
for material all supply and repair action taken to keep a force in condition to carry out its mission
for material the routine recurring work required to keep a facility (plant building structure ground facility utility system or other real property) in such condition that it may be continuously used at its original or designed capacity and efficiency for its intended purpose
manufacturers and industrial supply companies often refer to mro as opposed to original equipment manufacturer (oem) oem includes any activity related to the direct manufacture of goods where mro refers to any maintenance and repair activity to keep a manufacturing plant running
== maintenance types ==
generally speaking there are four types of maintenance in use
preventive maintenance where equipment is maintained before break down occurs
operational maintenance where equipment is maintained in using
corrective maintenance where equipment is maintained after break down this maintenance is often most expensive because worn equipment can damage other parts and cause multiple damages
adaptive maintenance where equipment is maintained by letting it adapt to new environment
=== preventive maintenance ===
preventive maintenance is maintenance performed in an attempt to avoid failures unnecessary production loss and safety violations
the effectiveness of a preventive maintenance schedule depends on the rcm analysis which it was based on and the ground rules used for cost-effectivity
