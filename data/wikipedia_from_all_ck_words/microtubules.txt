microtubules (micro- + tube + -ule) are a component of the cytoskeleton found throughout the cytoplasm these tubular polymers of tubulin can grow as long as 50 micrometres and are highly dynamic the outer diameter of a microtubule is about 24 nm while the inner diameter is about 12 nm they are found in eukaryotic cells as well as some bacteria and are formed by the polymerization of a dimer of two globular proteins alpha and beta tubulin
microtubules are very important in a number of cellular processes they are involved in maintaining the structure of the cell and together with microfilaments and intermediate filaments they form the cytoskeleton they also make up the internal structure of cilia and flagella.they provide platforms for intracellular transport and are involved in a variety of cellular processes including the movement of secretory vesicles organelles and intracellular macromolecular assemblies (see entries for dynein and kinesin) they are also involved in chromosome separation (mitosis and meiosis) and are the major constituents of mitotic spindles which are used to pull apart eukaryotic chromosomes
microtubules are nucleated and organized by microtubule organizing centers (mtocs) such as the centrosome found in the center of many animal cells or the basal bodies found in cilia and flagella or the spindle pole bodies found in fungi
there are many proteins that bind to microtubules including the motor proteins kinesin and dynein severing proteins like katanin and other proteins important for regulating microtubule dynamics
== structureedit ==
in eukaryotes microtubules are long hollow cylinders made up of polymerised - and -tubulin dimers the and -tubulin subunits are approximately 50% identical at the amino acid level and each have a molecular weight of approximately 50 kda
these /-tubulin dimers polymerize end-to-end into linear protofilaments that associate laterally to form a single microtubule which can then be extended by the addition of more /-tubulin dimers typically microtubules are formed by the parallel association of thirteen protofilaments although microtubules composed of fewer or more protofilaments have been observed in vitro
microtubules have a distinct polarity that is critical for their biological function tubulin polymerizes end to end with the -subunits of one tubulin dimer contacting the -subunits of the next dimer therefore in a protofilament one end will have the -subunits exposed while the other end will have the -subunits exposed these ends are designated the () and (+) ends respectively the protofilaments bundle parallel to one another with the same polarity so in a microtubule there is one end the (+) end with only -subunits exposed while the other end the () end has only -subunits exposed while microtubule elongation can occur at both the (+) and (-) ends it is significantly more rapid at the (+) end
the lateral association of the protofilaments generates a pseudo-helical structure with one turn of the helix containing 13 tubulin dimers each from a different protofilament there are two distinct types of interactions that can occur between the subunits of lateral protofilaments within the microtubule called the a-type and b-type lattices in the a-type lattice the lateral associations of protofilaments occur between adjacent and -tubulin subunits (i.e an -tubulin subunit from one protofilament interacts with a -tubulin subunit from an adjacent protofilament) in the b-type lattice the and -tubulin subunits from one protofilament interact with the and -tubulin subunits from an adjacent protofilament respectively experimental studies have shown that the b-type lattice is the primary arrangement within microtubules however in most microtubules there is a seam in which tubulin subunits interact -
some species of prosthecobacter also contain microtubules the structure of these bacterial microtubules is similar to that of eukaryotic microtubules consisting of a hollow tube of protofilaments assembled from heterodimers of bacterial tubulin a (btuba) and bacterial tubulin b (btubb) both btuba and btubb share features of both - and -tubulin unlike eukaryotic microtubules bacterial microtubules do not require chaperones to fold in contrast to the 13 protofilaments of eukaryotic microtubules bacterial microtubules comprise only five
== intracellular organizationedit ==
microtubules are part of a structural network (the cytoskeleton) within the cell's cytoplasm roles of the microtubule cytoskeleton include mechanical support organization of the cytoplasm transport motility and chromosome segregation a microtubule is capable of growing and shrinking in order to generate force and there are motor proteins that allow organelles and other cellular components to be carried along a microtubule this combination of roles makes microtubules important for organizing and moving intracellular constituents
the organization of microtubules in the cell is cell-type specific in epithelia the minus-ends of the microtubule polymer are anchored near the site of cell-cell contact and organized along the apical-basal axis after nucleation the minus-ends are released and then re-anchored in the periphery by factors such as ninein and nezha/plekha7 in this manner they can facilitate the transport of proteins vesicles and organelles along the apical-basal axis of the cell in fibroblasts and other mesenchymal cell-types microtubules are anchored at the centrosome and radiate with their plus-ends outwards towards the cell periphery (as shown in the first figure) in these cells the microtubules play important roles in cell migration moreover the polarity of microtubules is acted upon by motor proteins which organize many components of the cell including the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus
== microtubule polymerizationedit ==
=== nucleationedit ===
microtubules are typically nucleated and organized by dedicated organelles called microtubule-organizing centres (mtocs) contained within the mtoc is another type of tubulin -tubulin which is distinct from the - and -subunits of the microtubules themselves the -tubulin combines with several other associated proteins to form a lock washer-like structure known as the -tubulin ring complex (-turc) this complex acts as a template for /-tubulin dimers to begin polymerization it acts as a cap of the () end while microtubule growth continues away from the mtoc in the (+) direction
the centrosome is the primary mtoc of most cell types however microtubules can be nucleated from other sites as well for example cilia and flagella have mtocs at their base termed basal bodies in addition work from the kaverina group at vanderbilt as well as others suggests that the golgi apparatus can serve as an important platform for the nucleation of microtubules because nucleation from the centrosome is inherently symmetrical golgi-associated microtubule nucleation may allow the cell to establish asymmetry in the microtubule network in recent studies the vale group at ucsf identified the protein complex augmin as a critical factor for centrosome-dependent spindle-based microtubule generation it that has been shown to interact with -turc and increase microtubule density around the mitotic spindle origin
some cell types such as plant cells do not contain well defined mtocs in these cells microtubules are nucleated from discrete sites in the cytoplasm other cell types such as trypanosomatid parasites have a mtoc but it is permanently found at the base of a flagellum here nucleation of microtubules for structural roles and for generation of the mitotic spindle is not from a canonical centriole-like mtoc
=== polymerizationedit ===
following the initial nucleation event tubulin monomers must be added to the growing polymer the process of adding or removing monomers depends on the concentration of -tubulin dimers in solution in relation to the critical concentration which is the steady state concentration of dimers at which there is no longer any net assembly or disassembly at the end of the microtubule if the dimer concentration is greater than the critical concentration the microtubule will polymerize and grow if the concentration is less than the critical concentration the length of the microtubule will decrease
== microtubule dynamicsedit ==
=== dynamic instabilityedit ===
dynamic instability refers to the coexistence of assembly and disassembly at the ends of a microtubule the microtubule can dynamically switch between growing and shrinking phases in this region tubulin dimers can bind two molecules of gtp one of which can be hydrolyzed subsequent to assembly during polymerization the tubulin dimers are in the gtp-bound state the gtp bound to -tubulin is stable and it plays a structural function in this bound state however the gtp bound to -tubulin may be hydrolyzed to gdp shortly after assembly the assembly properties of gdp-tubulin are different from those of gtp-tubulin as gdp-tubulin is more prone to depolymerization a gdp-bound tubulin subunit at the tip of a microtubule will tend to fall off although a gdp-bound tubulin in the middle of a microtubule cannot spontaneously pop out of the polymer since tubulin adds onto the end of the microtubule in the gtp-bound state a cap of gtp-bound tubulin is proposed to exist at the tip of the microtubule protecting it from disassembly when hydrolysis catches up to the tip of the microtubule it begins a rapid depolymerization and shrinkage this switch from growth to shrinking is called a catastrophe gtp-bound tubulin can begin adding to the tip of the microtubule again providing a new cap and protecting the microtubule from shrinking this is referred to as rescue
=== search and capture modeledit ===
in 1986 marc kirschner and tim mitchison proposed that microtubules use their dynamic properties of growth and shrinkage at their plus ends to probe the three dimensional space of the cell plus ends that encounter kinetochores or sites of polarity become captured and no longer display growth or shrinkage in contrast to normal dynamic microtubules which have a half-life of 510 minutes the captured microtubules can last for hours this idea is commonly known as the search and capture model indeed work since then has largely validated this idea at the kinetochore a variety of complexes have been shown to capture microtubule (+)-ends moreover a (+)-end capping activity for interphase microtubules has also been described this later activity is mediated by formins the adenomatous polyposis coli protein and eb1 a protein that tracks along the growing plus ends of microtubules
== regulation of microtubule dynamicsedit ==
=== post-translational modificationsedit ===
although most microtubules have a half-life of 5-10 min certain microtubules can remain stable for hours these stabilized microtubules accumulate post-translational modifications on their tubulin subunits by the action of microtubule-bound enzymes however once the microtubule depolymerizes most of these modifications are rapidly reversed by soluble enzymes since most modification reactions are slow while their reverse reactions are rapid modified tubulin is only detected on long-lived stable microtubules most of these modifications occur on the c-terminal region of alpha-tubulin this region which is rich in negatively charged glutamate forms relativey unstructured tails that project out from the microtubule and form contacts with motors thus it is believed that tubulin modifications regulate the interaction of motors with the microtubule since these stable modified microtubules are typically oriented towards the site of cell polarity in interphase cells this subset of modified microtubules provide a specialized route that helps deliver vesicles to these polarized zones these modifications include
detyrosination the removal of the c-terminal tyrosine from alpha-tubulin this reaction exposes a glutamate at the new c-terminus as a result microtubules that accumulate this modification are often referred to as glu-microtubules although the tubulin carboxypeptidase has yet to be identified the tubulintyrosine ligase (ttl) is known
delta2 the removal of the last two residues from the c-terminus of alpha-tubulin unlike detyrosination this reaction is thought to be irreversible and has only been documented in neurons
acetylation the addition of an acetyl group to lysine 40 of alpha-tubulin this modification occurs on a lysine that is accessible only from the inside of the microtubule and it remains unclear how enzymes access the lysine residue the nature of the tubulin acetyltransferase remains controversial however the reverse reaction is known to be catalyzed by hdac6
polyglutamylation the addition of a glutamate polymer (typically 4-6 residues long) to the gamma-carboxyl group of any one of five glutamates found near the end of alpha-tubulin enzymes related to ttl add the initial branching glutamate (ttl4,5 and 7) while other enzymes that belong to the same family lengthen the polyglutamate chain (ttl6,11 and 13)
polyglycylation the addition of a glycine polymer (2-10 residues long) to the gamma-carboxyl group of any one of five glutamates found near the end of beta-tubulin ttl3 and 8 add the initial branching glycine while ttl10 lengthens the polyglycine chain
tubulin is also known to be phosphorylated ubiquitinated sumoylated and palmitoylated
=== tubulin-binding drugs and chemical effectsedit ===
a wide variety of drugs are able to bind to tubulin and modify its assembly properties these drugs can have an effect at intracellular concentrations much lower than that of tubulin this interference with microtubule dynamics can have the effect of stopping a cells cell cycle and can lead to programmed cell death or apoptosis however there are data to suggest that interference of microtubule dynamics is insufficient to block the cells undergoing mitosis these studies have demonstrated that suppression of dynamics occurs at concentrations lower than those needed to block mitosis suppression of microtubule dynamics by tubulin mutations or by drug treatment have been shown to inhibit cell migration both microtubule stabilizers and destabilizers can suppress microtubule dynamics
the drugs that can alter microtubule dynamics include
the cancer-fighting taxane class of drugs (paclitaxel (taxol) and docetaxel) block dynamic instability by stabilizing gdp-bound tubulin in the microtubule thus even when hydrolysis of gtp reaches the tip of the microtubule there is no depolymerization and the microtubule does not shrink back
the epothilones e.g ixabepilone work in a similar way to the taxanes
nocodazole vincristine and colchicine have the opposite effect blocking the polymerization of tubulin into microtubules
eribulin binds to the (+) growing end of the microtubules eribulin exerts its anticancer effects by triggering apoptosis of cancer cells following prolonged and irreversible mitotic blockade
expression of 3-tubulin has been reported to alter cellular responses to drug-induced suppression of microtubule dynamics in general the dynamics are normally suppressed by low subtoxic concentrations of microtubule drugs that also inhibit cell migration however incorporating 3-tubulin into microtubules increases the concentration of drug that is needed to suppress dynamics and inhibit cell migration thus tumors that express 3-tubulin are not only resistant to the cytotoxic effects of microtubule targeted drugs but also to their ability to suppress tumor metastasis moreover expression of 3-tubulin also counteracts the ability of these drugs to inhibit angiogenesis which is normally another important facet of their action
microtubule polymers are extremely sensitive to various environmental effects very low levels of free calcium can destabilize microtubules and this prevented early researchers from studying the polymer in vitro cold temperatures also cause rapid depolymerization of microtubules in contrast heavy water promotes microtubule polymer stability
== proteins that interact with microtubulesedit ==
=== microtubule-associated proteins (maps)edit ===
maps have been shown to play a crucial role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics in-vivo the rates of microtubule polymerization depolymerization and catastrophe vary depending on which microtubule-associated proteins (maps) are present the originally identified maps from brain tissue can be classified into two groups based on their molecular weight this first class comprises maps with a molecular weight below 55-62 kda and are called (tau) proteins in-vitro tau proteins have been shown to directly bind microtubules promote nucleation and prevent disassembly and to induce the formation of parallel arrays additionally tau proteins have also been shown to stabilize microtubules in axons and have been implicated in alzheimer's disease the second class is composed of maps with a molecular weight of 200-1000 kda of which there are four known types map-1 map-2 map-3 and map-4 map-1 proteins consists of a set of three different proteins a b and c the c protein plays an important role in the retrograde transport of vesicles and is also known as cytoplasmic dynein map-2 proteins are located in the dendrites and in the body of neurons where they bind with other cytoskeletal filaments the map-4 proteins are found in the majority of cells and stabilize microtubules in addition to maps that have a stabilizing effect on microtubule structure other maps can have a destabilizing effect either by cleaving or by inducing depolymerization of microtubules three proteins called katanin spastin and fidgetin have been observed to regulate the number and length of microtubules via their destabilizing activities
=== plus-end tracking proteins (+tips)edit ===
plus end tracking proteins are map proteins which bind to the tips of growing microtubules and play an important role in regulating microtubule dynamics for example +tips have been observed to participate in the interactions of microtubules with chromosomes during mitosis the first map to be identified as a +tip was clip170 (cytoplasmic linker protein) which has been shown to play a role in microtubule depolymerization rescue events additional examples of +tips include eb1 eb2 eb3 p150glued dynamitin lis1 clip115 clasp1 and clasp2
=== motor proteinsedit ===
microtubules can act as substrates for motor proteins that are involved in important cellular functions such as vesicle trafficking and cell division unlike other microtubule-associated proteins motor proteins utilize the energy from atp hydrolysis to generate mechanical work that moves the protein along the substrate the major motor proteins that interact with microtubules are kinesin which moves toward the (+) end of the microtubule and dynein which moves toward the () end
dynein is composed of two identical heavy chains which make up two large globular head domains and a variable number of intermediate and light chains dynein-mediated transport takes place from the (+) end towards the (-) end of the microtubule atp hydrolysis occurs in the globular head domains which share similarities with the aaa+ (atpase associated with various cellular activities) protein family atp hydolysis in these domains is coupled to movement along the microtubule via the microtubule-binding domains dynein transports vesicles and organelles throughout the cytoplasm in order to do this dynein molecules bind organelle membranes via a protein complex that contains a number of elements including dynactin
kinesin has a similar structure to dynein kinesin is involved in the transport of a variety of intracellular cargoes including vesicles organelles protein complexes and mrnas toward the microtubule (+) end the majority of the kinesins are involved in the transport of vesicles from a microtubules (-) end toward the (+) end that is toward the distal region of a cell or neural axon
some viruses (including retroviruses herpesviruses parvoviruses and adenoviruses) that require access to the nucleus to replicate their genomes attach to motor proteins
== functionsedit ==
=== cell migrationedit ===
microtubule plus ends are often localized to particular structures as mentioned previously they are found at kinetochores and used to pull chromosomes apart during mitosis in polarized interphase cells microtubules are disproportionately oriented from the mtoc toward the site of polarity such as the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts this configuration is thought to help deliver microtubule-bound vesicles from the golgi to the site of polarity in addition microtubules are thought to trigger focal adhesion disassembly which is necessary for migration
=== mitosisedit ===
a notable structure composed largely of microtubules is the mitotic spindle used by eukaryotic cells to segregate their chromosomes during cell division the mitotic spindle includes the spindle microtubules microtubule-associated proteins (maps) and the mtoc the microtubules originate in the mtoc and fan out into the cell each cell has two mtocs as shown in the diagram
the process of mitosis is facilitated by three main subgroups of microtubules known as astral polar and kinetochore microtubules an astral microtubule is a microtubule originating from the mtoc that does not connect to a chromosome astral microtubules instead interact with the cytoskeleton near the cell membrane and function in concert with specialized dynein motors dynein motors pull the mtoc toward the cell membrane thus assisting in correct positioning and orientation of the entire apparatus
kinetochore microtubules directly connect to the chromosomes at the kinetochores to clarify the terminology each chromosome has two chromatids and each chromatid has a kinetochore the two kinetochores associated with a region of the chromosome called the centromere the polar microtubules from one mtoc intertwine with the microtubules from the other mtoc motor proteins make them push against each other and assist in the separation of the chromosomes to the two daughter cells
cell division in a typical eukaryote finishes with the generation of a final cytoplasmic bridge between the two daughter cells termed the midbody this structure is built of microtubules that originally made up part of the mitotic spindle
=== cilia and flagellaedit ===
microtubules have a major structural role in eukaryotic cilia and flagella cilia and flagella always extend directly from a mtoc in this case termed the basal body the action of the dynein motor proteins on the various microtubule strands that run along a cilium or flagellum allows the organelle to bend and generate force for swimming moving extracellular material and other roles prokaryotes possess tubulin-like proteins including ftsz however prokaryotic flagella are entirely different in structure from eukaryotic flagella and do not contain microtubule-based structures
=== developmentedit ===
the cytoskeleton formed by microtubules is essential to the morphogenetic process of an organisms development for example a network of polarized microtubules is required within the oocyte of drosophila melanogaster during its embryogenesis in order to establish the axis of the egg signals sent between the follicular cells and the oocyte (such as factors similar to epidermal growth factor) cause the reorganization of the microtubules so that their (-) ends are located in the lower part of the oocyte polarizing the structure and leading to the appearance of an anterior-posterior axis this involvement in the bodys architecture is also seen in mammals
another area where microtubules are essential is the formation of the nervous system in higher vertebrates where tubulins dynamics and those of the associated proteins (such as the maps) is finely controlled during the development of the nervous system
=== gene regulationedit ===
the cellular cytoskeleton is a dynamic system that functions on many different levels in addition to giving the cell a particular form and supporting the transport of vesicles and organelles it can also influence gene expression however the signal transduction mechanisms involved in this communication are little understood notwithstanding this the relationship between the drug-mediated depolymerization of microtubules and the specific expression of transcription factors has been described which has provided information on the differential expression of the genes depending on the presence of these factors this communication between the cytoskeleton and the regulation of the cellular response is also related to the action of growth factors for example this relation exists for connective tissue growth factor
