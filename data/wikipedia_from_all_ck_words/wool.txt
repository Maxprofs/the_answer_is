wool is the textile fiber obtained from sheep and certain other animals including cashmere from goats mohair from goats qiviut from muskoxen angora from rabbits and other types of wool from camelids
wool has several qualities that distinguish it from hair or fur it is crimped it is elastic and it grows in staples (clusters)
== characteristicsedit ==
wool's scaling and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers attach to each other so they stay together because of the crimp wool fabrics have greater bulk than other textiles and they hold air which causes the fabric to retain heat insulation works both ways bedouins and tuaregs use wool clothes to keep heat out and protect the body
felting of wool occurs upon hammering or other mechanical agitation as the microscopic barbs on the surface of wool fibers hook together
the amount of crimp corresponds to the fineness of the wool fibers a fine wool like merino may have up to 100 crimps per inch while the coarser wools like karakul may have as few as one or two in contrast hair has little if any scale and no crimp and little ability to bind into yarn on sheep the hair part of the fleece is called kemp the relative amounts of kemp to wool vary from breed to breed and make some fleeces more desirable for spinning felting or carding into batts for quilts or other insulating products including the famous tweed cloth of scotland
wool fibers readily absorb moisture but are not hollow wool can absorb almost one-third of its own weight in water wool absorbs sound like many other fabrics it is generally a creamy white color although some breeds of sheep produce natural colors such as black brown silver and random mixes
wool ignites at a higher temperature than cotton and some synthetic fibers it has a lower rate of flame spread a lower rate of heat release a lower heat of combustion and does not melt or drip it forms a char which is insulating and self-extinguishing and it contributes less to toxic gases and smoke than other flooring products when used in carpets wool carpets are specified for high safety environments such as trains and aircraft wool is usually specified for garments for firefighters soldiers and others in occupations where they are exposed to the likelihood of fire
wool is considered by the medical profession to be hypoallergenic
== processingedit ==
=== shearingedit ===
sheep shearing is the process by which the woolen fleece of a sheep is cut off after shearing the wool is separated into four main categories fleece (which makes up the vast bulk) broken bellies and locks the quality of fleeces is determined by a technique known as wool classing whereby a qualified person called a wool classer groups wools of similar gradings together to maximize the return for the farmer or sheep owner in australia and new zealand before being auctioned all merino fleece wool is objectively measured for micron yield (including the amount of vegetable matter) staple length staple strength and sometimes color and comfort factor the sheep is given a dip in antiseptic solution after shearing so as to cure the wounds caused during shearing
=== scouringedit ===
wool straight off a sheep known as greasy wool or wool in the grease contains a high level of valuable lanolin as well as dead skin sweat residue pesticides and vegetable matter before the wool can be used for commercial purposes it must be scoured a process of cleaning the greasy wool scouring may be as simple as a bath in warm water or as complicated as an industrial process using detergent and alkali in specialized equipment in north west england special potash pits were constructed to produce potash used in the manufacture of a soft soap for scouring locally produced white wool
in commercial wool vegetable matter is often removed by chemical carbonization in less-processed wools vegetable matter may be removed by hand and some of the lanolin left intact through the use of gentler detergents this semigrease wool can be worked into yarn and knitted into particularly water-resistant mittens or sweaters such as those of the aran island fishermen lanolin removed from wool is widely used in cosmetic products such as hand creams
== qualityedit ==
the quality of wool is determined by its fiber diameter crimp yield color and staple strength fiber diameter is the single most important wool characteristic determining quality and price
merino wool is typically 35 inches in length and is very fine (between 12 and 24 microns) the finest and most valuable wool comes from merino hoggets wool taken from sheep produced for meat is typically more coarse and has fibers 1.5 to 6 in (38 to 152 mm) in length damage or breaks in the wool can occur if the sheep is stressed while it is growing its fleece resulting in a thin spot where the fleece is likely to break
wool is also separated into grades based on the measurement of the wool's diameter in microns and also its style these grades may vary depending on the breed or purpose of the wool for example
< 15.5 ultrafine merino
15.6 18.5 superfine merino
18.6 20 fine merino
20.1 23 medium merino
> 23 strong merino
comeback 2126 microns white 90180 mm long
fine crossbred 2731 microns corriedales etc
medium crossbred 3235 microns
downs 2334 microns typically lacks luster and brightness examples aussiedown dorset horn suffolk etc
coarse crossbred >36 microns
carpet wools 3545 microns
any wool finer than 25 microns can be used for garments while coarser grades are used for outerwear or rugs the finer the wool the softer it is while coarser grades are more durable and less prone to pilling
the finest australian and new zealand merino wools are known as 1pp which is the industry benchmark of excellence for merino wool 16.9 microns and finer this style represents the top level of fineness character color and style as determined on the basis of a series of parameters in accordance with the original dictates of british wool as applied today by the australian wool exchange (awex) council only a few dozen of the millions of bales auctioned every year can be classified and marked 1pp
== historyedit ==
wild sheep were more hairy than woolly although sheep were domesticated some 9,000 to 11,000 years ago archaeological evidence from statuary found at sites in iran suggests selection for woolly sheep may have begun around 6000 bc with the earliest woven wool garments having only been dated to two to three thousand years later woolly-sheep were introduced into europe from the near east in the early part of the 4th millennium bc the oldest known european wool textile ca 1500 bc was preserved in a danish bog prior to invention of shearsprobably in the iron agethe wool was plucked out by hand or by bronze combs in roman times wool linen and leather clothed the european population cotton from india was a curiosity of which only naturalists had heard and silks imported along the silk road from china were extravagant luxury goods pliny the elder records in his natural history that the reputation for producing the finest wool was enjoyed by tarentum where selective breeding had produced sheep with superior fleeces but which required special care
in medieval times as trade connections expanded the champagne fairs revolved around the production of wool cloth in small centers such as provins the network developed by the annual fairs meant the woolens of provins might find their way to naples sicily cyprus majorca spain and even constantinople the wool trade developed into serious business a generator of capital in the 13th century the wool trade became the economic engine of the low countries and central italy by the end of the 14th century italy predominated though italian production turned to silk in the 16th century both industries based on the export of english raw wool were rivaled only by the 15th-century sheepwalks of castile and were a significant source of income to the english crown which in 1275 had imposed an export tax on wool called the great custom the importance of wool to the english economy can be seen in the fact that since the 14th century the presiding officer of the house of lords has sat on the woolsack a chair stuffed with wool
economies of scale were instituted in the cistercian houses which had accumulated great tracts of land during the 12th and early 13th centuries when land prices were low and labor still scarce raw wool was baled and shipped from north sea ports to the textile cities of flanders notably ypres and ghent where it was dyed and worked up as cloth at the time of the black death english textile industries accounted for about 10% of english wool production the english textile trade grew during the 15th century to the point where export of wool was discouraged over the centuries various british laws controlled the wool trade or required the use of wool even in burials the smuggling of wool out of the country known as owling was at one time punishable by the cutting off of a hand after the restoration fine english woolens began to compete with silks in the international market partly aided by the navigation acts in 1699 the english crown forbade its american colonies to trade wool with anyone but england herself
a great deal of the value of woolen textiles was in the dyeing and finishing of the woven product in each of the centers of the textile trade the manufacturing process came to be subdivided into a collection of trades overseen by an entrepreneur in a system called by the english the putting-out system or cottage industry and the verlagssystem by the germans in this system of producing wool cloth until recently perpetuated in the production of harris tweeds the entrepreneur provides the raw materials and an advance the remainder being paid upon delivery of the product written contracts bound the artisans to specified terms fernand braudel traces the appearance of the system in the 13th-century economic boom quoting a document of 1275 the system effectively bypassed the guilds restrictions
before the flowering of the renaissance the medici and other great banking houses of florence had built their wealth and banking system on their textile industry based on wool overseen by the arte della lana the wool guild wool textile interests guided florentine policies francesco datini the merchant of prato established in 1383 an arte della lana for that small tuscan city the sheepwalks of castile shaped the landscape and the fortunes of the meseta that lies in the heart of the iberian peninsula in the 16th century a unified spain allowed export of merino lambs only with royal permission the german wool market based on sheep of spanish origin did not overtake british wool until comparatively late the industrial revolution introduced mass production technology into wool and wool cloth manufacturing australia's colonial economy was based on sheep raising and the australian wool trade eventually overtook that of the germans by 1845 furnishing wool for bradford which developed as the heart of industrialized woolens production
due to decreasing demand with increased use of synthetic fibers wool production is much less than what it was in the past the collapse in the price of wool began in late 1966 with a 40% drop with occasional interruptions the price has tended down the result has been sharply reduced production and movement of resources into production of other commodities in the case of sheep growers to production of meat
superwash wool (or washable wool) technology first appeared in the early 1970s to produce wool that has been specially treated so it is machine washable and may be tumble-dried this wool is produced using an acid bath that removes the scales from the fiber or by coating the fiber with a polymer that prevents the scales from attaching to each other and causing shrinkage this process results in a fiber that holds longevity and durability over synthetic materials while retaining its shape
in december 2004 a bale of the then world's finest wool averaging 11.8 microns sold for au$3,000 per kilogram at auction in melbourne victoria this fleece wool tested with an average yield of 74.5% 68 mm long and had 40 newtons per kilotex strength the result was a$279,000 for the bale the finest bale of wool ever auctioned was sold for a seasonal record of au$2690 per kilo during june 2008 this bale was produced by the hillcreston pinehill partnership and measured 11.6 microns 72.1% yield and had a 43 newtons per kilotex strength measurement the bale realized $247,480 and was exported to india
in 2007 a new wool suit was developed and sold in japan that can be washed in the shower and which dries off ready to wear within hours with no ironing required the suit was developed using australian merino wool and it enables woven products made from wool such as suits trousers and skirts to be cleaned using a domestic shower at home
in december 2006 the general assembly of the united nations proclaimed 2009 to be the international year of natural fibres so as to raise the profile of wool and other natural fibers

organic wool is becoming more and more popular this wool is very limited in supply and much of it comes from new zealand and australia it is becoming easier to find in clothing and other products but these products often carry a higher price wool is environmentally preferable (as compared to petroleum-based nylon or polypropylene) as a material for carpets as well in particular when combined with a natural binding and the use of formaldehyde-free glues
animal rights groups have noted issues with the production of wool such as mulesing
== marketingedit ==
=== australiaedit ===
about 85% of wool sold in australia is sold by open cry auction sale by sample is a method in which a mechanical claw takes a sample from each bale in a line or lot of wool these grab samples are bulked objectively measured and a sample of not less than 4 kg is displayed in a box for the buyer to examine the australian wool exchange conducts sales primarily in sydney melbourne newcastle and fremantle about 80 brokers and agents work throughout australia
about 7% of australian wool is sold by private treaty on farms or to local wool-handling facilities this option gives wool growers benefit from reduced transport warehousing and selling costs this method is preferred for small lots or mixed butts to make savings on reclassing and testing
about 5% of australian wool is sold over the internet on an electronic offer board this option gives wool growers the ability to set firm price targets reoffer passed-in wool and offer lots to the market quickly and efficiently this method works well for tested lots as buyers use these results to make a purchase about 97% of wool is sold without sample inspection however as of december 2009 59% of wool listed had been passed in from auction growers through certain brokers can allocate their wool to a sale and at what price their wool will be reserved
sale by tender can achieve considerable cost savings on wool clips large enough to make it worthwhile for potential buyers to submit tenders some marketing firms sell wool on a consignment basis obtaining a fixed percentage as commission
forward selling some buyers offer a secure price for forward delivery of wool based on estimated measurements or the results of previous clips prices are quoted at current market rates and are locked in for the season premiums and discounts are added to cover variations in micron yield tensile strength etc. which are confirmed by actual test results when available
another method of selling wool includes sales direct to wool mills
=== other countriesedit ===
the british wool marketing board operates a central marketing system for uk fleece wool with the aim of achieving the best possible net returns for farmers
less than half of new zealand's wool is sold at auction while around 45% of farmers sell wool directly to private buyers and end-users
united states sheep producers market wool with private or cooperative wool warehouses but wool pools are common in many states in some cases wool is pooled in a local market area but sold through a wool warehouse wool offered with objective measurement test results is preferred imported apparel wool and carpet wool goes directly to central markets where it is handled by the large merchants and manufacturers
== yarnedit ==
virgin wool is spun for the first time
shoddy or recycled wool is made by cutting or tearing apart existing wool fabric and respinning the resulting fibers as this process makes the wool fibers shorter the remanufactured fabric is inferior to the original the recycled wool may be mixed with raw wool wool noil or another fiber such as cotton to increase the average fiber length such yarns are typically used as weft yarns with a cotton warp this process was invented in the heavy woollen district of west yorkshire and created a microeconomy in this area for many years
rag is a sturdy wool fiber made into yarn and used in many rugged applications such as gloves
worsted is a strong long-staple combed wool yarn with a hard surface
woolen is a soft short-staple carded wool yarn typically used for knitting in traditional weaving woolen weft yarn (for softness and warmth) is frequently combined with a worsted warp yarn for strength on the loom
== usesedit ==
in addition to clothing wool has been used for blankets horse rugs saddle cloths carpeting felt wool insulation (also see links) and upholstery wool felt covers piano hammers and it is used to absorb odors and noise in heavy machinery and stereo speakers ancient greeks lined their helmets with felt and roman legionnaires used breastplates made of wool felt
wool has also been traditionally used to cover cloth diapers wool fiber exteriors are hydrophobic (repel water) and the interior of the wool fiber is hygroscopic (attracts water) this makes a wool garment able to cover a wet diaper while inhibiting wicking so outer garments remain dry wool felted and treated with lanolin is water resistant air permeable and slightly antibacterial so it resists the buildup of odor some modern cloth diapers use felted wool fabric for covers and there are several modern commercial knitting patterns for wool diaper covers
initial studies of woolen underwear have found it prevented heat and sweat rashes because it more readily absorbs the moisture than other fibers
merino wool has been used in baby sleep products such as swaddle baby wrap blankets and infant sleeping bags
as an animal protein it can be used as a soil fertilizer being a slow-release source of nitrogen
researchers at the royal melbourne institute of technology school of fashion and textiles have discovered a blend of wool and kevlar the synthetic fiber widely used in body armor was lighter cheaper and worked better in damp conditions than kevlar alone kevlar when used alone loses about 20% of its effectiveness when wet so required an expensive waterproofing process wool increased friction in a vest with 2830 layers of fabric to provide the same level of bullet resistance as 36 layers of kevlar alone
== carbon footprintedit ==
the carbon footprint of woolen products is difficult to determine and varies considerably according to factors ranging from the conditions in which sheep are bred to the processes used to manufacture the products
the average greenhouse gas footprint of wool in manufacturing carpets estimated at 5.48 kg co2 equivalent per kg when produced in europe
the carbon footprint of a 264.85g woolly jumper made from new zealand merino wool averages about 1.667 kg co2 equivalent at the point of purchase by a consumer implying a carbon footprint of around 6 kg per kg of finished woolen product
