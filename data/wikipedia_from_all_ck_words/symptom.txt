a symptom (from greek  accident misfortune that which befalls from  i befall from - together with and  i fall") is a departure from normal function or feeling which is noticed by a patient reflecting the presence of an unusual state or of a disease a symptom is subjective observed by the patient and cannot be measured directly whereas a sign is objectively observable by others for example paresthesia is a symptom (only the person experiencing it can directly observe their own tingling feeling) whereas erythema is a sign (anyone can confirm that the skin is redder than usual) symptoms and signs are often nonspecific but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain diagnoses helping to narrow down what may be wrong in other cases they are specific even to the point of being pathognomonic
the term is sometimes also applied to physiological states outside the context of disease as for example when referring to symptoms of pregnancy
== types ==
symptoms may be chronic relapsing or remitting asymptomatic conditions also exist (e.g subclinical infections and silent diseases like sometimes high blood pressure)
constitutional or general symptoms are those related to the systemic effects of a disease (e.g. fever malaise anorexia and weight loss) they affect the entire body rather than a specific organ or location
the terms chief complaint presenting symptom iatrotropic symptom or presenting complaint are used to describe the initial concern which brings a patient to a doctor the symptom that ultimately leads to a diagnosis is called a cardinal symptom
non-specific symptoms are self-reported symptoms that do not indicate a specific disease process or involve an isolated body system for example fatigue is a feature of many acute and chronic medical conditions which may or may not be mental and may be either a primary or secondary symptom fatigue is also a normal healthy condition when experienced after exertion or at the end of a day
=== positive and negative ===
in describing mental disorders especially schizophrenia symptoms can be divided into positive and negative symptoms
positive symptoms are symptoms present in the disorder but not normally experienced by most individuals it reflects an excess or distortion of normal functions (i.e. experiences and behaviors that have been added to a persons normal way of functioning) examples are hallucinations delusions and bizarre behavior
negative symptoms are functions that are normally found in healthy persons but that are diminished or not present in affected persons thus it is something that has disappeared from a persons normal way of functioning examples are social withdrawal apathy inability to experience pleasure and defects in attention control
== possible causes ==
some symptoms occur in a wide range of disease processes whereas other symptoms are fairly specific for a narrow range of illnesses for example a sudden loss of sight in one eye has a significantly smaller number of possible causes than nausea does
some symptoms can be misleading to the patient or the medical practitioner caring for them for example inflammation of the gallbladder often gives rise to pain in the right shoulder which may understandably lead the patient to attribute the pain to a non-abdominal cause such as muscle strain
== symptom versus sign ==
a symptom can more simply be defined as any feature which is noticed by the patient a sign is noticed by other people it is not necessarily the nature of the sign or symptom which defines it but who observes it
a feature might be a sign or a symptom - or both - depending on the observer(s) for example a skin rash may be noticed by either a healthcare professional as a sign or by the patient as a symptom when it is noticed by both then the feature is both a sign and a symptom in lists of features to expect in the history and physical examination rash may be listed under both (constituting a symptom in the former a sign in the latter)
some features such as pain can only be symptoms because they cannot be directly observed by other people other features can only be signs such as a blood cell count measured in a medical laboratory which most patients have no way to observe independently
