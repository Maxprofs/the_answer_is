drama is the specific mode of narrative typically fictional represented in performance the term comes from the greek word  drama meaning action which is derived from the verb  dra meaning to do or to act the enactment of drama in theatre performed by actors on a stage before an audience presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception the structure of dramatic texts unlike other forms of literature is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception the early modern tragedy hamlet (1601) by shakespeare and the classical athenian tragedy oedipus the king (c 429 bc) by sophocles are among the masterpieces of the art of drama a modern example is long day's journey into night (1956) by eugene oneill
the two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy they are symbols of the ancient greek muses thalia and melpomene the muse of comedy represented by the laughing face and the muse of tragedy represented by the weeping face respectively considered as a genre of poetry in general the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since aristotle's poetics (c 335 bc)the earliest work of dramatic theory
the use of drama in the narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the 19th century drama in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedyfor example zola's thrse raquin (1873) or chekhov's ivanov (1887) it is this narrow sense that the film and television industry and film studies adopted to describe drama as a genre within their respective media radio drama has been used in both sensesoriginally transmitted in a live performance it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio
drama is often combined with music and dance the drama in opera is generally sung throughout musicals generally include both spoken dialogue and songs and some forms of drama have incidental music or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue (melodrama and japanese n for example) in certain periods of history (the ancient roman and modern romantic) some dramas have been written to be read rather than performed in improvisation the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience
== history of western dramaedit ==
=== classical greek dramaedit ===
western drama originates in classical greece the theatrical culture of the city-state of athens produced three genres of drama tragedy comedy and the satyr play their origins remain obscure though by the 5th century bc they were institutionalised in competitions held as part of festivities celebrating the god dionysus historians know the names of many ancient greek dramatists not least thespis who is credited with the innovation of an actor ("hypokrites") who speaks (rather than sings) and impersonates a character (rather than speaking in his own person) while interacting with the chorus and its leader ("coryphaeus") who were a traditional part of the performance of non-dramatic poetry (dithyrambic lyric and epic)
only a small fraction of the work of five dramatists however has survived to this day we have a small number of complete texts by the tragedians aeschylus sophocles and euripides and the comic writers aristophanes and from the late 4th century menander aeschylus historical tragedy the persians is the oldest surviving drama although when it won first prize at the city dionysia competition in 472 bc he had been writing plays for more than 25 years the competition ("agon") for tragedies may have begun as early as 534 bc official records ("didaskaliai") begin from 501 bc when the satyr play was introduced tragic dramatists were required to present a tetralogy of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme) which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play (though exceptions were made as with euripides alcestis in 438 bc) comedy was officially recognized with a prize in the competition from 487 to 486 bc
five comic dramatists competed at the city dionysia (though during the peloponnesian war this may have been reduced to three) each offering a single comedy ancient greek comedy is traditionally divided between old comedy (5th century bc) middle comedy (4th century bc) and new comedy (late 4th century to 2nd bc)
=== classical roman dramaedit ===
following the expansion of the roman republic (50927 bc) into several greek territories between 270240 bc rome encountered greek drama from the later years of the republic and by means of the roman empire (27 bc-476 ad) theatre spread west across europe around the mediterranean and reached england roman theatre was more varied extensive and sophisticated than that of any culture before it
while greek drama continued to be performed throughout the roman period the year 240 bc marks the beginning of regular roman drama from the beginning of the empire however interest in full-length drama declined in favour of a broader variety of theatrical entertainments the first important works of roman literature were the tragedies and comedies that livius andronicus wrote from 240 bc five years later gnaeus naevius also began to write drama no plays from either writer have survived while both dramatists composed in both genres andronicus was most appreciated for his tragedies and naevius for his comedies their successors tended to specialise in one or the other which led to a separation of the subsequent development of each type of drama
by the beginning of the 2nd century bc drama was firmly established in rome and a guild of writers (collegium poetarum) had been formed the roman comedies that have survived are all fabula palliata (comedies based on greek subjects) and come from two dramatists titus maccius plautus (plautus) and publius terentius afer (terence) in re-working the greek originals the roman comic dramatists abolished the role of the chorus in dividing the drama into episodes and introduced musical accompaniment to its dialogue (between one-third of the dialogue in the comedies of plautus and two-thirds in those of terence) the action of all scenes is set in the exterior location of a street and its complications often follow from eavesdropping
plautus the more popular of the two wrote between 205 and 184 bc and twenty of his comedies survive of which his farces are best known he was admired for the wit of his dialogue and his use of a variety of poetic meters all of the six comedies that terence wrote between 166 and 160 bc have survived the complexity of his plots in which he often combined several greek originals was sometimes denounced but his double-plots enabled a sophisticated presentation of contrasting human behaviour no early roman tragedy survives though it was highly regarded in its day historians know of three early tragediansquintus ennius marcus pacuvius and lucius accius
from the time of the empire the work of two tragedians survivesone is an unknown author while the other is the stoic philosopher seneca nine of seneca's tragedies survive all of which are fabula crepidata (tragedies adapted from greek originals) his phaedra for example was based on euripides hippolytus historians do not know who wrote the only extant example of the fabula praetexta (tragedies based on roman subjects) octavia but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to seneca due to his appearance as a character in the tragedy
=== medievaledit ===
in the middle ages drama in the vernacular languages of europe may have emerged from religious enactments of the liturgy mystery plays were presented on the porch of the cathedrals or by strolling players on feast days miracle and mystery plays along with moralities and interludes later evolved into more elaborate forms of drama such as was seen on the elizabethan stages
=== elizabethan and jacobeanedit ===

=== modern and postmodernedit ===
the pivotal and innovative contributions of the 19th-century norwegian dramatist henrik ibsen and the 20th-century german theatre practitioner bertolt brecht dominate modern drama each inspired a tradition of imitators which include many of the greatest playwrights of the modern era the works of both playwrights are in their different ways both modernist and realist incorporating formal experimentation meta-theatricality and social critique in terms of the traditional theoretical discourse of genre ibsen's work has been described as the culmination of liberal tragedy while brecht's has been aligned with an historicised comedy
other important playwrights of the modern era include antonin artaud august strindberg anton chekhov frank wedekind maurice maeterlinck federico garca lorca eugene o'neill luigi pirandello george bernard shaw ernst toller vladimir mayakovsky arthur miller tennessee williams jean genet eugne ionesco samuel beckett harold pinter friedrich drrenmatt dario fo heiner mller and caryl churchill

==== sanskrit theatreedit ====

the major source of evidence for sanskrit theatre is a treatise on theatre (ntyastra) a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 bc to 200 ad) and whose authorship is attributed to bharata muni the treatise is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world it addresses acting dance music dramatic construction architecture costuming make-up props the organisation of companies the audience competitions and offers a mythological account of the origin of theatre
its drama is regarded as the highest achievement of sanskrit literature it utilised stock characters such as the hero (nayaka) heroine (nayika) or clown (vidusaka) actors may have specialised in a particular type it was patronized by the kings as well as village assemblies famous early playwrights include bhasa kalidasa (famous for vikrama and urvashi malavika and agnimitra and the recognition of shakuntala) udraka (famous for the little clay cart) asvaghosa dain and emperor harsha (famous for nagananda ratnavali and priyadarsika) akuntal (in english translation) influenced goethe's faust (18081832)

==== modern urdu drama of india and pakistanedit ====
urdu drama evolved from the prevailing dramatic traditions of north india shaping rahas or raas as practiced by exponents like nawab wajid ali shah of awadh his dramatic experiments led to the famous inder sabha of amanat and later this tradition took the shape of parsi theatre agha hashr kashmiri is the culmination of this tradition
in some way or other urdu theatre tradition has greatly influenced modern indian theatre among all the languages urdu (which was called hindi by early writers) along with gujrati marathi and bengali theatres have kept flourishing and demand for its writers and artists has not subsided by the drama aficionados for urdu drama no place is better than bombay film industry otherwise known as hindi film industry all the early gems of urdu theatre (performed by parsi companies) were made into films urdu dramatic tradition has been a spectators delight since 100 years and counting
drama as a theme is made up of several elements it focuses on life and different aspects of it the thing to be noticed here is that drama on stage imitates drama in life it has been said that there has always been a mutual relationship between theatre and real life great historical personalities like shakespeare have influenced modern urdu tradition to a large extent when indian iranian turkish stories and folk was adapted for stage with heavy doses of urdu poetry in modern times writers like imtiaz ali taj rafi peer krishan chander manto upender nath ashk ghulam rabbani prof mujeeb and many others shaped this tradition
while prof hasan ghulam jeelani j.n,kaushal shameem hanfi jameel shaidayi etc belong to the old generation contemporary writers like danish iqbal sayeed alam shahid anwar iqbal niyazi and anwar are a few postmodern playwrights actively contributing in the field of urdu drama
sayeed alam is known for his wit and humour and more particularly for plays like ghalib in new delhi big b and many other gems which are regularly staged for massive turn out of theatre lovers maulana azad is his magnum opus both for its content and style
danish iqbal's play about dara shikoh directed by m s sathyu is considered a modern classic for the use of newer theatre techniques and contemporary perspective his other plays are sahir on the famous lyricist and revolutionary poet kuchh ishq kiya kuchh kaam is another play written by danish which is basically a celebration of the faiz's poetry featuring events from the early part of his life particularly the events and incidents of pre-partition days which shaped his life and ideals chand roz aur meri jaan - another play inspired from faiz's letters written from various jails during the rawalpindi conspiracy days he has written 14 other plays including dilli jo ek shehr thaa and main gaya waqt nahin hoon shahid's three b is also a significant play he has been associated with many groups like natwa and others zaheer anwar has kept the flag of urdu theatre flying in kolkata unlike the writers of previous generation sayeed shahid danish iqbal and zaheer do not write bookish plays but their work is a product of vigorous performing tradition iqbal niyazi of mumbai has written several plays in urdu his play aur kitne jalyanwala baugh? won a national award other awards hence this is the only generation after amanat and agha hashr who actually write for stage and not for libraries

western opera is a dramatic art form which arose during the renaissance in an attempt to revive the classical greek drama tradition in which both music and theatre were combined being strongly intertwined with western classical music the opera has undergone enormous changes in the past four centuries and it is an important form of theatre until this day noteworthy is the huge influence of the german 19th-century composer richard wagner on the opera tradition in his view there was no proper balance between music and theatre in the operas of his time because the music seemed to be more important than the dramatic aspects in these works to restore the connection with the traditional greek drama he entirely renewed the operatic format and to emphasize the equal importance of music and drama in these new works he called them music dramas
