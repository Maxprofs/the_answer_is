a tugboat (tug) is a boat that maneuvers vessels by pushing or towing them tugs move vessels that either should not move themselves such as ships in a crowded harbor or a narrow canal or those that cannot move by themselves such as barges disabled ships log rafts or oil platforms tugboats are powerful for their size and strongly built and some are ocean-going some tugboats serve as icebreakers or salvage boats early tugboats had steam engines but today most have diesel engines many tugboats have firefighting monitors allowing them to assist in firefighting especially in harbors

=== seagoing tugboatsedit ===
seagoing tugboats (or ocean tugboats) fall into four basic categories
the standard seagoing tugboat with model bow that tows its payload on a hawser
the notch tug which can be secured in a notch at the stern of a specially designed barge effectively making the combination a ship this configuration is dangerous to use with a barge which is in ballast (no cargo) or in a head or following sea therefore the notch tugs are usually built with a towing winch with this configuration the barge being pushed might approach the size of a small ship with interaction of the water flow allowing a higher speed with a minimal increase in power required or fuel consumption
the integral unit, or integrated tug and barge (itb) comprises specially designed vessels that lock together in such a rigid and strong method as to be certified as such by authorities (classification societies) such as the american bureau of shipping lloyd's register of shipping indian register of shipping det norske veritas or several others these units stay combined under virtually any sea conditions and the tugs usually have poor sea-keeping designs for navigation without their barges attached vessels in this category are legally considered to be ships rather than tugboats and barges must be staffed accordingly these vessels must show navigation lights compliant with those required of ships rather than those required of tugboats and vessels under tow
articulated tug and barge (atb) units also utilize mechanical means to connect to their barges atbs generally utilize intercon and bludworth connecting systems atbs are generally staffed as a large tugboat with between seven to nine crew members the typical american atb operating on the east coast per custom displays navigational lights of a towing vessel pushing ahead as described in the 72 colregs
=== harbour tugboatsedit ===
compared to seagoing tugboats harbour tugboats are generally smaller and the width-to-length ratio is often higher due to the need for a lower draught in smaller harbours these are often also termed lunch bucket boats because they are only manned when needed and only at a minimum (captain and deckhand) thus the crew will bring their own lunch with them the number of tugboats in a harbour varies with the harbour infrastructure and the types of tugboats things to take into consideration includes ships with/without bow thrusters and forces like wind current and waves and type of ships (i.e in some countries there is a requirement for a certain amount and size of tugboats for port operations with gas tankers)
=== river tugboatsedit ===
river tugs are also referred to as towboats or pushboats their hull designs would make open ocean operation dangerous river tugs usually do not have any significant hawser or winch their hulls feature a flat front or bow to line up with the rectangular stern of the barge often with large pushing knees
== tugboat propulsionedit ==
tugboat engines typically produce 500 to 2,500 kw (~ 680 to 3,400 hp) but larger boats (used in deep waters) can have power ratings up to 20,000 kw (~ 27,200 hp) and usually have an extreme power:tonnage-ratio (normal cargo and passenger ships have a p:t-ratio (in kw:grt) of 0.35 to 1.20 whereas large tugs typically are 2.20 to 4.50 and small harbour-tugs 4.0 to 9.5) the engines are often the same as those used in railroad locomotives but typically drive the propeller mechanically instead of converting the engine output to power electric motors as is common for diesel-electric locomotives for safety tugboats engines often feature two of each critical part for redundancy
a tugboat's power is typically stated by its engine's horsepower and its overall bollard pull the largest commercial harbour tugboats in the 2000s-2010s used for towing container ships or similar had around 60-65 tons of bollard pull which is described as 15 tons above normal tugboats
tugboats are highly maneuverable and various propulsion systems have been developed to increase maneuverability and increase safety the earliest tugs were fitted with paddle wheels but these were soon replaced by propeller-driven tugs kort nozzles have been added to increase thrust per kw/hp this was followed by the nozzle-rudder which omitted the need for a conventional rudder the cycloidal propeller was developed prior to world war ii and was occasionally used in tugs because of its maneuverability after world war ii it was also linked to safety due to the development of the voith water tractor a tugboat configuration which could not be pulled over by its tow in the late 1950s the z-drive or (azimuth thruster) was developed although sometimes referred to as the aquamaster or schottel system many brands exist steerprop  wrtsil berg propulsion etc these propulsion systems are used on tugboats designed for tasks such as ship docking and marine construction conventional propeller/rudder configurations are more efficient for port-to-port towing
the kort nozzle is a sturdy cylindrical structure around a special propeller having minimum clearance between the propeller blades and the inner wall of the kort nozzle the thrust-to-power ratio is enhanced because the water approaches the propeller in a linear configuration and exits the nozzle the same way the kort nozzle is named after its inventor but many brands exist
a recent dutch innovation is the carousel tug winner of the maritime innovation award at the dutch maritime innovation awards gala in 2006 the carousel tug adds a pair of interlocking rings to the body of the tug the inner ring attached to the boat with the outer ring attached to the towed ship by winch or towing hook since the towing point rotates freely the tug is very difficult to capsize
the voith schneider propeller (vsp) also known as a cycloidal drive is a specialized marine propulsion system it is highly maneuverable being able to change the direction of its thrust almost instantaneously it is widely used on tugs and ferries
from a circular plate rotating around a vertical axis a circular array of vertical blades (in the shape of hydrofoils) protrude out of the bottom of the ship each blade can rotate itself around a vertical axis the internal gear changes the angle of attack of the blades in sync with the rotation of the plate so that each blade can provide thrust in any direction very similar to the collective pitch control and cyclic in a helicopter
