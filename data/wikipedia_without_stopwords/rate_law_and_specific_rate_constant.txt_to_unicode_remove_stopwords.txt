second order reactionsedit
second order reaction depends concentrations one second order reactant two first order reactants
reaction rate given
last equations stems definition rate law respect reactant
consider reaction b
second order reaction involving one reagent must mean terms definition rate law derivative b respect time equal one half derivative respect time b appears disappearing thus speed disappears twice speed b appears disappearing groups two b appearing groups one derivative b respect time equal minus one half derivative respect time
taking account definition rate equation relationship rate reaction terms concentration given reagent say ra make expressions equivalent find
thus derivative respect time must halved obtain rate disappearing
integrated second order rate laws respectively
b must different obtain integrated equation
halflife equation second order reaction dependent one second order reactant reaction halflife progressively doubles concentration reactant falls half initial value
another way present rate laws take log sides
