lysogeny lysogenic cycle one two cycles viral reproduction lytic cycle lysogeny characterized integration bacteriophage nucleic acid host bacteriums genome formations circular replicon bacteriums cytoplasm condition bacterium continues live reproduce normally genetic material bacteriophage called prophage transmitted daughter cells subsequent cell division later event uv radiation presence certain chemicals release causing proliferation new phages via lytic cycle lysogenic cycles also occur eukaryotes although method dna incorporation fully understood

bacteriophages
bacteriophages viruses infect replicate within bacteria temperate phages lambda phage reproduce using lytic lysogenic cycle via lysogenic cycle bacteriophages genome expressed instead integrated bacterias genome form prophage since bacteriophages genetic information incorporated bacterias genetic information prophage bacteriophage replicates passively bacterium divides form daughter bacteria cells scenario daughter bacteria cells contain prophage known lysogens lysogens remain lysogenic cycle many generations switch lytic cycle time via process known induction induction prophage dna excised bacterial genome transcribed translated make coat proteins virus regulate lytic growth

fitness tradeoffs bacteria
bacteriophages parasitic infect hosts use bacterial machinery replicate ultimately lyse bacteria temperate phages lead advantages disadvantages hosts via lysogenic cycle lysogenic cycle virus genome incorporated prophage repressor prevents viral replication nonetheless temperate phage escape repression replicate produce viral particles lyse bacteria temperate phage escaping repression would disadvantage bacteria hand prophage may transfer genes enhance host virulence resistance immune system also repressor produced prophage prevents prophage genes expressed confers immunity host bacteria lytic infection related viruses
lysogenic conversion
interactions lysogenic phages bacteria lysogenic conversion may occur temperate phage induces change phenotype infected bacteria part usual phage cycle changes often involve external membrane cell making impervious phages even increasing pathogenic capability bacteria host way temperate bacteriophages also play role spread virulence factors exotoxins exoenzymes amongst bacteria
bacterial survival

bacterial virulence
nonvirulent bacteria also shown transform highly virulent pathogens lysogenic conversion virulence factors carried lysogenic prophage virulence genes carried within prophages discrete autonomous genetic elements known morons confer advantage bacteria indirectly benefits virus enhanced lysogen survival

preventing lysogenic induction
strategies combat certain bacterial infections blocking prophage induction transition lysogenic lytic cycle eliminating vivo induction agents proposed reactive oxygen species ros hydrogen peroxide strong oxidizing agents decompose free radicals cause dna damage bacteria leads prophage induction one potential strategy combat prophage induction use glutathione strong antioxidant remove free radical intermediates another approach could cause overexpression ci repressor since prophage induction occurs concentration ci repressor low
