the atlantic ocean is the second largest of the world's oceanic divisions following the pacific ocean with a total area of about 106,400,000 square kilometres (41,100,000 sq mi) it covers approximately 20 percent of the earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area the first part of its name refers to atlas of greek mythology making the atlantic the sea of atlas
the oldest known mention of atlantic is in the histories of herodotus around 450 bc (hdt 1.202.4) atlantis thalassa (greek  english sea of atlas) the term ethiopic ocean derived from ethiopia was applied to the southern atlantic as late as the mid-19th century before europeans discovered other oceans their term ocean was synonymous with the waters beyond the strait of gibraltar that are now known as the atlantic the early greeks believed this ocean to be a gigantic river encircling the world
the atlantic ocean occupies an elongated s-shaped basin extending longitudinally between eurasia and africa to the east and the americas to the west as one component of the interconnected global ocean it is connected in the north to the arctic ocean to the pacific ocean in the southwest the indian ocean in the southeast and the southern ocean in the south (other definitions describe the atlantic as extending southward to antarctica) the equator subdivides it into the north atlantic ocean and south atlantic ocean
== geographyedit ==
the atlantic ocean is bounded on the west by north and south america it connects to the arctic ocean through the denmark strait greenland sea norwegian sea and barents sea to the east the boundaries of the ocean proper are europe the strait of gibraltar (where it connects with the mediterranean seaone of its marginal seasand in turn the black sea both of which also touch upon asia) and africa
in the southeast the atlantic merges into the indian ocean the 20 east meridian running south from cape agulhas to antarctica defines its border some authorities show it extending south to antarctica while others show it bounded at the 60 parallel by the southern ocean
in the southwest the drake passage connects it to the pacific ocean the man-made panama canal links the atlantic and pacific besides those mentioned other large bodies of water adjacent to the atlantic are the caribbean sea the gulf of mexico hudson bay the arctic ocean the mediterranean sea the north sea the baltic sea and the celtic sea
covering approximately 22% of earth's surface the atlantic is second in size to the pacific with its adjacent seas it occupies an area of about 106,400,000 square kilometres (41,100,000 sq mi) without them it has an area of 82,400,000 square kilometres (31,800,000 sq mi) the land that drains into the atlantic covers four times that of either the pacific or indian oceans the volume of the atlantic with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000 cubic kilometers (85,100,000 cu mi) and without them 323,600,000 cubic kilometres (77,640,000 cu mi)
the average depth of the atlantic with its adjacent seas is 3,339 metres (1,826 fathoms 10,955 ft) without them it is 3,926 metres (2,147 fathoms 12,881 ft) the greatest depth milwaukee deep with 8,380 metres (4,580 fathoms 27,490 ft) is in the puerto rico trench the shortest point between the mainland of 2 continents through the atlantic is from kabrousse,senegal to approximately touros,brazil measuring just 2,839 kilometers(1,764 miles)
== cultural significanceedit ==
the atlantic ocean was named by the ancient greeks after either atlas the titan or the atlas mountains named for him both involve the concept of holding up the sky transatlantic travel played a major role in the expansion of western civilization into the americas it is the atlantic that separates the old world from the new world in modern times some idioms refer to the ocean in a humorously diminutive way as the pond describing both the geographical and cultural divide between north america and europe in particular between the english-speaking nations of both continents many irish or british people refer to the united states and canada as across the pond and vice versa
the black atlantic refers to the role of this ocean in shaping black people's history especially through the atlantic slave trade irish migration to the us is meant when the term the green atlantic is used the term red atlantic has been used in reference to the marxian concept of an atlantic working class as well as to the atlantic experience of indigenous americans
== ocean flooredit ==
the principal feature of the bathymetry (bottom topography) is a submarine mountain range called the mid-atlantic ridge it extends from iceland in the north to approximately 58 south latitude reaching a maximum width of about 860 nautical miles (1,590 km 990 mi) a great rift valley also extends along the ridge over most of its length the depth of water at the apex of the ridge is less than 2,700 metres (1,500 fathoms 8,900 ft) in most places while the bottom of the ridge is three times as deep several peaks rise above the water and form islands the south atlantic ocean has an additional submarine ridge the walvis ridge
the mid-atlantic ridge separates the atlantic ocean into two large troughs with depths from 3,7005,500 metres (2,0003,000 fathoms 12,10018,000 ft) transverse ridges running between the continents and the mid-atlantic ridge divide the ocean floor into numerous basins some of the larger basins are the blake guiana north american cape verde and canaries basins in the north atlantic the largest south atlantic basins are the angola cape argentina and brazil basins
the deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps abyssal plains trenches seamounts basins plateaus canyons and some guyots various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise
ocean floor trenches and seamounts
puerto rico trench in the north atlantic is the deepest trench at 8,605 metres (4,705 fathoms 28,232 ft)
laurentian abyss is found off the eastern coast of canada
south sandwich trench reaches a depth of 8,428 metres (4,608 fathoms 27,651 ft)
romanche trench is located near the equator and reaches a depth of about 7,454 metres (4,076 fathoms 24,455 ft)
ocean sediments are composed of
terrigenous deposits with land origins consisting of sand mud and rock particles formed by erosion weathering and volcanic activity on land washed to sea these materials are found mostly on the continental shelves and are thickest near large river mouths or off desert coasts
pelagic deposits which contain the remains of organisms that sink to the ocean floor include red clays and globigerina pteropod and siliceous oozes covering most of the ocean floor and ranging in thickness from 603,300 metres (331,804 fathoms 20010,830 ft) they are thickest in the convergence belts notably at the hamilton ridge and in upwelling zones
authigenic deposits consist of such materials as manganese nodules they occur where sedimentation proceeds slowly or where currents sort the deposits such as in the hewett curve
== water characteristicsedit ==
on average the atlantic is the saltiest major ocean surface water salinity in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand (3.3 3.7%) by mass and varies with latitude and season evaporation precipitation river inflow and sea ice melting influence surface salinity values although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall) in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter maximum salinity values occur at about 25 north and south in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation
surface water temperatures which vary with latitude current systems and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy range from below 2 c (28 f) to over 30 c (86 f) maximum temperatures occur north of the equator and minimum values are found in the polar regions in the middle latitudes the area of maximum temperature variations values may vary by 78 c (1314 f)
the atlantic ocean consists of four major water masses the north and south atlantic central waters make up the surface the sub-antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of 1,000 metres (550 fathoms 3,300 ft) the north atlantic deep water reaches depths of as much as 4,000 metres (2,200 fathoms 13,000 ft) the antarctic bottom water occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 meters
within the north atlantic ocean currents isolate the sargasso sea a large elongated body of water with above average salinity the sargasso sea contains large amounts of seaweed and is also the spawning ground for both the european eel and the american eel
the coriolis effect circulates north atlantic water in a clockwise direction whereas south atlantic water circulates counter-clockwise the south tides in the atlantic ocean are semi-diurnal that is two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours in latitudes above 40 north some east-west oscillation occurs
== climateedit ==
climate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds because of the ocean's great capacity to store and release heat maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures
the oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation climatic zones vary with latitude the warmest zones stretch across the atlantic north of the equator the coldest zones are in high latitudes with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice ocean currents influence climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas
the gulf stream and its northern extension towards europe the north atlantic drift for example warms the atmosphere of the british isles and north-western europe and influences weather and climate as far south as the northern mediterranean the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern canada (the grand banks of newfoundland area) and africa's north-western coast in general winds transport moisture and air over land areas hurricanes develop in the southern part of the north atlantic ocean more local particular weather examples could be found in examples such as the azores high benguela current and nor'easter
== historyedit ==
the atlantic ocean appears to be the second youngest of the five oceans it did not exist prior to 130 million years ago when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral super continent pangaea were drifting apart the atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements along its shores
the norsemen the portuguese and the spanish were the first to explore and to cross it systematically from europe to the americas as well as to its islands and archipelagos and from the north atlantic to the south atlantic it was after the voyages of christopher columbus in 1492 at the service of castile (later spain) that the americas became well known in europe and european exploration rapidly accelerated leading to many new trade routes and the colonization of the americas
as a result the atlantic became and remains the major artery between europe and the americas (known as transatlantic trade) scientific explorations include the challenger expedition the german meteor expedition columbia university's lamont-doherty earth observatory and the united states navy hydrographic office

== economyedit ==
the atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes the atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves the atlantic hosts the world's richest fishing resources especially in the waters covering the shelves the major fish are cod haddock hake herring and mackerel
the most productive areas include the grand banks of newfoundland the nova scotia shelf georges bank off cape cod the bahama banks the waters around iceland the irish sea the dogger bank of the north sea and the falkland banks eel lobster and whales appear in great quantities various international treaties attempt to reduce pollution caused by environmental threats such as oil spills marine debris and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea
== terrainedit ==
from october to june the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the labrador sea denmark strait and baltic sea a clockwise warm-water gyre occupies the northern atlantic and a counter-clockwise warm-water gyre appears in the southern atlantic the mid-atlantic ridge a rugged north-south centerline for the entire atlantic basin first discovered by the challenger expedition dominates the ocean floor this was formed by the vulcanism that also formed the ocean floor and the islands rising from it
the atlantic has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays gulfs and seas these include the norwegian sea baltic sea north sea labrador sea black sea gulf of saint lawrence bay of fundy gulf of maine mediterranean sea gulf of mexico and caribbean sea

=== natural hazardsedit ===
icebergs are common from february to august in the davis strait denmark strait and the northwestern atlantic and have been spotted as far south as bermuda and madeira ships are subject to superstructure icing in the extreme north from october to may persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from may to september as can hurricanes north of the equator (may to december)
the united states southeast coast has a long history of shipwrecks due to its many shoals and reefs the virginia and north carolina coasts were particularly dangerous
the bermuda triangle is popularly believed to be the site of numerous aviation and shipping incidents because of unexplained and supposedly mysterious causes but coast guard records do not support this belief
hurricanes are also a natural hazard in the atlantic but mainly in the northern part of the ocean rarely tropical cyclones form in the southern parts hurricanes usually form between 1 june and 30 november of every year
== current environmental issuesedit ==
endangered marine species include the manatee seals sea lions turtles and whales drift net fishing can kill dolphins albatrosses and other seabirds (petrels auks) hastening the fish stock decline and contributing to international disputes municipal pollution comes from the eastern united states southern brazil and eastern argentina oil pollution in the caribbean sea gulf of mexico lake maracaibo mediterranean sea and north sea and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the baltic sea north sea and mediterranean sea
in 2005 there was some concern that warm northern european currents were slowing down
on 7 june 2006 florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off the state's endangered species list some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature
=== marine pollutionedit ===
marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles the biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone
marine debris which is also known as marine litter describes human-created waste floating in a body of water oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter
