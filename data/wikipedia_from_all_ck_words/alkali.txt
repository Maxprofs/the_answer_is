in chemistry an alkali (/lkla/ from arabic al-qaly   ashes of the saltwort) is a basic ionic salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal chemical element an alkali also can be defined as a base that dissolves in water a solution of a soluble base has a ph greater than 7.0 the adjective alkaline is commonly and alkalescent less often used in english as a synonym for basic especially for soluble bases this broad use of the term is likely to have come about because alkalis were the first bases known to obey the arrhenius definition of a base and they are still among the most common bases
== etymology ==
the word alkali is derived from arabic al qaly (or alkali) meaning the calcined ashes (see calcination) referring to the original source of alkaline substances a water-extract of burned plant ashes called potash and composed mostly of potassium carbonate was mildly basic after heating this substance with calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) a far more strongly basic substance known as caustic potash (potassium hydroxide) was produced caustic potash was traditionally used in conjunction with animal fats to produce soft soaps one of the caustic processes that rendered soaps from fats in the process of saponification one known since antiquity plant potash lent the name to the element potassium which was first derived from caustic potash and also gave potassium its chemical symbol k (from the german name kalium) which ultimately derived from alkali
== common properties ==
alkalis are all arrhenius bases ones which form hydroxide ions (oh) when dissolved in water common properties of alkaline aqueous solutions include
moderately concentrated solutions (over 103 m) have a ph of 7.1 or greater this means that they will turn phenolphthalein from colorless to pink
concentrated solutions are caustic (causing chemical burns)
alkaline solutions are slippery or soapy to the touch due to the saponification of the fatty substances on the surface of the skin
alkalis are normally water-soluble although some like barium carbonate are only soluble when reacting with an acidic aqueous solution
== difference between alkali and base ==
the terms base and alkali are often used interchangeably particularly outside of the context of chemistry and chemical engineering
there are various more specific definitions for the concept of an alkali alkalis are usually defined as a subset of the bases one of two subsets is commonly chosen
a basic salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal (this includes mg(oh)2 but excludes nh3.)
any base that is soluble in water and forms hydroxide ions or the solution of a base in water (this includes mg(oh)2 and nh3.)
the second subset of bases is also called an arrhenius base
== alkali salts ==
alkali salts are soluble hydroxides of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals of which common examples are
sodium hydroxide - often called caustic soda
potassium hydroxide - commonly called caustic potash
lye - generic term for either of the previous two or even for a mixture
calcium hydroxide - saturated solution known as limewater
magnesium hydroxide - an atypical alkali since it has low solubility in water (although the dissolved portion is considered a strong base due to complete dissociation of its ions)
== alkaline soil ==
soils with ph values that are higher than 7.3 are usually defined as being alkaline these soils can occur naturally due to the presence of alkali salts although many plants do prefer slightly basic soil (including vegetables like cabbage and fodder like buffalograss) most plants prefer a mildly acidic soil (with phs between 6.0 and 6.8) and alkaline soils can cause problems
== alkali lakes ==
in alkali lakes (also called soda lakes) evaporation concentrates the naturally occurring carbonate salts giving rise to an alkalic and often saline lake
examples of alkali lakes
alkali lake lake county oregon
baldwin lake san bernardino county california
mono lake near owens valley in california
redberry lake saskatchewan
summer lake lake county oregon
tramping lake saskatchewan
lake magadi in kenya
lake turkana in kenya (the largest alkali lake in the world)
there are also alkali lakes in the outback of australia
bear lake on the utahidaho border
