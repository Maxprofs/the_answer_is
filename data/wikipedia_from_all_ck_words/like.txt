== as a discourse particle filler hedge or speech disfluencyedit ==
=== history of this usageedit ===
the word like has developed several non-traditional uses in informal speech especially since the late 20th century onward it has appeared in addition to its traditional uses as a colloquialism across all dialects of spoken english serving as a discourse particle filler hedge speech disfluency or other metalinguistic unit although these particular colloquial uses of like appear to have become widespread rather recently its use as a filler is a fairly old regional practice in welsh english and in scotland it was used similarly at least as early as the 19th century
despite such prevalence in modern-day spoken english these colloquial usages of like rarely appear in writing (unless the writer is deliberately trying to replicate colloquial dialogue) and they have long been stigmatized in formal speech or in high cultural or high social settings furthermore this use of like seems to appear most commonly in particular among natively english-speaking children and adolescents while less so or not at all among middle-aged or elderly adults one suggested explanation for this phenomenon is the argument that younger english speakers are still developing their linguistic competence and metalinguistically wishing to express ideas without sounding too confident certain or assertive use like to fulfill this purpose
in pop culture such colloquial applications of like (especially in verbal excess) are commonly and often comedically associated with valley girls as made famous through the song valley girl by frank zappa released in 1982 and the film of the same name released in the following year the stereotyped valley girl language is an exaggeration of the variants of california english spoken by younger generations
however non-traditional usage of the word has been around at least since the 1950s introduced through beat and jazz culture the beatnik character maynard g krebs (bob denver) in the popular dobie gillis tv series of 1959-1963 brought the expression to prominence this was reinforced in later decades by the character of shaggy on scooby doo (who was based on krebs) a very early use of this locution can be seen in a new yorker cartoon of 15 september 1928 in which two young ladies are discussing a man's workplace what's he got - an awfice? no he's got like a loft.
it is also used in the 1962 novel a clockwork orange by the narrator as part of his teenage slang and in the top cat cartoon series from 1961 to 1962 by the jazz beatnik type characters
a common eye dialect spelling is lyk
see fleischman (1998) for a similar discourse particle in french
=== examplesedit ===
like can be used in much the same way as um... or er... as a discourse particle it has become common especially among north american teenagers to use the word like in this way see valspeak discourse marker and speech disfluency)
i like don't know what to do
it is also becoming more often used (northern england and hiberno-english in particular) at the end of a sentence as an alternative to you know this usage is sometimes considered to be a colloquial interjection and it implies a desire to remain calm and defuse tension
i didn't say anything like
just be cool like
use of like as a filler is quite common in all varieties of spoken english an example from r l stevenson's 1886 novel kidnapped
what'll like be your business mannie (p 7)
what's like wrong with him? said she at last (p 193)
like can be used as hedge to indicate that the following phrase will be an approximation or exaggeration or that the following words may not be quite right but are close enough it may indicate that the phrase in which it appears is to be taken metaphorically or as a hyperbole this use of like is sometimes regarded as adverbial as like is often synonymous here with adverbial phrases of approximation such as almost or more or less. examples
i have like no money
the restaurant is only like five miles from here
i like died
they like hate you
