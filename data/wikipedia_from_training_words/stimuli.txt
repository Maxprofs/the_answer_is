in the performing arts a scenario (uk /snrio/ us /snrio/ from italian that which is pinned to the scenery pronounced [*enarjo]) is a synoptical collage of an event or series of actions and events in the commedia dell'arte it was an outline of entrances exits and action describing the plot of a play and was literally pinned to the back of the scenery it is also known as canovaccio or that which is pinned to the canvas of which the scenery was constructed
surviving scenarios from the renaissance contain little other than character names brief descriptions of action and references to specific lazzi with no further explanation it is believed that a scenario formed the basis for a fully improvisational performance though it is also likely that they were simple reminders of the plot for those members of the cast who were literate modern commedia troupes most often make use of a script with varying degrees of additional improvisation
in the creation of an opera or ballet a scenario is often developed initially to indicate how the original source if any is to be adapted and to summarize the aspects of character staging plot etc that can be expanded later in a fully developed libretto or script this sketch can be helpful in pitching the idea to a prospective producer director or composer
