molecule mlkjul latin moles mass electrically neutral group two atoms held together chemical bonds molecules distinguished ions lack electrical charge however quantum physics organic chemistry biochemistry term molecule often used less strictly also applied polyatomic ions
kinetic theory gases term molecule often used gaseous particle regardless composition according definition noble gas atoms considered molecules despite composed single nonbonded atom
molecule may homonuclear consists atoms single chemical element oxygen o may heteronuclear chemical compound composed one element water ho atoms complexes connected noncovalent bonds hydrogen bonds ionic bonds generally considered single molecules
molecules components matter common organic substances therefore biochemistry also make oceans atmosphere however majority familiar solid substances earth including minerals make crust mantle core earth contain many chemical bonds made identifiable molecules also typical molecule defined ionic crystals salts covalent crystals network solids although often composed repeating unit cells extend either plane graphene threedimensionally diamond quartz sodium chloride theme repeated unitcellularstructure also holds condensed phases metallic bonding means solid metals also made molecules glasses solids exist vitreous disordered state atoms may also held together chemical bonds without presence definable molecule also without regularity repeating units characterizes crystals
molecular scienceedit
science molecules called molecular chemistry molecular physics depending whether focus chemistry physics molecular chemistry deals laws governing interaction molecules results formation breakage chemical bonds molecular physics deals laws governing structure properties practice however distinction vague molecular sciences molecule consists stable system bound state composed two atoms polyatomic ions may sometimes usefully thought electrically charged molecules term unstable molecule used reactive species ie shortlived assemblies resonances electrons nuclei radicals molecular ions rydberg molecules transition states van der waals complexes systems colliding atoms boseeinstein condensate
history etymologyedit
according merriamwebster online etymology dictionary word molecule derives latin moles small unit mass
molecule extremely minute particle fr molcule modern latin molecula diminutive latin moles mass barrier vague meaning first vogue word used late th century latin form traced philosophy descartes
definition molecule evolved knowledge structure molecules increased earlier definitions less precise defining molecules smallest particles pure chemical substances still retain composition chemical properties definition often breaks since many substances ordinary experience rocks salts metals composed large crystalline networks chemically bonded atoms ions made discrete molecules
molecular sizeedit
molecules far small seen naked eye exceptions dna macromolecule reach macroscopic sizes molecules many polymers molecules commonly used building blocks organic synthesis dimension angstroms several dozen single molecules cannot usually observed light noted small molecules even outlines individual atoms may traced circumstances use atomic force microscope largest molecules macromolecules supermolecules
smallest molecule diatomic hydrogen h bond length
effective molecular radius size molecule displays solution table permselectivity different substances contains examples
molecular formulasedit
chemical formula typesedit
chemical formula molecule uses single line chemical element symbols numbers sometimes also symbols parentheses dashes brackets plus minus signs limited single typographic line symbols may include subscripts superscripts
compounds empirical formula simple type chemical formula simplest integer ratio chemical elements constitute example water always composed ratio hydrogen oxygen atoms ethyl alcohol ethanol always composed carbon hydrogen oxygen ratio however determine kind molecule uniquely dimethyl ether ratios ethanol instance molecules atoms different arrangements called isomers also carbohydrates example ratio carbonhydrogenoxygen thus empirical formula different total numbers atoms molecule
molecular formula reflects exact number atoms compose molecule characterizes different molecules however different isomers atomic composition different molecules
empirical formula often molecular formula always example molecule acetylene molecular formula ch simplest integer ratio elements ch
molecular mass calculated chemical formula expressed conventional atomic mass units equal mass neutral carbon c isotope atom network solids term formula unit used stoichiometric calculations
structural formulaedit
molecules complicated dimensional structure especially involving atoms bonded four different substituents simple molecular formula even semistructural chemical formula may enough completely specify molecule case graphical type formula called structural formula may needed structural formulas may turn represented onedimensional chemical name chemical nomenclature requires many words terms part chemical formulas
molecular geometryedit
molecules fixed equilibrium geometriesbond lengths angles continuously oscillate vibrational rotational motions pure substance composed molecules average geometrical structure chemical formula structure molecule two important factors determine properties particularly reactivity isomers share chemical formula normally different properties different structures stereoisomers particular type isomers may similar physicochemical properties time different biochemical activities
molecular spectroscopyedit
molecular spectroscopy deals response spectrum molecules interacting probing signals known energy frequency according plancks formula molecules quantized energy levels analyzed detecting molecules energy exchange absorbance emission spectroscopy generally refer diffraction studies particles neutrons electrons high energy xrays interact regular arrangement molecules crystal
theoretical aspectsedit
