commonly map projection systematic transformation latitudes longitudes locations surface sphere ellipsoid locations plane map projections necessary creating maps map projections distort surface fashion depending purpose map distortions acceptable others therefore different map projections exist order preserve properties spherelike body expense properties limit number possible map projections
generally surfaces planetary bodies mapped even irregular modeled well sphere ellipsoid see even generally projections subject several pure mathematical fields including differential geometry projective geometry however map projection refers specifically cartographic projection
background
maps useful globes many situations compact easier store readily accommodate enormous range scales viewed easily computer displays facilitate measuring properties terrain mapped show larger portions earths surface cheaper produce transport useful traits maps motivate development map projections
however carl friedrich gausss theorema egregium proved spheres surface cannot represented plane without distortion applies reference surfaces used models earth since map projection representation one surfaces plane map projections distort every distinct map projection distorts distinct way study map projections characterization distortions

map projections constructed preserve least one properties though limited way projection preserves compromises approximates basic metric properties different ways purpose map determines projection form base map many purposes exist maps many projections created suit purposes
another consideration configuration projection compatibility data sets used map data sets geographic information collection depends chosen datum model earth different datums assign slightly different coordinates location large scale maps national mapping systems important match datum projection slight differences coordinate assignation different datums concern world maps vast territories differences get shrunk imperceptibility
projection best
mathematics projection permit particular map projection best everything something always get distorted therefore diversity projections exists service many uses maps vast range scales
modern national mapping systems typically employ transverse mercator close variant largescale maps order preserve conformality low variation scale small areas smallerscale maps spanning continents entire world many projections common use according fitness purpose
thematic maps normally require equal area projection phenomena per unit area shown correct proportion however representing area ratios correctly necessarily distorts shapes many maps equalarea hence reference maps world often appear compromise projections instead due distortions inherent map world choice projection becomes largely one aesthetics
mercator projection developed navigational purposes often used world maps projections would appropriate problem long recognized even outside professional circles example new york times editorial states
time come discard mercator something represents continents directions less deceptively although usage diminished still highly popular wall map apparently part rectangular map fills rectangular wall space map clearly familiarity breeds popularity
controversy peters map motivated american cartographic association cartography geographic information society produce series booklets including map best designed educate public map projections distortion maps internal debate seven north american geographic organizations adopted resolution recommending using rectangular projection including mercator gallpeters reference maps world
distortion
classic way showing distortion inherent projection use tissots indicatrix given point using scale factor h along meridian scale factor k along parallel angle nicolas tissot described construct ellipse characterizes amount orientation components distortion spacing ellipses regularly along meridians parallels network indicatrices shows distortion varies across map
mercator projection conformal projection hk ellipse degenerates circle radius hk equal sole scale factor point
sinusoidal projection equalarea projection semimajor axis ellipse reciprocal semiminor axis every ellipse area even though shapes vary
arbitrary projections neither shape area ellipses related general
construction map projection
creation map projection involves two steps
selection model shape earth planetary body usually choosing sphere ellipsoid earths actual shape irregular information lost step
transformation geographic coordinates longitude latitude cartesian xy polar plane coordinates cartesian coordinates normally simple relation eastings northings defined grid superimposed projection
simplest map projections literally projections obtained placing light source definite point relative globe projecting features onto specified surface case projections defined terms mathematical formulae direct geometric interpretation
choosing projection surface
surface unfolded unrolled plane sheet without stretching tearing shrinking called developable surface cylinder cone plane developable surfaces sphere ellipsoid developable surfaces projection onto plane distort image compare one cannot flatten orange peel without tearing warping
one way describing projection first project earths surface developable surface cylinder cone unroll surface plane first step inevitably distorts properties globe developable surface unfolded without distortion
aspect projection
choice made projecting onto cylinder cone plane aspect shape must specified aspect describes developable surface placed relative globe may normal surfaces axis symmetry coincides earths axis transverse right angles earths axis oblique angle
notable lines
developable surface may also either tangent secant sphere ellipsoid tangent means surface touches slice globe secant means surface slice globe moving developable surface away contact globe never preserves optimizes metric properties possibility discussed
tangent secant lines represented undistorted lines parallel latitude conical projections called standard parallel central meridian meridian globe rotated projecting central meridian usually written parallel origin usually written often used define origin map projection
scale
globe way represent earth constant scale throughout entire map directions map cannot achieve property area matter small however achieve constant scale along specific lines
possible properties
scale depends location direction equivalent preservation angles defining characteristic conformal map
scale constant along parallel direction parallel applies cylindrical pseudocylindrical projection normal aspect
combination scale depends latitude longitude direction applies mercator projection normal aspect
scale constant along straight lines radiating particular geographic location defining characteristic equidistant projection azimuthal equidistant projection also projections maurer close true distances two points preserved
choosing model shape body
projection construction also affected shape earth planetary body approximated following section projection categories earth taken sphere order simplify discussion however earths actual shape closer oblate ellipsoid whether spherical ellipsoidal principles discussed hold without loss generality
selecting model shape earth involves choosing advantages disadvantages sphere versus ellipsoid spherical models useful smallscale maps world atlases globes since error scale usually noticeable important enough justify using complicated ellipsoid ellipsoidal model commonly used construct topographic maps large mediumscale maps need accurately depict land surface auxiliary latitudes often employed projecting ellipsoid
third model geoid complex accurate representation earths shape coincident mean sea level would winds tides land compared best fitting ellipsoid geoidal model would change characterization important properties distance conformality equivalence therefore geoidal projections preserve properties mapped graticule would deviate mapped ellipsoids graticule normally geoid used earth model projections however earths shape regular undulation geoid amounting less m ellipsoidal model million m earth radius irregular planetary bodies asteroids however sometimes models analogous geoid used project maps
