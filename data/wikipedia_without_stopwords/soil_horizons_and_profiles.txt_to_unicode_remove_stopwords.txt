layers
soil generally consists visually texturally distinct layers also called profiles summarized follows top bottom
o horizon
layer generally forms mineral soil occurs organic soil profile o stands organic matter surface layer dominated presence large amounts organic material derived dead plant andor animal residues varying stages decomposition o horizon generally absent grassland regions o horizon usually occurs forested areas commonly referred forest floor o horizon considered distinct layer leaf litter covering many heavily vegetated areas contains weathered mineral particles part soil o horizons may divided o o categories whereby o horizons contain decomposed matter whose origin spotted sight instance fragments rotting leaves o horizons contain welldecomposed organic matter origin readily visible o horizons may also divided three subordinate o horizons denoted oi oe oa

subdivisions within master horizons
often distinctive layers exist within given master horizon indicated numeral following letter designation example three different combinations structure colors seen b horizon profile may include sequence bbb two different geologic parent materials eg loess overlying glacial till present within soil profile numeral placed front master horizon symbols horizons developed second layer parent material example soil would sequence horizons designated oabc c horizon developed different parent material layer mineral soil material transported humans source outside pedon caret symbol inserted master horizon designation
transition horizons
master horizon letter combinations slash eb used designate transition horizons distinct parts horizon properties e parts properties b transitional layers master horizons may dominated properties one horizon also characteristics another two master horizon letters used designate transition horizons eg ae eb bc wherein dominant horizon placed nondominant horizon example transition b like b e eb transition b like e b
subordinate distinctions
subordinate horizons may occur within master horizon designated lowercase letters following capital master horizon letter eg ap bt oi since nature master horizon generally described capital master horizon letter lowercase letter symbols following master horizon designation often used indicate specific horizon characteristics subordinate distinctions include limited special physical characteristics accumulation particular materials
