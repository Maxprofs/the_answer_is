tetanus also known as lockjaw is an infection characterized by muscle spasms in the most common type the spasms begin in the jaw and then progress to the rest of the body these spasms usually last a few minutes each time and occur frequently for three to four weeks spasms may be so severe that bone fractures may occur other symptoms may include fever sweating headache trouble swallowing high blood pressure and a fast heart rate onset of symptoms is typically three to twenty-one days following infection it may take months to recover about 10% of those infected die
tetanus is caused by an infection with the bacterium clostridium tetani which is commonly found in soil dust and manure the bacteria generally enter through a break in the skin such as a cut or puncture wound by a contaminated object they produce toxins that interfere with muscle contractions resulting in the typical symptoms diagnosis is based on the presenting signs and symptoms the disease does not spread between people
infection can be prevented by proper immunization with the tetanus vaccine in those who have a significant wound and less than three doses of the vaccine both immunization and tetanus immune globulin are recommended in those who are infected tetanus immune globulin or if not available intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) is used the wound should be cleaned and any dead tissue removed muscle relaxants may be used to control spasms mechanical ventilation may be required if a person's breathing is affected
tetanus occurs in all parts of the world but is most frequent in hot and wet climates where the soil contains a lot of organic matter in 2013 it caused about 59,000 deaths down from 356,000 in 1990 description of the disease by hippocrates exists from at least as far back as the 5th century bce the cause of the disease was determined in 1884 by antonio carle and giorgio rattone at the university of turin with a vaccine being developed in 1924
== signs and symptomsedit ==
tetanus often begins with mild spasms in the jaw musclesalso known as lockjaw or trismus the spasms can also affect the facial muscles resulting in an appearance called risus sardonicus chest neck back abdominal muscles and buttocks may be affected back muscle spasms often cause arching called opisthotonos sometimes the spasms affect muscles that help with breathing which can lead to breathing problems
prolonged muscular action causes sudden powerful and painful contractions of muscle groups which is called tetany these episodes can cause fractures and muscle tears other symptoms include drooling excessive sweating fever hand or foot spasms irritability difficulty swallowing suffocation heart attack breathing problems irregular heartbeat and uncontrolled urination or defecation the episodes can also cause destruction of elements of the nervous system through viral cell exchange
with treatment about 10% of people who contract tetanus die the mortality rate is higher in unvaccinated people and people over 60 years of age
=== incubation periodedit ===
the incubation period of tetanus may be up to several months but is usually about eight days in general the farther the injury site is from the central nervous system the longer the incubation period the shorter the incubation period the more severe the symptoms in neonatal tetanus symptoms usually appear from 4 to 14 days after birth averaging about 7 days on the basis of clinical findings four different forms of tetanus have been described
=== generalized tetanusedit ===
generalized tetanus is the most common type of tetanus representing about 80% of cases the generalized form usually presents with a descending pattern the first sign is trismus or lockjaw and the facial spasms called risus sardonicus followed by stiffness of the neck difficulty in swallowing and rigidity of pectoral and calf muscles other symptoms include elevated temperature sweating elevated blood pressure and episodic rapid heart rate spasms may occur frequently and last for several minutes with the body shaped into a characteristic form called opisthotonos spasms continue for up to four weeks and complete recovery may take months sympathetic overactivity (soa) is common in severe tetanus and manifests as labile hypertension tachycardia dysrhythmia peripheral vasculature constriction profuse sweating fever increased carbon dioxide output increased catecholamine excretion and late development of hypotension death can occur within four days
=== neonatal tetanusedit ===
neonatal tetanus is a form of generalized tetanus that occurs in newborns usually those born to mothers who themselves have not been vaccinated if the mother has been vaccinated against tetanus the infants acquire passive immunity and are thus protected it usually occurs through infection of the unhealed umbilical stump particularly when the stump is cut with a non-sterile instrument as of 1998 neonatal tetanus was common in many developing countries and was responsible for about 14% (215,000) of all neonatal deaths in 2010 the worldwide death toll was 58,000 newborns as the result of a public health campaign the death toll from neonatal tetanus was reduced by 90% between 1990 and 2010 and by 2013 the disease had been largely eliminated from all but 25 countries neonatal tetanus is rare in developed countries
=== local tetanusedit ===
local tetanus is an uncommon form of the disease in which patients have persistent contraction of muscles in the same anatomic area as the injury the contractions may persist for many weeks before gradually subsiding local tetanus is generally milder only about 1% of cases are fatal but it may precede the onset of generalized tetanus
=== cephalic tetanusedit ===
cephalic tetanus is the rarest form of the disease (0.93% of cases) and is limited to muscles and nerves in the head it usually occurs after trauma to the head area including skull fracture laceration eye injury dental extraction and otitis media but it has been observed from injuries to other parts of the body paralysis of the facial nerve is most frequently implicated which may cause lockjaw facial palsy or ptosis but other cranial nerves can also be affected cephalic tetanus may progress to a more generalized form of the disease due to its rarity clinicians may be unfamiliar with the clinical presentation and may not suspect tetanus as the illness treatment can be complicated as symptoms may be concurrent with the initial injury that caused the infection cephalic tetanus is more likely than other forms of tetanus to be fatal with the progression to generalized tetanus carrying a 1530% case fatality rate
== causeedit ==
tetanus is caused by the tetanus bacterium clostridium tetani tetanus is often associated with rust especially rusty nails objects that accumulate rust are often found outdoors or in places that harbour anaerobic bacteria but the rust itself does not cause tetanus nor does it contain more c tetani bacteria the rough surface of rusty metal merely provides a prime habitat for c tetani endospores to reside in (due to its high surface area) and the nail affords a means to puncture skin and deliver endospores deep within the body at the site of the wound
an endospore is a non-metabolizing survival structure that begins to metabolize and cause infection once in an adequate environment because c tetani is an anaerobic bacterium it and its endospores thrive in environments that lack oxygen hence stepping on a nail (rusty or not) may result in a tetanus infection as the low-oxygen (anaerobic) environment is caused by the oxidization of the same object that causes a puncture wound delivering endospores to a suitable environment for growth
tetanus is an international health problem as c tetani spores are ubiquitous the disease occurs almost exclusively in persons unvaccinated or inadequately immunized it is more common in hot damp climates with soil rich in organic matter this is particularly true with manure-treated soils as the spores are widely distributed in the intestines and feces of many animals such as horses sheep cattle dogs cats rats guinea pigs and chickens spores can be introduced into the body through puncture wounds in agricultural areas a significant number of human adults may harbor the organism the spores can also be found on skin surfaces and in contaminated heroin heroin users particularly those that inject the drug subcutaneously appear to be at high risk of contracting tetanus
== pathophysiologyedit ==
tetanus affects skeletal muscle a type of striated muscle used in voluntary movement the other type of striated muscle cardiac or heart muscle cannot be tetanized because of its intrinsic electrical properties
the tetanus toxin initially binds to peripheral nerve terminals it is transported within the axon and across synaptic junctions until it reaches the central nervous system there it becomes rapidly fixed to gangliosides at the presynaptic inhibitory motor nerve endings and is taken up into the axon by endocytosis the effect of the toxin is to block the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) across the synaptic cleft which is required to check the nervous impulse if nervous impulses cannot be checked by normal inhibitory mechanisms the generalized muscular spasms characteristic of tetanus are produced the toxin appears to act by selective cleavage of a protein component of synaptic vesicles synaptobrevin ii and this prevents the release of neurotransmitters by the cells
== diagnosisedit ==
there are currently no blood tests for diagnosing tetanus the diagnosis is based on the presentation of tetanus symptoms and does not depend upon isolation of the bacterium which is recovered from the wound in only 30% of cases and can be isolated from patients without tetanus laboratory identification of c tetani can be demonstrated only by production of tetanospasmin in mice having recently experienced head trauma may indicate cephalic tetanus if no other diagnosis has been made
the spatula test is a clinical test for tetanus that involves touching the posterior pharyngeal wall with a soft-tipped instrument and observing the effect a positive test result is the involuntary contraction of the jaw (biting down on the spatula") and a negative test result would normally be a gag reflex attempting to expel the foreign object a short report in the american journal of tropical medicine and hygiene states that in a patient research study the spatula test had a high specificity (zero false-positive test results) and a high sensitivity (94% of infected patients produced a positive test)
== preventionedit ==
unlike many infectious diseases recovery from naturally acquired tetanus does not usually result in immunity to tetanus this is due to the extreme potency of the tetanospasmin toxin even a lethal dose of tetanospasmin is insufficient to provoke an immune response
tetanus can be prevented by vaccination with tetanus toxoid the cdc recommends that adults receive a booster vaccine every ten years and standard care practice in many places is to give the booster to any patient with a puncture wound who is uncertain of when he or she was last vaccinated or if he or she has had fewer than three lifetime doses of the vaccine the booster may not prevent a potentially fatal case of tetanus from the current wound however as it can take up to two weeks for tetanus antibodies to form
in children under the age of seven the tetanus vaccine is often administered as a combined vaccine dpt/dtap vaccine which also includes vaccines against diphtheria and pertussis for adults and children over seven the td vaccine (tetanus and diphtheria) or tdap (tetanus diphtheria and acellular pertussis) is commonly used
the world health organisation certifies countries as having eliminated maternal or neonatal tetanus certification requires at least two years of rates of less than 1 case per 1000 live births in 1998 in uganda 3,433 tetanus cases were recorded in newborn babies of these 2,403 died after a major public health effort uganda in 2011 was certified as having eliminated tetanus
=== post-exposure prophylaxisedit ===
tetanus toxoid can be given in case of a suspected exposure to tetanus in such cases it can be given with or without tetanus immunoglobulin (also called tetanus antibodies or tetanus antitoxin) it can be given as intravenous therapy or by intramuscular injection
the guidelines for such events in the united states for non-pregnant people 11 years and older are as follows
== treatmentedit ==
=== mild tetanusedit ===
mild cases of tetanus can be treated with
tetanus immunoglobulin (tig) also called tetanus antibodies or tetanus antitoxin it can be given as intravenous therapy or by intramuscular injection
metronidazole iv for 10 days
diazepam oral or iv
=== severe tetanusedit ===
severe cases will require admission to intensive care in addition to the measures listed above for mild tetanus
human tetanus immunoglobulin injected intrathecally (increases clinical improvement from 4% to 35%)
tracheotomy and mechanical ventilation for 3 to 4 weeks tracheotomy is recommended for securing the airway because the presence of an endotracheal tube is a stimulus for spasm
magnesium as an intravenous (iv) infusion to prevent muscle spasm
diazepam as a continuous iv infusion
the autonomic effects of tetanus can be difficult to manage (alternating hyper- and hypotension hyperpyrexia/hypothermia) and may require iv labetalol magnesium clonidine or nifedipine
drugs such as diazepam or other muscle relaxants can be given to control the muscle spasms in extreme cases it may be necessary to paralyze the patient with curare-like drugs and use a mechanical ventilator
in order to survive a tetanus infection the maintenance of an airway and proper nutrition are required an intake of 3,500 to 4,000 calories and at least 150 g of protein per day is often given in liquid form through a tube directly into the stomach (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) or through a drip into a vein (parenteral nutrition) this high-caloric diet maintenance is required because of the increased metabolic strain brought on by the increased muscle activity full recovery takes 4 to 6 weeks because the body must regenerate destroyed nerve axon terminals
== epidemiologyedit ==
in 2013 it caused about 59,000 deaths down from 356,000 in 1990 tetanus in particular the neonatal form remains a significant public health problem in non-industrialized countries with 59,000 newborns worldwide dying in 2008 as a result of neonatal tetanus in the united states from 2000 through 2007 an average of 31 cases were reported per year nearly all of the cases in the united states occur in unimmunized individuals or individuals who have allowed their inoculations to lapse
== historyedit ==
tetanus was well known to ancient people who recognized the relationship between wounds and fatal muscle spasms in 1884 arthur nicolaier isolated the strychnine-like toxin of tetanus from free-living anaerobic soil bacteria the etiology of the disease was further elucidated in 1884 by antonio carle and giorgio rattone two pathologists of the university of turin who demonstrated the transmissibility of tetanus for the first time they produced tetanus in rabbits by injecting pus from a patient with fatal tetanus into their sciatic nerves
in 1891 c tetani was isolated from a human victim by kitasato shibasabur who later showed that the organism could produce disease when injected into animals and that the toxin could be neutralized by specific antibodies in 1897 edmond nocard showed that tetanus antitoxin induced passive immunity in humans and could be used for prophylaxis and treatment tetanus toxoid vaccine was developed by p descombey in 1924 and was widely used to prevent tetanus induced by battle wounds during world war ii
=== etymologyedit ===
the word tetanus comes from the ancient greek tetanos taut which is further from the ancient greek teinein to stretch
