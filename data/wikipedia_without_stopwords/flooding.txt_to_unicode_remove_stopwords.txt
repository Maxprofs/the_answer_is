flood overflow water submerges land usually dry european union eu floods directive defines flood covering water land normally covered water sense flowing water word may also applied inflow tide flooding may occur overflow water water bodies river lake water overtops breaks levees resulting water escaping usual boundaries may occur due accumulation rainwater saturated ground areal flood size lake body water vary seasonal changes precipitation snow melt changes size unlikely considered significant unless flood property drown domestic animals
floods also occur rivers flow rate exceeds capacity river channel particularly bends meanders waterway floods often cause damage homes businesses natural flood plains rivers riverine flood damage eliminated moving away rivers bodies water people traditionally lived worked rivers land usually flat fertile rivers provide easy travel access commerce industry

principal typesedit
arealedit
floods happen flat lowlying areas water supplied rainfall snowmelt rapidly either infiltrate run excess accumulates place sometimes hazardous depths surface soil become saturated effectively stops infiltration water table shallow floodplain intense rain one series storms infiltration also slow negligible frozen ground rock concrete paving roofs areal flooding begins flat areas like floodplains local depressions connected stream channel velocity overland flow depends surface slope endorheic basins may experience areal flooding periods precipitation exceeds evaporation
riverine channeledit
floods occur types river stream channels smallest ephemeral streams humid zones normallydry channels arid climates worlds largest rivers overland flow occurs tilled fields result muddy flood sediments picked run carried suspended matter bed load localized flooding may caused exacerbated drainage obstructions landslides ice debris beaver dams
slowrising floods commonly occur large rivers large catchment areas increase flow may result sustained rainfall rapid snow melt monsoons tropical cyclones
