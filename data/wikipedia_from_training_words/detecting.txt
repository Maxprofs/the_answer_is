in some police departments a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer in many other police systems detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers some people argue that detectives do a completely different job and therefore require completely different training qualifications qualities and abilities than uniformed officers the opposing argument is that without previous service as a uniformed patrol officer a detective cannot have a great enough command of standard police procedures and problems and will find it difficult to work with uniformed colleagues
