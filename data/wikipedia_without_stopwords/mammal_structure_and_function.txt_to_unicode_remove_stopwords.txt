chelates chelate keeleyt animal feed organic forms essential trace minerals copper iron manganese zinc
animals absorb digest use mineral chelates better inorganic minerals means lower concentrations used animal feeds addition animals fed chelated sources essential trace minerals excrete lower amounts faeces less environmental contamination mineral chelates also offers health welfare benefits animal nutrition
brief history chelates
since animal feeds supplemented essential trace minerals copper cu iron fe iodine manganese mn molybdenum mo selenium se zinc zn initially supplementation means inorganic salts essential trace elements onwards genetic improvement farm livestock resulted increased nutritional requirements nutrients chelated minerals developed trace mineral chelates proven better inorganic minerals meeting nutritional needs modern farm animals
role source minerals
objective supplementation trace minerals avoid variety deficiency diseases trace minerals carry key functions relation many metabolic processes notably catalysts enzymes hormones essential optimum health growth productivity example supplementary minerals help ensure good growth bone development feathering birds hoof skin hair quality mammals enzyme structure functions appetite deficiency trace minerals affect many metabolic processes may manifested different symptoms poor growth appetite reproductive failures impaired immune responses general illthrift trace mineral supplementation animal diets form inorganic minerals largely eradicated associated deficiency diseases farm animals
role fertility reproductive diseases dairy cattle highlights organic forms zn retained better inorganic sources may provide greater benefit disease prevention notably mastitis lameness
sources essential minerals
recent decades global food animal production intensified genetic potential growth yields improved result commercial tendencies increase trace mineral supplementationin order allow greater mineral requirements superior stock reared industrial conditions increasing concentration inorganic minerals animal diets led several problems
use high cu swine poultry rations caused accidental cu poisoning sensitive animals sheep grazing pastures fertilised pig poultry manure scan opinion scientific committee animal nutrition use copper feedingstuffs secondly inorganic minerals may form insoluble complexes dietary agents resulting low absorption addition thought positive charge many inorganic minerals reduces access enterocytes due repulsion negatively charged mucin layer competition binding sites
finally poor retention high excretion rates inorganic minerals led environmental concerns especially europe opinion scientific committee animal nutrition use zinc feedingstuffs european union concerned possible detrimental effects excess supplementation trace minerals environment human animal health legislated reduction permitted feed concentrations several trace metals co cu fe mn zn
research trace element nutrition led development bioavailable organic minerals including trace minerals derived chelates chelates allow lower supplementation rate trace minerals equivalent improved effect animal health growth productivity samples natural minerals wikimedia commons
particular types chelates
summary
chelates organic molecules normally consisting organic parts essential trace mineral occupying central position held place covalent bonding
proteinate particular type chelate mineral chelated shortchain peptides amino acids derived hydrolysed soy proteins proteinates minerals bound various amino acids different levels stability
aminoacid complex glycinates methionates particular types chelate mineral chelated amino acid based one single type aminoacid product pure one type bond chelation minerals ligand therefore easier work stability ensure full chelation moreover depending size amino acid also possible increase metal content
