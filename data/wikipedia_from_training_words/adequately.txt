hanlon's razor is an aphorism that recommends a way of eliminating unlikely explanations for a phenomenon (a philosophical razor)
never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity
as an eponymous law it may have been named after robert j hanlon there are also earlier sayings that convey the same idea dating back at least as far as goethe in 1774
== origins and etymologyedit ==
inspired by occam's razor the aphorism was popularized in this form and under this name by the jargon file a glossary of computer programmer slang in 1990 it appeared in the jargon file described as a murphyism parallel to occam's razor later that same year the jargon file editors noted lack of knowledge about the term's derivation and the existence of a similar epigram by william james in 1996 the jargon file entry on hanlon's razor noted the existence of a similar quotation in robert a heinlein's short story logic of empire (1941) with speculation that hanlon's razor might be a corruption of heinlein's razor (heinlein termed it the devil theory of sociology and wrote you have attributed conditions to villainy that simply result from stupidity".)
in 2001 quentin stafford-fraser published two blog entries citing e-mails from one joseph e bigler about how the quotation originally came from robert j hanlon of scranton pennsylvania as a submission for a book compilation of various jokes related to murphy's law published in arthur bloch's murphy's law book two more reasons why things go wrong (1980) subsequently in 2002 the jargon file entry noted the same though not definitively

another similar quotation appears in goethe's the sorrows of young werther (1774)
misunderstandings and neglect create more confusion in this world than trickery and malice at any rate the last two are certainly much less frequent
similarly jane west's the loyalists (1812) includes
let us not attribute to malice and cruelty what may be referred to less criminal motives do we not often afflict others undesignedly and from mere carelessness neglect to relieve distress
a common (and more laconic) british english variation coined by bernard ingham is the saying cock-up before conspiracy deriving from this 1985 quotation
many journalists have fallen for the conspiracy theory of government i do assure you that they would produce more accurate work if they adhered to the cock-up theory
another similar instance from politics is the attribution by first minister of scotland henry mcleish of financial irregularities that led to his resignation in 2001 to a muddle not a fiddle
heinlein's razor has since been defined as variations on never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity but don't rule out malice. this quotation is falsely attributed to albert einstein in peter w singer's book wired for war (2009)
