examplesedit
interact groundedit
someth exert forc ground ground push back equal forc opposit direct certain field appli physic biomechan forc ground call ground reaction forc forc object ground view action
someon want jump exert addit downward forc ground action simultan ground exert upward forc person reaction upward forc greater person weight result upward acceler forc perpendicular ground also call normal forc

gravit forcesedit
earth orbit around sun gravit forc exert sun earth action serv centripet forc maintain planet neighborhood sun simultan earth exert gravit attract sun reaction amplitud action opposit direct case pull sun toward earth sinc sun mass much larger earth appear react pull earth fact correct way describ combin motion object ignor celesti bodi moment say orbit around center mass combin system
support massedit
mass earth pull gravit forc earth forc also call weight correspond reaction gravit forc mass exert planet
object support remain rest instanc cabl hang surfac underneath liquid float also support forc upward direct tension forc normal forc buoyant forc respect support forc equal opposit forc know newton third law object remain rest forc must balanc
support forc also reaction object pull support cabl push support surfac liquid case therefor four forc equal magnitud
f gravit forc earth object downward
f gravit forc object earth upward
f forc support object upward
f forc object support downward
forc f f equal newton third law true forc f f forc f f equal object equilibrium forc appli noth newton third law
mass springedit
mass hang spring consider appli howev system perturb eg mass given slight kick upward downward say mass start oscil acceler subsequ deceler conclud newton second law net forc respons observ chang veloc gravit forc pull mass longer equal upward elast forc spring terminolog previous section f f longer equal
howev still true f f f f requir newton third law
causal misinterpretationedit
term action reaction unfortun suggest causal action caus reaction effect therefor easi think second forc first even happen time first incorrect forc perfect simultan reason
forc caus person volit eg soccer player kick ball volit caus often lead asymmetr interpret forc player ball consid action forc ball player reaction physic situat symmetr forc ball player explain near result pair contact forc ultim due electr repuls near caus decis player bear physic analysi far physic concern label action reaction flip
equal oppositeedit
one problem frequent observ physic educ student tend appli newton third law pair equal opposit forc act object incorrect third law refer forc two differ object exampl book lie tabl subject downward gravit forc exert earth upward normal forc tabl sinc book acceler forc must exact balanc accord newton first second law therefor equal opposit howev forc alway equal strong differ book push third forc tabl slant tableandbook system acceler elev case three forc cover consid sum forc
