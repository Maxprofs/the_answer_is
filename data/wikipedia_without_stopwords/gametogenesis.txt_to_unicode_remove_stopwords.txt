gametogenesis biological process diploid haploid precursor cells undergo cell division differentiation form mature haploid gametes depending biological life cycle organism gametogenesis occurs meiotic division diploid gametocytes various gametes mitotic division haploid gametogenous cells example plants produce gametes mitosis gametophytes gametophytes grow haploid spores sporic meiosis existence multicellular haploid phase life cycle meiosis gametogenesis also referred alternation generations
animals
animals produce gametes directly meiosis organs called gonads testicle males ovary females males females species reproduces sexually different forms gametogenesis
spermatogenesis male
oogenesis female
stages
however turning gametogonia embryonic development gametes males females
common path
gametogonia usually seen initial stage gametogenesis however gametogonia successors primordial germ cells early embryonic development primordial germ cells pgcs dorsal endoderm yolk sac migrate along hindgut gonadal ridge multiply mitosis reached gonadal ridge late embryonic stage referred gametogonia germ cells developed gametogonia longer males females
individual path
gametogonia male female gametes develop differently males spermatogenesis females oogenesis however convention following pattern common
gametangia
fungi algae primitive plants form specialized haploid structures called gametangia gametes produced mitosis fungi zygomycota gametangia single cells situated ends hyphae act gametes fusing zygote typically gametangia multicellular structures differentiate male female organs
antheridium male
archegonium female
flowering plants
flowering plants male gamete produced inside pollen grain division generative cell two sperm nuclei depending species occur pollen forms anther pollination growth pollen tube female gamete produced inside embryo sac ovule
