== receptionedit ==
writing for rolling stone anthony decurtis gave the album a star rating of four out of five stars he said that the band's second album develops the sounds of august and everything after and that they largely achieve their serious ambitions he praised adam duritz lyrics and called the album deeply satisfying
in a review for allmusic stephen thomas erlewine gave the album a rating of four stars out of five he called it a self-consciously challenging response to their successful debut album he described the songs as slightly more somber than those on the first album but more affecting he noted an occasional pretentiousness on the album but praised a long december as particularly articulate
andy gill from the independent gave the album a more negative review he criticized duritz song-writing as self-pity[ing] and called him a classic solipsistic soul-barer he just won't shut up about himself he called the album bland with obvious influences (including r.e.m. bruce springsteen and lynyrd skynyrd) gill had some praise for producer gil norton's work on the album
in a review for entertainment weekly ken tucker also had negative feelings about the album and gave it a c grade he criticized duritz yowling and moans and called counting crows a pastiche of its influences
