a concert is a live music performance in front of an audience
the performance may be by a single musician sometimes then called a recital or by a musical ensemble such as an orchestra choir or band concerts are held in a wide variety and size of settings from private houses and small nightclubs dedicated concert halls entertainment centres and parks to large multipurpose buildings and even sports stadiums indoor concerts held in the largest venues are sometimes called arena concerts or amphitheatre concerts informal names for a concert include show and gig
regardless of venue musicians usually perform on a stage concerts often require live event support with professional audio equipment before recorded music concerts provided the main opportunity to hear musicians play
== types ==
the nature of a concert varies by musical genre individual performers and the venue concerts by a small jazz combo or small bluegrass band may have the same order of program mood and volumebut vary in music and dress in a similar way a particular musician band or genre of music might attract concert attendees with similar dress hairstyle and behavior for example concert goers in the 1960s often had long hair (sometimes in dread lock form) sandals and inexpensive clothing made of natural fibers regular attendees to a concert venue might also have a recognizable style that comprises that venue's scene
=== theatrical ===
some performers or groups put on very elaborate and expensive shows to create a memorable and exciting atmosphere and increase the spectacle performers frequently include additional entertainment devices these can include elaborate stage lighting electronic imagery via (imag) system and/or pre-recorded video inflatable sets artwork or other set pieces various special effects such as theatrical smoke and fog and pyrotechnics and unusual costumes or wardrobe some singers especially popular music augment concert sound with pre-recorded accompaniment back-up dancers and even broadcast vocal tracks of the singer's own voice activities during these concerts can include dancing sing-alongs and moshing performers known for including these elements in their performances include pink floyd the flaming lips cher alice cooper iron maiden daft punk lady gaga jean michel jarre sarah brightman kiss gwar slipknot (band) and madonna
=== festivals ===
concerts involving a greater number of artists especially those that last for multiple days are known as festivals unlike other concerts which typically remain in a single genre of music or work of a particular artist festivals often cover a broad scope of music and arts due to their size festivals are almost exclusively held outdoors new platforms for festivals are becoming increasingly popular such as jam cruise which is a festival held on a cruise ship as well as mayan holidaze which is a destination festival held in tulum a few examples of the hundreds of festivals around the world include the big day out coachella festival download festival v festival falls festival glastonbury festival lollapalooza reading and leeds festivals rock werchter pukkelpop roskilde festival newport jazz festival oxegen festival ozzfest parachute music festival rock in rio rockwave festival salzburg festival festival woodstock music and art festival soundwave festival and the warped tour
=== concert tour ===
a concert tour is a series of concerts by an artist or group of artists in different cities or locations often concert tours are named to differentiate different tours by the same artist and associate a specific tour with a particular album or product (for example iron maiden world slavery tour) especially in the popular music world such tours can become large-scale enterprises that last for several months or even years are seen by hundreds of thousands or millions of people and bring in millions of dollars (or the equivalent) in ticket revenues
different segments of longer concert tours are known as legs the different legs of a tour are denoted in different ways dependent on the artist and type of tour but the most common means of separating legs are dates (especially if there is a long break at some point) countries and/or continents or different opening acts in the largest concert tours it is becoming more common for different legs to employ separate touring production crews and equipment local to each geographical region concert tours are often administered on the local level by concert promoters or by performing arts presenters usually small concert tours are managed by a road manager whereas large concert tours are managed by a tour manager
== revenue ==
while admission to some concerts is free it is common practice to charge money for concerts by selling admission tickets historically concerts were the primary source of revenue for musicians revenue from ticket sales typically goes to the performing artists producers venue organizers and the brokers in the case of benefit concerts a portion of profits often go towards a charitable organization
additional revenue is also often raised through in-concert advertising from free local concerts for local sponsorships to sponsorships from corporations during major tours e.g 2009's vans warped tour presented by at&t both vans and at&t would have paid significant amounts to have their company names included at the forefront in all marketing material for the warped tour
concessions and merchandise are also often sold during and after concerts often by the venue in the case of the former and by the performing band or artist in the case of the latter
as of 2011 the highest-grossing concert tour of all time is u2 360 tour with gross revenues of $736,137,344 the second highest-grossing concert tour of all time is the rolling stones a bigger bang tour which earned approximately $558 million between 2005 and 2007 madonna's sticky & sweet tour which earned $408 million in 2008 and 2009 was the highest-earning tour by a female artist it is unlikely that new acts will top these numbers
