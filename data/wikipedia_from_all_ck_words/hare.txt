hares are swift animals the european brown hare (lepus europaeus) can run up to 56 km/h (35 mph) the five species of jackrabbits found in central and western north america are able to run at 64 km/h (40 mph) and can leap up to 3 m (10 ft) at a time
normally a shy animal the european brown hare changes its behavior in spring when hares can be seen in daytime chasing one another this appears to be competition between males to attain dominance (and hence more access to breeding females) during this spring frenzy hares can be seen boxing one hare striking another with its paws (probably the origin of the term mad as a march hare") for a long time this had been thought to be intermale competition but closer observation has revealed it is usually a female hitting a male to prevent copulation

hares do not bear their young below ground in a burrow as do other leporids but rather in a shallow depression or flattened nest of grass called a form young hares are adapted to the lack of physical protection relative to that afforded by a burrow by being born fully furred and with eyes open they are hence precocial and are able to fend for themselves soon after birth by contrast the related rabbits and cottontail rabbits are altricial having young that are born blind and hairless
all rabbits (except the cottontail rabbits) live underground in burrows or warrens while hares (and cottontail rabbits) live in simple nests above the ground and usually do not live in groups hares are generally larger than rabbits with longer ears and have black markings on their fur hares have not been domesticated while rabbits are raised for food and kept as house pets the domestic pet known as the belgian hare is a rabbit that has been selectively bred to resemble a hare
hares have jointed or kinetic skulls unique among mammals they have 48 chromosomes while rabbits have 44
