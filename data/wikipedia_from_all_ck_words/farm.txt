a farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes or an area of water that is devoted primarily to aquacultural processes in order to produce and manage such commodities as fibres grains livestock dairy or fuel it is the basic production facility in food production
a farm may be owned and operated by a single individual family community corporation or a company may produce one or many types of produce and can be a holding of any size from a fraction of a hectare to several thousand hectares
== etymology ==
the word in the sense of an agricultural land-holding derives from the verb to farm a revenue source whether taxes customs rents of a group of manors or simply to hold an individual manor by the feudal land tenure of fee farm the word is from the medieval latin noun firma also the source of the french word ferme meaning a fixed agreement contract from the classical latin adjective firmus meaning strong stout firm as in the medieval age virtually all manors were engaged in the business of agriculture which was their principal revenue source so to hold a manor by the tenure of fee farm became synonymous with the practice of agriculture itself
== history ==
farming has been innovated at multiple different points and places in human history the transition from hunter-gatherer to settled agricultural societies is called the neolithic revolution and first began around 12,000 years ago near the beginning of the geological epoch of the holocene around 12,000 years ago it was the world's first historically verifiable revolution in agriculture subsequent step-changes in human farming practices were provoked by the british agricultural revolution in the eighteenth century and the green revolution of the second half of the twentieth
== types of farm ==
a farm may operate under a monoculture system or with a variety of cereal or arable crops which may be separate from or combined with raising livestock specialist farms are often denoted as such thus a dairy farm fish farm poultry farm or mink farm
some farms may not use the word at all hence vineyard (grapes) orchard (nuts and other fruit) market garden or truck farm (vegetables and flowers) some farms may be denoted by their topographical location such as a hill farm while large estates growing cash crops such as cotton or coffee may be called plantations
many other terms are used to describe farms to denote their methods of production as in collective corporate intensive organic or vertical
other farms may primarily exist for research or education such as an ant farm and since farming is synonymous with mass production the word farm may be used to describe wind power generation or puppy farm
== specialized farms ==
=== dairy farm ===
dairy farming is a class of agriculture where female cattle goats or other mammals are raised for their milk which may be either processed on-site or transported to a dairy for processing and eventual retail sale
in most western countries a centralized dairy facility processes milk and dairy products such as cream butter and cheese in the united states these dairies are usually local companies while in the southern hemisphere facilities may be run by very large nationwide or trans-national corporations (such as fonterra)
dairy farms generally sell male calves for veal meat as dairy breeds are not normally satisfactory for commercial beef production many dairy farms also grow their own feed typically including corn alfalfa and hay this is fed directly to the cows or stored as silage for use during the winter season additional dietary supplements are added to the feed to improve milk production
=== poultry farm ===
poultry farms are devoted to raising chickens (egg layers or broilers) turkeys ducks and other fowl generally for meat or eggs
=== pig farm ===
a pig farm is one that specializes in raising pigs or hogs for bacon ham and other pork products and may be free range intensive or both
=== prison farm ===
prison farms are farms which serve as prisons for people sentenced to hard labor by a court on prison farms inmates run the important tasks of a farm and producing crops
== ownership ==
farm control and ownership has traditionally been a key indicator of status and power especially in medieval european agrarian societies the distribution of farm ownership has historically been closely linked to form of government medieval feudalism was essentially a system that centralized control of farmland control of farm labor and political power while the early american democracy in which land ownership was a prerequisite for voting rights was built on relatively easy paths to individual farm ownership however the gradual modernization and mechanization of farming which greatly increases both the efficiency and capital requirements of farming has led to increasingly large farms this has usually been accompanied by the decoupling of political power from farm ownership
=== forms of ownership ===
in some societies (especially socialist and communist) collective farming is the norm with either government ownership of the land or common ownership by a local group especially in societies without widespread industrialized farming tenant farming and sharecropping are common farmers either pay landowners for the right to use farmland or give up a portion of the crops
== farms around the world ==
=== americas ===
the land and buildings of a farm are called the farmstead enterprises where livestock are raised on rangeland are called ranches where livestock are raised in confinement on feed produced elsewhere the term feedlot is usually used
in 1910 there were 6,406,000 farms and 10,174,000 family workers in 2000 there were only 2,172,000 farms and 2,062,300 family workers the share of u.s farms operated by women has risen steadily over recent decades from 5 percent in 1978 to 14 percent by 2007
in the united states there are over three million migrant and seasonal farmworkers 72% are foreign-born 78% are male they have an average age of 36 and average education of 8 years farmworkers make an average hourly rate of $910 per hour compared to an average of over $18 per hour for nonfarm labor their average family income is under $20,000 and 23% live in families with incomes below the federal poverty level one-half of all farmworker families earn less than $10,000 per year which is significantly below the 2005 u.s poverty level of $19,874 for a family of four
in 2007 corn acres are expected to increase by 15% because of the high demand for ethanol both in and outside of the u.s producers are expecting to plant 90.5 million acres (366,000 km) of corn making it the largest corn crop since 1944
=== asia ===
==== pakistan ====
according to the world bank most empirical evidence indicates that land productivity on large farms in pakistan is lower than that of small farms holding other factors constant. small farmers have higher net returns per hectare than large farms according to farm household income data
=== australia ===
farming is a significant economic sector in australia a farm is an area of land used for primary production which will include buildings
according to the un green agriculture directs a greater share of total farming input expenditures towards the purchase of locally sourced inputs (e.g labour and organic fertilisers) and a local multiplier effect is expected to kick in overall green farming practices tend to require more labour inputs than conventional farming (e.g from comparable levels to as much as 30 per cent more) (fao 2007 and european commission 2010) creating jobs in rural areas and a higher return on labour inputs.
where most of the income is from some other employment and the farm is really an expanded residence the term hobby farm is common this will allow sufficient size for recreational use but be very unlikely to produce sufficient income to be self-sustaining hobby farms are commonly around 2 hectares (4.9 acres) but may be much larger depending upon land prices (which vary regionally)
often very small farms used for intensive primary production are referred to by the specialization they are being used for such as a dairy rather than a dairy farm a piggery a market garden etc this also applies to feedlots which are specifically developed to a single purpose and are often not able to be used for more general purpose (mixed) farming practices
in remote areas farms can become quite large as with estates in england there is no defined size or method of operation at which a large farm becomes a station
=== europe ===
in the uk farm as an agricultural unit always denotes the area of pasture and other fields together with its farmhouse farmyard and outbuildings large farms or groups of farms under the same ownership may be called an estate conversely a small farm surrounding the owner's dwelling is called a smallholding and is generally focused on self-sufficiency with only the surplus being sold
== farm equipment ==
farm equipment has evolved over the centuries from simple hand tools such as the hoe through ox- or horse-drawn equipment such as the plough and harrow to the modern highly-technical machinery such as the tractor baler and combine harvester replacing what was a highly labour-intensive occupation before the industrial revolution today much of the farm equipment used on both small and large farms is automated (e.g using satellite guided farming)
as new types of high-tech farm equipment have become inaccessible to farmers that historically fixed their own equipment wired reports there is a growing backlash due mostly to companies using intellectual property law to prevent farmers from having the legal right to fix their equipment (or gain access to the information to allow them to do it) this has encouraged groups such as open source ecology and farm hack to begin to make open source hardware for agricultural machinery in addition on a smaller scale farmbot and the reprap open source 3d printer community has begun to make open-source farm tools available of increasing levels of sophistication
