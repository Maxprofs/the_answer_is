reversible inhibitors
types reversible inhibitors
reversible inhibitors attach enzymes noncovalent interactions hydrogen bonds hydrophobic interactions ionic bonds multiple weak bonds inhibitor active site combine produce strong specific binding contrast substrates irreversible inhibitors reversible inhibitors generally undergo chemical reactions bound enzyme easily removed dilution dialysis
four kinds reversible enzyme inhibitors classified according effect varying concentration enzymes substrate inhibitor
competitive inhibition substrate inhibitor cannot bind enzyme time shown figure right usually results inhibitor affinity active site enzyme substrate also binds substrate inhibitor compete access enzymes active site type inhibition overcome sufficiently high concentrations substrate vmax remains constant ie outcompeting inhibitor however apparent km increase takes higher concentration substrate reach km point half vmax competitive inhibitors often similar structure real substrate see examples
uncompetitive inhibition inhibitor binds substrateenzyme complex confused noncompetitive inhibitors type inhibition causes vmax decrease maximum velocity decreases result removing activated complex km decrease due better binding efficiency result le chateliers principle effective elimination es complex thus decreasing km indicates higher binding affinity
noncompetitive inhibition binding inhibitor enzyme reduces activity affect binding substrate result extent inhibition depends concentration inhibitor vmax decrease due inability reaction proceed efficiently km remain actual binding substrate definition still function properly
mixed inhibition inhibitor bind enzyme time enzymes substrate however binding inhibitor affects binding substrate vice versa type inhibition reduced overcome increasing concentrations substrate although possible mixedtype inhibitors bind active site type inhibition generally results allosteric effect inhibitor binds different site enzyme inhibitor binding allosteric site changes conformation ie tertiary structure threedimensional shape enzyme affinity substrate active site reduced
quantitative description reversible inhibition

enzyme multiple substrates inhibitors show different types inhibition depending substrate considered results active site containing two different binding sites within active site one substrate example inhibitor might compete substrate first binding site noncompetitive inhibitor respect substrate b second binding site
measuring dissociation constants reversible inhibitor
noted enzyme inhibitor characterised two dissociation constants ki ki enzyme enzymesubstrate complex respectively enzymeinhibitor constant ki measured directly various methods one extremely accurate method isothermal titration calorimetry inhibitor titrated solution enzyme heat released absorbed measured however dissociation constant ki difficult measure directly since enzymesubstrate complex shortlived undergoing chemical reaction form product hence ki usually measured indirectly observing enzyme activity various substrate inhibitor concentrations fitting data modified michaelismenten equation
modifying factors defined inhibitor concentration two dissociation constants
thus presence inhibitor enzymes effective km vmax become km vmax respectively however modified michaelismenten equation assumes binding inhibitor enzyme reached equilibrium may slow process inhibitors subnanomolar dissociation constants cases usually practical treat tightbinding inhibitor irreversible inhibitor see however still possible estimate ki kinetically ki measured independently
