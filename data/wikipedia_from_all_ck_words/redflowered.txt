corymbia ficifolia or the red flowering gum also known as albany red flowering gum (previously known as eucalyptus ficifolia) is one of the most commonly planted ornamental trees in the broader eucalyptus family
in 2009 parra-o and colleagues published a combined analysis of nuclear rdna (ets + its) and morphological characters published to clarify relationships within the genus corymbia c ficifolia was shown to comprise a natural group with two other western australian species c calophylla and c haematoxylon they classified the group as section calophyllae within the subgenus corymbia
== distribution ==
it is native to a very small area of south coastal western australia (measured in just tens of kilometres) to the east of walpole (430 km southeast of perth) but is not considered under threat in the wild
== cultivation and uses ==
in nature corymbia ficifolia prefers infertile sandy soils but it is readily adaptable to most temperate locations provided it is not exposed to severe frost or sustained tropical damp it is an ideal street tree as it is hardy moderately fast growing and rarely grows large enough to require pruning the largest known single-stemmed tree of this species in the world (216.5 cm diameter) is located on princes street in hamilton new zealand because of its big and lovely colourful flowers genetic improvement for cold resistance in dublin area in ireland is being carrying out by collecting seeds from western and southern australia in the coldest parts of australia where it grows in ireland most of the plants were killed by severe frosts but the surviving shoots have been kept by tissue culture
it is difficult to graft but grows well from seed typically taking about 7 years before it flowers for the first time and 1520 years to reach something approaching its full size of anything between 28 m for the home gardener buying a red flowering gum from a nursery is something of a gamble it may or may not be a ficifolia and the flower colour does not breed true - there is no way to find out what colour the flowers will be short of planting a seedling and waiting for it to reach maturity
== corymbia similarities ==
corymbia ficifolia is a close relative of the west australian marri or port gregory gum (corymbia calophylla) the marri is widespread in southern wa although in the wild it can grow much larger than corymbia ficifolia (up to 50 m tall) under cultivation this size is rare
the two species can be very difficult to tell apart there is no single reliable method it is generally necessary to consider a range of factors to be aware that they crossbreed readily and to recall that species is an artificial human concept that nature does not always obey
corymbia calophylla tends to have
white to pink flowers but varies a great deal
tends to lighter bark
prolific flowering
buds generally green
leaves often broader relative to length (but very variable)
corymbia ficifolia
tends to have orange to red flowers but can be almost white pink or deep crimson
tends to have darker bark
very prolific flowering
buds can be any colour pink reddish pale or green
leaves tend to be longer relative to width
most individual examples are clearly one species or the other but even experts cannot always tell the difference particularly as many cultivated trees are crossbreeds
== flowering ==
the common name red flowering gum is often used but generally not to indicate corymbia ficifolia in particular as opposed to it and other similar looking trees the name is also something of a misnomer all gums flower many are red corymbia ficifolia is not really a gum but a bloodwood and its flowers can be any shade between pale cream through pink to red orange or deep crimson
both species are unusual in that they mainly grow only in spring which means that the flower heads (which blossom in late summer) are outside the bulk of the foliage and very visible both species share the habit of flowering heavily only every second year typically parts of a given tree will flower one year and other parts the next but this varies greatly in typical corymbia fashion each individual tree seems to have its own particular habits
along with nuytsia floribunda blossoms of the tree regularly correlate with summer solstice and christmas season in trees growing in metropolitan perth
