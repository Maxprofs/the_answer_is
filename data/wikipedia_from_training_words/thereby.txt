therapy (often abbreviated tx or tx) is the attempted remediation of a health problem usually following a diagnosis in the medical field it is usually synonymous with treatment (also abbreviated tx) among psychologists and other mental health professionals including psychiatrists psychiatric nurse practitioners and clinical social workers the term may refer specifically to psychotherapy (sometimes dubbed talking therapy') the english word therapy comes via latin therapa from greek and literally means curing or healing
as a rule each therapy has indications and contraindications
== semantic fieldedit ==
the words care therapy treatment and intervention overlap in a semantic field and thus they can be synonymous depending on context moving rightward through that order the connotative level of holism decreases and the level of specificity (to concrete instances) increases thus in health care contexts (where its senses are always noncount) the word care tends to imply a broad idea of everything done to protect or improve someone's health (for example as in the terms preventive care and primary care which connote ongoing action) although it sometimes implies a narrower idea (for example in the simplest cases of wound care or postanesthesia care a few particular steps are sufficient and the patient's interaction with that provider is soon finished) in contrast the word intervention tends to be specific and concrete and thus the word is often countable for example one instance of cardiac catheterization is one intervention performed and coronary care (noncount) can require a series of interventions (count) at the extreme the piling on of such countable interventions amounts to interventionism a flawed model of care lacking holistic circumspectionmerely treating discrete problems (in billable increments) rather than maintaining health therapy and treatment in the middle of the semantic field can connote either the holism of care or the discreteness of intervention with context conveying the intent in each use accordingly they can be used in both noncount and count senses (for example therapy for chronic kidney disease can involve several dialysis treatments per week)
the words aceology and iamatology are obscure and obsolete synonyms referring to the study of therapies
== types of therapiesedit ==
=== by chronology priority or intensityedit ===
==== levels of careedit ====
levels of care classify health care into categories of chronology priority or intensity as follows
emergency care handles medical emergencies and is a first point of contact or intake for less serious problems which can be referred to other levels of care as appropriate
intensive care also called critical care is care for extremely ill or injured patients it thus requires high resource intensity knowledge and skill as well as quick decision making
ambulatory care is care provided on an outpatient basis typically patients can walk into and out of the clinic under their own power (hence ambulatory") usually on the same day
home care is care at home including care from providers (such as physicians nurses and home health aides) making house calls care from caregivers such as family members and patient self-care
primary care is meant to be the main kind of care in general and ideally a medical home that unifies care across referred providers
secondary care is care provided by medical specialists and other health professionals who generally do not have first contact with patients for example cardiologists urologists and dermatologists a patient reaches secondary care as a next step from primary care typically by provider referral although sometimes by patient self-initiative
tertiary care is specialized consultative care usually for inpatients and on referral from a primary or secondary health professional in a facility that has personnel and facilities for advanced medical investigation and treatment such as a tertiary referral hospital
end-of-life care is care near the end of one's life it often includes the following
palliative care is supportive care most especially (but not necessarily) near the end of life
hospice care is palliative care very near the end of life when cure is very unlikely its main goal is comfort both physical and mental
==== lines of therapyedit ====
treatment decisions often follow formal or informal algorithmic guidelines treatment options can often be ranked or prioritized into lines of therapy first-line therapy second-line therapy third-line therapy and so on first-line therapy (sometimes called induction therapy primary therapy or front-line therapy) is the first therapy that will be tried its priority over other options is usually either (1) formally recommended on the basis of clinical trial evidence for its best-available combination of efficacy safety and tolerability or (2) chosen based on the clinical experience of the physician if a first-line therapy either fails to resolve the issue or produces intolerable side effects additional (second-line) therapies may be substituted or added to the treatment regimen followed by third-line therapies and so on
an example of a context in which the formalization of treatment algorithms and the ranking of lines of therapy is very extensive is chemotherapy regimens because of the great difficulty in successfully treating some forms of cancer one line after another may be tried in oncology the count of therapy lines may reach 10 or even 20
often multiple therapies may be tried simultaneously (combination therapy or polytherapy) thus combination chemotherapy is also called polychemotherapy whereas chemotherapy with one agent at a time is called single-agent therapy or monotherapy
adjuvant therapy is therapy given in addition to the primary main or initial treatment but simultaneously (as opposed to second-line therapy) neoadjuvant therapy is therapy that is begun before the main therapy thus one can consider surgical excision of a tumor as the first-line therapy for a certain type and stage of cancer even though radiotherapy is used before it the radiotherapy is neoadjuvant (chronologically first but not primary in the sense of the main event)
step therapy or stepladder therapy is a specific type of prioritization by lines of therapy it is controversial in american health care because unlike conventional decision-making about what constitutes first-line second-line and third-line therapy which in the u.s reflects safety and efficacy first and cost only according to the patient's wishes step therapy attempts to mix cost containment by someone other than the patient (third-party payers) into the algorithm therapy freedom and the negotiation between individual and group rights are involved
