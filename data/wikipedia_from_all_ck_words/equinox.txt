an equinox is an astronomical event in which the imaginary plane of earth's equator passes the center of the sun making night and day of approximately equal length all over the planet the equinoxes are the only times when the solar terminator (the edge between night and day) is perpendicular to the equator as a result the northern and southern hemispheres are equally illuminated
in other words the equinoxes are the only times when the subsolar point is on the equator meaning that the sun is exactly overhead at a point on the equatorial line equinoxes occur twice a year around 21 march and 23 september the subsolar point crosses the equator moving northward at the march equinox and southward at the september equinox
the equinoxes along with solstices are directly related to the seasons of the year in the northern hemisphere the vernal equinox (march) conventionally marks the beginning of spring in most cultures and the autumnal equinox (september) marks the beginning of autumn in the southern hemisphere the vernal equinox occurs in september and the autumnal equinox in march
== terminologyedit ==
the oldest meaning of the word equinox is the day when daytime and night are of approximately equal duration the word equinox comes from this definition derived from the latin aequinoctium aequus (equal) and nox (genitive noctis) (night) the equinox is not exactly the same as the day when period of daytime and night are of equal length for two reasons first sunrise which begins daytime occurs when the top of the sun's disk rises above the eastern horizon at that instant the disk's center is still below the horizon second earth's atmosphere refracts sunlight as a result an observer sees daylight before the sun's disk rises above the horizon geometrically to avoid this ambiguity the word equilux is sometimes used to mean a day on which the periods of daylight and night are equal times of sunset and sunrise vary with an observer's location (longitude and latitude) so the dates when day and night are closest together in length depend on location

=== dateedit ===
when julius caesar established his calendar in 45 bc he set 25 march as the spring equinox because a julian year (365.25 days) is slightly longer than the tropical year the calendar drifted with respect to the equinox such that the equinox was occurring on about 21 march in ad 300 and by ad 1500 it had reached 11 march
this drift induced pope gregory xiii to create a modern gregorian calendar the pope wanted to continue to conform with the edicts concerning the date of easter of the council of nicaea of ad 325 which means he wanted to move the vernal equinox to 21 march which is the day allocated to it in the easter table of the julian calendar however the leap year intervals in his calendar were not smooth (400 is not an exact multiple of 97) this causes the equinox to oscillate by about 53 hours around its mean position this in turn raised the possibility that it could fall on 22 march and thus easter day might theoretically commence before the equinox the astronomers chose the appropriate number of days to omit so that the equinox would swing from 19 to 21 march but never fall on the 22nd (although it can in a handful of years fall early in the morning of that day in the far east)
=== namesedit ===
spring equinox and fall equinox colloquial names based on the seasons however these can be ambiguous since the northern hemisphere's spring is the southern hemisphere's fall and vice versa the latinate names vernal equinox (spring) and autumnal equinox (fall) are often used to the same effect
march equinox and september equinox names referring to the months of the year they occur with no ambiguity as to which hemisphere is the context they are still not universal however as not all cultures use a solar-based calendar where the equinoxes occur every year in the same month (as they do not in the islamic calendar and hebrew calendar for example)
northward equinox and southward equinox names referring to the apparent direction of motion of the sun the northward equinox occurs in march when the sun crosses the equator from south to north and the southward equinox occurs in september when the sun crosses the equator from north to south these terms can be used unambiguously for other planets
first point of aries and first point of libra names referring to the astrological signs the sun is entering due to the precession of the equinoxes however the constellations where the equinoxes are currently located are pisces and virgo respectively
=== length of equinoctial day and nightedit ===
on the day of the equinox the center of the sun spends a roughly equal amount of time above and below the horizon at every location on the earth so night and day are about the same length the word equinox derives from the latin words aequus (equal) and nox (night) in reality the day is longer than the night at an equinox day is usually defined as the period when sunlight reaches the ground in the absence of local obstacles from the earth the sun appears as a disc rather than a point of light so when the center of the sun is below the horizon its upper edge is visible furthermore the atmosphere refracts light so even when the upper limb of the sun is 0.4 degrees below the horizon its rays curve over the horizon to the ground in sunrise/sunset tables the assumed semidiameter (apparent radius) of the sun is 16 minutes of arc and the atmospheric refraction is assumed to be 34 minutes of arc their combination means that when the upper limb of sun is on the visible horizon its center is 50 minutes of arc below the geometric horizon which is the intersection with the celestial sphere of a horizontal plane through the eye of the observer these effects make the day about 14 minutes longer than the night at the equator and longer still towards the poles the real equality of day and night only happens in places far enough from the equator to have a seasonal difference in day length of at least 7 minutes actually occurring a few days towards the winter side of each equinox
because the sun is a spherical (rather than a single-point) source of light the actual crossing of the sun over the equator takes approximately 33 hours
at the equinoxes the rate of change for the length of daylight and night-time is the greatest at the poles the equinox marks the start of the transition from 24 hours of nighttime to 24 hours of daylight (or vice versa) far north of the arctic circle at longyearbyen svalbard norway there is an additional 15 minutes more daylight every day about the time of the spring equinox whereas in singapore (which is just one degree of latitude north of the equator) the amount of daylight in each daytime varies by just a few seconds
=== geocentric view of the astronomical seasonsedit ===
in the half-year centered on the june solstice the sun rises north of east and sets north of west which means longer days with shorter nights for the northern hemisphere and shorter days with longer nights for the southern hemisphere in the half-year centered on the december solstice the sun rises south of east and sets south of west and the durations of day and night are reversed
also on the day of an equinox the sun rises everywhere on earth (except at the poles) at about 06:00 and sets at about 18:00 (local time) these times are not exact for several reasons
the sun is much larger in diameter than the earth so that more than half of the earth could be in sunlight at any one time (due to unparallel rays creating tangent points beyond an equal-day-night line)
most places on earth use a time zone which differs from the local solar time by minutes or even hours for example if the sun rises at 07:00 on the equinox it will set 12 hours later at 19:00
even people whose time zone is equal to local solar time will not see sunrise and sunset at 06:00 and 18:00 this is due to the variable speed and the inclination of the earth's orbit and is described as the equation of time it has different values for the march and september equinoxes (+8 and 8 minutes respectively)
sunrise and sunset are commonly defined for the upper limb of the solar disk rather than its center the upper limb is already up for at least a minute before the center appears and the upper limb likewise sets later than the center of the solar disk also when the sun is near the horizon atmospheric refraction shifts its apparent position above its true position by a little more than its own diameter this makes sunrise more than two minutes earlier and sunset an equal amount later these two effects combine to make the equinox day 12 h 7 min long and the night only 11 h 53 min note however that these numbers are only true for the tropics for moderate latitudes the discrepancy increases (e.g. 12 minutes in london) and closer to the poles it becomes very much larger (in terms of time) up to about 100 km from either pole the sun is up for a full 24 hours on an equinox day
night includes twilight if dawn and dusk are instead considered daytime the day would be almost 13 hours near the equator and longer at higher latitudes
height of the horizon changes the day's length for an observer atop a mountain the day is longer while standing in a valley will shorten the day
==== day arcs of the sunedit ====
some of the statements above can be made clearer by picturing the day arc (i.e. the path the sun tracks along the celestial dome in its diurnal movement) the pictures show this for every hour on equinox day in addition some ghost suns are also indicated below the horizon up to 18 below it the sun in such areas still causes twilight the depictions presented below can be used for both the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere the observer is understood to be sitting near the tree on the island depicted in the middle of the ocean the green arrows give cardinal directions
in the northern hemisphere north is to the left the sun rises in the east (far arrow) culminates in the south (right arrow) while moving to the right and setting in the west (near arrow)
in the southern hemisphere south is to the left the sun rises in the east (near arrow) culminates in the north (right arrow) while moving to the left and setting in the west (far arrow)
the following special cases are depicted
=== celestial coordinate systemsedit ===
the vernal equinox occurs in march about when the sun crosses the celestial equator south to north the term vernal point is used for the time of this occurrence and for the direction in space where the sun is seen at that time which is the origin of some celestial coordinate systems
in the ecliptic coordinate system the vernal point is the origin of the ecliptic longitude
in the equatorial coordinate system the vernal point is the origin of the right ascension
strictly speaking at the equinox the sun's ecliptic longitude is zero its latitude will not be exactly zero since the earth is not exactly in the plane of the ecliptic its declination will not be exactly zero either (the ecliptic is defined by the center of mass of the earth and moon combined.) the modern definition of equinox is the instants when the sun's apparent geocentric longitude is 0 (northward equinox) or 180 (southward equinox) see the diagram to the right
because of the precession of the earth's axis the position of the vernal point on the celestial sphere changes over time and the equatorial and the ecliptic coordinate systems change accordingly thus when specifying celestial coordinates for an object one has to specify at what time the vernal point and the celestial equator are taken that reference time is called the equinox of date
the autumnal equinox is at ecliptic longitude 180 and at right ascension 12h
the upper culmination of the vernal point is considered the start of the sidereal day for the observer the hour angle of the vernal point is by definition the observer's sidereal time
the same is true in western tropical astrology the vernal equinox is the first point (i.e the start) of the sign of aries in this system it is of no significance that the equinoxes shift over time with respect to the fixed stars
using the current official iau constellation boundaries and taking into account the variable precession speed and the rotation of the ecliptic the equinoxes shift through the constellations as follows (expressed in astronomical year numbering in which the year 0 = 1 bc 1 = 2 bc etc.)
the march equinox passed from taurus into aries in year 1865 passed into pisces in year 67 will pass into aquarius in year 2597 will pass into capricornus in year 4312 it passed along (but not into) a corner of cetus on 010 distance in year 1489
the september equinox passed from libra into virgo in year 729 will pass into leo in year 2439
=== cultural aspectsedit ===
a number of traditional spring and autumn (harvest) festivals are celebrated on the date of the equinoxes
== equinoxes of other planetsedit ==
equinox is a phenomenon that can occur on any planet with a significant tilt to its rotational axis most dramatic of these is saturn where the equinox places its normally majestic ring system edge-on facing the sun as a result they are visible only as a thin line when seen from earth when seen from above a view seen by humans during an equinox for the first time from the cassini space probe in 2009 they receive very little sunshine indeed more planetshine than light from the sun
this lack of sunshine occurs once every 14.7 years it can last a few weeks before and after the exact equinox the most recent exact equinox for saturn was on 11 august 2009 its next equinox will take place on 30 april 2024
one effect of equinoctial periods is the temporary disruption of communications satellites for all geostationary satellites there are a few days around the equinox when the sun goes directly behind the satellite relative to earth (i.e within the beam-width of the ground-station antenna) for a short period each day the sun's immense power and broad radiation spectrum overload the earth station's reception circuits with noise and depending on antenna size and other factors temporarily disrupt or degrade the circuit the duration of those effects varies but can range from a few minutes to an hour (for a given frequency band a larger antenna has a narrower beam-width and hence experiences shorter duration sun outage windows.)
