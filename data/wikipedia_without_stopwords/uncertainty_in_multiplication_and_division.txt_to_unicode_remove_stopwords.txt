subscript gives symbol dummy variable case called index multiplication together lower bound whereas superscript gives upper bound lower upper bound expressions denoting integers factors product obtained taking expression following product operator successive integer values substituted index multiplication starting lower bound incremented including upper bound example
generally notation defined
m n integers expressions evaluate integers case m n value product single factor xm m n product empty product value
infinite productsedit
one may also consider products infinitely many terms called infinite products notationally would replace n lemniscate product series defined limit product first n terms n grows without bound definition
one similarly replace m negative infinity define

propertiesedit
real complex numbers includes example natural numbers integers fractions multiplication certain properties
commutative property
order two numbers multiplied matter
associative property
expressions solely involving multiplication addition invariant respect order operations
distributive property
holds respect multiplication addition identity prime importance simplifying algebraic expressions
identity element
multiplicative identity anything multiplied one known identity property
property zero
number multiplied zero zero known zero property multiplication
negation
negative one times number equal additive inverse number
negative one times negative one positive one
natural numbers include negative numbers
inverse element
every number x except zero multiplicative inverse
order preservation
multiplication positive number preserves order
b c ab ac
multiplication negative number reverses order
b c ab ac
complex numbers order predicate
mathematical systems include multiplication operation may properties example multiplication general commutative matrices quaternions
axiomsedit

sy represents successor y natural number follows y various properties like associativity proved axioms peano arithmetic including induction instance denoted multiplicative identity
axioms integers typically define equivalence classes ordered pairs natural numbers model based treating xy equivalent xy x y treated integers thus equivalent multiplication axiom integers defined way

multiplication extended similar way rational numbers real numbers
multiplication set theoryedit
product nonnegative integers defined set theory using cardinal numbers peano axioms see extend multiplying arbitrary integers arbitrary rational numbers product real numbers defined terms products rational numbers see construction real numbers
multiplication group theoryedit
many sets operation multiplication satisfy axioms define group structure axioms closure associativity inclusion identity element inverses
simple example set nonzero rational numbers identity opposed groups addition identity typically note rationals must exclude zero multiplication inverse rational number multiplied zero result example abelian group always case
see look set invertible square matrices given dimension given field straightforward verify closure associativity inclusion identity identity matrix inverses however matrix multiplication commutative therefore group nonabelian
another fact note integers multiplication group even exclude zero easily seen nonexistence inverse elements
multiplication group theory typically notated either dot juxtaposition omission operation symbol elements multiplying element element b could notated b ab referring group via indication set operation dot used eg first example could indicated
