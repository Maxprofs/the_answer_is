relative humidity
relative humidity airwater mixture defined ratio partial pressure water vapor ho mixture saturated vapor pressure water given temperature thus relative humidity air function water content temperature
relative humidity normally expressed percentage calculated using following equation
relative humidity important metric used weather forecasts reports indicator likelihood precipitation dew fog hot summer weather rise relative humidity increases apparent temperature humans animals hindering evaporation perspiration skin example according heat index relative humidity f c would feel like f f c c relative humidity
specific humidity
specific humidity moisture content ratio water vapor mass air parcels total ie including dry mass sometimes referred humidity ratio specific humidity approximately equal mixing ratio defined ratio mass water vapor air parcel mass dry air parcel
specific humidity defined

measurement
various devices used measure regulate humidity device used measure humidity called psychrometer hygrometer humidistat humiditytriggered switch often used control dehumidifier
humidity also measured global scale using remotely placed satellites satellites able detect concentration water troposphere altitudes kilometers satellites measure water vapor sensors sensitive infrared radiation water vapor specifically absorbs reradiates radiation spectral band satellite water vapor imagery plays important role monitoring climate conditions like formation thunderstorms development future weather forecasts
climate
humidity climate variable also interacts strongly climate variables humidity affected winds rainfall time humidity affects energy budget thereby influences temperatures two major ways first water vapor atmosphere contains latent energy transpiration evaporation latent heat removed surface liquid cooling earths surface biggest nonradiative cooling effect surface compensates roughly average net radiative warming surface
second water vapor abundant greenhouse gases water vapor like green lens allows green light pass absorbs red light selective absorber along greenhouse gases water vapor transparent solar energy literally see absorbs infrared energy emitted radiated upward earths surface reason humid areas experience little nocturnal cooling dry desert regions cool considerably night selective absorption causes greenhouse effect raises surface temperature substantially theoretical radiative equilibrium temperature sun water vapor cause warming greenhouse gas
unlike greenhouse gases however water merely boiling point regions earth freezing point many altitudes condensible greenhouse gas precipitates much lower scale height shorter atmospheric lifetime weeks instead decades without greenhouse gases earths blackbody temperature freezing point water would cause water vapor removed atmosphere water vapor thus slave noncondensible greenhouse gases

air density volume
humidity depends water vaporization condensation turn mainly depends temperature therefore applying pressure gas saturated water components initially decrease volume approximately according ideal gas law however water condense returning almost humidity giving resulting total volume deviating ideal gas law predicted conversely decreasing temperature would also make water condense making final volume deviate predicted ideal gas law therefore gas volume may alternatively expressed dry volume excluding humidity content fraction accurately follows ideal gas law contrary saturated volume volume gas mixture would humidity added saturation relative humidity

gas given temperature pressure number molecules present particular volume constant see ideal gas law water molecules vapor introduced volume dry air number air molecules volume must decrease number temperature pressure remain constant addition water molecules molecules gas without removal equal number molecules necessarily require change temperature pressure total volume change least one three parameters temperature pressure remain constant volume increases dry air molecules displaced initially move additional volume mixture eventually become uniform diffusion hence mass per unit volume gasits densitydecreases isaac newton discovered phenomenon wrote book opticks
