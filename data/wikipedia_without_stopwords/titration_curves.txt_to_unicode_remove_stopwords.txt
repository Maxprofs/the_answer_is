titrations often recorded graphs called titration curves generally contain volume titrant independent variable ph solution dependent variable changes depending composition two solutions
equivalence point graph starting solution usually acid neutralized titrant usually base calculated precisely finding second derivative titration curve computing points inflection graph changes concavity however cases simple visual inspection curve suffice curve given right equivalence points visible roughly ml naoh solution titrated oxalic acid solution calculate acid dissociation constant pka one must find volume halfequivalence point half amount titrant added form next compound sodium hydrogen oxalate disodium oxalate halfway equivalence point ml ml ph observed giving pka
monoprotic acids point halfway beginning curve titrant added equivalence point significant point concentrations two species acid conjugate base equal therefore hendersonhasselbalch equation solved manner
therefore one easily find pka monoprotic acid finding ph point halfway beginning curve equivalence point solving simplified equation case sample curve ka would approximately visual inspection actual ka
polyprotic acids calculating acid dissociation constants marginally difficult first acid dissociation constant calculated way would calculated monoprotic acid second acid dissociation constant however point halfway first equivalence point second equivalence point acids release two protons phosphoric acid
