plant hormones also known phytohormones chemicals regulate plant growth uk termed plant growth substances
plant hormones signal molecules produced within plant occur extremely low concentrations hormones regulate cellular processes targeted cells locally moved locations functional part plant hormones also determine formation flowers stems leaves shedding leaves development ripening fruit plants unlike animals lack glands produce secrete hormones instead cell capable producing hormones plant hormones shape plant affecting seed growth time flowering sex flowers senescence leaves fruits affect tissues grow upward grow downward leaf formation stem growth fruit development ripening plant longevity even plant death hormones vital plant growth lacking plants would mostly mass undifferentiated cells also known growth factors growth hormones term phytohormone coined thimann
phytohormones found higher plants algae showing similar functions microorganisms like fungi bacteria case play hormonal immediate physiological role producing organism thus regarded secondary metabolites
characteristics
word hormone derived greek meaning set motion plant hormones affect gene expression transcription levels cellular division growth naturally produced within plants though similar chemicals produced fungi bacteria also affect plant growth large number related chemical compounds synthesized humans used regulate growth cultivated plants weeds vitrogrown plants plant cells manmade compounds called plant growth regulators pgrs short early study plant hormones phytohormone commonly used term use less widely applied
plant hormones nutrients chemicals small amounts promote influence growth development differentiation cells tissues biosynthesis plant hormones within plant tissues often diffuse always localized plants lack glands produce store hormones unlike animals two circulatory systems lymphatic cardiovascular powered heart moves fluids around body plants use passive means move chemicals around plant plants utilize simple chemicals hormones move easily plants tissues often produced used local basis within plant body plant cells produce hormones affect even different regions cell producing hormone
hormones transported within plant utilizing four types movements localized movement cytoplasmic streaming within cells slow diffusion ions molecules cells utilized vascular tissues used move hormones one part plant another include sieve tubes phloem move sugars leaves roots flowers xylem moves water mineral solutes roots foliage
