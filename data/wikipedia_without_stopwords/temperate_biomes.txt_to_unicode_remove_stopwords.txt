sources damage
dna damage subdivided two main types
endogenous damage attack reactive oxygen species produced normal metabolic byproducts spontaneous mutation especially process oxidative deamination
also includes replication errors
exogenous damage caused external agents

types damage
several types damage dna due endogenous cellular processes
oxidation bases eg oxodihydroguanine oxog generation dna strand interruptions reactive oxygen species
alkylation bases usually methylation formation methylguanosine methyladenine omethylguanine
hydrolysis bases deamination depurination depyrimidination
bulky adduct formation ie benzoapyrene diol epoxidedg adduct aristolactam ida adduct
mismatch bases due errors dna replication wrong dna base stitched place newly forming dna strand dna base skipped mistakenly inserted
monoadduct damage cause change single nitrogenous base dna
diadduct damage
