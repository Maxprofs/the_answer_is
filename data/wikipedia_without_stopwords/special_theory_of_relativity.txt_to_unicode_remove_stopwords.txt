defining feature special relativity replacement galilean transformations newtonian mechanics lorentz transformations time space cannot defined separately rather space time interwoven single continuum known spacetime events occur time one observer could occur different times another
theory special applies special case curvature spacetime due gravity negligible order include gravity einstein formulated general relativity special relativity contrary outdated descriptions capable handling accelerated frames reference
galilean relativity considered approximation special relativity valid low speeds special relativity considered approximation general relativity valid weak gravitational fields ie sufficiently small scale conditions free fall whereas general relativity incorporates noneuclidean geometry order represent gravitational effects geometric curvature spacetime special relativity restricted flat spacetime known minkowski space locally lorentzinvariant frame abides special relativity defined sufficiently small scales even curved spacetime
galileo galilei already postulated absolute welldefined state rest privileged reference frames principle called galileos principle relativity einstein extended principle accounted constant speed light phenomenon recently observed michelsonmorley experiment also postulated holds laws physics including laws mechanics electrodynamics
postulatesedit
einstein discerned two fundamental propositions seemed assured regardless exact validity known laws either mechanics electrodynamics propositions constancy speed light independence physical laws especially constancy speed light choice inertial system initial presentation special relativity expressed postulates
principle relativity laws states physical systems undergo change affected whether changes state referred one two systems uniform translatory motion relative
principle invariant light speed light always propagated empty space definite velocity speed c independent state motion emitting body preface light vacuum propagates speed c fixed constant independent direction least one system inertial coordinates stationary system regardless state motion light source
derivation special relativity depends two explicit postulates also several tacit assumptions made almost theories physics including isotropy homogeneity space independence measuring rods clocks past history
following einsteins original presentation special relativity many different sets postulates proposed various alternative derivations however common set postulates remains employed einstein original paper mathematical statement principle relativity made later einstein introduces concept simplicity mentioned
special principle relativity system coordinates k chosen relation physical laws hold good simplest form laws hold good relation system coordinates k moving uniform translation relatively k
henri poincar provided mathematical framework relativity theory proving lorentz transformations subset poincar group symmetry transformations einstein later derived transformations axioms
many einsteins papers present derivations lorentz transformation based upon two principles
einstein consistently based derivation lorentz invariance essential core special relativity two basic principles relativity lightspeed invariance wrote
insight fundamental special theory relativity assumptions relativity light speed invariance compatible relations new type lorentz transformation postulated conversion coordinates times events universal principle special theory relativity contained postulate laws physics invariant respect lorentz transformations transition one inertial system arbitrarily chosen inertial system restricting principle natural laws
thus many modern treatments special relativity base single postulate universal lorentz covariance equivalently single postulate minkowski spacetime
principle relativity alone without assuming constancy speed light ie using isotropy space symmetry implied principle special relativity one show spacetime transformations inertial frames either euclidean galilean lorentzian lorentzian case one obtain relativistic interval conservation certain finite limiting speed experiments suggest speed speed light vacuum
constancy speed light motivated maxwells theory electromagnetism lack evidence luminiferous ether conflicting evidence extent einstein influenced null result michelsonmorley experiment case null result michelsonmorley experiment helped notion constancy speed light gain widespread rapid acceptance
lack absolute reference frameedit
principle relativity states preferred inertial reference frame dates back galileo incorporated newtonian physics however late th century existence electromagnetic waves led physicists suggest universe filled substance called aether would act medium waves vibrations travelled aether thought constitute absolute reference frame speeds could measured could considered fixed motionless aether supposedly possessed wonderful properties sufficiently elastic support electromagnetic waves waves could interact matter yet offered resistance bodies passing results various experiments including michelsonmorley experiment led theory special relativity showing aether einsteins solution discard notion aether absolute state rest relativity reference frame moving uniform motion observe laws physics particular speed light vacuum always measured c even measured multiple systems moving different constant velocities
reference frames coordinates lorentz transformationedit
reference frames play crucial role relativity theory term reference frame used observational perspective space undergoing change motion acceleration position measured along spatial axes addition reference frame ability determine measurements time events using clock reference device uniform periodicity
event occurrence assigned single unique time location space relative reference frame point spacetime since speed light constant relativity every reference frame pulses light used unambiguously measure distances refer back times events occurred clock even though light takes time reach clock event transpired
example explosion firecracker may considered event completely specify event four spacetime coordinates time occurrence dimensional spatial location define reference point lets call reference frame
relativity theory often want calculate position point different reference point
suppose second reference frame whose spatial axes clock exactly coincide time zero moving constant velocity v respect along xaxis
since absolute reference frame relativity theory concept moving doesnt strictly exist everything always moving respect reference frame instead two frames move speed direction said comoving therefore comoving
define event spacetime coordinates txyz system txyz lorentz transformation specifies coordinates related following way
lorentz factor c speed light vacuum velocity v parallel xaxis y z coordinates unaffected x coordinates transformed lorentz transformations form oneparameter group linear mappings parameter called rapidity
nothing special xaxis transformation apply y z axes indeed direction done directions parallel motion warped factor perpendicular see main article details
quantity invariant lorentz transformations known lorentz scalar
writing lorentz transformation inverse terms coordinate differences instance one event coordinates x x another event coordinates x x differences defined
get
effects merely appearances explicitly related way measuring time intervals events occur place given coordinate system called colocal events time intervals different another coordinate system moving respect first unless events also simultaneous similarly effects also relate measured distances separated simultaneous events given coordinate system choice events colocal separated distance space occur spatial distance seen another moving coordinate system however spacetime interval observers underlying reality remains perspective changes
consequences derived lorentz transformationedit
consequences special relativity derived lorentz transformation equations transformations hence special relativity lead different physical predictions newtonian mechanics relative velocities become comparable speed light speed light much larger anything humans encounter effects predicted relativity initially counterintuitive
relativity simultaneityedit
two events happening two different locations occur simultaneously reference frame one inertial observer may occur nonsimultaneously reference frame another inertial observer lack absolute simultaneity
first equation lorentz transformation terms coordinate differences
clear two events simultaneous frame satisfying necessarily simultaneous another inertial frame satisfying events additionally colocal frame satisfying x simultaneous another frame
time dilationedit
time lapse two events invariant one observer another dependent relative speeds observers reference frames eg twin paradox concerns twin flies spaceship traveling near speed light returns discover twin sibling aged much
suppose clock rest unprimed system location clock two different ticks characterized x find relation times ticks measured systems first equation used find
events satisfying
shows time two ticks seen frame clock moving longer time ticks measured rest frame clock time dilation explains number physical phenomena example decay rate muons produced cosmic rays impinging earths atmosphere
length contractionedit
dimensions eg length object measured one observer may smaller results measurements object made another observer eg ladder paradox involves long ladder traveling near speed light contained within smaller garage
similarly suppose measuring rod rest aligned along xaxis unprimed system system length rod written x measure length rod system clock moving distances x end points rod must measured simultaneously system words measurement characterized combined fourth equation find relation lengths x x
events satisfying
shows length x rod measured frame moving shorter length x rest frame
composition velocitiesedit
velocities speeds simply add observer measures object moving along x axis velocity u observer system frame reference moving velocity v x direction respect measure object moving velocity u lorentz transformations
frame measure
notice object moving speed light system ie u c would also moving speed light system also u v small respect speed light recover intuitive galilean transformation velocities
usual example given train frame traveling due east velocity v respect tracks frame child inside train throws baseball due east velocity u respect train nonrelativistic physics observer rest tracks measure velocity baseball due east u u v special relativity longer true instead velocity baseball due east given second equation u u v uvc nothing special x east directions formalism applies direction considering parallel perpendicular motion direction relative velocity v see main article details

massenergy equivalence consequence special relativity energy momentum separate newtonian mechanics form fourvector relativity relates time component energy space components momentum nontrivial way object rest energymomentum fourvector e time component energy three space components zero changing frames lorentz transformation x direction small value velocity v energy momentum fourvector becomes e evc momentum equal energy multiplied velocity divided c newtonian mass object ratio momentum velocity slow velocities equal ec
energy momentum properties matter radiation impossible deduce form fourvector two basic postulates special relativity dont talk matter radiation talk space time derivation therefore requires additional physical reasoning paper einstein used additional principles newtonian mechanics hold slow velocities one energy scalar one threevector momentum slow velocities conservation law energy momentum exactly true relativity furthermore assumed energy light transformed dopplershift factor frequency previously shown true based maxwells equations first einsteins papers subject inertia body depend upon energy content although einsteins argument paper nearly universally accepted physicists correct even selfevident many authors years suggested wrong authors suggest argument merely inconclusive relied implicit assumptions

diagram interval ab timelike ie frame reference events b occur location space separated occurring different times precedes b frame precedes b frames hypothetically possible matter information travel b causal relationship cause b effect
