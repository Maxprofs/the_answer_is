a safe (also called a strongbox or coffer) is a secure lockable box used for securing valuable objects against theft and/or damage from fire a safe is usually a hollow cuboid or cylinder with one face being removable or hinged to form a door the body and door may be cast from metal (such as steel) or formed out of plastic through blow molding bank teller safes typically are secured to the counter have a slit opening for dropping valuables into the safe without opening it and a time-delay combination lock to foil robbers one significant distinction between types of safes is whether the safe is secured to a wall or structure or if it can be moved around a less secure version (only suitable for petty cash) is usually called a cash-box
== history ==
in 1835 english inventors charles chubb and jeremiah chubb in wolverhampton england received a patent for a burglar-resisting safe and began a production of safes.[1] the chubb brothers had produced locks since 1818 chubb locks was an independent company until 2000 when it was sold to assa abloy
on november 2 1886 inventor henry brown patented a receptacle for storing and preserving papers. the container was fire retardant and accident resistant as it was made from forged metal the box was able to be safely secured with a lock and key and also able to maintain organization by offering different slots to organize important papers
== specifications ==
specifications for safes include some or all of the following parameters
burglar-resistance
fire-resistance
environmental resistance (e.g. to water or dust)
type of lock (e.g. combination key time lock electronic locking)
location (e.g. wall safe floor safe)
smart safes as part of an automated cash handling system
it is often possible to open a safe without access to the key or knowledge of the combination this activity is known as safe-cracking and is a popular theme in heist films
a diversion safe or hidden safe is a safe that is made from an otherwise ordinary object such as a book a candle a can or even a wall outlet plug valuables are placed in these hidden safes which are themselves placed inconspicuously (for example a book would be placed on a book shelf)
fire resistant record protection equipment consists of self-contained devices that incorporate insulated bodies doors drawers or lids or non-rated multi-drawer devices housing individually rated containers that contain one or more inner compartments for storage of records these devices are intended to provide protection to one or more types of records as evidenced by the assigned class rating or ratings class 350 for paper class 150 for microfilm microfiche other and photographic film and class 125 for magnetic media and hard drives
these types of enclosures can be rated for periods of  1 2 and 4 hour durations
in addition these enclosures may be rated for their impact resistance should the safe fall a number of feet to a lower level or have debris fall upon it during a fire
burglary resistant safes are rated as to their resistance to the type of tools to be used in their attack and also the duration of the attack
the attack durations are for periods of 15 min. 30 min and 60 min
safes can also contain hardware that automatically dispenses cash or validates bills as part of an automated cash handling system
== room-sized fireproof vaults ==
for larger volumes of heat-sensitive materials a modular room-sized vault is much more economical than purchasing and storing many fire rated safes typically these room-sized vaults are utilized by corporations government agencies and off-site storage service firms fireproof vaults are rated up to class 125-4 hour for large data storage applications these vaults utilize ceramic fiber a high temperature industrial insulating material as the core of their modular panel system all components of the vault not just the walls and roof panels must be class 125 rated to achieve that overall rating for the vault this includes the door assembly (a double door is needed since there is no single class 125 vault door available) cable penetrations coolant line penetrations (for split hvac systems) and air duct penetrations
there are also class 150 applications (such as microfilm) and class 350 vaults for protecting valuable paper documents like the data-rated (class 125) structures these vault systems employ ceramic fiber insulation and components rated to meet or exceed the required level of protection
in recent years room-sized class 125 vaults have been installed to protect entire data centers as data storage technologies migrate from tape-based storage methods to hard drives this trend is likely to continue
== fire-resistant safes ==
a fire-resistant safe is a type of safe that is designed to protect its contents from high temperatures or actual fire fire resistant safes are usually rated by the amount of time they can withstand the extreme temperatures a fire produces while not exceeding a set internal temperature e.g. less than 350 f (177 c) models are typically available between half-hour and four-hour durations
in the uk the bs en-1047 standard is set aside for data and document safes to determine their ability to withstand prolonged intense heat and impact damage
document safes are designed to maintain an internal temperature no greater than 177 c (351 f) while in a constantly heated environment in excess of 1,000 c (1,830 f)
data safes are designed to maintain an internal temperature no greater than 55 c (131 f) while in a constantly heated environment in excess of 1,000 c (1,830 f)
these conditions are maintained for the duration of the test this is usually at least 30 minutes but can extend to many hours depending on grade both kinds of safe are also tested for impact by dropping from a set height onto a solid surface and then tested for fire survivability once again
in the usa both the writing of standards for fire-resistance and the actual testing of safes is performed by underwriters laboratories
an in-floor safe installed in a concrete floor is very resistant to fire however not all floor safes are watertight and will often fill with water from fire hoses therefore everything stored inside should be placed in either double zip lock bags dry bags or sealed plastic containers
reinforced fireproof cabinets are also used for dangerous chemicals or flammable goods
== wall safes ==
wall safes are designed to provide hidden protection for documents and miscellaneous valuables adjustable depth allows the maximization of usable space when installed in different wall thicknesses some wall safes feature pry resistant recessed doors with concealed hinges for anti-theft protection a painting can be hung over a wall safe to hide it from public view
== jewelry safes ==
jewelry safes are burglary and fire safes made specifically to house jewelry and valuables these high end safes are typically manufactured with interior jewelry chests of fine woods and fabric liners with a range of organizational configurations
== safe-cracking ==
safe cracking is opening a safe without a combination or key there are many methods to safe cracking ranging from brute force methods to guessing the combination the easiest method that can be used on many safes is safe bouncing which involves hitting the safe on top this may cause the locking pin to budge opening the safe
== ul certification for safes ==
underwriters laboratories (ul) testing certifications for safes are known to be the some of the most rigorous and most respected in the world they are only matched by b.t.u/vdma certifications (germany)
j.i.s (japan) and cstb (france) preheat the oven with the safe inside until the temperature reaches the desired setting (as opposed to a sustained temperature of the rating) then the safe is cooled artificially (as opposed to naturally) also j.i.s and cstb only drop their safes from 1315 feet (as opposed to 30) rarely are safes dropped 15 feet (4.6 m) or more and they are usually artificially cooled by the fire department ul also runs an indirect explosion test on all safes additionally ul-768 certifies the combination lock against tampering ul-140 certifies a relocking mechanism that will permanently lock the safe bolts in case an electronic lock fails or a ul-768 rated lock is compromised
=== class 125 ===
the safe sustains an internal atmosphere of 125 f (52 c) and 80% humidity this class was introduced with the emergence of floppy disks the safes are tested with only non-paper media but are clearly sufficient to hold paper new more durable computer media such as data on compact disks crystallize at 350 f (177 c) which make this type of safe overly-sufficient to store these media
however underwriters laboratories have not tested whether data on blu-ray disks dvds or cds are altered during testing only floppy disks were tested which are no longer a common storage medium
an added benefit of this safe is that it is waterproof due to a door gasket which is stated on the label these class ratings are used in conjunction with hour ratings such as  1 2 3 or 4
=== class 150 ===
the safe sustains an internal atmosphere less than 150 f (66 c) and 85% humidity this class was introduced with the emergence of computer data tapes or magnetic reel-to-reel tapes ul tests this with paper and non-paper articles this safe is also sufficient in storing some optical media such as compact disks cases can be purchased that will meet class 125 if they are placed inside a class 150 safe some may be waterproof due to a gasket on the door and the label will state this these class ratings are used in conjunction with hour ratings such as  1 2 3 or 4
=== class 350 ===
the safe sustains an internal atmosphere of less than 350 f (177 c) and 85% humidity this is the most basic of u.l tests and specifically tests for the storage of paper the ignition point of paper is 450 f (232 c) so this safe is sufficient for storage of paper cases can be purchased that will meet class 125 if they are placed inside a class 350 safe these class ratings are used in conjunction with hour ratings such as  1 2 3 or 4
=== class tl-15 ===
this is a combination locked safe that offers limited protection against combinations of common mechanical and electrical tools the safe will resist abuse for 15 minutes from tools such as hand tools picking tools mechanical or electric tools grinding points carbide drills and devices that apply pressure
=== class tl-30 ===
this is a combination locked safe that offers moderate protection against combinations of mechanical and electrical tools the safe will resist abuse for 30 minutes from tools such as hand tools picking tools mechanical or electrical tools grinding points carbide drills devices that apply pressure cutting wheels and power saws
=== class tl-40 ===
this is a combination locked safe that offers moderate protection against combinations of mechanical and electrical tools the safe will resist abuse for 40 minutes from tools such as hand tools picking tools mechanical or electrical tools grinding points carbide drills devices that apply pressure cutting wheels and power saws
=== class trtl-30 ===
this is a combination locked safe that offers high protection against combinations of mechanical electrical and cutting tools the safe will resist abuse for 30 minutes from tools such as hand tools picking tools mechanical or electrical tools grinding points carbide drills devices that apply pressure cutting wheels power saws impact tools and in addition can withstand an oxy-fuel welding and cutting torch (tested gas limited to 1,000 cubic feet (28 m3) combined total oxygen and fuel gas.)
=== class trtl-60 ===
this class will withstand the same assaults as class trtl-30 for 60 minutes
=== class txtl-60 ===
this class meets all the requirements for class trtl-60 and in addition can withstand high explosives such as nitroglycerin or equivalent to not more than 4 ounces (110 g) of nitroglycerin in one charge (entire test must not use more explosive than that equivalent to 8 ounces (230 g) of nitroglycerin)
== european safe standards ==
depending on the usage the cen has published different european standards for safes testing and certification according to these standards should be done by an accredited certification body e.g european certification body
en 1143-1 is the main testing standard for safes atm safes strongroom doors and strongrooms for safes it features eleven resistance grades (0 i ii  to x) from one grade to the next the security rises by approximately 50% testing is based on a free choice of attack tools and methods testing requires partial access (hand hole) and complete access attempts on all sides of the product the security is calculated by using ratings of tools and the attack time the result is expressed in resistance units (ru)
en 14450 is a testing standard for secure safe cabinets the standard covers products meant for purposes where the security resistance required is less than that of en 1143-1
for fire resistant safes the en 1047-1 (fire resistance standard similar to the fire resistance safe standard of ul) and en 15659 (for light fire storage units) were published
