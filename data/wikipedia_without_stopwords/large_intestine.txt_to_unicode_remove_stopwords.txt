functionedit
large intestine takes hours finish digestion food removes water remaining absorbable nutrients food sending indigestible matter rectum colon absorbs vitamins created colonic bacteria vitamin k especially important daily ingestion vitamin k normally enough maintain adequate blood coagulation vitamin b thiamine riboflavin also compacts feces stores fecal matter rectum discharged via anus defecation large intestine also secretes k cl chloride secretion increases cystic fibrosis recycling various nutrients takes place colon examples include fermentation carbohydrates short chain fatty acids urea cycling
large intestine differs physical form small intestine much wider showing longitudinal layer muscularis reduced straplike structures known taeniae coli wall large intestine lined simple columnar epithelium instead evaginations small intestine villi large intestine invaginations intestinal glands small intestine large intestine goblet cells abundant large intestine
appendix attached inferior surface cecum contains small amount mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue gives appendix undetermined role immunity however appendix known important fetal life contains endocrine cells release biogenic amines peptide hormones important homeostasis early growth development appendix removed apparent damage consequence patient
large intestine extends ileocecal junction anus m long surface bands longitudinal muscle fibers called taeniae coli wide identified three bands start base appendix extend cecum rectum along sides taeniae tags peritoneum filled fat called epiploic appendages appendices epiploicae found sacculations called haustra characteristic features large intestine distinguish small intestine
large intestine comes small intestine digestive tract measures approximately meters length adult humans differences large intestine different organisms large intestine mainly responsible storing waste reclaiming water maintaining water balance absorbing vitamins vitamin k providing location floraaided fermentation
time chyme reached tube nutrients water absorbed body point electrolytes like sodium magnesium chloride left well indigestible parts ingested food eg large part ingested amylose starch shielded digestion heretofore dietary fiber largely indigestible carbohydrate either soluble insoluble form chyme moves large intestine remaining water removed chyme mixed mucus bacteria known gut flora becomes feces ascending colon receives fecal material liquid muscles colon move watery waste material forward slowly absorb excess water stools gradually solidify move along descending colon
bacteria break fiber nourishment create acetate propionate butyrate waste products turn used cell lining colon nourishment protein made available humans perhaps undigested carbohydrate thus becomes available though may vary diet animals including apes primates proportionally larger colons made available thus permitting higher portion plant material diet large intestine produces digestive enzymes chemical digestion completed small intestine chyme reaches large intestine ph colon varies slightly acidic neutral
standing gradient osmosisedit
water absorption colon typically proceeds transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient standing gradient osmosis reabsorption water osmotic gradient intestines hypertonic fluid creates osmotic pressure drives water lateral intercellular spaces osmosis via tight junctions adjacent cells turn moves across basement membrane capillaries
gut floraedit
large intestine houses species bacteria perform variety functions well fungi protozoa archaea species diversity varies geography diet microbes human distal gut often number vicinity trillion weigh around grams pounds mass mostly symbiotic microbes recently called latest human organ discovered words forgotten organ
large intestine absorbs products formed bacteria inhabiting region undigested polysaccharides fiber metabolized shortchain fatty acids bacteria large intestine absorbed passive diffusion bicarbonate large intestine secretes helps neutralize increased acidity resulting formation fatty acids
bacteria also produce large amounts vitamins especially vitamin k biotin b vitamin absorption blood although source vitamins general provides small part daily requirement makes significant contribution dietary vitamin intake low individual depends absorption vitamins formed bacteria large intestine may become vitamindeficient treated antibiotics inhibit species bacteria well diseasecausing bacteria
bacterial products include gas flatus mixture nitrogen carbon dioxide small amounts gases hydrogen methane hydrogen sulfide bacterial fermentation undigested polysaccharides produces fecal odor due indoles metabolized amino acid tryptophan normal flora also essential development certain tissues including cecum lymphatics
also involved production crossreactive antibodies antibodies produced immune system normal flora also effective related pathogens thereby preventing infection invasion
prevalent bacteria bacteroides implicated initiation colitis colon cancer bifidobacteria also abundant often described friendly bacteria
mucus layer protects large intestine attacks colonic commensal bacteria

colonoscopyedit
colonoscopy endoscopic examination large intestine distal part small bowel ccd camera fiber optic camera flexible tube passed anus provide visual diagnosis eg ulceration polyps grants opportunity biopsy removal suspected colorectal cancer lesions colonoscopy remove polyps small one millimetre less polyps removed studied aid microscope determine precancerous takes years fewer polyp turn cancerous
colonoscopy similar sigmoidoscopythe difference related parts colon examine colonoscopy allows examination entire colon mm length sigmoidoscopy allows examination distal portion mm colon may sufficient benefits cancer survival colonoscopy limited detection lesions distal portion colon
sigmoidoscopy often used screening procedure full colonoscopy often done conjunction fecal occult blood test fobt screened patients referred colonoscopy
virtual colonoscopy uses d d imagery reconstructed computed tomography ct scans nuclear magnetic resonance mr scans also possible totally noninvasive medical test although standard still investigation regarding diagnostic abilities furthermore virtual colonoscopy allow therapeutic maneuvers polyptumour removal biopsy visualization lesions smaller millimeters growth polyp detected using ct colonography standard colonoscopy would still need performed additionally surgeons lately using term pouchoscopy refer colonoscopy ileoanal pouch
animalsedit
large intestine truly distinct tetrapods almost always separated small intestine ileocaecal valve vertebrates however relatively short structure running directly anus although noticeably wider small intestine although caecum present amniotes mammals remainder large intestine develop true colon
small mammals colon straight tetrapods majority mammalian species divided ascending descending portions distinct transverse colon typically present primates however taeniae coli accompanying haustra found either carnivorans ruminants rectum mammals monotremes derived cloaca vertebrates therefore truly homologous rectum found species
fish true large intestine simply short rectum connecting end digestive part gut cloaca sharks includes rectal gland secretes salt help animal maintain osmotic balance seawater gland somewhat resembles caecum structure homologous structure
