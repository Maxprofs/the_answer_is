across the many fields concerned with interactivity including information science computer science human-computer interaction communication and industrial design there is little agreement over the meaning of the term interactivity although all are related to interaction with computers and other machines with a user interface
multiple views on interactivity exist in the contingency view of interactivity there are three levels
no interactive when a message is not related to previous messages
reactive when a message is related only to one immediately previous message and
interactive when a message is related to a number of previous messages and to the relationship between them
one body of research has made a strong distinction between interaction and interactivity as the suffix ity is used to form nouns that denote a quality or condition this body of research has defined interactivity as the quality or condition of interaction these researchers suggest that the distinction between interaction and interactivity is important since interaction may be present in any given setting but the quality of the interaction varies from low and high
== human to human communicationedit ==
human communication is the basic example of interactive communication which involves two different processes human to human interactivity and human to computer interactivity human-human interactivity is the communication between people
on the other hand human to computer communication is the way that people communicate with new media according to rada roy the human computer interaction model might consists of 4 main components which consist of human computer task environment and machine environment the two basic flows of information and control are assumed the communication between people and computers one must understand something about both and about the tasks which people perform with computers a general model of human - computer interface emphasizes the flow of information and control at the human computer interface. human to human interactivity consists of many conceptualizations which are based on anthropomorphic definitions for example complex systems that detect and react to human behavior are sometimes called interactive under this perspective interaction includes responses to human physical manipulation like movement body language and/or changes in mental states
media theorist fernando arturo torres defined interactivity as a particular medium's ability to facilitate the properties necessary in an ideal conversation ("towards a universal theory of media interactivity developing a proper context, 1995 definition of interactivity, para 1) his research determined that interactivity should be defined by how well a medium facilitates two-way communication rather than by the technology of the medium.
== human to artifact communicationedit ==
in the context of communication between a human and an artifact interactivity refers to the artifacts interactive behaviour as experienced by the human user this is different from other aspects of the artifact such as its visual appearance its internal working and the meaning of the signs it might mediate for example the interactivity of an ipod is not its physical shape and colour (its so-called design") its ability to play music or its storage capacityit is the behaviour of its user interface as experienced by its user this includes the way you move your finger on its input wheel the way this allows you to select a tune in the playlist and the way you control the volume
an artifacts interactivity is best perceived through use a bystander can imagine how it would be like to use an artifact by watching others use it but it is only through actual use that its interactivity is fully experienced and felt this is due to the kinesthetic nature of the interactive experience it is similar to the difference between watching someone drive a car and actually driving it it is only through the driving that you can experience and feel how this car differs from others
new media academic vincent maher defines interactivity as the relation constituted by a symbolic interface between its referential objective functionality and the subject.
== computing scienceedit ==
the term look and feel is often used to refer to the specifics of a computer system's user interface using this metaphor the look refers to its visual design while the feel refers to its interactivity indirectly this can be regarded as an informal definition of interactivity
for a more detailed discussion of how interactivity has been conceptualized in the human-computer interaction literature and how the phenomenology of the french philosopher merleau-ponty can shed light on the user experience see (svanaes 2000)
in computer science interactive refers to software which accepts and responds to input from peoplefor example data or commands interactive software includes most popular programs such as word processors or spreadsheet applications by comparison noninteractive programs operate without human contact examples of these include compilers and batch processing applications if the response is complex enough it is said that the system is conducting social interaction and some systems try to achieve this through the implementation of social interfaces
also there is the notion of kinds of user interaction like the rich ui
== creating interactivityedit ==
web page authors can integrate javascript coding to create interactive web pages sliders date pickers drag and dropping are just some of the many enhancements that can be provided
various authoring tools are available for creating various kinds of interactivities some of the most common platforms for creating interactivities include adobe flash and microsoft silverlight the most commonly used authoring tools for creating interactivities include harbinger's elicitus and articulate's engage elearning makes use of a concept called an interaction model using an interaction model any person can create interactivities in a very short period of time some tools like harbinger's raptivity come with readymade interaction models that can be customized easily without any programming
some of the interaction models presented with authoring tools fall under various categories like games puzzles simulation tools presentation tools etc. which can be completely customized
