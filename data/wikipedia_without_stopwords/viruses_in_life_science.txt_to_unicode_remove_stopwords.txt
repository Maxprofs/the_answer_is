origins
viruses found wherever life probably existed since living cells first evolved origin viruses unclear form fossils molecular techniques used compare dna rna viruses useful means investigating arose addition viral genetic material may occasionally integrate germline host organisms passed vertically offsprings host many generations provides invaluable source information paleovirologist trace back ancient viruses existed millions years ago currently three main hypotheses aim explain origins viruses
regressive hypothesis
viruses may small cells parasitised larger cells time genes required parasitism lost bacteria rickettsia chlamydia living cells like viruses reproduce inside host cells lend support hypothesis dependence parasitism likely caused loss genes enabled survive outside cell also called degeneracy hypothesis reduction hypothesis
cellular origin hypothesis
viruses may evolved bits dna rna escaped genes larger organism escaped dna could come plasmids pieces naked dna move cells transposons molecules dna replicate move around different positions within genes cell called jumping genes transposons examples mobile genetic elements could origin viruses discovered maize barbara mcclintock sometimes called vagrancy hypothesis escape hypothesis
