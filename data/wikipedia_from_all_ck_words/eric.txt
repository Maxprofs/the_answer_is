the given name eric erik or erick is derived from the old norse name eirkr (or erkr in eastern scandinavia due to monophthongization) the first element ei- is derived either from the older proto-norse *aina(z) meaning one or alone or from proto-norse *aiwa(z) meaning ever or eternal the second element -rkr derives either from *rk(a)z meaning ruler or prince (cf gothic reiks) or from an even older proto-germanic *rkiaz which meant powerful and rich the name is thus usually taken to mean one ruler autocrat eternal ruler or ever powerful warrior and government
the most common spelling in scandinavia is erik in norway another form of the name (which has kept the old norse diphthong) eirik is also commonly used in finland the form erkki is also used the modern icelandic version is eirkur while the modern faroese version is eirikur ric [eik] is used in french and in germany eric erik and erich are used
although the name was in use in anglo-saxon england its use was reinforced by scandinavian settlers arriving before the norman invasion it was an uncommon name in england until the middle ages when it gained popularity and finally became a common name in the 19th century this was partly because of the publishing of the novel eric or little by little by frederick william farrar in 1858
in norway sweden and finland the name day for erik and eirik is 18 may commemorating the death of saint eric of sweden
the feminine derivative is erica or erika
