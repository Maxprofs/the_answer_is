magnesium sulfate magnesium sulphate inorganic salt chemical compound containing magnesium sulfur oxygen formula mgso often encountered heptahydrate sulfate mineral epsomite mgsoho commonly called epsom salt taking name bitter saline spring epsom surrey england salt produced springs arise porous chalk north downs meets nonporous london clay monohydrate mgsoho found mineral kieserite overall global annual usage mids monohydrate million tons majority used agriculture
anhydrous magnesium sulfate used drying agent anhydrous form hygroscopic readily absorbs water air therefore difficult weigh accurately hydrate often preferred preparing solutions example medical preparations epsom salt traditionally used component bath salts epsom salt also used beauty product athletes use soothe sore muscles gardeners use improve crops variety uses epsom salt also effective removal splinters

usesedit
medicaledit
magnesium sulfate common mineral pharmaceutical preparation magnesium commonly known epsom salt used externally internally epsom salt used bath salts isolation tanks oral magnesium sulfate commonly used saline laxative osmotic purgative magnesium sulfate main preparation intravenous magnesium
internal uses include
replacement therapy hypomagnesemia
magnesium sulfate firstline antiarrhythmic agent torsades de pointes cardiac arrest ecc guidelines managing quinidineinduced arrhythmias
bronchodilator betaagonist anticholinergic agents tried eg severe exacerbations asthma magnesium sulfate nebulized reduce symptoms acute asthma commonly administered via intravenous route management severe asthma attacks
magnesium sulfate effective decreasing risk preeclampsia progresses eclampsia iv magnesium sulfate diazepam used prevent treat seizures eclampsia also commonly used eclampsia compared diazepam phenytoin results better outcomes
risk preterm birth systematic review suggested intravenous magnesium sulfate birth could reduce risk cerebral palsy motor dysfunction preterm infants
magnesium sulfate used experimental treatment irukandji syndrome caused envenomation certain species irukandji jellyfish efficacy treatment remains unproven
solutions sulfate salts epsom salt may given first aid barium chloride poisoning
use epsom salt may help draw splinters
overdose magnesium causes hypermagnesemia
agricultureedit
gardening agriculture magnesium sulfate used correct magnesium sulfur deficiency soil magnesium essential element chlorophyll molecule sulfur another important micronutrient commonly applied potted plants magnesiumhungry crops potatoes roses tomatoes lemon trees carrots peppers advantage magnesium sulfate magnesium soil amendments dolomitic lime high solubility also allows option foliar feeding solutions magnesium sulfate also nearly neutral compared alkaline salts magnesium found limestone therefore use magnesium sulfate magnesium source soil significantly change soil ph
otheredit
anhydrous magnesium sulfate commonly used desiccant organic synthesis due affinity water workup organic phase saturated magnesium sulfate longer forms clumps hydrated solid removed filtration decantation inorganic sulfate salts sodium sulfate calcium sulfate may also used way
magnesium sulfate used bath salts particularly flotation therapy high concentrations raise bath waters specific gravity effectively making body buoyant traditionally also used prepare foot baths intended soothe sore feet reason inclusion salt partially cosmetic increase ionic strength prevents temporary skin wrinkling partial maceration caused prolonged immersion extremities pure water also common belief magnesium sulfate absorbed skin reducing inflammation however scientific study ever published either explain reaffirm belief naturally present mineral waters
may also used coagulant making tofu
magnesium sulfate heptahydrate also used maintain magnesium concentration marine aquaria contain large amounts stony corals slowly depleted calcification process magnesiumdeficient marine aquarium calcium alkalinity concentrations difficult control enough magnesium present stabilize ions saltwater prevent spontaneous precipitation calcium carbonate
magnesium sulfate used electrolyte prepare copper sulfate magnesium sulfate solution electrolyzed copper anode form copper sulfate magnesium hydroxide hydrogen
cu mgso ho h cuso mgoh
magnesium sulfate used brewing salt beer production adjust ion content brewing water enhance enzyme action mash promote desired flavor profile beer
pregnancy usageedit
magnesium sulfate used tocolytic metaanalyses failed support anticontraction medication use prolonged periods five seven days may result health problems baby
risk early delivery magnesium sulfate appears decrease risk cerebral palsy unclear helps born term
debateedit
study carried february found epsom salt minutely raises magnesium levels bathe regularly therefore although epsom salts may help relieve muscle tightness epsom salts less beneficial thought
physical propertiesedit
magnesium sulfate highly soluble water anhydrous form strongly hygroscopic used desiccant primary substance causes absorption sound seawater acoustic energy converted thermal energy absorption strongly dependent frequency lower frequencies less absorbed salt sound travels much farther ocean boric acid also contributes absorption abundant salt seawater sodium chloride negligible sound absorption
hydratesedit
almost known mineralogical forms mgso occur hydrates epsomite natural analogue epsom salt another heptahydrate coppercontaining mineral alpersite mgcusoho recently recognized however highest known hydrates mgso due recent terrestrial find meridianiite mgsoho thought also occur mars hexahydrite next lower hydrate three next lower hydrates pentahydrite starkeyite especially sanderite rarely found kieserite monohydrate common among evaporitic deposits anhydrous magnesium sulfate reported burning coal dumps never treated mineral
ph hydrates average magnesium hydrates like copperii sulfate coordinated water
manufacturingedit
heptahydrate prepared neutralizing sulfuric acid magnesium carbonate oxide usually obtained directly natural sources
anhydrous magnesium sulfate prepared dehydration hydrate
