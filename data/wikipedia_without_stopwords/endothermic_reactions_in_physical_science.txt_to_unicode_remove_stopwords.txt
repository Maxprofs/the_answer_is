thermodynamics term endothermic process describes process reaction system absorbs energy surroundings usually always form heat term coined marcellin berthelot greek roots endo derived word endon meaning within root therm meaning hot intended sense reaction depends absorbing heat proceed opposite endothermic process exothermic process one releases gives energy form usually always heat thus term endothermic exothermic prefix refers heat goes reaction occurs though reality refers energy goes without necessarily form heat
concept frequently applied physical sciences example chemical reactions thermal energy heat converted chemical bond energy
endothermic exothermic analysis accounts enthalpy change h reaction full energy analysis reaction gibbs free energy g includes entropy temperature term addition enthalpy reaction spontaneous process certain temperature products lower gibbs free energy exergonic reaction even enthalpy products higher entropy enthalpy different terms change entropic energy overcome opposite change enthalpic energy make endothermic reaction favorable
