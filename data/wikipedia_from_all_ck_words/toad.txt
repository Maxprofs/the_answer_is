a toad is any of a number of species of amphibians in the order anura (frogs) that are characterized by dry leathery skin short legs and parotoid glands
== biologyedit ==
a distinction between frogs and toads is not made in scientific taxonomy but is common in popular culture (folk taxonomy) in which toads are associated with drier skin and more terrestrial habitats than animals commonly called frogs in scientific taxonomy toads are found in the families bufonidae bombinatoridae discoglossidae pelobatidae rhinophrynidae scaphiopodidae and microhylidae there is no definitive collective noun for toads and like most collective nouns the listed proposals are fanciful one example is a knot of toads others include a lump nest or knob of toads
the function of the bumps on the skins of toads has been speculated to be to help the animal to blend more effectively into its environment by breaking up its visual outline usually the largest of the bumps are those that cover the parotoid glands the bumps commonly are referred to as warts but this is fanciful they have nothing to do with warts being fixed in size present on healthy specimens and are not a result of infection or injury
== reproductionedit ==
toads like many amphibians exhibit breeding site fidelity (philopatry) individual bufo americanus toads return to their natal ponds to breed where they are likely to encounter siblings as potential mates although inbred examples within a species is possible siblings rarely mate toads recognize and actively avoid mating with close kin advertisement vocalizations given by males appear to serve as cues by which females recognize kin kin recognition thus allows avoidance of inbreeding and consequent inbreeding depression
