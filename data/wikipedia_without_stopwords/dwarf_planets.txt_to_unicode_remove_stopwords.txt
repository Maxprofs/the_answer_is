starting astronomers discovered ceres bodies mars jupiter decades considered planets around number planets reached astronomers started using word asteroid smaller bodies stopped naming classifying planets
discovery pluto astronomers considered solar system nine planets along thousands significantly smaller bodies asteroids comets almost years pluto thought larger mercury discovery plutos moon charon became possible measure plutos mass accurately determine much smaller initial estimates roughly onetwentieth mass mercury made pluto far smallest planet although still ten times massive largest object asteroid belt ceres onefifth earths moon furthermore unusual characteristics large orbital eccentricity high orbital inclination became evident completely different kind body planets
astronomers began find objects region space pluto known kuiper belt even farther away many shared several plutos key orbital characteristics pluto started seen largest member new class objects plutinos led astronomers stop referring pluto planet several terms including subplanet planetoid started used bodies known dwarf planets three transneptunian objects comparable size pluto quaoar sedna eris reported became clear either would also classified planets pluto would reclassified astronomers also confident objects large pluto would discovered number planets would start growing quickly pluto remain planet
eris known ub discovered january believed slightly larger pluto reports informally referred tenth planet consequence issue became matter intense debate iau general assembly august iaus initial draft proposal included charon eris ceres list planets many astronomers objected proposal alternative drawn uruguayan astronomer julio ngel fernndez created median classification objects large enough round cleared orbits planetesimals dropping charon list new proposal also removed pluto ceres eris cleared orbits
iaus final resolution preserved threecategory system celestial bodies orbiting sun reads
iau resolves planets bodies except satellites solar system defined three distinct categories following way
planet celestial body orbit around sun b sufficient mass selfgravity overcome rigid body forces assumes hydrostatic equilibrium nearly round shape c cleared neighbourhood around orbit
dwarf planet celestial body orbit around sun b sufficient mass selfgravity overcome rigid body forces assumes hydrostatic equilibrium nearly round shape c cleared neighbourhood around orbit d satellite
objects except satellites orbiting sun shall referred collectively small solar system bodies

iau process established assign borderline objects either dwarf planet status
currently include solar system asteroids transneptunian objects tnos comets small bodies
although concerns raised classification planets orbiting stars issue resolved proposed instead decide objects start observed
