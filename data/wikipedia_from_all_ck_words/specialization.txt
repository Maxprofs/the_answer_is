the name calorie is used for two units of energy
the small calorie or gram calorie (symbol cal) is the approximate amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree celsius at a pressure of one atmosphere
the large calorie kilogram calorie dietary calorie nutritionist's calorie nutritional calorie calorie (capital c) or food calorie (symbol cal) is approximately the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree celsius the large calorie is thus equal to 70031000000000000001000 small calories or one kilocalorie (symbol kcal)
although these units are part of the metric system they have been superseded in the international system of units by the joule one small calorie is approximately 4.2 joules (so one large calorie is about 4.2 kilojoules) the factor used to convert calories to joules at a given temperature is numerically equivalent to the specific heat capacity of water expressed in joules per kelvin per gram or per kilogram the precise conversion factor depends on the definition adopted
in spite of its non-official status the large calorie is still widely used as a unit of food energy the small calorie is also often used for measurements in chemistry although the amounts involved are typically recorded in kilocalories
the calorie was first defined by nicolas clment in 1824 as a unit of heat and entered french and english dictionaries between 1841 and 1867 the word comes from latin calor meaning heat
== definitions ==
the energy needed to increase the temperature of a given mass of water by 1 c depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature accordingly several different precise definitions of the calorie have been used
the pressure is usually taken to be the standard atmospheric pressure (7005101325000000000101.325 kpa) the temperature increase can be expressed as one kelvin which means the same as an increment of one degree celsius
2 the two definitions most common in older literature appear to be the 15 c calorie and the thermochemical calorie
== usage ==
the calorie was first defined specifically to measure energy in the form of heat especially in experimental calorimetry
=== nutrition ===
in nutritional contexts the kilojoule (kj) is the si unit of food energy although the kilocalorie is still in common use in these contexts confusingly the word calorie is very often used for what is actually a kilocalorie of nutritional energy sometimes in an attempt to avoid confusion it is written calorie (with a capital c") in an attempt to make the distinction although this is not universal and is not widely understood
in attempts to facilitate comparison specific energy or energy density figures are often quoted for example calories per serving or kilocalories per 100 g nutritional requirements or intakes are often expressed in calories per day
=== chemistry ===
in scientific contexts the term calorie almost always refers to the small calorie even though it is not an si unit it is still used in chemistry for example the energy released in a chemical reaction per mole of reagent is occasionally expressed in kilocalories per mole traditionally this use was largely due to the ease with which it could be calculated in laboratory reactions especially in aqueous solution a volume of reagent dissolved in water forming a solution with concentration expressed in moles per liter (1 liter weighing 1 kg) will induce a temperature change in degrees celsius in the total volume of water solvent and these quantities (volume molar concentration and temperature change) can then be used to calculate energy per mole it is also occasionally used to specify energy quantities that relate to reaction energy such as enthalpy of formation and the size of activation barriers however its use is being superseded by the si unit the joule and multiples thereof such as the kilojoule
