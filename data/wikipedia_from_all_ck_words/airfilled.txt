an aerodrome or airdrome is a location from which aircraft flight operations take place regardless of whether they involve air cargo passengers or neither aerodromes include small general aviation airfields large commercial airports and military airbases the term airport may imply a certain stature (having satisfied certain certification criteria or regulatory requirements) that an aerodrome may not have achieved that is to say all airports are aerodromes but not all aerodromes are airports usage of the term aerodrome remains more common in the uk and commonwealth nations and is conversely almost unknown in american english
a water aerodrome is an area of open water used regularly by seaplanes or amphibious aircraft for landing and taking off
according to the international civil aviation organization (icao) an aerodrome is a defined area on land or water (including any buildings installations and equipment) intended to be used either wholly or in part for the arrival departure and surface movement of aircraft.
== etymologyedit ==
the word aerodrome is derived from the greek words aeras () air and dromos () road or course literally meaning air course an ancient example was the term hippodrome (stadium for horse racing and chariot racing derived from hippos ( horse") and dromos ( course")
in the uk the term was used by the royal flying corps in the first world war and the royal air force in the first and second world war as it had the advantage that their french allies on whose soil they were based and with whom they co-operated used the cognate term arodrome
in canada and australia aerodrome is a legal term of art for any area of land or water used for aircraft operation regardless of facilities
the term aerodrome is used in international civil aviation organization (icao) documents for example in the annex to the icao convention about aerodromes their physical characteristics and their operation however the term airfield or airport has mostly superseded use of aerodrome after world war ii
== history of aerodromesedit ==
in the early days of aviation when there were no paved runways and all landing fields were grass a typical airfield might permit takeoffs and landings in only a couple of directions much like today's airports whereas an aerodrome was distinguished by virtue of its much greater size by its ability to handle landings and take offs in any direction the ability to always take off and land directly into the wind regardless of the wind's direction was an important advantage in the earliest days of aviation when an airplane's performance in a crosswind takeoff or landing might be poor or even dangerous the development of differential braking in aircraft improved aircraft performance utilization of paved runways and the fact that a circular aerodrome required much more space than did the l or triangle shaped airfield eventually made the early aerodromes obsolete the city of the first aerodrome in the world is a french commune named viry-chatillon
the unimproved airfield remains a phenomenon in military aspects the dhc-4 caribou served in the u.s military in vietnam (designated as the cv-2) landing on rough unimproved airfields where the c-130 workhorse could not operate earlier the ju-52 and fieseler storch could do the same one example of the latter taking off from the fhrerbunker whilst completely surrounded by russian troops
== types of aerodromesedit ==
=== airportedit ===
an airport is an aerodrome certificated for commercial flights
=== air baseedit ===
an air base is an aerodrome with significant facilities to support aircraft and crew the term is usually reserved for military bases but also applies to civil seaplane bases
=== airstripedit ===
an airstrip is a small aerodrome that consists only of a runway with perhaps fueling equipment they are generally in remote locations many airstrips (now mostly abandoned) were built on the hundreds of islands in the pacific ocean during world war ii a few airstrips grew to become full-fledged airbases as strategic or economic importance of a region increased over time
== aerodromes by countryedit ==
=== canadaedit ===
the canadian aeronautical information manual (aim) says ...for the most part all of canada can be an aerodrome however there are also registered aerodromes and certified airports to become a registered aerodrome the operator must maintain certain standards and keep the minister of transport (canada) informed of any changes to be certified as an airport the aerodrome which usually supports commercial operations must meet safety standards nav canada the private company responsible for air traffic control services in canada publishes the canada flight supplement (cfs) a directory of all registered canadian land aerodromes as well as the canada water aerodrome supplement (cwas)
