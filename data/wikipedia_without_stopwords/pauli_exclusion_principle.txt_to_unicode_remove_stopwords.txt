pauli exclusion principle singlevalued manyparticle wavefunction equivalent requiring wavefunction antisymmetric antisymmetric twoparticle state represented sum states one particle state state
antisymmetry exchange means axy ayx implies axy xy pauli exclusion true basis since unitary changes basis keep antisymmetric matrices antisymmetric although strictly speaking quantity axy matrix antisymmetric ranktwo tensor
conversely diagonal quantities axx zero every basis wavefunction component
necessarily antisymmetric prove consider matrix element
zero two particles zero probability superposition state equal
first last terms right side diagonal elements zero whole sum equal zero wavefunction matrix elements obey

consequencesedit
atoms pauli principleedit
pauli exclusion principle helps explain wide variety physical phenomena one particularly important consequence principle elaborate electron shell structure atoms way atoms share electrons explaining variety chemical elements chemical combinations electrically neutral atom contains bound electrons equal number protons nucleus electrons fermions cannot occupy quantum state electrons electrons stack within atom ie different spins electron orbital described
example neutral helium atom two bound electrons occupy lowestenergy states acquiring opposite spin spin part quantum state electron two electrons different quantum states violate pauli principle however spin take two different values eigenvalues lithium atom three bound electrons third electron cannot reside state must occupy one higherenergy states instead similarly successively larger elements must shells successively higher energy chemical properties element largely depend number electrons outermost shell atoms different numbers occupied electron shells number electrons outermost shell similar properties gives rise periodic table elements
solid state properties pauli principleedit
conductors semiconductors large numbers molecular orbitals effectively form continuous band structure energy levels strong conductors metals electrons degenerate cannot even contribute much thermal capacity metal many mechanical electrical magnetic optical chemical properties solids direct consequence pauli exclusion
stability matteredit
stability electrons atom unrelated exclusion principle described quantum theory atom underlying idea close approach electron nucleus atom necessarily increases kinetic energy application uncertainty principle heisenberg however stability large systems many electrons many nucleons different matter requires pauli exclusion principle
shown pauli exclusion principle responsible fact ordinary bulk matter stable occupies volume suggestion first made paul ehrenfest pointed electrons atom cannot fall lowestenergy orbital must occupy successively larger shells atoms therefore occupy volume cannot squeezed closely together
rigorous proof provided freeman dyson andrew lenard considered balance attractive electronnuclear repulsive electronelectron nuclearnuclear forces showed ordinary matter would collapse occupy much smaller volume without pauli principle
consequence pauli principle electrons spin kept apart repulsive exchange interaction shortrange effect acting simultaneously longrange electrostatic coulombic force effect partly responsible everyday observation macroscopic world two solid objects cannot place time
astrophysics pauli principleedit
dyson lenard consider extreme magnetic gravitational forces occur astronomical objects elliott lieb coworkers showed pauli principle still leads stability intense magnetic fields neutron stars although much higher density ordinary matter consequence general relativity sufficiently intense gravitational fields matter collapses form black hole
astronomy provides spectacular demonstration effect pauli principle form white dwarf neutron stars types body atomic structure disrupted large gravitational forces leaving constituents supported degeneracy pressure alone exotic form matter known degenerate matter white dwarfs atoms held apart electron degeneracy pressure neutron stars subject even stronger gravitational forces electrons merged protons form neutrons neutrons capable producing even higher degeneracy pressure albeit shorter range stabilize neutron stars collapse smaller size higher density white dwarf neutrons rigid objects known young modulus accurately bulk modulus orders magnitude larger diamond however even enormous rigidity overcome gravitational field massive star pressure supernova leading formation black hole
