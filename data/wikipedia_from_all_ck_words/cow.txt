cattlecolloquially cowsare the most common type of large domesticated ungulates they are a prominent modern member of the subfamily bovinae are the most widespread species of the genus bos and are most commonly classified collectively as bos taurus cattle are raised as livestock for meat (beef and veal) as dairy animals for milk and other dairy products and as draft animals (oxen or bullocks that pull carts plows and other implements) other products include leather and dung for manure or fuel in some regions such as parts of india cattle have significant religious meaning from as few as 80 progenitors domesticated in southeast turkey about 10,500 years ago according to an estimate from 2003 there are 1.3 billion cattle in the world in 2009 cattle became one of the first livestock animals to have a fully mapped genome some consider cattle the oldest form of wealth and cattle raiding consequently one of the earliest forms of theft
== taxonomyedit ==
cattle were originally identified as three separate species bos taurus the european or taurine cattle (including similar types from africa and asia) bos indicus the zebu and the extinct bos primigenius the aurochs the aurochs is ancestral to both zebu and taurine cattle now these have been reclassified as one species bos taurus with three subspecies bos taurus primigenius bos taurus indicus and bos taurus taurus
complicating the matter is the ability of cattle to interbreed with other closely related species hybrid individuals and even breeds exist not only between taurine cattle and zebu (such as the sanga cattle bos taurus africanus) but also between one or both of these and some other members of the genus bos yaks (the dzo or yattle) banteng and gaur hybrids such as the beefalo breed can even occur between taurine cattle and either species of bison leading some authors to consider them part of the genus bos as well the hybrid origin of some types may not be obvious for example genetic testing of the dwarf lulu breed the only taurine-type cattle in nepal found them to be a mix of taurine cattle zebu and yak however cattle cannot successfully be hybridized with more distantly related bovines such as water buffalo or african buffalo
the aurochs originally ranged throughout europe north africa and much of asia in historical times its range became restricted to europe and the last known individual died in masovia poland in about 1627 breeders have attempted to recreate cattle of similar appearance to aurochs by crossing traditional types of domesticated cattle creating the heck cattle breed
== etymologyedit ==
cattle did not originate as the term for bovine animals it was borrowed from anglo-norman catel itself from medieval latin capitale principal sum of money capital itself derived in turn from latin caput head cattle originally meant movable personal property especially livestock of any kind as opposed to real property (the land which also included wild or small free-roaming animals such as chickens they were sold as part of the land) the word is a variant of chattel (a unit of personal property) and closely related to capital in the economic sense the term replaced earlier old english feoh cattle property which survives today as fee (cf german vieh dutch vee gothic faihu)
the word cow came via anglo-saxon c (plural c) from common indo-european gus (genitive gows) = a bovine animal compare persian gv sanskrit go- welsh buwch the plural c became ki or kie in middle english and an additional plural ending was often added giving kine kien but also kies kuin and others this is the origin of the now archaic english plural kine the scots language singular is coo or cou and the plural is kye
in older english sources such as the king james version of the bible cattle refers to livestock as opposed to deer which refers to wildlife wild cattle may refer to feral cattle or to undomesticated species of the genus bos today when used without any other qualifier the modern meaning of cattle is usually restricted to domesticated bovines
== terminologyedit ==
in general the same words are used in different parts of the world but with minor differences in the definitions the terminology described here contrasts the differences in definition between the united kingdom and other british-influenced parts of world such as canada australia new zealand ireland and the united states
an intact (i.e. not castrated) adult male is called a bull a wild young unmarked bull is known as a micky in australia an unbranded bovine of either sex is called a maverick in the usa and canada
an adult female that has had a calf (or two depending on regional usage) is a cow
a young female before she has had a calf of her own and is under three years of age is called a heifer (/hfr/ hef-r) a young female that has had only one calf is occasionally called a first-calf heifer
young cattle of both sexes are called calves until they are weaned then weaners until they are a year old in some areas in other areas particularly with male beef cattle they may be known as feeder calves or simply feeders after that they are referred to as yearlings or stirks if between one and two years of age
a castrated male is called a steer in the united states older steers are often called bullocks in other parts of the world but in north america this term refers to a young bull piker bullocks are micky bulls (uncastrated young male bulls) that were caught castrated and then later lost in australia the term japanese ox is used for grain-fed steers in the weight range of 500 to 650 kg that are destined for the japanese meat trade in north america draft cattle under four years old are called working steers improper or late castration on a bull results in it becoming a coarse steer known as a stag in australia canada and new zealand in some countries an incompletely castrated male is known also as a rig
a castrated male (occasionally a female or in some areas a bull) kept for draft purposes is called an ox (plural oxen) ox may also be used to refer to some carcass products from any adult cattle such as ox-hide ox-blood oxtail or ox-liver
a springer is a cow or heifer close to calving
in all cattle species a female twin of a bull usually becomes an infertile partial intersex and is called a freemartin
neat (horned oxen from which neatsfoot oil is derived) beef (young ox) and beefing (young animal fit for slaughtering) are obsolete terms although poll pollard or polled cattle are still terms in use for naturally hornless animals or in some areas also for those that have been disbudded or dehorned
cattle raised for human consumption are called beef cattle within the american beef cattle industry the older term beef (plural beeves) is still used to refer to an animal of either sex some australian canadian new zealand and british people use the term beast especially for single animals when the sex is unknown
cattle bred specifically for milk production are called milking or dairy cattle a cow kept to provide milk for one family may be called a house cow or milker a fresh cow is a dairy term for a cow or first-calf heifer who has recently given birth or freshened.
the adjective applying to cattle in general is usually bovine the terms bull cow and calf are also used by extension to denote the sex or age of other large animals including whales hippopotamuses camels elk and elephants
=== singular terminology issueedit ===
cattle can only be used in the plural and not in the singular it is a plurale tantum thus one may refer to three cattle or some cattle but not one cattle no universally used singular form in modern english of cattle exists other than the sex- and age-specific terms such as cow bull steer and heifer historically ox was not a sex-specific term for adult cattle but generally this is now used only for draft cattle especially adult castrated males the term is also incorporated into the names of other species such as the musk ox and grunting ox (yak) and is used in some areas to describe certain cattle products such as ox-hide and oxtail
cow is in general use as a singular for the collective cattle despite the objections by those who insist it to be a female-specific term although the phrase that cow is a bull is absurd from a lexicographic standpoint the word cow is easy to use when a singular is needed and the sex is unknown or irrelevant when there is a cow in the road for example further any herd of fully mature cattle in or near a pasture is statistically likely to consist mostly of cows so the term is probably accurate even in the restrictive sense other than the few bulls needed for breeding the vast majority of male cattle are castrated as calves and slaughtered for meat before the age of three years thus in a pastured herd any calves or herd bulls usually are clearly distinguishable from the cows due to distinctively different sizes and clear anatomical differences merriam-webster a us dictionary recognizes the sex-nonspecific use of cow as an alternate definition whereas collins a uk dictionary does not
colloquially more general nonspecific terms may denote cattle when a singular form is needed australian new zealand and british farmers use the term beast or cattle beast bovine is also used in britain the term critter is common in the western united states and canada particularly when referring to young cattle in some areas of the american south (particularly the appalachian region) where both dairy and beef cattle are present an individual animal was once called a beef critter though that term is becoming archaic
=== other terminologyedit ===
cattle raised for human consumption are called beef cattle within the beef cattle industry in parts of the united states the term beef (plural beeves") is still used in its archaic sense to refer to an animal of either sex cows of certain breeds that are kept for the milk they give are called dairy cows or milking cows (formerly milch cows") most young male offspring of dairy cows are sold for veal and may be referred to as veal calves
the term dogies is used to describe orphaned calves in the context of ranch work in the american west as in keep them dogies moving in some places a cow kept to provide milk for one family is called a house cow other obsolete terms for cattle include neat (this use survives in neatsfoot oil extracted from the feet and legs of cattle) and beefing (young animal fit for slaughter)
an onomatopoeic term for one of the most common sounds made by cattle is moo (also called lowing) there are a number of other sounds made by cattle including calves bawling and bulls bellowing bawling is most common for cows after weaning of a calf the bullroarer makes a sound similar to a bull's territorial call
== characteristicsedit ==
=== anatomyedit ===
cattle are large quadrupedal ungulate mammals with cloven hooves most breeds have horns which can be as large as the texas longhorn or small like a scur careful genetic selection has allowed polled (hornless) cattle to become widespread
cattle are ruminants meaning their digestive system is highly specialized to allow the use of poorly digestible plants as food cattle have one stomach with four compartments the rumen reticulum omasum and abomasum with the rumen being the largest compartment cattle are known for regurgitating and re-chewing their food known as cud chewing the reticulum the smallest compartment is known as the honeycomb cattle sometimes consume metal objects which are deposited in the reticulum and irritation from the metal objects causes hardware disease the omasum's main function is to absorb water and nutrients from the digestible feed the omasum is known as the many plies the abomasum is like the human stomach this is why it is known as the true stomach the cud is then swallowed again and further digested by specialized microorganisms in the rumen these microbes are primarily responsible for decomposing cellulose and other carbohydrates into volatile fatty acids cattle use as their primary metabolic fuel the microbes inside the rumen also synthesize amino acids from non-protein nitrogenous sources such as urea and ammonia as these microbes reproduce in the rumen older generations die and their cells continue on through the digestive tract these cells are then partially digested in the small intestines allowing cattle to gain a high-quality protein source these features allow cattle to thrive on grasses and other vegetation
==== gestation and sizeedit ====
the gestation period for a cow is about nine months long a newborn calf's size can vary among breeds but a typical calf typically weighs 25 to 45 kg (55 to 99 lb) adult size and weight vary significantly among breeds and sex the world record for the heaviest bull was 1,740 kg (3,840 lb) a chianina named donetto when he was exhibited at the arezzo show in 1955 the heaviest steer was eight-year-old old ben a shorthorn/hereford cross weighing in at 2,140 kg (4,720 lb) in 1910 steers are generally killed before reaching 750 kg (1,650 lb) breeding stock may be allowed a longer lifespan occasionally living as long as 25 years the oldest recorded cow big bertha died at the age of 48 in 1993
==== udderedit ====
a cow's udder contains two pairs of mammary glands (commonly referred to as teats) creating four quarters the front ones are referred to as fore quarters and the rear ones rear quarters
==== male genitaliaedit ====
bulls become fertile at about seven months of age their fertility is closely related to the size of their testicles and one simple test of fertility is to measure the circumference of the scrotum a young bull is likely to be fertile once this reaches 28 centimetres (11 in) that of a fully adult bull may be over 40 centimetres (16 in)
bulls have a fibro-elastic penis given the small amount of erectile tissue there is little enlargement after erection the penis is quite rigid when non-erect and becomes even more rigid during erection protrusion is not affected much by erection but more by relaxation of the retractor penis muscle and straightening of the sigmoid flexure
=== weightedit ===
adult weights of cattle always depend on the breed smaller kinds such as dexter and jersey adults range between 272 to 454 kg (600 to 1,001 lb) large continental breeds such as charolais marchigiana belgian blue and chianina adults range up to 635 to 1,134 kg (1,400 to 2,500 lb) british-breeds such as hereford angus and shorthorn mature between 454 to 907 kg (1,001 to 2,000 lb) occasionally higher particularly with angus and hereford
bulls will be a bit larger than cows of the same breed by a few hundred kilograms chianina bulls can weigh up to 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) british bulls such as angus and hereford can weigh as little as 907 kg (2,000 lb) to as much as 1,361 kg (3,000 lb)
it is difficult to generalize or average out the weight of all cattle because different kinds have different averages of weights however according to some sources the average weight of all cattle is 753 kg (1,660 lb) finishing steers in the feedlot average about 640 kg (1,410 lb) cows about 725 kg (1,598 lb) and bulls about 1,090 kg (2,400 lb)
in the united states the average weights of beef cattle have steadily increased especially since the 1970s requiring the building of new slaughterhouses able to handle larger carcasses new packing plants in the 1980s stimulated a large increase in cattle weights before 1790 beef cattle averaged only 160 kg (350 lb) net and thereafter weights climbed steadily
== cognitionedit ==
in laboratory studies young cattle are able to memorize the locations of several food sources and retain this memory for at least 8 hrs although this declined after 12 hrs fifteen-month-old heifers learn more quickly than adult cows which have had either one or two calvings but their longer-term memory is less stable mature cattle perform well in spatial learning tasks and have a good long-term memory in these tests cattle tested in a radial arm maze are able to remember the locations of high-quality food for at least 30 days although they initially learn to avoid low-quality food this memory diminishes over the same duration under less artificial testing conditions young cattle showed they were able to remember the location of feed for at least 48 days cattle can make an association between a visual stimulus and food within 1 day memory of this association can be retained for 1 year despite a slight decay
calves are capable of discrimination learning and adult cattle compare favourably with small mammals in their learning ability in the closed-field test
they are also able to discriminate between familiar individuals and among humans cattle can tell the difference between familiar and unfamiliar animals of the same species (conspecifics) studies show they behave less aggressively toward familiar individuals when they are forming a new group calves can also discriminate between humans based on previous experience as shown by approaching those who handled them positively and avoiding those who handled them aversively although cattle can discriminate between humans by their faces alone they also use other cues such as the color of clothes when these are available
in audio play-back studies calves prefer their own mother's vocalizations compared to the vocalizations of an unfamiliar mother
in laboratory studies using images cattle can discriminate between images of the heads of cattle and other animal species they are also able to distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics furthermore they are able to categorize images as familiar and unfamiliar individuals
when mixed with other individuals cloned calves from the same donor form subgroups indicating that kin discrimination occurs and may be a basis of grouping behaviour it has also been shown using images of cattle that both artificially inseminated and cloned calves have similar cognitive capacities of kin and non-kin discrimination
cattle can recognize familiar individuals visual individual recognition is distinguished from mere visual discrimination recognition is a more complex mental process than discrimination it requires the recollection of the learned idiosyncratic identity of an individual that has been previously encountered and the formation of a mental representation by using 2-dimensional images of the heads of one cow (face profiles views) all the tested heifers showed individual recognition of familiar and unfamiliar individuals from their own breed furthermore almost all the heifers recognized unknown individuals from different breeds although this was achieved with greater difficulty individual recognition was most difficult when the visual features of the breed being tested were quite different from the breed in the image for example the breed being tested had no spots whereas the image was of a spotted breed
cattle use visual/brain lateralisation in their visual scanning of novel and familiar stimuli domestic cattle prefer to view novel stimuli with the left eye i.e using the right brain hemisphere (similar to horses australian magpies chicks toads and fish) but use the right eye i.e using the left hemisphere for viewing familiar stimuli
== temperament and emotionsedit ==
in cattle temperament can affect production traits such as carcass and meat quality or milk yield as well as affecting the animal's overall health and reproduction cattle temperament is defined as the consistent behavioral and physiological difference observed between individuals in response to a stressor or environmental challenge and is used to describe the relatively stable difference in the behavioral predisposition of an animal which can be related to psychobiological mechanisms generally cattle temperament is assumed to be multidimensional five underlying categories of temperament traits have been proposed
shyness-boldness
exploration-avoidance
activity
aggressiveness
sociability
in a study on holsteinfriesian heifers learning to press a panel to open a gate for access to a food reward the researchers also recorded the heart rate and behavior of the heifers when moving along the race towards the food when the heifers made clear improvements in learning they had higher heart rates and tended to move more vigorously along the race the researchers concluded this was an indication that cattle may react emotionally to their own learning improvement
negative emotional states are associated with a bias toward negative (pessimistic) responses towards ambiguous cues in judgement tasks as encapsulated in the question of is the glass half empty or half full? after separation from their mothers holstein calves showed such a cognitive bias indicative of low mood a similar study showed that after hot-iron disbudding (dehorning) calves had a similar negative bias indicating that post-operative pain following this routine procedure results in a negative change in emotional state
in studies of visual discrimination the position of the ears has been used as an indicator of emotional state when cattle are stressed this can be recognised by other cattle as it is communicated by alarm substances in the urine
cattle are very gregarious and even short-term isolation is considered to cause severe psychological stress when aubrac and fresian heifers are isolated they increase their vocalizations and experience increased heart rate and plasma cortisol concentrations these physiological changes are greater in aubracs when visual contact is re-instated vocalisations rapidly decline regardless of the familiarity of the returning cattle however heart rate decreases are greater if the returning cattle are familiar to the previously-isolated individual mirrors have been used to reduce stress in isolated cattle
== sensesedit ==
cattle use all of the five widely recognized sensory modalities these can assist in some complex behavioural patterns for example in grazing behaviour cattle eat mixed diets but when given the opportunity show a partial preference of approximately 70% clover and 30% grass this preference has a diurnal pattern with a stronger preference for clover in the morning and the proportion of grass increasing towards the evening
=== visionedit ===
vision is the dominant sense in cattle and they obtain almost 50% of their information visually
cattle are a prey animal and to assist prey detection their eyes are located on the sides of their head rather than the front this gives them a wide field of view of 330o but limits binocular vision (and therefore stereopsis) to 30o to 50o compared to 140o in humans this means they have a blind spot directly behind them cattle have good visual acuity (1/20) but compared to humans the visual accommodation of cattle is poor
cattle have two kinds of color receptors in the cone cells of their retinas this means that cattle are dichromatic as are most other non-primate land mammals there are two to three rods per cone in the fovea centralis but five to six near the optic papilla cattle can distinguish long wavelength colors (yellow orange and red) much better than the shorter wavelengths (blue grey and green) calves are able to discriminate between long (red) and short (blue) or medium (green) wavelengths but have limited ability to discriminate between the short and medium they also approach handlers more quickly under red light whilst having good color sensitivity it is not as good as humans or sheep
a common misconception about cattle (particularly bulls) is that they are enraged by the color red (something provocative is often said to be like a red flag to a bull") this is a myth in bullfighting it is the movement of the red flag or cape that irritates the bull and incites it to charge
=== tasteedit ===
cattle have a well developed sense of taste and can distinguish the four primary tastes (sweet salty bitter and sour) they possess around 20,000 taste buds the strength of taste perception depends on the individual's current food requirements they avoid bitter-tasting foods (potentially toxic) and have a marked preference for sweet (high calorific value) and salty foods (electrolyte balance) their sensitivity to sour-tasting foods helps them to maintain optimal ruminal ph
plants have low levels of sodium and cattle have developed the capacity of seeking salt by taste and smell if cattle become depleted of sodium salts they show increased locomotion directed to searching for these to assist in their search the olfactory and gustatory receptors able to detect minute amounts of sodium salts increase their sensitivity as biochemical disruption develops with sodium salt depletion
=== auditionedit ===
cattle hearing ranges from 23 hz to 35 khz their frequency of best sensitivity is 8 khz and they have a lowest threshold of 21 db (re 20 n/m2) which means their hearing is more acute than horses (lowest threshold of 7 db) sound localization acuity thresholds are an average of 30 this means that cattle are less able to localise sounds compared to goats (18) dogs (8) and humans (0.8) because cattle have a broad foveal fields of view covering almost the entire horizon they may not need very accurate locus information from their auditory systems to direct their gaze to a sound source
vocalisations are an important mode of communication amongst cattle and can provide information on the age sex dominance status and reproductive status of the caller calves can recognize their mothers using vocal and vocal behaviour may play a role by indicating estrus and competitive display by bulls
=== olfaction and gustationedit ===
cattle have a range of odiferous glands over their body including interdigital infraorbital inguinal and sebaceous glands indicating that olfaction probably plays a large role in the their social life both the primary olfactory system using the olfactory bulbs and the secondary olfactory system using the vomeronasal organ are used this latter olfactory system is used in the flehmen response there is evidence that when cattle are stressed this can be recognised by other cattle and this is communicated by alarm substances in the urine the odour of dog faeces induces behavioural changes prior to cattle feeding whereas the odours of urine from either stressed or non-stressed conspecifics and blood have no effect
in the laboratory cattle can be trained to recognise conspecific individuals using olfaction only
in general cattle use their sense of smell to expand on information detected by other sensory modalities however in the case of social and reproductive behaviours olfaction is a key source of information
=== touchedit ===
cattle have tactile sensations detected mainly by mechanoreceptors thermoreceptors and nociceptors in the skin and muzzle these are used most frequently when cattle explore their environment
=== magnetoreceptionedit ===
there is conflicting evidence for magnetoreception in cattle one study reported that resting and grazing cattle tend to align their body axes in the geomagnetic north-south (n-s) direction in a follow-up study cattle exposed to various magnetic fields directly beneath or in the vicinity of power lines trending in various magnetic directions exhibited distinct patterns of alignment however in 2011 a group of czech researchers reported their failed attempt to replicate the finding using google earth images
== behaviouredit ==
under natural conditions calves stay with their mother until weaning at 8 to 11 months heifer and bull calves are equally attached to their mothers in the first few months of life cattle are considered to be hider type animals but in the artificial environment of small calving pens close proximity between cow and calf is maintained by the mother at the first three calvings but this changes to being mediated by the calf after these primiparous dams show a higher incidence of abnormal maternal behaviour
beef-calves reared on the range suckle an average of 5.0 times each 24 hrs with an average total time of 46 mins spent suckling there is a diurnal rhythm in suckling activity with peaks between 05:0007:00 10:0013:00 and 17:0021:00 h
studies on the natural weaning of zebu cattle (bos indicus) have shown that the cow weans her calves over a 2-week period but after that she continues to show strong affiliatory behaviour with her offspring and preferentially chooses them for grooming and as grazing partners for at least 45 years
=== reproductive behaviouredit ===
semi-wild highland cattle heifers first give birth at 2 or 3 years of age and the timing of birth is synchronized with increases in natural food quality average calving interval is 391 days and calving mortality within the first year of life is 5%
=== dominance and leadershipedit ===
one study showed that over a 4-year period dominance relationships within a herd of semi-wild highland cattle were very firm there were few overt aggressive conflicts and the majority of disputes were settled by agonistic (non-aggressive competitive) behaviours that involved no physical contact between opponents (e.g threatening and spontaneous withdrawing) such agonistic behaviour reduces the risk of injury dominance status depended on age and sex with older animals generally being dominant to young ones and males dominant to females young bulls gained superior dominance status over adult cows when they reached about 2 years-of-age
as with many animal dominance hierarchies dominance-associated aggressiveness does not correlate with rank position but is closely related to rank distance between individuals
dominance is maintained in several ways cattle often engage in mock fights where they test each other's strength in a non-aggressive way licking is primarily performed by subordinates and received by dominant animals mounting is a playful behaviour shown by calves of both sexes and by bulls but not by cows however this is not a dominance related behaviour as has been found in other species
the horns of cattle are honest signals used in mate selection furthermore horned cattle attempt to keep greater distances between themselves and have fewer physical interactions than hornless cattle this leads to more stable social relationships
in calves the frequency of agonistic behavior decreases as space allowance increases but this does not occur for changes in group size however in adult cattle the number of agonistic encounters increases as the group size increases
=== grazing behaviouredit ===
when grazing cattle vary several aspects of their bite i.e tongue and jaw movements depending on characteristics of the plant they are eating bite area decreases with the density of the plants but increases with their height bite area is determined by the sweep of the tongue in one study observing 750 kg steers bite area reached a maximum of approximately 170 cm2 bite depth increases with the height of the plants by adjusting their behaviour cattle obtain heavier bites in swards that are tall and sparse compared with short dense swards of equal mass/area cattle adjust other aspects of their grazing behaviour in relation to the available food foraging velocity decreases and intake rate increases in areas of abundant palatable forage
cattle avoid grazing areas contaminated by the faeces of other cattle more strongly than they avoid areas contaminated by sheep but they do not avoid pasture contaminated by rabbit faeces
== geneticsedit ==
in the 24 april 2009 edition of the journal science a team of researchers led by the national institutes of health and the us department of agriculture reported having mapped the bovine genome the scientists found cattle have about 22,000 genes and 80% of their genes are shared with humans and they share about 1000 genes with dogs and rodents but are not found in humans using this bovine hapmap researchers can track the differences between the breeds that affect the quality of meat and milk yields
behavioral traits of cattle can be as heritable as some production traits and often the two can be related the heritability of fear varies markedly in cattle from low (0.1) to high (0.53) such high variation is also found in pigs and sheep probably due to differences in the methods used the heritability of temperament (response to isolation during handling) has been calculated as 0.36 and 0.46 for habituation to handling rangeland assessments show that the heritability of aggressiveness in cattle is around 0.36
quantitative trait loci (qtls) have been found for a range of production and behavioral characteristics for both dairy and beef cattle
== domestication and husbandryedit ==
cattle occupy a unique role in human history domesticated since at least the early neolithic
there are different views on the domestication of cattle
archeozoological and genetic data indicate that cattle were first domesticated from wild aurochs (bos primigenius) approximately 10,500 years ago there were two major areas of domestication one in the middle east/europe (the area that is now turkey) giving rise to the taurine line and a second in the indian subcontinent (the area that is now pakistan) resulting in the indicine line modern mitochondrial dna variation indicates the taurine line may have arisen from as few as 80 aurochs tamed in the upper reaches of mesopotamia near the villages of ayn tepesi in southeastern turkey and dja'de el-mughara in northern iraq
although european cattle are largely descended from the taurine lineage gene flow from african cattle (partially of indicine origin) contributed substantial genomic components to both southern european cattle breeds and their new world descendants a study on 134 breeds showed that modern taurine cattle originated from africa asia north and south america australia and europe some researchers have suggested that african taurine cattle are derived from a third independent domestication from north african aurochsen
=== usage as moneyedit ===
as early as 9000 bc both grain and cattle were used as money or as barter (davies) (the first grain remains found considered to be evidence of pre-agricultural practice date to 17,000 bc) some evidence also exists to suggest that other animals such as camels and goats may have been used as currency in some parts of the world one of the advantages of using cattle as currency is that it allows the seller to set a fixed price it even created the standard pricing for example two chickens were traded for one cow as cows were deemed to be more valuable than chickens
=== modern husbandryedit ===
cattle are often raised by allowing herds to graze on the grasses of large tracts of rangeland raising cattle in this manner allows the use of land that might be unsuitable for growing crops the most common interactions with cattle involve daily feeding cleaning and milking many routine husbandry practices involve ear tagging dehorning loading medical operations vaccinations and hoof care as well as training for agricultural shows and preparations also some cultural differences occur in working with cattle the cattle husbandry of fulani men rests on behavioural techniques whereas in europe cattle are controlled primarily by physical means such as fences breeders use cattle husbandry to reduce m bovis infection susceptibility by selective breeding and maintaining herd health to avoid concurrent disease
cattle are farmed for beef veal dairy and leather and they are less commonly used for conservation grazing simply to maintain grassland for wildlife for example in epping forest england they are often used in some of the most wild places for livestock depending on the breed cattle can survive on hill grazing heaths marshes moors and semidesert modern cattle are more commercial than older breeds and having become more specialized are less versatile for this reason many smaller farmers still favor old breeds such as the jersey dairy breed in portugal spain southern france and some latin american countries bulls are used in the activity of bullfighting jallikattu in india is a bull taming sport radically different from european bullfighting humans are unarmed and bulls are not killed in many other countries bullfighting is illegal other activities such as bull riding are seen as part of a rodeo especially in north america bull-leaping a central ritual in bronze age minoan culture (see bull (mythology)) still exists in southwestern france in modern times cattle are also entered into agricultural competitions these competitions can involve live cattle or cattle carcases in hoof and hook events
in terms of food intake by humans consumption of cattle is less efficient than of grain or vegetables with regard to land use and hence cattle grazing consumes more area than such other agricultural production when raised on grains nonetheless cattle and other forms of domesticated animals can sometimes help to use plant resources in areas not easily amenable to other forms of agriculture
=== sleepedit ===
the average sleep time of a domestic cow is about four hours a day
== economyedit ==
the meat of adult cattle is known as beef and that of calves is veal other animal parts are also used as food products including blood liver kidney heart and oxtail cattle also produce milk and dairy cattle are specifically bred to produce the large quantities of milk processed and sold for human consumption cattle today are the basis of a multibillion-dollar industry worldwide the international trade in beef for 2000 was over $30 billion and represented only 23% of world beef production the production of milk which is also made into cheese butter yogurt and other dairy products is comparable in economic size to beef production and provides an important part of the food supply for many of the world's people cattle hides used for leather to make shoes couches and clothing are another widespread product cattle remain broadly used as draft animals in many developing countries such as india cattle are also used in some sporting games including rodeo and bullfighting
=== cattle meat productionedit ===
source helgi library world bank faostat
about half the world's meat comes from cattle
=== dairyedit ===
certain breeds of cattle such as the holstein-friesian are used to produce milk which can be processed into dairy products such as milk cheese or yogurt dairy cattle are usually kept on specialized dairy farms designed for milk production most cows are milked twice per day with milk processed at a dairy which may be onsite at the farm or the milk may be shipped to a dairy plant for eventual sale of a dairy product for dairy cattle to continue producing milk they must give birth to one calf per year if the calf is male it generally is slaughtered at a young age to produce veal they will continue to produce milk until three weeks before birth over the last fifty years dairy farming has become more intensive to increase the yield of milk produced by each cow the holstein-friesian is the breed of dairy cow most common in the uk europe and the usa it has been bred selectively to produce the highest yields of milk of any cow around 22 litres per day is average in the uk
=== hidesedit ===
most cattle are not kept solely for hides which are usually a by-product of beef production hides are most commonly used for leather which can be made into a variety of product including shoes in 2012 india was the world's largest producer of cattle hides
== feral cattleedit ==

a report from the food and agriculture organization (fao) states that the livestock sector is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions the report concludes unless changes are made the damage thought to be linked to livestock may more than double by 2050 as demand for meat increases another concern is manure which if not well-managed can lead to adverse environmental consequences however manure also is a valuable source of nutrients and organic matter when used as a fertilizer manure was used as a fertilizer on about 15.8 million acres of us cropland in 2006 with manure from cattle accounting for nearly 70% of manure applications to soybeans and about 80% or more of manure applications to corn wheat barley oats and sorghum substitution of manure for synthetic fertilizers in crop production can be environmentally significant as between 43 and 88 megajoules of fossil fuel energy would be used per kg of nitrogen in manufacture of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers
one of the cited changes suggested to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is intensification of the livestock industry since intensification leads to less land for a given level of production this assertion is supported by studies of the us beef production system suggesting practices prevailing in 2007 involved 8.6% less fossil fuel use 16.3% less greenhouse gas emissions 12.1% less water use and 33.0% less land use per unit mass of beef produced than those used in 1977 the analysis took into account not only practices in feedlots but also feed production (with less feed needed in more intensive production systems) forage-based cow-calf operations and backgrounding before cattle enter a feedlot (with more beef produced per head of cattle from those sources in more intensive systems) and beef from animals derived from the dairy industry
the number of american cattle kept in confined feedlot conditions fluctuates from 1 january 2002 through 1 january 2012 there was no significant overall upward or downward trend in the number of us cattle on feed for slaughter which averaged about 14.046 million head over that period previously the number had increased it was 12.453 million in 1985 cattle on feed (for slaughter) numbered about 14.121 million on 1 january 2012 i.e about 15.5% of the estimated inventory of 90.8 million us cattle (including calves) on that date of the 14.121 million us cattle on feed (for slaughter) in operations with 1000 head or more were estimated to number 11.9 million cattle feedlots in this size category correspond to the regulatory definition of large concentrated animal feeding operations (cafos) for cattle other than mature dairy cows or veal calves significant numbers of dairy as well as beef cattle are confined in cafos defined as new and existing operations which stable or confine and feed or maintain for a total of 45 days or more in any 12-month period more than the number of animals specified where [c]rops vegetation forage growth or post-harvest residues are not sustained in the normal growing season over any portion of the lot or facility. they may be designated as small medium and large such designation of cattle cafos is according to cattle type (mature dairy cows veal calves or other) and cattle numbers but medium cafos are so designated only if they meet certain discharge criteria and small cafos are designated only on a case-by-case basis
a cafo that discharges pollutants is required to obtain a permit which requires a plan to manage nutrient runoff manure chemicals contaminants and other wastewater pursuant to the us clean water act the regulations involving cafo permitting have been extensively litigated commonly cafo wastewater and manure nutrients are applied to land at agronomic rates for use by forages or crops and it is often assumed that various constituents of wastewater and manure e.g organic contaminants and pathogens will be retained inactivated or degraded on the land with application at such rates however additional evidence is needed to test reliability of such assumptions  concerns raised by opponents of cafos have included risks of contaminated water due to feedlot runoff soil erosion human and animal exposure to toxic chemicals development of antibiotic resistant bacteria and an increase in e coli contamination while research suggests some of these impacts can be mitigated by developing wastewater treatment systems and planting cover crops in larger setback zones the union of concerned scientists released a report in 2008 concluding that cafos are generally unsustainable and externalize costs
an estimated 935,000 cattle operations were operating in the usa in 2010 in 2001 the us environmental protection agency (epa) tallied 5,990 cattle cafos then regulated consisting of beef (2,200) dairy (3,150) heifer (620) and veal operations (20) since that time the epa has established cafos as an enforcement priority epa enforcement highlights for fiscal year 2010 indicated enforcement actions against 12 cattle cafos for violations that included failures to obtain a permit failures to meet the terms of a permit and discharges of contaminated water
grazing by cattle at low intensities can create a favourable environment for native herbs and forbs in many world regions though cattle are reducing biodiversity due to overgrazing a survey of refuge managers on 123 national wildlife refuges in the us tallied 86 species of wildlife considered positively affected and 82 considered negatively affected by refuge cattle grazing or haying proper management of pastures notably managed intensive rotational grazing and grazing at low intensities can lead to less use of fossil fuel energy increased recapture of carbon dioxide fewer ammonia emissions into the atmosphere reduced soil erosion better air quality and less water pollution
some microbes in the cattle gut carry out anaerobic process known as methanogenesis which produces methane cattle and other livestock emit about 80 to 93 tg of methane per year accounting for an estimated 37% of anthropogenic methane emissions and additional methane is produced by anaerobic fermentation of manure in manure lagoons and other manure storage structures the 100-year global warming potential of methane including effects on ozone and stratospheric water vapor is 25 times as great as that of carbon dioxide methane's effect on global warming is correlated with changes in atmospheric methane content not with emissions the net change in atmospheric methane content was recently about 1 tg per year and in some recent years there has been no increase in atmospheric methane content mitigation options for reducing methane emission from ruminant enteric fermentation include genetic selection immunization rumen defaunation diet modification and grazing management among others while cattle fed forage actually produce more methane than grain-fed cattle the increase may be offset by the increased carbon recapture of pastures which recapture three times the co2 of cropland used for grain

the veterinary discipline dealing with cattle and cattle diseases (bovine veterinary) is called buiatrics veterinarians and professionals working on cattle health issues are pooled in the world association for buiatrics founded in 1960 national associations and affiliates also exist
cattle diseases were in the center of attention in the 1980s and 1990s when the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse) also known as mad cow disease was of concern cattle might catch and develop various other diseases like blackleg bluetongue foot rot too
in most state as cattle health is not only a veterinarian issue but also a public health issue public health and food safety standards and farming regulations directly affect the daily work of farmers who keep cattle however said rules change frequently and are often debated for instance in the u.k. it was proposed in 2011 that milk from tuberculosis-infected cattle should be allowed to enter the food chain internal food safety regulations might affect a country's trade policy as well for example the united states has just reviewed its beef import rules according to the mad cow standards while mexico forbids the entry of cattle who are older than 30 months
cow urine is commonly used in india for internal medical purposes it is distilled and then consumed by patients seeking treatment for a wide variety of illnesses at present no conclusive medical evidence shows this has any effect however an indian medicine containing cow urine has already obtained u.s patents
digital dermatitis is caused by the bacteria from the genus treponema it differs from foot rot and can appear under unsanitary conditions such as poor hygiene or inadequate hoof trimming among other causes it primarily affects dairy cattle and has been known to lower the quantity of milk produced however the milk quality remains unaffected cattle are also susceptible to ringworm caused by the fungus trichophyton verrucosum a contagious skin disease which may be transferred to humans exposed to infected cows
mycobacterium vaccae is a non pathogenic possibly even beneficial bacteria that is seen naturally in soil that was first isolated from cow dung

oxen (singular ox) are cattle trained as draft animals often they are adult castrated males of larger breeds although females and bulls are also used in some areas usually an ox is over four years old due to the need for training and to allow it to grow to full size oxen are used for plowing transport hauling cargo grain-grinding by trampling or by powering machines irrigation by powering pumps and wagon drawing oxen were commonly used to skid logs in forests and sometimes still are in low-impact select-cut logging oxen are most often used in teams of two paired for light work such as carting with additional pairs added when more power is required sometimes up to a total of 20 or more
an ox is a mature bovine which has learned to respond appropriately to a teamster's signals these signals are given by verbal commands or by noise (whip cracks) verbal commands vary according to dialect and local tradition in one tradition in north america the commands are
back up go backwards
gee turn right
get up walk forward
haw turn left
whoa stop
oxen can pull harder and longer than horses though not as fast as horses they are less prone to injury because they are more sure-footed
many oxen are used worldwide especially in developing countries about 11.3 million draft oxen are used in sub-saharan africa in india the number of draft cattle in 1998 was estimated at 65.7 million head about half the world's crop production is thought to depend on land preparation (such as plowing) made possible by animal traction
