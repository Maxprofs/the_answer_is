humans kidneys located abdominal cavity one side spine lie retroperitoneal position slightly oblique angle asymmetry within abdominal cavity caused position liver typically results right kidney slightly lower smaller left placed slightly middle left kidney left kidney approximately vertebral level l right slightly lower right kidney sits diaphragm posterior liver left sits diaphragm posterior spleen top kidney adrenal gland upper parts kidneys partially protected th th ribs kidney adrenal gland surrounded two layers fat perirenal pararenal fat renal fascia adult males kidney weighs grams females weight kidney grams
structure
kidney beanshaped structure convex concave border recessed area concave border renal hilum renal artery enters kidney renal vein ureter leave kidney surrounded tough fibrous tissue renal capsule surrounded perirenal fat adipose capsule renal fascia pararenal fat paranephric body anterior front surface tissues peritoneum posterior rear surface transversalis fascia
superior pole right kidney adjacent liver left kidney next spleen therefore move upon inhalation
kidney approximately cm length cm wide cm thick
substance parenchyma kidney divided two major structures outer renal cortex inner renal medulla grossly structures take shape eight coneshaped renal lobes containing renal cortex surrounding portion medulla called renal pyramid malpighi renal pyramids projections cortex called renal columns bertin columns nephrons urineproducing functional structures kidney span cortex medulla initial filtering portion nephron renal corpuscle located cortex followed renal tubule passes cortex deep medullary pyramids part renal cortex medullary ray collection renal tubules drain single collecting duct

blood supply
renal circulation supplies blood kidneys via renal arteries left right branch directly abdominal aorta despite relatively small size kidneys receive approximately cardiac output
renal artery branches segmental arteries dividing interlobar arteries penetrate renal capsule extend renal columns renal pyramids interlobar arteries supply blood arcuate arteries run boundary cortex medulla arcuate artery supplies several interlobular arteries feed afferent arterioles supply glomeruli
medullary interstitium functional space kidney beneath individual filters glomeruli rich blood vessels interstitium absorbs fluid recovered urine various conditions lead scarring congestion area cause kidney dysfunction failure
filtration occurs blood moves small network venules converge interlobular veins arteriole distribution veins follow pattern interlobular provide blood arcuate veins back interlobar veins come form renal vein exiting kidney transfusion blood

innervation
kidney nervous system communicate via renal plexus whose fibers course along renal arteries reach kidney input sympathetic nervous system triggers vasoconstriction kidney thereby reducing renal blood flow kidney also receives input parasympathetic nervous system way renal branches vagus nerve cranial nerve x function yet unclear sensory input kidney travels levels spinal cord sensed corresponding dermatome thus pain flank region may referred corresponding kidney
development
mammalian kidney develops intermediate mesoderm kidney development also called nephrogenesis proceeds series three successive developmental phases pronephros mesonephros metanephros
functions
kidney participates wholebody homeostasis regulating acidbase balance electrolyte concentrations extracellular fluid volume blood pressure kidney accomplishes homeostatic functions independently concert organs particularly endocrine system various endocrine hormones coordinate endocrine functions include renin angiotensin ii aldosterone antidiuretic hormone atrial natriuretic peptide among others
many kidneys functions accomplished relatively simple mechanisms filtration reabsorption secretion take place nephron filtration takes place renal corpuscle process cells large proteins filtered blood make ultrafiltrate eventually becomes urine kidney generates liters filtrate day reabsorbing large percentage allowing generation approximately liters urine reabsorption transport molecules ultrafiltrate blood secretion reverse process molecules transported opposite direction blood urine
excretion wastes
kidneys excrete variety waste products produced metabolism urine include nitrogenous wastes urea protein catabolism uric acid nucleic acid metabolism ability mammals birds concentrate wastes volume urine much smaller volume blood wastes extracted dependent elaborate countercurrent multiplication mechanism requires several independent nephron characteristics operate tight hairpin configuration tubules water ion permeability descending limb loop water impermeability ascending loop active ion transport ascending limb addition passive countercurrent exchange vessels carrying blood supply nephron essential enabling function
reabsorption vital nutrients
glucose normal plasma levels completely reabsorbed proximal tubule mechanism naglucose cotransporter plasma level mgdl fully saturate transporters glucose lost urine plasma glucose level approximately sufficient allow glucosuria important clinical clue diabetes mellitus
amino acids reabsorbed sodium dependent transporters proximal tubule hartnup disease deficiency tryptophan amino acid transporter results pellagra
pregnancy reduces reabsorption glucose amino acids
acidbase homeostasis
two organ systems kidneys lungs maintain acidbase homeostasis maintenance ph around relatively stable value lungs contribute acidbase homeostasis regulating carbon dioxide co concentration kidneys two important roles maintaining acidbase balance reabsorb regenerate bicarbonate urine excrete hydrogen ions fixed acids anions acids urine
osmolality regulation
significant rise plasma osmolality detected hypothalamus communicates directly posterior pituitary gland increase osmolality causes gland secrete antidiuretic hormone adh resulting water reabsorption kidney increase urine concentration two factors work together return plasma osmolality normal levels
adh binds principal cells collecting duct translocate aquaporins membrane allowing water leave normally impermeable membrane reabsorbed body vasa recta thus increasing plasma volume body
two systems create hyperosmotic medulla thus increase body plasma volume urea recycling single effect
urea usually excreted waste product kidneys however plasma blood volume low adh released aquaporins opened also permeable urea allows urea leave collecting duct medulla creating hyperosmotic solution attracts water urea reenter nephron excreted recycled depending whether adh still present
single effect describes fact ascending thick limb loop henle permeable water permeable nacl allows countercurrent exchange system whereby medulla becomes increasingly concentrated time setting osmotic gradient water follow aquaporins collecting duct opened adh
blood pressure regulation
although kidney cannot directly sense blood longterm regulation blood pressure predominantly depends upon kidney primarily occurs maintenance extracellular fluid compartment size depends plasma sodium concentration renin first series important chemical messengers make reninangiotensin system changes renin ultimately alter output system principally hormones angiotensin ii aldosterone hormone acts via multiple mechanisms increase kidneys absorption sodium chloride thereby expanding extracellular fluid compartment raising blood pressure renin levels elevated concentrations angiotensin ii aldosterone increase leading increased sodium chloride reabsorption expansion extracellular fluid compartment increase blood pressure conversely renin levels low angiotensin ii aldosterone levels decrease contracting extracellular fluid compartment decreasing blood pressure
hormone secretion
kidneys secrete variety hormones including erythropoietin enzyme renin erythropoietin released response hypoxia low levels oxygen tissue level renal circulation stimulates erythropoiesis production red blood cells bone marrow calcitriol activated form vitamin d promotes intestinal absorption calcium renal reabsorption phosphate part reninangiotensinaldosterone system renin enzyme involved regulation aldosterone levels
