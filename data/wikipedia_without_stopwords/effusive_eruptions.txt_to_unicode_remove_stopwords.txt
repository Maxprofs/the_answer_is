effusive eruption type volcanic eruption lava steadily flows volcano onto ground effusive eruption differs explosive eruption wherein magma violently fragmented expelled volcano shape lava flows created effusive eruptions governed type lava rate duration eruption slope surrounding areas
volcanic eruption effusive lowviscosity magma usually basaltic composition released earths crust effusive eruption gas escaped magma erupts forms lava flows downhill continuously type lava flow build shield volcanoes numerous hawaii
eruptions basaltic magma often transition effusive explosive eruption patterns behavior eruptions largely dependent permeability magma magma ascent rate effusive eruption occur magma must permeable enough allow expulsion gas bubbles contained within magma certain permeability threshold cannot degas erupt explosively additionally certain threshold fragmentation within magma cause explosive eruption threshold governed reynolds number dimensionless number fluid dynamics directly proportional fluid velocity eruptions effusive magma low ascent velocity higher magma ascent rates fragmentation within magma passes threshold results explosive eruptions silicic magma also exhibits transition effusive explosive eruptions fragmentation mechanism differs novarupta eruption stromboli eruption exhibited transition explosive effusive eruption patterns
effusive basalt lava flows cool either two forms phoehoe andesite lava typically forms blocky lava flows dacite lava flows often form steepsided mounds called lava domes due greater viscosity
