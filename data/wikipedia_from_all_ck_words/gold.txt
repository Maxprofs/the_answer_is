gold is a chemical element with symbol au (from latin aurum) and atomic number 79 in its purest form it is a bright slightly reddish yellow dense soft malleable and ductile metal chemically gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element it is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions the metal therefore occurs often in free elemental (native) form as nuggets or grains in rocks in veins and in alluvial deposits it occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium less commonly it occurs in minerals as gold compounds often with tellurium (gold tellurides)
gold's atomic number of 79 makes it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally in the universe it is thought to have been produced in supernova nucleosynthesis from the collision of two neutron stars and to have been present in the dust from which the solar system formed because the earth was molten when it was just formed almost all of the gold present in the early earth probably sank into the planetary core therefore most of the gold that is present today in the earth's crust and mantle is thought to have been delivered to earth later by asteroid impacts during the late heavy bombardment about 4 billion years ago
gold resists attacks by individual acids but it can be dissolved by aqua regia (nitro-hydrochloric acid literally royal water") the acid mixture causes the formation of a soluble gold tetrachloride anion gold metal also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide which are used in mining and electroplating it is insoluble in nitric acid which dissolves silver and base metals a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in items giving rise to the term acid test it dissolves in mercury though forming amalgam alloys but this is not a chemical reaction
this metal has been a valuable and highly sought-after precious metal for coinage jewelry and other arts since long before the beginning of recorded history in the past a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy within and between nations but gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the 1930s and the world gold standard was finally abandoned for a fiat currency system after 1976 the historical value of gold was rooted in its medium rarity easy handling and minting easy smelting corrosion resistance distinct color and non-reactivity to other elements
a total of 183,600 tonnes of gold have been mined in human history as of 2014 this is equivalent to 9513 m3 of gold the world consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewelry 40% in investments and 10% in industry golds high malleability ductility resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices (its chief industrial use) gold is also used in infrared shielding colored-glass production gold leafing and tooth restoration certain gold salts are still used as anti-inflammatories in medicine
== etymology ==
gold is cognate with similar words in many germanic languages deriving via proto-germanic *gul from proto-indo-european *elh- ("to shine to gleam to be yellow or green")
the symbol au is from the latin aurum the latin word for gold the proto-indo-european ancestor of aurum was *h-hus-o- meaning glow this word is derived from the same root (proto-indo-european *hues- to dawn") as *huss the ancestor of the latin word aurora dawn this etymological relationship is presumably behind the frequent claim in scientific publications that aurum meant shining dawn
== characteristics ==
gold is the most malleable of all metals a single gram can be beaten into a sheet of 1 square meter or an ounce into 300 square feet gold leaf can be beaten thin enough to become transparent the transmitted light appears greenish blue because gold strongly reflects yellow and red such semi-transparent sheets also strongly reflect infrared light making them useful as infrared (radiant heat) shields in visors of heat-resistant suits and in sun-visors for spacesuits gold is a good conductor of heat and electricity and reflects infrared radiation strongly
in addition gold is very dense a cubic meter has a mass of 19,300 kg by comparison the density of lead is 11,340 kg/m3 and that of the densest element osmium is 22,588 15 kg/m3
== chemistry ==
gold is unaffected by oxygen at any temperature similarly it does not react with ozone gold is strongly attacked by fluorine at dull-red heat to form gold(iii) fluoride
powdered gold reacts with chlorine at 180 c to form aucl3 gold reacts with bromine at 140 c to form gold(iii) bromide but reacts only very slowly with iodine to form the monoiodide
gold does not react with sulfur directly but gold(iii) sulfide can be made by passing hydrogen sulfide through a dilute solution of gold(iii) chloride or chlorauric acid
gold readily dissolves in mercury at room temperature to form an amalgam and forms alloys with many other metals at higher temperatures these alloys can be produced to modify the hardness and other metallurgical properties to control melting point or to create exotic colors
gold reacts with potassium rubidium caesium or tetramethylammonium to form the respective auride salts containing the au ion caesium auride is perhaps the most famous
gold is unaffected by most acids it does not react with hydrofluoric hydrochloric hydrobromic hydriodic sulfuric or nitric acid it does react with aqua regia a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids and with selenic acid
gold is similarly unaffected by most bases it does not react with aqueous solid or molten sodium or potassium hydroxide it does however react with sodium or potassium cyanide under alkaline conditions when oxygen is present to form soluble complexes
common oxidation states of gold include +1 (gold(i) or aurous compounds) and +3 (gold(iii) or auric compounds) gold ions in solution are readily reduced and precipitated as metal by adding any other metal as the reducing agent the added metal is oxidized and dissolves allowing the gold to be displaced from solution and be recovered as a solid precipitate
=== color ===
whereas most other pure metals are gray or silvery white gold is slightly reddish yellow this color is determined by the density of loosely bound (valence) electrons those electrons oscillate as a collective plasma medium described in terms of a quasiparticle called a plasmon the frequency of these oscillations lies in the ultraviolet range for most metals but it falls into the visible range for gold due to subtle relativistic effects that affect the orbitals around gold atoms similar effects impart a golden hue to metallic caesium
common colored gold alloys such as rose gold can be created by the addition of various amounts of copper and silver as indicated in the triangular diagram to the left alloys containing palladium or nickel are also important in commercial jewelry as these produce white gold alloys less commonly addition of manganese aluminium iron indium and other elements can produce more unusual colors of gold for various applications
=== isotopes ===
gold has only one stable isotope 197au which is also its only naturally occurring isotope so gold is both a mononuclidic and monoisotopic element thirty-six radioisotopes have been synthesized ranging in atomic mass from 169 to 205 the most stable of these is 195au with a half-life of 186.1 days the least stable is 171au which decays by proton emission with a half-life of 30 s most of gold's radioisotopes with atomic masses below 197 decay by some combination of proton emission decay and + decay the exceptions are 195au which decays by electron capture and 196au which decays most often by electron capture (93%) with a minor decay path (7%) all of gold's radioisotopes with atomic masses above 197 decay by decay
at least 32 nuclear isomers have also been characterized ranging in atomic mass from 170 to 200 within that range only 178au 180au 181au 182au and 188au do not have isomers gold's most stable isomer is 198m2au with a half-life of 2.27 days gold's least stable isomer is 177m2au with a half-life of only 7 ns 184m1au has three decay paths + decay isomeric transition and alpha decay no other isomer or isotope of gold has three decay paths
== modern applications ==
the world consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewelry 40% in investments and 10% in industry
=== jewelry ===
because of the softness of pure (24k) gold it is usually alloyed with base metals for use in jewelry altering its hardness and ductility melting point color and other properties alloys with lower carat rating typically 22k 18k 14k or 10k contain higher percentages of copper or other base metals or silver or palladium in the alloy copper is the most commonly used base metal yielding a redder color
eighteen-carat gold containing 25% copper is found in antique and russian jewelry and has a distinct though not dominant copper cast creating rose gold fourteen-carat gold-copper alloy is nearly identical in color to certain bronze alloys and both may be used to produce police and other badges blue gold can be made by alloying with iron and purple gold can be made by alloying with aluminium although rarely done except in specialized jewelry blue gold is more brittle and therefore more difficult to work with when making jewelry
fourteen- and eighteen-carat gold alloys with silver alone appear greenish-yellow and are referred to as green gold white gold alloys can be made with palladium or nickel white 18-carat gold containing 17.3% nickel 5.5% zinc and 2.2% copper is silvery in appearance nickel is toxic however and its release from nickel white gold is controlled by legislation in europe
alternative white gold alloys are available based on palladium silver and other white metals but the palladium alloys are more expensive than those using nickel high-carat white gold alloys are far more resistant to corrosion than are either pure silver or sterling silver the japanese craft of mokume-gane exploits the color contrasts between laminated colored gold alloys to produce decorative wood-grain effects
by 2014 the gold jewelry industry was escalating despite a dip in gold prices demand in the first quarter of 2014 pushed turnover to $23.7 billion according to a world gold council report
=== investment ===
many holders of gold store it in form of bullion coins or bars as a hedge against inflation or other economic disruptions however economist martin feldstein does not believe gold serves as a hedge against inflation or currency depreciation
the iso 4217 currency code of gold is xau
modern bullion coins for investment or collector purposes do not require good mechanical wear properties they are typically fine gold at 24k although the american gold eagle and the british gold sovereign continue to be minted in 22k (0.92) metal in historical tradition and the south african krugerrand first released in 1967 is also 22k (0.92) the special issue canadian gold maple leaf coin contains the highest purity gold of any bullion coin at 99.999% or 0.99999 while the popular issue canadian gold maple leaf coin has a purity of 99.99%
several other 99.99% pure gold coins are available in 2006 the united states mint began producing the american buffalo gold bullion coin with a purity of 99.99% the australian gold kangaroos were first coined in 1986 as the australian gold nugget but changed the reverse design in 1989 other modern coins include the austrian vienna philharmonic bullion coin and the chinese gold panda
=== electronics connectors ===
only 10% of the world consumption of new gold produced goes to industry but by far the most important industrial use for new gold is in fabrication of corrosion-free electrical connectors in computers and other electrical devices for example according to the world gold council a typical cell phone may contain 50 mg of gold worth about 50 cents but since nearly one billion cell phones are produced each year a gold value of 50 cents in each phone adds to $500 million in gold from just this application
though gold is attacked by free chlorine its good conductivity and general resistance to oxidation and corrosion in other environments (including resistance to non-chlorinated acids) has led to its widespread industrial use in the electronic era as a thin-layer coating on electrical connectors thereby ensuring good connection for example gold is used in the connectors of the more expensive electronics cables such as audio video and usb cables the benefit of using gold over other connector metals such as tin in these applications has been debated gold connectors are often criticized by audio-visual experts as unnecessary for most consumers and seen as simply a marketing ploy however the use of gold in other applications in electronic sliding contacts in highly humid or corrosive atmospheres and in use for contacts with a very high failure cost (certain computers communications equipment spacecraft jet aircraft engines) remains very common
besides sliding electrical contacts gold is also used in electrical contacts because of its resistance to corrosion electrical conductivity ductility and lack of toxicity switch contacts are generally subjected to more intense corrosion stress than are sliding contacts fine gold wires are used to connect semiconductor devices to their packages through a process known as wire bonding
the concentration of free electrons in gold metal is 5.901022 cm3 gold is highly conductive to electricity and has been used for electrical wiring in some high-energy applications (only silver and copper are more conductive per volume but gold has the advantage of corrosion resistance) for example gold electrical wires were used during some of the manhattan project's atomic experiments but large high-current silver wires were used in the calutron isotope separator magnets in the project
=== non-electronic industry ===
gold solder is used for joining the components of gold jewelry by high-temperature hard soldering or brazing if the work is to be of hallmarking quality gold solder must match the carat weight of the work and alloy formulas are manufactured in most industry-standard carat weights to color match yellow and white gold gold solder is usually made in at least three melting-point ranges referred to as easy medium and hard by using the hard high-melting point solder first followed by solders with progressively lower melting points goldsmiths can assemble complex items with several separate soldered joints
gold can be made into thread and used in embroidery
gold produces a deep intense red color when used as a coloring agent in cranberry glass
in photography gold toners are used to shift the color of silver bromide black-and-white prints towards brown or blue tones or to increase their stability used on sepia-toned prints gold toners produce red tones kodak published formulas for several types of gold toners which use gold as the chloride
gold is a good reflector of electromagnetic radiation such as infrared and visible light as well as radio waves it is used for the protective coatings on many artificial satellites in infrared protective faceplates in thermal-protection suits and astronauts helmets and in electronic warfare planes such as the ea-6b prowler
gold is used as the reflective layer on some high-end cds
automobiles may use gold for heat shielding mclaren uses gold foil in the engine compartment of its f1 model
gold can be manufactured so thin that it appears transparent it is used in some aircraft cockpit windows for de-icing or anti-icing by passing electricity through it the heat produced by the resistance of the gold is enough to deter ice from forming
=== commercial chemistry ===
gold is attacked by and dissolves in alkaline solutions of potassium or sodium cyanide to form the salt gold cyanidea technique that has been used in extracting metallic gold from ores in the cyanide process gold cyanide is the electrolyte used in commercial electroplating of gold onto base metals and electroforming
gold chloride (chloroauric acid) solutions are used to make colloidal gold by reduction with citrate or ascorbate ions gold chloride and gold oxide are used to make cranberry or red-colored glass which like colloidal gold suspensions contains evenly sized spherical gold nanoparticles
=== medicine ===
metallic and gold compounds have been used for medicinal purposes historically and are still in use the apparent paradox of the actual toxicology of the substance suggests the possibility of serious gaps in the understanding of the action of gold in physiology
gold (usually as the metal) is perhaps the most anciently administered medicine (apparently by shamanic practitioners) and known to dioscorides in medieval times gold was often seen as beneficial for the health in the belief that something so rare and beautiful could not be anything but healthy even some modern esotericists and forms of alternative medicine assign metallic gold a healing power
in the 19th century gold had a reputation as a nervine, a therapy for nervous disorders depression epilepsy migraine and glandular problems such as amenorrhea and impotence were treated and most notably alcoholism (keeley 1897)
only salts and radioisotopes of gold are of pharmacological value since elemental (metallic) gold is inert to all chemicals it encounters inside the body (i.e. ingested gold cannot be attacked by stomach acid) some gold salts do have anti-inflammatory properties and at present two are still used as pharmaceuticals in the treatment of arthritis and other similar conditions in the us (sodium aurothiomalate and auranofin) these drugs have been explored as a means to help to reduce the pain and swelling of rheumatoid arthritis and also (historically) against tuberculosis and some parasites
gold alloys are used in restorative dentistry especially in tooth restorations such as crowns and permanent bridges the gold alloys slight malleability facilitates the creation of a superior molar mating surface with other teeth and produces results that are generally more satisfactory than those produced by the creation of porcelain crowns the use of gold crowns in more prominent teeth such as incisors is favored in some cultures and discouraged in others
colloidal gold preparations (suspensions of gold nanoparticles) in water are intensely red-colored and can be made with tightly controlled particle sizes up to a few tens of nanometers across by reduction of gold chloride with citrate or ascorbate ions colloidal gold is used in research applications in medicine biology and materials science the technique of immunogold labeling exploits the ability of the gold particles to adsorb protein molecules onto their surfaces colloidal gold particles coated with specific antibodies can be used as probes for the presence and position of antigens on the surfaces of cells in ultrathin sections of tissues viewed by electron microscopy the immunogold labels appear as extremely dense round spots at the position of the antigen
gold or alloys of gold and palladium are applied as conductive coating to biological specimens and other non-conducting materials such as plastics and glass to be viewed in a scanning electron microscope the coating which is usually applied by sputtering with an argon plasma has a triple role in this application gold's very high electrical conductivity drains electrical charge to earth and its very high density provides stopping power for electrons in the electron beam helping to limit the depth to which the electron beam penetrates the specimen this improves definition of the position and topography of the specimen surface and increases the spatial resolution of the image gold also produces a high output of secondary electrons when irradiated by an electron beam and these low-energy electrons are the most commonly used signal source used in the scanning electron microscope
the isotope gold-198 (half-life 2.7 days) is used in nuclear medicine in some cancer treatments and for treating other diseases
=== food and drink ===
gold can be used in food and has the e number 175
gold leaf flake or dust is used on and in some gourmet foods notably sweets and drinks as decorative ingredient gold flake was used by the nobility in medieval europe as a decoration in food and drinks in the form of leaf flakes or dust either to demonstrate the host's wealth or in the belief that something that valuable and rare must be beneficial for one's health
danziger goldwasser (german gold water of danzig) or goldwasser (english goldwater) is a traditional german herbal liqueur produced in what is today gdask poland and schwabach germany and contains flakes of gold leaf there are also some expensive (~$1000) cocktails which contain flakes of gold leaf however since metallic gold is inert to all body chemistry it has no taste it provides no nutrition and it leaves the body unaltered
== monetary exchange (historical) ==
gold has been widely used throughout the world as money for efficient indirect exchange (versus barter) and to store wealth in hoards for exchange purposes mints produce standardized gold bullion coins bars and other units of fixed weight and purity
the first known coins containing gold were struck in lydia asia minor around 600 bc the talent coin of gold in use during the periods of grecian history both before and during the time of the life of homer weighed between 8.42 and 8.75 grams from an earlier preference in using silver european economies re-established the minting of gold as coinage during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries
bills (that mature into gold coin) and gold certificates (convertible into gold coin at the issuing bank) added to the circulating stock of gold standard money in most 19th century industrial economies in preparation for world war i the warring nations moved to fractional gold standards inflating their currencies to finance the war effort post-war the victorious countries most notably britain gradually restored gold-convertibility but international flows of gold via bills of exchange remained embargoed international shipments were made exclusively for bilateral trades or to pay war reparations
after world war ii gold was replaced by a system of nominally convertible currencies related by fixed exchange rates following the bretton woods system gold standards and the direct convertibility of currencies to gold have been abandoned by world governments led in 1971 by the united states refusal to redeem its dollars in gold fiat currency now fills most monetary roles switzerland was the last country to tie its currency to gold it backed 40% of its value until the swiss joined the international monetary fund in 1999
central banks continue to keep a portion of their liquid reserves as gold in some form and metals exchanges such as the london bullion market association still clear transactions denominated in gold including future delivery contracts today gold mining output is declining with the sharp growth of economies in the 20th century and increasing foreign exchange the world's gold reserves and their trading market have become a small fraction of all markets and fixed exchange rates of currencies to gold have been replaced by floating prices for gold and gold future contract though the gold stock grows by only 1 or 2% per year very little metal is irretrievably consumed inventory above ground would satisfy many decades of industrial and even artisan uses at current prices
the gold content of alloys is measured in carats (k) pure gold is designated as 24k english gold coins intended for circulation from 1526 into the 1930s were typically a standard 22k alloy called crown gold for hardness (american gold coins for circulation after 1837 contained the slightly lower amount of 0.900 fine gold or 21.6 kt)
although the prices of some platinum group metals can be much higher gold has long been considered the most desirable of precious metals and its value has been used as the standard for many currencies gold has been used as a symbol for purity value royalty and particularly roles that combine these properties gold as a sign of wealth and prestige was ridiculed by thomas more in his treatise utopia on that imaginary island gold is so abundant that it is used to make chains for slaves tableware and lavatory seats when ambassadors from other countries arrive dressed in ostentatious gold jewels and badges the utopians mistake them for menial servants paying homage instead to the most modestly dressed of their party
== cultural history ==
gold artifacts found at the nahal kana cave cemetery dated during the 1980s showed these to be from within the chalcolithic and considered the earliest find from the levant (gopher et al 1990) gold artifacts in the balkans also appear from the 4th millennium bc such as those found in the varna necropolis near lake varna in bulgaria thought by one source (la niece 2009) to be the earliest well-dated find of gold artifacts gold artifacts such as the golden hats and the nebra disk appeared in central europe from the 2nd millennium bc bronze age
egyptian hieroglyphs from as early as 2600 bc describe gold which king tushratta of the mitanni claimed was more plentiful than dirt in egypt egypt and especially nubia had the resources to make them major gold-producing areas for much of history one of the earliest known maps known as the turin papyrus map shows the plan of a gold mine in nubia together with indications of the local geology the primitive working methods are described by both strabo and diodorus siculus and included fire-setting large mines were also present across the red sea in what is now saudi arabia
the legend of the golden fleece may refer to the use of fleeces to trap gold dust from placer deposits in the ancient world gold is mentioned frequently in the old testament starting with genesis 2:11 (at havilah) the story of the golden calf and many parts of the temple including the menorah and the golden altar in the new testament it is included with the gifts of the magi in the first chapters of matthew the book of revelation 21:21 describes the city of new jerusalem as having streets made of pure gold clear as crystal exploitation of gold in the south-east corner of the black sea is said to date from the time of midas and this gold was important in the establishment of what is probably the world's earliest coinage in lydia around 610 bc from the 6th or 5th century bc the chu (state) circulated the ying yuan one kind of square gold coin
in roman metallurgy new methods for extracting gold on a large scale were developed by introducing hydraulic mining methods especially in hispania from 25 bc onwards and in dacia from 106 ad onwards one of their largest mines was at las medulas in len (spain) where seven long aqueducts enabled them to sluice most of a large alluvial deposit the mines at roia montan in transylvania were also very large and until very recently still mined by opencast methods they also exploited smaller deposits in britain such as placer and hard-rock deposits at dolaucothi the various methods they used are well described by pliny the elder in his encyclopedia naturalis historia written towards the end of the first century ad
during mansa musa's (ruler of the mali empire from 1312 to 1337) hajj to mecca in 1324 he passed through cairo in july 1324 and was reportedly accompanied by a camel train that included thousands of people and nearly a hundred camels where he gave away so much gold that it depressed the price in egypt for over a decade a contemporary arab historian remarked
gold was at a high price in egypt until they came in that year the mithqal did not go below 25 dirhams and was generally above but from that time its value fell and it cheapened in price and has remained cheap till now the mithqal does not exceed 22 dirhams or less this has been the state of affairs for about twelve years until this day by reason of the large amount of gold which they brought into egypt and spent there [...]
the european exploration of the americas was fueled in no small part by reports of the gold ornaments displayed in great profusion by native american peoples especially in mesoamerica peru ecuador and colombia the aztecs regarded gold as the product of the gods calling it literally god excrement (teocuitlatl in nahuatl) and after moctezuma ii was killed most of this gold was shipped to spain however for the indigenous peoples of north america gold was considered useless and they saw much greater value in other minerals which were directly related to their utility such as obsidian flint and slate rumors of cities filled with gold fueled legends of el dorado
gold played a role in western culture as a cause for desire and of corruption as told in children's fables such as rumpelstiltskin where the peasant's daughter turns hay into gold in return for giving up her child when she becomes a princess and the stealing of the hen that lays golden eggs in jack and the beanstalk
the top prize at the olympic games is the gold medal
75% of all gold ever produced has been extracted since 1910 it has been estimated that all the gold ever refined would form a single cube 20 m (66 ft) on a side (equivalent to 8,000 m3)
one main goal of the alchemists was to produce gold from other substances such as lead presumably by the interaction with a mythical substance called the philosopher's stone although they never succeeded in this attempt the alchemists did promote an interest in systematically finding out what can be done with substances and this laid the foundation for today's chemistry their symbol for gold was the circle with a point at its center () which was also the astrological symbol and the ancient chinese character for the sun
golden treasures have been rumored to be found at various locations following tragedies such as the jewish temple treasures in the vatican following the temple's destruction in 70 ad a gold stash on the titanic the nazi gold train following world war ii
the dome of the rock on the jerusalem temple site is covered with an ultra-thin golden glasure the sikh golden temple the harmandir sahib is a building covered with gold similarly the wat phra kaew emerald budha temple in thailand has ornamental gold statues walls and roofs some european king and queen's crowns were made of gold and gold was used for the bridal crown since antiquity an ancient talmudic text circa 100 ad describes rachel rabbi akiba's wife asking for a jerusalem of gold (crown) a greek burial crown made of gold was found in a grave circa 370 bc
== occurrence ==
gold's atomic number of 79 makes it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally traditionally gold is thought to have formed by the r-process in supernova nucleosynthesis but a relatively recent paper suggests that gold and other elements heavier than iron may also be produced in quantity by the collision of neutron stars in both cases satellite spectrometers only indirectly detect the resulting gold we have no spectroscopic evidence that [such] elements have truly been produced.
these gold nucleogenesis theories hold that the resulting explosions scattered metal-containing dusts (including heavy elements such as gold) into the region of space in which they later condensed into our solar system and the earth because the earth was molten when it was just formed almost all of the gold present on earth sank into the core most of the gold that is present today in the earth's crust and mantle is thought to have been delivered to earth later by asteroid impacts during the late heavy bombardment
the asteroid that formed vredefort crater 2.020 billion years ago is often credited with seeding the witwatersrand basin in south africa with the richest gold deposits on earth however the gold-bearing witwatersrand rocks were laid down between 700 and 950 million years before the vredefort impact these gold-bearing rocks had furthermore been covered by a thick layer of ventersdorp lavas and the transvaal supergroup of rocks before the meteor struck what the vredefort impact achieved however was to distort the witwatersrand basin in such a way that the gold-bearing rocks were brought to the present erosion surface in johannesburg on the witwatersrand just inside the rim of the original 300 km diameter crater caused by the meteor strike the discovery of the deposit in 1886 launched the witwatersrand gold rush nearly 50% of all the gold ever mined on earth has been extracted from these witwatersrand rocks
on earth gold is found in ores in rock formed from the precambrian time onward it most often occurs as a native metal typically in a metal solid solution with silver (i.e as a gold silver alloy) such alloys usually have a silver content of 810% electrum is elemental gold with more than 20% silver electrum's color runs from golden-silvery to silvery dependent upon the silver content the more silver the lower the specific gravity
native gold occurs as very small to microscopic particles embedded in rock often together with quartz or sulfide minerals such as fool's gold which is a pyrite these are called lode deposits the metal in a native state is also found in the form of free flakes grains or larger nuggets that have been eroded from rocks and end up in alluvial deposits called placer deposits such free gold is always richer at the surface of gold-bearing veins owing to the oxidation of accompanying minerals followed by weathering and washing of the dust into streams and rivers where it collects and can be welded by water action to form nuggets
gold sometimes occurs combined with tellurium as the minerals calaverite krennerite nagyagite petzite and sylvanite (see telluride minerals) and as the rare bismuthide maldonite (au2bi) and antimonide aurostibite (ausb2) gold also occurs in rare alloys with copper lead and mercury the minerals auricupride (cu3au) novodneprite (aupb3) and weishanite ((au ag)3hg2)
recent research suggests that microbes can sometimes play an important role in forming gold deposits transporting and precipitating gold to form grains and nuggets that collect in alluvial deposits
another recent study has claimed water in faults vaporizes during an earthquake depositing gold when an earthquake strikes it moves along a fault water often lubricates faults filling in fractures and jogs about 6 miles (10 kilometers) below the surface under incredible temperatures and pressures the water carries high concentrations of carbon dioxide silica and gold during an earthquake the fault jog suddenly opens wider the water inside the void instantly vaporizes flashing to steam and forcing silica which forms the mineral quartz and gold out of the fluids and onto nearby surfaces
=== seawater ===
the world's oceans contain gold measured concentrations of gold in the atlantic and northeast pacific are 50150 femtomol/l or 1030 parts per 1,000,000,000,000,000 quadrillion (about 1030 g/km3) in general gold concentrations for south atlantic and central pacific samples are the same (~50 femtomol/l) but less certain mediterranean deep waters contain slightly higher concentrations of gold (100150 femtomol/l) attributed to wind-blown dust and/or rivers at 10 parts per quadrillion the earth's oceans would hold 15,000 tonnes of gold these figures are three orders of magnitude less than reported in the literature prior to 1988 indicating contamination problems with the earlier data
a number of people have claimed to be able to economically recover gold from sea water but so far they have all been either mistaken or acted in an intentional deception prescott jernegan ran a gold-from-seawater swindle in the united states in the 1890s a british fraudster ran the same scam in england in the early 1900s fritz haber (the german inventor of the haber process) did research on the extraction of gold from sea water in an effort to help pay germany's reparations following world war i based on the published values of 2 to 64 ppb of gold in seawater a commercially successful extraction seemed possible after analysis of 4,000 water samples yielding an average of 0.004 ppb it became clear that the extraction would not be possible and he stopped the project no commercially viable mechanism for performing gold extraction from sea water has yet been identified gold synthesis is not economically viable and is unlikely to become so in the foreseeable future

== production ==
at the end of 2009 it was estimated that all the gold ever mined totaled 165,000 tonnes this can be represented by a cube with an edge length of about 20.28 meters at $1,600 per troy ounce 165,000 metric tonnes of gold would have a value of $8.5 trillion
world production for 2013 was at 2,800 tonnes compared to 2,260 tonnes for 2008
== mining ==
since the 1880s south africa has been the source for a large proportion of the world's gold supply with about 50% of all gold ever produced having come from south africa production in 1970 accounted for 79% of the world supply producing about 1,480 tonnes in 2007 china (with 276 tonnes) overtook south africa as the world's largest gold producer the first time since 1905 that south africa has not been the largest
as of 2013 china was the world's leading gold-mining country followed in order by australia the united states russia and peru south africa which had dominated world gold production for most of the 20th century had declined to sixth place other major producers are the ghana burkina faso mali indonesia and uzbekistan
in south america the controversial project pascua lama aims at exploitation of rich fields in the high mountains of atacama desert at the border between chile and argentina
today about one-quarter of the world gold output is estimated to originate from artisanal or small scale mining
the city of johannesburg located in south africa was founded as a result of the witwatersrand gold rush which resulted in the discovery of some of the largest gold deposits the world has ever seen the gold fields are confined to the northern and north-western edges of the witwatersrand basin which is a 57 km thick layer of archean rocks located in most places deep under the free state gauteng and surrounding provinces these witwatersrand rocks are exposed at the surface on the witwatersrand in and around johannesburg but also in isolated patches to the south-east and south-west of johannesburg as well as in an arc around the vredefort dome which lies close to the center of the witwatersrand basin from these surface exposures the basin dips extensively requiring some of the mining to occur at depths of nearly 4000 m making them especially the savuka and tautona mines to the south-west of johannesburg the deepest mines on earth the gold is found only in six areas where archean rivers from the north and north-west formed extensive pebbly braided river deltas before draining into the witwatersrand sea where the rest of the witwatersrand sediments were deposited
the second boer war of 18991901 between the british empire and the afrikaner boers was at least partly over the rights of miners and possession of the gold wealth in south africa
=== prospecting ===
during the 19th century gold rushes occurred whenever large gold deposits were discovered the first documented discovery of gold in the united states was at the reed gold mine near georgeville north carolina in 1803 the first major gold strike in the united states occurred in a small north georgia town called dahlonega further gold rushes occurred in california colorado the black hills otago in new zealand australia witwatersrand in south africa and the klondike in canada
== bioremediation ==
a sample of the fungus aspergillus niger was found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano metal complexes such as gold silver copper iron and zinc the fungus also plays a role in the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides
== extraction ==
gold extraction is most economical in large easily mined deposits ore grades as little as 0.5 mg/kg (0.5 parts per million ppm) can be economical typical ore grades in open-pit mines are 15 mg/kg (15 ppm) ore grades in underground or hard rock mines are usually at least 3 mg/kg (3 ppm) because ore grades of 30 mg/kg (30 ppm) are usually needed before gold is visible to the naked eye in most gold mines the gold is invisible
the average gold mining and extraction costs were about us$317/oz in 2007 but these can vary widely depending on mining type and ore quality global mine production amounted to 2,471.1 tonnes
=== refining ===
after initial production gold is often subsequently refined industrially by the wohlwill process which is based on electrolysis or by the miller process that is chlorination in the melt the wohlwill process results in higher purity but is more complex and is only applied in small-scale installations other methods of assaying and purifying smaller amounts of gold include parting and inquartation as well as cupellation or refining methods based on the dissolution of gold in aqua regia
== synthesis from other elements ==
gold was synthesized from mercury by neutron bombardment in 1941 but the isotopes of gold produced were all radioactive in 1924 a japanese physicist hantaro nagaoka accomplished the same feat
gold can currently be manufactured in a nuclear reactor by irradiation either of platinum or mercury
only the mercury isotope 196hg which occurs with a frequency of 0.15% in natural mercury can be converted to gold by neutron capture and following electron capture-decay into 197au with slow neutrons other mercury isotopes are converted when irradiated with slow neutrons into one another or formed mercury isotopes which beta decay into thallium
using fast neutrons the mercury isotope 198hg which composes 9.97% of natural mercury can be converted by splitting off a neutron and becoming 197hg which then disintegrates to stable gold this reaction however possesses a smaller activation cross-section and is feasible only with un-moderated reactors
it is also possible to eject several neutrons with very high energy into the other mercury isotopes in order to form 197hg however such high-energy neutrons can be produced only by particle accelerators
== consumption ==
the consumption of gold produced in the world is about 50% in jewelry 40% in investments and 10% in industry
according to world gold council china is the world's largest single consumer of gold in 2013 and toppled india for the first time with chinese consumption increasing by 32 percent in a year while that of india only rose by 13 percent and world consumption rose by 21 percent unlike india where gold is used for mainly for jewellery china uses gold for manufacturing and retail
== pollution ==
gold production is associated with contribution to hazardous pollution
low-grade gold ore may contain less than one ppm gold metal such ore is ground and mixed with sodium cyanide dissolve the gold cyanide is a highly poisonous chemical which can kill living creatures when exposed in minute quantities many cyanide spills from gold mines have occurred in both developed and developing countries which killed aquatic life in long stretches of affected rivers environmentalists consider these events major environmental disasters thirty tons of used ore is dumped as waste for producing one troy ounce of gold gold ore dumps are the source of many heavy elements such as cadmium lead zinc copper arsenic selenium and mercury when sulfide bearing minerals in these ore dumps are exposed to air and water the sulfide transforms into sulfuric acid which in turn dissolves these heavy metals facilitating their passage into surface water and ground water this process is called acid mine drainage these gold ore dumps are long term highly hazardous wastes second only to nuclear waste dumps
it was once common to use of mercury to recover gold from ore but today the use of mercury is largely limited to small-scale individual miners minute quantities of mercury compounds can reach water bodies causing heavy metal contamination mercury can then enter into the human food chain in the form of methylmercury mercury poisoning in humans causes incurable brain function damage and severe retardation
gold extraction is also a highly energy intensive industry extracting ore from deep mines and grinding the large quantity of ore for further chemical extraction requires nearly 25 kwh of electricity per gram of gold produced
== chemistry ==
although gold is the most noble of the noble metals it still forms many diverse compounds the oxidation state of gold in its compounds ranges from 1 to +5 but au(i) and au(iii) dominate its chemistry au(i) referred to as the aurous ion is the most common oxidation state with soft ligands such as thioethers thiolates and tertiary phosphines au(i) compounds are typically linear a good example is au(cn)2 which is the soluble form of gold encountered in mining curiously aurous complexes of water are rare the binary gold halides such as aucl form zigzag polymeric chains again featuring linear coordination at au most drugs based on gold are au(i) derivatives
au(iii) (auric) is a common oxidation state and is illustrated by gold(iii) chloride au2cl6 the gold atom centers in au(iii) complexes like other d8 compounds are typically square planar with chemical bonds that have both covalent and ionic character
aqua regia a 1:3 mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid dissolves gold nitric acid oxidizes the metal to +3 ions but only in minute amounts typically undetectable in the pure acid because of the chemical equilibrium of the reaction however the ions are removed from the equilibrium by hydrochloric acid forming aucl4 ions or chloroauric acid thereby enabling further oxidation
some free halogens react with gold gold also reacts in alkaline solutions of potassium cyanide with mercury it forms an amalgam
=== less common oxidation states ===
less common oxidation states of gold include 1 +2 and +5
the 1 oxidation state occurs in compounds containing the au anion called aurides caesium auride (csau) for example crystallizes in the caesium chloride motif other aurides include those of rb+ k+ and tetramethylammonium (ch3)4n+ gold has the highest pauling electronegativity of any metal with a value of 2.54 making the auride anion relatively stable
gold(ii) compounds are usually diamagnetic with auau bonds such as [au(ch2)2p(c6h5)2]2cl2 the evaporation of a solution of au(oh)
3 in concentrated h
2so
4 produces red crystals of gold(ii) sulfate au2(so4)2 originally thought to be a mixed-valence compound it has been shown to contain au4+
2 cations analogous to the better-known mercury(i) ion hg2+
2  a noteworthy legitimate gold(ii) complex is the tetraxenonogold(ii) cation which contains xenon as a ligand found in [auxe4](sb2f11)2
gold pentafluoride along with its derivative anion auf
6 and its difluorine complex gold heptafluoride is the sole example of gold(v) the highest verified oxidation state
some gold compounds exhibit aurophilic bonding which describes the tendency of gold ions to interact at distances that are too long to be a conventional auau bond but shorter than van der waals bonding the interaction is estimated to be comparable in strength to that of a hydrogen bond
=== mixed valence compounds ===
well-defined cluster compounds are numerous in such cases gold has a fractional oxidation state a representative example is the octahedral species {au(p(c6h5)3)}62+ gold chalcogenides such as gold sulfide feature equal amounts of au(i) and au(iii)
== toxicity ==
pure metallic (elemental) gold is non-toxic and non-irritating when ingested and is sometimes used as a food decoration in the form of gold leaf metallic gold is also a component of the alcoholic drinks goldschlger gold strike and goldwasser metallic gold is approved as a food additive in the eu (e175 in the codex alimentarius) although the gold ion is toxic the acceptance of metallic gold as a food additive is due to its relative chemical inertness and resistance to being corroded or transformed into soluble salts (gold compounds) by any known chemical process which would be encountered in the human body
soluble compounds (gold salts) such as gold chloride are toxic to the liver and kidneys common cyanide salts of gold such as potassium gold cyanide used in gold electroplating are toxic by virtue of both their cyanide and gold content there are rare cases of lethal gold poisoning from potassium gold cyanide gold toxicity can be ameliorated with chelation therapy with an agent such as dimercaprol
gold metal was voted allergen of the year in 2001 by the american contact dermatitis society gold contact allergies affect mostly women despite this gold is a relatively non-potent contact allergen in comparison with metals like nickel
== price ==
gold is currently valued at around us$1,200 per troy ounce (us$39,000 per kilogram)
like other precious metals gold is measured by troy weight and by grams when it is alloyed with other metals the term carat or karat is used to indicate the purity of gold present with 24 carats being pure gold and lower ratings proportionally less the purity of a gold bar or coin can also be expressed as a decimal figure ranging from 0 to 1 known as the millesimal fineness such as 0.995 being very pure
=== history ===
the price of gold is determined through trading in the gold and derivatives markets but a procedure known as the gold fixing in london originating in september 1919 provides a daily benchmark price to the industry the afternoon fixing was introduced in 1968 to provide a price when us markets are open
historically gold coinage was widely used as currency when paper money was introduced it typically was a receipt redeemable for gold coin or bullion in a monetary system known as the gold standard a certain weight of gold was given the name of a unit of currency for a long period the united states government set the value of the us dollar so that one troy ounce was equal to $20.67 ($664.56/kg) but in 1934 the dollar was devalued to $35.00 per troy ounce ($1125.27/kg) by 1961 it was becoming hard to maintain this price and a pool of us and european banks agreed to manipulate the market to prevent further currency devaluation against increased gold demand
on 17 march 1968 economic circumstances caused the collapse of the gold pool and a two-tiered pricing scheme was established whereby gold was still used to settle international accounts at the old $35.00 per troy ounce ($1.13/g) but the price of gold on the private market was allowed to fluctuate this two-tiered pricing system was abandoned in 1975 when the price of gold was left to find its free-market level central banks still hold historical gold reserves as a store of value although the level has generally been declining the largest gold depository in the world is that of the u.s federal reserve bank in new york which holds about 3% of the gold ever mined as does the similarly laden u.s bullion depository at fort knox in 2005 the world gold council estimated total global gold supply to be 3,859 tonnes and demand to be 3,754 tonnes giving a surplus of 105 tonnes
sometime around 1970 the price began in trend to greatly increase and between 1968 and 2000 the price of gold ranged widely from a high of $850/oz ($27,300/kg) on 21 january 1980 to a low of $252.90/oz ($8,131/kg) on 21 june 1999 (london gold fixing) prices increased rapidly from 2001 but the 1980 high was not exceeded until 3 january 2008 when a new maximum of $865.35 per troy ounce was set another record price was set on 17 march 2008 at $1023.50/oz ($32,900/kg)
in late 2009 gold markets experienced renewed momentum upwards due to increased demand and a weakening us dollar on 2 december 2009 gold reached a new high closing at $1,217.23 gold further rallied hitting new highs in may 2010 after the european union debt crisis prompted further purchase of gold as a safe asset on 1 march 2011 gold hit a new all-time high of $1432.57 based on investor concerns regarding ongoing unrest in north africa as well as in the middle east
from april 2001 to august 2011 spot gold prices more than quintupled in value against the us dollar hitting a new all-time high of $1,913.50 on 23 august 2011 prompting speculation that the long secular bear market had ended and a bull market had returned however the price then began a slow decline to the $1200-per-ounce range in late 2014 and 2015
== symbolism ==
great human achievements are frequently rewarded with gold in the form of gold medals golden trophies and other decorations winners of athletic events and other graded competitions are usually awarded a gold medal many awards such as the nobel prize are made from gold as well other award statues and prizes are depicted in gold or are gold plated (such as the academy awards the golden globe awards the emmy awards the palme d'or and the british academy film awards)
aristotle in his ethics used gold symbolism when referring to what is now commonly known as the golden mean similarly gold is associated with perfect or divine principles such as in the case of the golden ratio and the golden rule
gold is further associated with the wisdom of aging and fruition the fiftieth wedding anniversary is golden our most valued or most successful latter years are sometimes considered golden years the height of a civilization is referred to as a golden age
in some forms of christianity and judaism gold has been associated both with holiness and evil in the book of exodus the golden calf is a symbol of idolatry while in the book of genesis abraham was said to be rich in gold and silver and moses was instructed to cover the mercy seat of the ark of the covenant with pure gold in byzantine iconography the halos of christ mary and the christian saints are often golden
according to christopher columbus those who had something of gold were in possession of something of great value on earth and a substance to even help souls to paradise
wedding rings have long been made of gold it is long lasting and unaffected by the passage of time and may aid in the ring symbolism of eternal vows before god and the perfection the marriage signifies in orthodox christian wedding ceremonies the wedded couple is adorned with a golden crown (though some opt for wreaths instead) during the ceremony an amalgamation of symbolic rites
in popular culture gold has many connotations but is most generally connected to terms such as good or great such as in the phrases has a heart of gold that's golden! golden moment then you're golden! and golden boy it remains a cultural symbol of wealth and through that in many societies success
== state emblem ==
in 1965 the california legislature designated gold the state mineral and mineralogical emblem
in 1968 the alaska legislature named gold the official state mineral
