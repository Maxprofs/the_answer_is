a genus (/dins/ pl genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology in the hierarchy of biological classification genus comes above species and below family in binomial nomenclature the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus
e.g. felis catus and f silvestris are two species within the genus felis felis is a genus within the family felidae
the composition of a genus is determined by a taxonomist the standards for genus classification are not strictly codified so different authorities often produce different classifications for genera there are some general practices used however including the idea that a newly defined genus should fulfill these three criteria to be descriptively useful
monophyly all descendants of an ancestral taxon are grouped together
reasonable compactness a genus should not be expanded needlessly and
distinctness with respect to evolutionarily relevant criteria i.e ecology morphology or biogeography note that dna sequences are a consequence rather than a condition of diverging evolutionary lineages except in cases where they directly inhibit gene flow (e.g postzygotic barriers)
== nameedit ==
the term comes from the latin genus ("origin type group race") a noun form cognate with gignere ("to bear to give birth to") it probably came to latin from the arabic gins meaning type linnaeus popularized its use in his 1753 species plantarum but the french botanist joseph pitton de tournefort (16561708) is considered the founder of the modern concept of genera
== useedit ==
the scientific name of a genus may be called the generic name or generic epithet it is always capitalized it plays a pivotal role in binomial nomenclature the system of naming organisms
=== binomial nomenclatureedit ===
the rules for the scientific names of organisms are laid down in the nomenclature codes which are employed by the speakers of all languages giving each species a single unique latinate name the standard way of scientifically describing species and other lower-ranked taxa is by binomial nomenclature the generic name forms its first half for example the gray wolf's binomial name is canis lupus with canis (lat dog") being the generic name shared by the wolf's close relatives and lupus (lat wolf") being the specific name particular to the wolf the specific name is written in lower-case and may be followed by subspecies names in zoology or a variety of infraspecific names in botany especially with these longer names when the generic name is known from context it is typically shortened to its initial letter
because animals are typically only grouped within subspecies it is simply written as a trinomen with a third name for example because dogs are still so similar to wolves as to form part of their species but so distinct as to require separate treatment they are described as c lupus familiaris (lat domestic") while the wolves form many distinct subspecies including the common wolf (c lupus lupus) and the dingo (c lupus dingo) dog breeds meanwhile are not scientifically distinguished
there are several divisions of plant species and therefore their infraspecific names generally include contractions explaining the relation for example the genus hibiscus (lat marshmallow") includes hundreds of other species apart from the rose of sharon or common garden hibiscus (h syriacus from lat syrian") rose of sharon doesn't have subspecies but has cultivars that carry desired traits such as the bright white h syriaca diana hawaiian hibiscus meanwhile includes several separate species since not all botanists agree on the divisions or names between species it is common to specify the source of the name using author abbreviations for example h arnottianus a.gray was first specified in a work by asa gray sister roe identified an immaculate white hibiscus on molokai as a separate species but d.m bates later reclassified it as a subspecies of h arnottianus it thus now appears as h arnottianus ssp immaculatus or as h arnottianus a.gray subsp immaculatus (m.j.roe) d.m.bates when it is considered a mere variety of h arnottianus it is written h arnottianus var immaculatus
=== typeedit ===
each genus should have a designated type although in practice there is a backlog of older names without one in zoology this is the type species and the generic name is permanently associated with the type specimen of its type species should the specimen turn out to be assignable to another genus the generic name linked to it becomes a junior synonym and the remaining taxa in the former genus need to be reassessed
=== identical namesedit ===
within the same kingdom one generic name can apply to only one genus this is why the platypus belongs to the genus ornithorhynchus although george shaw named it platypus in 1799 that name had already been given to a group of ambrosia beetles by johann friedrich wilhelm herbst in 1793 since beetles and platypuses are both members of the kingdom animalia the name could not be used for both johann friedrich blumenbach published the replacement name ornithorhynchus in 1800
however a genus in one kingdom is allowed to bear a scientific name that is in use as a generic name (or the name of a taxon in another rank) in a kingdom that is governed by a different nomenclature code names with the same form but applying to different taxa are called homonyms although this is discouraged by both the international code of zoological nomenclature and the international code of nomenclature for algae fungi and plants there are some five thousand such names in use in more than one kingdom for instance anura is the name of the order of frogs but also is the name of a non-current genus of plants aotus is the generic name of both golden peas and night monkeys oenanthe is the generic name of both wheatears and water dropworts prunella is the generic name of both accentors and self-heal and proboscidea is the order of elephants and the genus of devil's claws
=== higher classificationsedit ===
the type genus forms the base for higher taxonomic ranks such as the family name canidae ("canids") based on canis however this does not typically ascend more than one or two levels the order to which dogs and wolves belong is carnivora ("carnivores")
== sizeedit ==
the number of species in genera varies considerably among taxonomic groups for instance among (non-avian) reptiles which have about 1180 genera most (>300) have only 1 species ~360 have between 2 and 4 species 260 have 5-10 species ~200 have 11-50 species and only 27 genera have more than 50 species (see figure) however some insect genera such as the bee genera lasioglossum and andrena have over 1000 species each
which species are assigned to a genus is somewhat arbitrary although all species within a genus are supposed to be similar there are no objective criteria for grouping species into genera there is much debate among zoologists whether large species-rich genera should be maintained as it is extremely difficult to come up with identification keys or even character sets that distinguish all species hence many taxonomists argue in favor of breaking down large genera for instance the lizard genus anolis has been suggested to be broken down into 8 or so different genera which would bring its ~400 species to smaller more manageable subsets
