== corporate history ==
=== 19231928 the silent era ===
in early 1923 kansas city missouri animator walt disney created a short film entitled alice's wonderland which featured child actress virginia davis interacting with animated characters after the bankruptcy in 1923 of his previous firm laugh-o-gram films disney moved to hollywood to join his brother roy o disney film distributor margaret j winkler of m.j winkler productions contacted disney with plans to distribute a whole series of alice comedies purchased for $1,500 per reel with disney as a production partner walt and roy disney formed disney brothers cartoon studio that same year more animated films followed after alice in january 1926 with the completion of the disney studio on hyperion street the disney brothers studio's name was changed to the walt disney studio
after the demise of the alice comedies disney developed an all-cartoon series starring his first original character oswald the lucky rabbit which was distributed by winkler pictures through universal pictures the distributor owned oswald so disney only made a few hundred dollars disney completed 26 oswald shorts before losing the contract in february 1928 due to a legal loophole when winkler's husband charles mintz took over their distribution company after failing to take over the disney studio mintz hired away four of disney's primary animators (the exception being ub iwerks) to start his own animation studio snappy comedies
=== 19281934 mickey mouse and silly symphonies ===
in 1928 to recover from the loss of oswald the lucky rabbit disney came up with the idea of a mouse character named mortimer while on a train headed to california drawing up a few simple drawings the mouse was later renamed mickey mouse (disney's wife lillian disliked the sound of mortimer mouse') and starred in several disney produced films ub iwerks refined disney's initial design of mickey mouse disney's first sound film steamboat willie a cartoon starring mickey was released on november 18 1928 through pat powers distribution company it was the first mickey mouse sound cartoon released but the third to be created behind plane crazy and the gallopin gaucho steamboat willie was an immediate smash hit and its initial success was attributed not just to mickey's appeal as a character but to the fact that it was the first cartoon to feature synchronized sound disney used pat powers cinephone system created by powers using lee de forest's phonofilm system steamboat willie premiered at b s moss's colony theater in new york city now the broadway theatre disney's plane crazy and the galloping gaucho were then retrofitted with synchronized sound tracks and re-released successfully in 1929
disney continued to produce cartoons with mickey mouse and other characters and began the silly symphonies series with columbia pictures signing on as symphonies distributor in august 1929 in september 1929 theater manager harry woodin requested permission to start a mickey mouse club which walt approved in november test comics strips were sent to king features who requested additional samples to show to the publisher william randolph hearst on december 16 the walt disney studios partnership was reorganized as a corporation with the name of walt disney productions limited with a merchandising division walt disney enterprises and two subsidiaries disney film recording company limited and liled realty and investment company for real estate holdings walt and his wife held 60% (6,000 shares) and roy owned 40% of wd productions on december 30 king features signed its first newspaper new york mirror to publish the mickey mouse comic strip with walt's permission
in 1932 disney signed an exclusive contract with technicolor (through the end of 1935) to produce cartoons in color beginning with flowers and trees (1932) disney released cartoons through powers celebrity pictures (19281930) columbia pictures (19301932) and united artists (19321937) the popularity of the mickey mouse series allowed disney to plan for his first feature-length animation
the feature film walt before mickey based on the book by diane disney miller featured these moments in the studio's history
=== 19341945 snow white and the seven dwarfs and world war ii ===
deciding to push the boundaries of animation even further disney began production of his first feature-length animated film in 1934 taking three years to complete snow white and the seven dwarfs premiered in december 1937 and became highest-grossing film of that time by 1939 snow white was released through rko radio pictures which had assumed distribution of disney's product in july 1937 after united artists attempted to attain future television rights to the disney shorts
using the profits from snow white disney financed the construction of a new 51-acre (210,000 m2) studio complex in burbank california the new walt disney studios in which the company is headquartered to this day was completed and open for business by the end of 1939 the following year on april 2 walt disney productions had its initial public offering
the studio continued releasing animated shorts and features such as pinocchio (1940) fantasia (1940) dumbo (1941) and bambi (1942) after world war ii began box-office profits declined when the united states entered the war after the attack on pearl harbor many of disney's animators were drafted into the armed forces the u.s and canadian governments commissioned the studio to produce training and propaganda films by 1942 90% of its 550 employees were working on war-related films films such as the feature victory through air power and the short education for death (both 1943) were meant to increase public support for the war effort even the studio's characters joined the effort as donald duck appeared in a number of comical propaganda shorts including the academy award-winning der fuehrer's face (1943)
=== 19461954 post-war and television ===
with limited staff and little operating capital during and after the war disney's feature films during much of the 1940s were package films, or collections of shorts such as the three caballeros (1944) and melody time (1948) which performed poorly at the box-office at the same time the studio began producing live-action films and documentaries song of the south (1946) and so dear to my heart (1948) featured animated segments while the true-life adventures series which included such films as seal island (1948) and the vanishing prairie (1954) were also popular eight of the films in the series won academy awards
the release of cinderella in 1950 proved that feature-length animation could still succeed in the marketplace other releases of the period included alice in wonderland (1951) and peter pan (1953) both in production before the war began and disney's first all-live action feature treasure island (1950) other early all-live-action disney films included the story of robin hood and his merrie men (1952) the sword and the rose (1953) and 20,000 leagues under the sea (1954) disney ended its distribution contract with rko in 1953 forming its own distribution arm buena vista distribution
in december 1950 walt disney productions and the coca-cola company teamed up for disney's first venture into television the nbc television network special an hour in wonderland in october 1954 the abc network launched disney's first regular television series disneyland which would go on to become one of the longest-running primetime series in history disneyland allowed disney a platform to introduce new projects and broadcast older ones and abc became disney's partner in the financing and development of disney's next venture located in the middle of an orange grove near anaheim california it was the first phase of a long corporate relationship which although no one could have anticipated it at the time would culminate four decades later in the disney company's acquisition of the abc network its owned and operated stations and its numerous cable and publishing ventures
=== 19551965 disneyland ===
in 1954 walt disney used his disneyland series to unveil what would become disneyland an idea conceived out of a desire for a place where parents and children could both have fun at the same time on july 18 1955 walt disney opened disneyland to the general public on july 17 1955 disneyland was previewed with a live television broadcast hosted by art linkletter and ronald reagan after a shaky start disneyland continued to grow and attract visitors from across the country and around the world a major expansion in 1959 included the addition of america's first monorail system
for the 1964 new york world's fair disney prepared four separate attractions for various sponsors each of which would find its way to disneyland in one form or another during this time walt disney was also secretly scouting out new sites for a second disney theme park in november 1965 disney world was announced with plans for theme parks hotels and even a model city on thousands of acres of land purchased outside of orlando florida
disney continued to focus its talents on television throughout the 1950s its weekday afternoon children's television program the mickey mouse club featuring its roster of young mouseketeers premiered in 1955 to great success as did the davy crockett miniseries starring fess parker and broadcast on the disneyland anthology show two years later the zorro series would prove just as popular running for two seasons on abc despite such success walt disney productions invested little into television ventures in the 1960s with the exception of the long-running anthology series later known as the wonderful world of disney
disney's film studios stayed busy as well averaging five or six releases per year during this period while the production of shorts slowed significantly during the 1950s and 1960s the studio released a number of popular animated features like lady and the tramp (1955) sleeping beauty (1959) and one hundred and one dalmatians (1961) which introduced a new xerography process to transfer the drawings to animation cels disney's live-action releases were spread across a number of genres including historical fiction (johnny tremain 1957) adaptations of children's books (pollyanna 1960) and modern-day comedies (the shaggy dog 1959) disney's most successful film of the 1960s was a live action/animated musical adaptation of mary poppins which was one of the all-time highest grossing movies and received five academy awards including best actress for julie andrews and best song for robert b sherman & richard m sherman for chim chim cher-ee 
the theme park design and architectural group became so integral to the disney studio's operations that the studio bought it on february 5 1965 along with the wed enterprises name
=== 19661971 the deaths of walt and roy disney and the opening of walt disney world ===
on december 15 1966 walt disney died of complications relating to lung cancer and roy disney took over as chairman ceo and president of the company one of his first acts was to rename disney world as walt disney world in honor of his brother and his vision

=== 19721984 theatrical malaise and new leadership ===
while walt disney productions continued releasing family-friendly films throughout the 1970s such as escape to witch mountain (1975) and freaky friday (1976) the films did not fare as well at the box office as earlier material however the animation studio saw success with robin hood (1973) the rescuers (1977) and the fox and the hound (1981)
as head of the studio miller attempted to make films to drive the profitable teenage market who generally passed on seeing disney movies inspired by the popularity of star wars the disney studio produced the science-fiction adventure the black hole in 1979 that cost $20 million to make but was lost in star wars wake the black hole was the first disney production to carry a pg rating in the united states disney dabbled in the horror genre with the watcher in the woods and financed the boldly innovative tron both films were released to minimal success
disney also hired outside producers for film projects which had never been done before in the studio's history in 1979 disney entered a joint venture with paramount pictures on the production of the 1980 film adaptation of popeye and dragonslayer (1981) the first time disney collaborated with another studio paramount distributed disney films in canada at the time and it was hoped that disney's marketing prestige would help sell the two films
finally in 1982 the disney family sold the naming rights and rail-based attractions to the disney film studio for 818,461 shares of disney stock then worth $42.6 million none of which went to retlaw also roy e disney objected to the overvalued purchase price of the naming right and voted against the purchase as a disney board director the 1983 release of mickey's christmas carol began a string of successful movies starting with never cry wolf and the ray bradbury adaptation something wicked this way comes the walt productions film division was incorporated on 000000001983-04-01-0000april 1 1983 as walt disney pictures in 1984 disney ceo ron miller created touchstone films as a brand for disney to release more major release motion pictures touchstone's first release was the comedy splash (1984) which was a box office success
with the wonderful world of disney remaining a prime-time staple disney returned to television in the 1970s with syndicated programing such as the anthology series the mouse factory and a brief revival of the mickey mouse club in 1980 disney launched walt disney home video to take advantage of the newly emerging videocassette market on april 18 1983 the disney channel debuted as a subscription-level channel on cable systems nationwide featuring its large library of classic films and tv series along with original programming and family-friendly third-party offerings
walt disney world received much of the company's attention through the 1970s and into the 1980s in 1978 disney executives announced plans for the second walt disney world theme park epcot center which would open in october 1982 inspired by walt disney's dream of a futuristic model city epcot center was built as a permanent world's fair complete with exhibits sponsored by major american corporations as well as pavilions based on the cultures of other nations in japan the oriental land company partnered with walt disney productions to build the first disney theme park outside of the united states tokyo disneyland which opened in april 1983
despite the success of the disney channel and its new theme park creations walt disney productions was financially vulnerable its film library was valuable but offered few current successes and its leadership team was unable to keep up with other studios particularly the works of don bluth who defected from disney in 1979
by the early 1980s the parks were generating 70% of disney's income
in 1984 financier saul steinberg's reliance group holdings launched a hostile takeover bid for walt disney productions with the intent of selling off some of its operations disney bought out reliance's 11.1% stake in the company however another shareholder filed suit claiming the deal devaluated disney's stock and for disney management to retain their positions the shareholder lawsuit was settled in 1989 for a total of $45 million from disney and reliance

the katzenberg case dragged on as his contract included a portion of the film revenue from ancillary markets forever katzenberg had offered $100 to settle the case but eisner felt the original claim amount of about half a billion too much but then the ancillary market clause was found disney lawyers tried to indicate a decline situation which reveal the some of the problems in the company abc had declining rating and increasing costs while the film segment had two film failures while neither party revealed the settlement amount it is estimated at $200 million

some of disney's animated family films have drawn fire for being accused of having sexual references hidden in them among them the little mermaid (1989) aladdin (1992) and the lion king (1994) instances of sexual material hidden in some versions of the rescuers (1977) and who framed roger rabbit (1988) resulted in recalls and modifications of the films to remove such content
some religious welfare groups such as the catholic league have opposed films including priest (1994) and dogma (1999) a book called growing up gay published by disney-owned hyperion and similar publications as well as the company's extension of benefits to same-sex domestic partners spurred boycotts of disney and its advertisers by the catholic league the assemblies of god usa the american family association and other conservative groups the boycotts were discontinued by most of these organizations by 2005 in addition to these social controversies the company has been accused of human rights violations regarding the working conditions in factories that produce their merchandise
