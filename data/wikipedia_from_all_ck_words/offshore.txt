a legume (/ljum/ or /ljum/) is a plant in the family fabaceae (or leguminosae) or the fruit or seed of such a plant legumes are grown agriculturally primarily for their food grain seed (example beans and lentils or generally pulse) for livestock forage and silage and as soil-enhancing green manure legumes are notable in that most of them have symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in structures called root nodules well-known legumes include alfalfa clover peas beans lentils lupins mesquite carob soybeans peanuts and tamarind
a legume fruit is a simple dry fruit that develops from a simple carpel and usually dehisces (opens along a seam) on two sides a common name for this type of fruit is a pod although the term pod is also applied to a few other fruit types such as that of vanilla (a capsule) and of radish (a silique)
== nitrogen-fixing ability ==
many legumes (alfalfa clover peas beans lentils soybeans peanuts and others) contain symbiotic bacteria called rhizobia within root nodules of their root systems (plants belonging to the genus styphnolobium are one exception to this rule.) these bacteria have the special ability of fixing nitrogen from atmospheric molecular nitrogen (n2) into ammonia (nh3) the chemical reaction is
ammonia is then converted to another form ammonium (nh4+) usable by (some) plants by the following reaction
this arrangement means that the root nodules are sources of nitrogen for legumes making them relatively rich in plant proteins all proteins contain nitrogenous amino acids nitrogen is therefore a necessary ingredient in the production of proteins hence legumes are among the best sources of plant protein
when a legume plant dies in the field for example following the harvest all of its remaining nitrogen incorporated into amino acids inside the remaining plant parts is released back into the soil in the soil the amino acids are converted to nitrate (no3) making the nitrogen available to other plants thereby serving as fertilizer for future crops
in many traditional and organic farming practices crop rotation involving legumes is common by alternating between legumes and nonlegumes sometimes planting nonlegumes two times in a row and then a legume the field usually receives a sufficient amount of nitrogenous compounds to produce a good result even when the crop is nonleguminous legumes are sometimes referred to as green manure
== uses by humans ==
farmed legumes can belong to many agricultural classes including forage grain blooms pharmaceutical/industrial fallow/green manure and timber species most commercially farmed species fill two or more roles simultaneously depending upon their degree of maturity when harvested
forage legumes are of two broad types some like alfalfa clover vetch (vicia) stylo (stylosanthes) or arachis are sown in pasture and grazed by livestock other forage legumes such as leucaena or albizia are woody shrub or tree species that are either broken down by livestock or regularly cut by humans to provide livestock feed
grain legumes are cultivated for their seeds and are also called pulses the seeds are used for human and animal consumption or for the production of oils for industrial uses grain legumes include beans lentils lupins peas and peanuts
legume species grown for their flowers include lupins which are farmed commercially for their blooms as well as being popular in gardens worldwide industrially farmed legumes include indigofera and acacia species which are cultivated for dye and natural gum production respectively fallow/green manure legume species are cultivated to be tilled back into the soil in order to exploit the high levels of captured atmospheric nitrogen found in the roots of most legumes numerous legumes farmed for this purpose include leucaena cyamopsis and sesbania species various legume species are farmed for timber production worldwide including numerous acacia species and castanospermum australe
legume trees like the locust trees (gleditsia robinia) or the kentucky coffeetree (gymnocladus dioicus) can be used in permaculture food forests other legume trees like laburnum and the woody climbing vine wisteria are poisonous
== nutritional facts ==
legumes are a significant source of protein dietary fiber carbohydrates and micronutrients including folate thiamin manganese magnesium potassium and iron such as for cooked black beans
common examples of protein combining using legumes are indian dal and rice mexican beans with corn tortillas middle eastern hummus commonly served with pita bread and mujaddara a dish consisting mainly of rice and lentils
