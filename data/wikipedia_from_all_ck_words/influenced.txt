sex linkage is the phenotypic expression of an allele related to the allosome (sex chromosome) of the individual in autosomal chromosomes both sexes have the same probability of existing (see fisher's principle) but since humans have many more genes on the female x chromosome than on the male y chromosome these are much more common than y-linked traits
in mammals the female is homogametic with two x chromosomes (xx) while the male is the heterogametic sex with one x and one y chromosome (xy) genes on the x or y chromosome are called sex-linked in zw sex-determination system used by birds the opposite is true the male is the homogametic sex (zz) and the female is heterogametic (zw)
x-linked recessive traits are expressed in all heterogametics but are only expressed in those homogametics that are homozygous for the recessive allele for example an x-linked recessive allele in humans causes haemophilia which is much more common in males than females because they are hemizygous (see zygosity) and therefore express the trait when they inherit one mutant allele in contrast a female must inherit two mutant alleles a less frequent event since the mutant allele is rare in the population tsarevich alexei of russia was the most famous sufferer of x-linked haemophilia
the incidence of recessive x-linked phenotypes in females is the square of that in males (squaring a proportion less than one gives an outcome closer to 0 than the original) if 1 in 20 males in a human population are red-green color blind then 1 in 400 females in the population are expected to be color-blind (1/20)*(1/20) (the term color-blind is not completely accurate there are degrees of weakness in color vision and it is now called color vision deficiency'.)
x-linked traits are maternally inherited from carrier mothers or from an affected father each son born to a carrier mother has a 50% probability of inheriting the x-chromosome carrying the mutant allele there are a few y-linked traits these are inherited from father
in classical genetics a reciprocal cross is performed to test if a trait is sex-linked
== x-linked dominant inheritanceedit ==
each child of a mother affected with an x-linked dominant trait has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation and thus being affected with the disorder if only the father is affected 100% of the daughters will be affected since they inherit their father's x-chromosome and 0% of the sons will be affected since they inherit their father's y-chromosome

alport's syndrome
aarskog-scott syndrome
coffin-lowry syndrome (cls)
idiopathic hypoparathyroidism
incontinentia pigmenti
ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficiency
rett syndrome (rs)
vitamin d resistant rickets
fragile x syndrome
== x-linked recessive inheritanceedit ==
females possessing one x-linked recessive mutation are considered carriers and will generally not manifest clinical symptoms of the disorder all males possessing an x-linked recessive mutation will be affected since males have only a single x-chromosome and therefore have only one copy of x-linked genes all offspring of a carrier female have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation if the father does not carry the recessive allele all female children of an affected father will be carriers (assuming the mother is not affected or a carrier) as daughters possess their father's x-chromosome if the mother is not a carrier no male children of an affected father will be affected as males only inherit their father's y-chromosome

== sex-linked traits in other animalsedit ==
fur color in domestic cats the gene that causes orange pigment is on the x chromosome thus a calico or tortoiseshell cat with both black (or gray) and orange pigment is nearly always female
white eyes in drosophila melanogaster flies the first sex-linked gene discovered in drosophila
the first sex-linked gene ever discovered was the lacticolor x-linked recessive gene in the moth abraxas grossulariata by leonard doncaster
== related termsedit ==
it is important to distinguish between sex-linked characters which are controlled by genes on sex chromosomes and two other categories
=== sex-influenced traitsedit ===
sex-influenced or sex-conditioned traits are phenotypes affected by whether they appear in a male or female body even in a homozygous dominant or recessive female the condition may not be expressed fully example baldness in humans
=== sex-limited traitsedit ===
these are characters only expressed in one sex they may be caused by genes on either autosomal or sex chromosomes examples female sterility in drosophila and many polymorphic characters in insects especially in relation to mimicry closely linked genes on autosomes called supergenes are often responsible for the latter
