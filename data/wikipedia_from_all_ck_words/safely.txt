safety is the state of being safe (from french sauf) the condition of being protected against physical social spiritual financial political emotional occupational psychological educational or other types or consequences of failure damage error accidents harm or any other event that could be considered non-desirable safety can also be defined to be the control of recognized hazards to achieve an acceptable level of risk this can take the form of being protected from the event or from exposure to something that causes health or economical losses it can include protection of people or of possessions
== meaningsedit ==
there are two slightly different meanings of safety for example home safety may indicate a building's ability to protect against external harm events (such as weather home invasion etc.) or may indicate that its internal installations (such as appliances stairs etc.) are safe (not dangerous or harmful) for its inhabitants
discussions of safety often include mention of related terms security is such a term with time the definitions between these two have often become interchanged equated and frequently appear juxtaposed in the same sentence readers unfortunately are left to conclude whether they comprise a redundancy this confuses the uniqueness that should be reserved for each by itself when seen as unique as we intend here each term will assume its rightful place in influencing and being influenced by the other
safety is the condition of a steady state of an organization or place doing what it is supposed to do what it is supposed to do is defined in terms of public codes and standards associated architectural and engineering designs corporate vision and mission statements and operational plans and personnel policies for any organization place or function large or small safety is a normative concept it complies with situation-specific definitions of what is expected and acceptable
using this definition protection from a homes external threats and protection from its internal structural and equipment failures (see meanings above) are not two types of safety but rather two aspects of a homes steady state
in the world of everyday affairs not all goes as planned some entitys steady state is challenged this is where security science which is of more recent date enters drawing from the definition of safety then
security is the process or means physical or human of delaying preventing and otherwise protecting against external or internal defects dangers loss criminals and other individuals or actions that threaten hinder or destroy an organizations steady state and deprive it of its intended purpose for being
using this generic definition of safety it is possible to specify the elements of a security program
== limitationsedit ==
safety can be limited in relation to some guarantee or a standard of insurance to the quality and unharmful function of an object or organization it is used in order to ensure that the object or organization will do only what it is meant to do
it is important to realize that safety is relative eliminating all risk if even possible would be extremely difficult and very expensive a safe situation is one where risks of injury or property damage are low and manageable
== types of safetyedit ==
it is important to distinguish between products that meet standards that are safe and those that merely feel safe the highway safety community uses these terms
=== normative safetyedit ===
normative safety is achieved when a product or design meets applicable standards and practices for design and construction or manufacture regardless of the product's actual safety history
=== substantive safetyedit ===
substantive or objective safety occurs when the real-world safety history is favorable whether or not standards are met
=== perceived safetyedit ===
perceived or subjective safety refers to the users level of comfort and perception of risk without consideration of standards or safety history for example traffic signals are perceived as safe yet under some circumstances they can increase traffic crashes at an intersection traffic roundabouts have a generally favorable safety record yet often make drivers nervous
low perceived safety can have costs for example after the 9/11/2001 attacks many people chose to drive rather than fly despite the fact that even counting terrorist attacks flying is safer than driving perceived risk discourages people from walking and bicycling for transportation enjoyment or exercise even though the health benefits outweigh the risk of injury
=== securityedit ===
also called social safety or public safety security addresses the risk of harm due to intentional criminal acts such as assault burglary or vandalism
because of the moral issues involved security is of higher importance to many people than substantive safety for example a death due to murder is considered worse than a death in a car crash even though in many countries traffic deaths are more common than homicides
== risks and responsesedit ==
safety is generally interpreted as implying a real and significant impact on risk of death injury or damage to property in response to perceived risks many interventions may be proposed with engineering responses and regulation being two of the most common
probably the most common individual response to perceived safety issues is insurance which compensates for or provides restitution in the case of damage or loss
== system safety and reliability engineeringedit ==
system safety and reliability engineering is an engineering discipline continuous changes in technology environmental regulation and public safety concerns make the analysis of complex safety-critical systems more and more demanding
a common fallacy for example among electrical engineers regarding structure power systems is that safety issues can be readily deduced in fact safety issues have been discovered one by one over more than a century in the case mentioned in the work of many thousands of practitioners and cannot be deduced by a single individual over a few decades a knowledge of the literature the standards and custom in a field is a critical part of safety engineering a combination of theory and track record of practices is involved and track record indicates some of the areas of theory that are relevant (in the usa persons with a state license in professional engineering in electrical engineering are expected to be competent in this regard the foregoing notwithstanding but most electrical engineers have no need of the license for their work.)
safety is often seen as one of a group of related disciplines quality reliability availability maintainability and safety (availability is sometimes not mentioned on the principle that it is a simple function of reliability and maintainability.) these issues tend to determine the value of any work and deficits in any of these areas are considered to result in a cost beyond the cost of addressing the area in the first place good management is then expected to minimize total cost
== safety measuresedit ==
safety measures are activities and precautions taken to improve safety i.e reduce risk related to human health common safety measures include
chemical analysis
destructive testing of samples
drug testing of employees etc
examination of activities by specialists to minimize physical stress or increase productivity
geological surveys to determine whether land or water sources are polluted how firm the ground is at a potential building site etc
government regulation so suppliers know what standards their product is expected to meet
industry regulation so suppliers know what level of quality is expected industry regulation is often imposed to avoid potential government regulation
instruction manuals explaining how to use a product or perform an activity
instructional videos demonstrating proper use of products
root cause analysis to identify causes of a system failure and correct deficiencies
internet safety or online safety is protection of the user's safety from cyber threats or computer crime in general
periodic evaluations of employees departments etc
physical examinations to determine whether a person has a physical condition that would create a problem
safety margins/safety factors for instance a product rated to never be required to handle more than 200 pounds might be designed to fail under at least 400 pounds a safety factor of two higher numbers are used in more sensitive applications such as medical or transit safety
self-imposed regulation of various types
implementation of standard protocols and procedures so that activities are conducted in a known way
statements of ethics by industry organizations or an individual company so its employees know what is expected of them
stress testing subjects a person or product to stresses in excess of those the person or product is designed to handle to determining the breaking point
training of employees vendors product users
visual examination for dangerous situations such as emergency exits blocked because they are being used as storage areas
visual examination for flaws such as cracks peeling loose connections
x-ray analysis to see inside a sealed object such as a weld a cement wall or an airplane outer skin
== standards organizationsedit ==
a number of standards organizations exist that promulgate safety standards these may be voluntary organizations or government agencies these agencies first define the safety standards which they publish in the form of codes they are also accreditation bodies and entitle independent third parties such as testing and certification agencies to inspect and ensure compliance to the standards they defined for instance the american society of mechanical engineers (asme) formulated a certain number of safety standards in its boiler and pressure vessel code (bpvc) and accredited tv rheinland to provide certification services to guarantee product compliance to the defined safety regulations
=== united statesedit ===
==== american national standards instituteedit ====
a major american standards organization is the american national standards institute (ansi) usually members of a particular industry will voluntarily form a committee to study safety issues and propose standards those standards are then recommended to ansi which reviews and adopts them many government regulations require that products sold or used must comply with a particular ansi standard
==== government agenciesedit ====
many government agencies set safety standards for matters under their jurisdiction such as
the food and drug administration
the consumer product safety commission
the united states environmental protection agency
==== testing laboratoriesedit ====
product safety testing for the united states is largely controlled by the consumer product safety commission in addition workplace related products come under the jurisdiction of the occupational safety and health administration (osha) which certifies independent testing companies as nationally recognized testing laboratories (nrtl) see
=== european unionedit ===
==== institutionsedit ====
the european commission (ec)
the european committee for standardization (cen)
the european food safety authority (efsa)
the european safety federation (esf)
==== testing laboratoriesedit ====
the european commission provides the legal framework but the different member states may authorize test laboratories to carry out safety testing
=== other countriesedit ===
==== standards institutionsedit ====
british standards institution
canadian standards association
deutsches institut fr normung
international organization for standardization
standards australia
==== testing laboratoriesedit ====
many countries have national organizations that have accreditation to test and/or submit test reports for safety certification these are typically referred to as a notified or competent body
