in writing and typography a ligature occurs where two or more graphemes or letters are joined as a single glyph an example is the character as used in english in which the letters a and e are joined the common ampersand (&) developed from a ligature in which the handwritten latin letters e and t (spelling et meaning and") were combined
== historyedit ==
at the origin of typographical ligatures is the simple running together of letters in manuscripts already the earliest known script sumerian cuneiform includes many cases of character combinations that over the script's history gradually evolve from a ligature into an independent character in its own right ligatures figure prominently in many historical scripts notably the brahmic abugidas or the bind rune of the migration period germanic runic inscriptions
medieval scribes writing in latin increased writing speed by combining characters and by introduction of scribal abbreviation for example in blackletter letters with right-facing bowls (b o and p) and those with left-facing bowls (c e o d g and q) were written with the facing edges of the bowls superimposed in many script forms characters such as h m and n had their vertical strokes superimposed scribes also used scribal abbreviations to avoid having to write a whole character at a stroke manuscripts in the fourteenth century employed hundreds of such abbreviations
in hand writing a ligature is made by joining two or more characters in a way they wouldn't usually be either by merging their parts writing one above another or one inside another while in printing a ligature is a group of characters that is typeset as a unit and the characters don't have to be joinedfor example in some cases fi ligature prints letters f and i more separated than when they are typeset as separate letters when printing with movable type was invented around 1450 typefaces included many ligatures and additional letters as they were based on handwriting ligatures made printing with movable type easier because one block would replace frequent combinations of letters and also allowed more complex and interesting character designs which would otherwise collide with one another
ligatures began to fall out of use due to their complexity in the 20th century sans serif fonts increasingly used for body text generally avoid ligatures though notable exceptions include gill sans and futura inexpensive phototypesetting machines in the 1970s which did not require journeyman knowledge or training to operate also generally avoid them
the trend was further strengthened by the desktop publishing revolution around 1985 early computer software in particular had no way to allow for ligature substitution (the automatic use of ligatures where appropriate) and in any case most new digital fonts did not include any ligatures as most of the early pc development was designed for and in the english language which already saw ligatures as optional at best a need for ligatures was not seen ligature use fell as the number of employed traditionally trained hand compositors and hot metal typesetting machine operators dropped a designer active in the period commented that some of the worlds greatest typefaces were quickly becoming some of the worlds worst fonts.
ligatures have grown in popularity over the last twenty years however due to an increasing interest in creating computer typesetting systems that evoke classic designs and older books one of the first computer typesetting programs to take advantage of computer-driven typesetting (and later laser printers) was the tex program of donald knuth now the standard method of mathematical typesetting its default styles are explicitly based on nineteenth-century models many new fonts feature extensive ligature sets these include ff scala seria and others by martin majoor and hoefler text by jonathan hoefler mrs eaves by zuzana licko contains a particularly large set to allow designers to create ostentatious dramatic display text with a period feel a parallel use of ligatures has been in the creation of script fonts that adjust letterforms to join up and simulate handwriting effectively this increase has been caused by the increased support for other languages and alphabets in modern computing many of which use ligatures extensively this has caused the development of new digital typesetting techniques such as opentype and the incorporation of ligature support into the text display systems of os x windows and applications such as microsoft office an increasing modern trend is to use a th ligature to reduce spacing between these letters a trait with little precedent in metal type
in font programming ligatures are separated into three groups which can be activated separately standard contextual and historical standard ligatures are needed to allow the font to display without errors such as collision of characters contextual and historic ligatures may be desired (or not) by a designer to create effects or evoke old-fashioned printing

=== stylistic ligaturesedit ===
many ligatures combine f with an adjacent letter the most prominent example is (or fi rendered with two normal letters) the tittle of the i in many typefaces collides with the hood of the f when placed beside each other in a word and are combined into a single glyph with the tittle absorbed into the f other ligatures with the letter f include fj fl () ff () ffi () and ffl () ligatures for fa fe fo fr fs ft fb fh fu fy and for f followed by a full stop comma or hyphen as well as the equivalent set for the doubled ff and fft are also used though are less common
these arose because with the usual type sort for lowercase f the end of its hood is on a kern which would be damaged by collision with raised parts of the next letter
ligatures crossing the morpheme boundary of a composite word are sometimes considered incorrect especially in official german orthography as outlined in the duden an english example of this would be ff in shelfful a german example would be schifffahrt ("boat trip") some computer programs (such as tex) provide a setting to disable ligatures for german while some users have also written macros to identify which ligatures to disable
turkish distinguishes dotted and dotless i in a ligature with f (in words such as frn ("oven") and fikir ("idea")) this contrast would be obscured the fi ligature is therefore not used in turkish typography and neither are other ligatures like that for fl which would be rare anyway
remnants of the ligatures /z ("sharp s"/"esszett") and t/tz ("sharp t"/"tezett") from fraktur a family of german blackletter typefaces originally mandatory in fraktur but now employed only stylistically can be seen to this day on street signs for city squares whose name contains platz or ends in -platz instead the sz ligature has merged into a single character the german see below
sometimes ligatures for st () t () ch ct qu and th are used (e.g in the typeface linux libertine)
=== german edit ===
the german eszett (also called the scharfes s meaning sharp s) is an official letter of the alphabet in germany and austria there is no general consensus about its history its name es-zett (meaning s-z) suggests a connection of long s and z () and the latin script also knows a ligature of long s over round s (s) the latter is used as the design principle for the character in most of todays typefaces since german was mostly set in blackletter typefaces until the 1940s and those typefaces were never set in uppercase a capital version of the eszett never came into common use even though its creation was discussed since the end of the 19th century therefore the common replacement in uppercase typesetting was originally sz (mae masze) and later ss (mae masse) the ss replacement is currently the only valid spelling according to the official orthography in germany and austria for german writing in switzerland the is omitted altogether in favour of ss since 2008 the capital version () of the eszett character is part of unicode and appears in more and more typefaces the new character has not yet entered mainstream writing a new standardized german keyboard layout (din 2137-t2) includes the capital since 2012 since the end of 2010 the stndiger ausschuss fr geographische namen (stagn) suggests the new upper case character for  rather than replacing it with ss or sz for geographical names
=== letters and diacritics originating as ligaturesedit ===
as the letter w is an addition to the latin alphabet which originated in the seventh century the phoneme it represents was formerly written in various ways in old english the runic letter wynn () was used but norman influence forced wynn out of use by the 14th century the new letter w originated as two vs or us joined together developed into a legitimate letter with its own position in the alphabet because of its relative youth compared to other letters of the alphabet only a few european languages (english dutch german polish welsh maltese and walloon) use the letter in native words
the character lower case (in ancient times named sc) when used in the danish norwegian or icelandic languages or old english is not a typographic ligature it is a distinct lettera voweland when alphabetised is given a different place in the alphabetic order in modern english orthography is not considered an independent letter but a spelling variant for example encyclopdia versus encyclopaedia or encyclopedia
comes from medival latin where it was an optional ligature in some words for example neas it is still found as a variant in english and french but the trend has recently been towards printing the a and e separately similarly and  while normally printed as ligatures in french are wrongly replaced by component letters if technical restrictions require it
in german orthography the umlauted vowels   and historically arose from ae oe ue ligatures (strictly from superscript e viz a o u) it is common practice to replace them with ae oe ue digraphs when the diacritics are unavailable for example in electronic conversation while in alphabetic order they are equivalent not to ae oe ue but to simple a o u except in phone books where they are treated as equivalent to ae oe and ue (so that a name mller will appear at the same place as if it were spelled mueller - german surnames have a strongly fixed orthography either a name is spelled with or with ue) the convention in scandinavian languages is different there the umlaut vowels are treated as independent letters with positions at the end of the alphabet
the ring diacritic used in vowels such as likewise originated as an o-ligature before the replacement of the older aa with  became a de facto practice an a with another a on top (a) could sometimes be used for example in johannes bureus's runa abc-boken (1611) the uo ligature in particular saw use in early modern high german but it merged in later germanic languages with u (e.g mhg fuosz enhg fu modern german fu foot") it survives in czech where it is called krouek
the tilde diacritic used in spanish as part of the letter  representing the palatal nasal consonant and in portuguese for nasalization of a vowel originated in ligatures where n followed the base letter espanna espaa similarly the circumflex in french spelling stems from the ligature of a silent s the french portuguese catalan and old spanish letter represents a c over a z the diacritic's name cedilla means little zed
the letter hwair () used only in transliteration of the gothic language resembles a hw ligature it was introduced by philologists around 1900 to replace the digraph hv formerly used to express the phoneme in question e.g by migne in the 1860s (patrologia latina vol 18)
the byzantines had a unique o-u ligature () that while originally based on the greek alphabet's - carried over into latin alphabets as well this ligature is still seen today on icon artwork in greek orthodox churches and sometimes in graffiti or other forms of informal or decorative writing
gha () a rarely used letter based on q and g was misconstrued by the iso to be an o-i ligature due to its appearance and is thus known (to the iso and in turn unicode) as oi.
the international phonetic alphabet formerly used ligatures to represent affricate consonants of which six are encoded in unicode     and  one fricative consonant is still represented with a ligature  and the extensions to the ipa contain three more  and 
rarer ligatures also exist such as     (barred av)   which is used in medieval nordic languages for /o/ (a long close-mid back rounded vowel) as well as in some orthographies of the massachusett language to represent /u/ (a long close back rounded vowel)    which was used in medieval welsh to represent // (the voiceless lateral fricative)     and 
=== symbols originating as ligaturesedit ===
the most common ligature is the ampersand & this was originally a ligature of e and t forming the latin word et meaning and it has exactly the same use in french and in english the ampersand comes in many different forms because of its ubiquity it is generally no longer considered a ligature but a logogram
like many other ligatures it has at times been considered a letter (e.g. in early modern english) in english it is pronounced and not et except in the case of &c pronounced et cetera in most fonts it does not immediately resemble the two letters used to form it although certain typefaces (such as trebuchet ms) use the design & in the form of a ligature
similarly the dollar sign $ possibly originated as a ligature (for pesos although there are other theories as well) but is now a logogram
the spanish peseta was sometimes symbolized by a ligature (from pts) and the french franc was often symbolized by an f-r ligature ()
alchemy used a set of mostly standardized symbols many of which were ligatures (ar for aqua regia) (s inside a v for aqua vitae) (mb for a marian bath or double boiler) (vb for a vapor bath) and (aaa for amalgam) in astronomy the dwarf planet pluto is symbolized by a pl ligature 
=== digraphsedit ===
digraphs such as ll in spanish or welsh are not ligatures in the general case as the two letters are displayed as separate glyphs although written together when they are joined in handwriting or italic fonts the base form of the letters is not changed and the individual glyphs remain separate like some ligatures discussed above these digraphs may or may not be considered individual letters in their respective languages until the 1994 spelling reform the digraphs ch and ll were considered separate letters in spanish for collation purposes
the difference can be illustrated with the french digraph u which is composed of the ligature and the simplex letter u
dutch  however is somewhat more ambiguous depending on the standard used it can be considered a digraph a ligature or a letter in itself and its upper case and lower case forms are often available as a single glyph with a distinctive ligature in several professional fonts (e.g zapfino) sans serif uppercase glyphs popular in the netherlands typically use a ligature resembling a u with a broken left-hand stroke adding to the confusion dutch handwriting can render y (which is not found in native dutch words but occurs in words borrowed from other languages) as a -glyph without the dots in its lowercase form and the ij in its uppercase form looking virtually identical (only slightly bigger) when written/typed as two separate letters both should be capitalized or not to form a correctly spelled word like ijs or ijs (ice)

ligatures are not limited to latin script
the brahmic abugidas make frequent use of ligatures in consonant clusters the number of ligatures employed is language-dependent thus many more ligatures are conventionally used in devanagari when writing sanskrit than when writing hindi having 37 consonants in total the total number of ligatures that can be formed in devanagari using only two letters is 1369 though few fonts are able to render all of them in particular mangal.ttf which is included with microsoft windows indic support does not correctly handle ligatures with consonants attached to the right of the characters     and  leaving the virama attached to them and displaying the following consonant in its standard form
georgian script also includes ligature (uni) is combination of (oni) and nowadays removed letter (vie)
a number of ligatures have been employed in the greek alphabet in particular a combination of omicron () and upsilon () which later gave rise to a letter of the cyrillic script see ou (letter) among the ancient greek acrophonic numerals ligatures were common (in fact the ligature of a short-legged capital pi was a key feature of the acrophonic numeral system)
cyrillic ligatures     iotified cyrillic letters are ligatures of the early cyrillic decimal i and another vowel (ancestor of )    (descended from another ligature  an early version of ) two letters of the macedonian and serbian cyrillic alphabets lje and nje ( ) were developed in the nineteenth century as ligatures of cyrillic el and en ( ) with the soft sign () a ligature of ya () and e also exists  as do some more ligatures and 
some forms of the glagolitic script used from middle ages to the 19th century to write some slavic languages have a box-like shape that lends itself to more frequent use of ligatures
in the hebrew alphabet the letters aleph and lamed can form a ligature () the ligature appears in some pre-modern texts (mainly religious) or in judeo-arabic texts where that combination is very frequent since [] [a]l- (written aleph plus lamed in the hebrew script) is the definite article in arabic
in the arabic alphabet historically a cursive derived from the nabataean alphabet most letters shapes depend on whether they are followed (word-initial) preceded (word-final) or both (medial) by other letters for example arabic mm isolated  tripled (mmm rendering as initial medial and final)  notable are the shapes taken by lm + alif isolated  and lm + alif medial or final  unicode has a special allah ligature at u+fdf2 
urdu (one of the main languages of south asia) which uses a calligraphic version of the arabic-based nasta`liq script requires a great number of ligatures in digital typography inpage a widely used desktop publishing tool for urdu uses nasta`liq fonts with over 20,000 ligatures
in asl a ligature of the american manual alphabet is used to sign i love you from the english initialism ily it consists of the little finger of the letter i plus the thumb and forefinger of the letter l the letter y (little finger and thumb) overlaps with the other two letters
the japanese language uses two ligatures one for hiragana  which is a vertical writing ligature of the characters and  and one for katakana  which is a vertical writing ligature of the characters and  both ligatures have fallen out of use in modern japanese
lao uses three ligatures all comprising the letter (h) as a tonal language most consonant sounds in lao are represented by two consonants which will govern the tone of the syllable five consonant sounds are only represented by a single consonant letter ( () (m) (n) (l) (w)) meaning that one cannot render all the tones for words beginning with these sounds a silent indicates that the syllable should be read with the tone rules for  rather than those of the following consonant three consonants can form ligatures with the letter  += (n) += (m) and += (l) () and (w) just form clusters () and (w) (l) can also be used written in a cluster rather than as a ligature (l)
in many runic texts ligatures are common such ligatures are known as bind-runes and were optional
=== chinese ligaturesedit ===
written chinese has a long history of creating new characters by merging parts or wholes of other chinese characters however a few of these combinations do not represent morphemes but retain the original multi-character (multiple morpheme) reading and are therefore not considered true characters themselves in chinese these ligatures are called hwn () or hsh () see polysyllabic chinese characters for more
one popular ligature used on chnti decorations used for chinese lunar new year is a combination of the four characters for zhoci jnbo () meaning ushering in wealth and fortune and used as a popular new year's greeting
in 1924 du dingyou ( 18981967) created the ligature  from two of the three characters (tshgun) meaning library although it does have an assigned pronunciation of tun and appears in many dictionaries it is not a morpheme and cannot be used as such in chinese instead it is usually considered a graphic representation of tshgun
in recent years a chinese internet meme the grass mud horse has had such a ligature associated with it combining the three relevant chinese characters   and (conm)
similar to the ligatures were several two-syllable chinese characters () created in the 19th century as chinese characters for si units in chinese these units are disyllabic and standardly written with two characters as lm centimeter ( centi- meter) or qinw kilowatt however in the 19th century these were often written via compound characters pronounced disyllabically such as for or for some of these characters were also used in japan where they were pronounced with borrowed european readings instead these have now fallen out of general use but are occasionally seen
== computer typesettingedit ==
tex is an example of a computer typesetting system that makes use of ligatures automatically the computer modern roman typeface provided with tex includes the five common ligatures ff fi fl ffi and ffl when tex finds these combinations in a text it substitutes the appropriate ligature unless overridden by the typesetter opinion is divided over whether it is the job of writers or typesetters to decide where to use ligatures
the opentype font format includes features for associating multiple glyphs to a single character used for ligature substitution typesetting software may or may not implement this feature even if it is explicitly present in the font's metadata xetex is a tex typesetting engine designed to make the most of such advanced features this type of substitution used to be needed mainly for typesetting arabic texts but ligature lookups and substitutions are being put into all kinds of western latin opentype fonts in opentype there are standard liga historical hlig contextual clig and discretionary dlig ligatures these can be enabled in css3 using font-feature-settings
css also support font-variant-ligatures common-ligatures discretionary-ligatures historical-ligatures and contextual are supported
this table below shows discrete letter pairs on the left the corresponding unicode ligature in the middle column and the unicode code point on the right provided you are using an operating system and browser that can handle unicode and have the correct unicode fonts installed some or all of these will display correctly see also the provided graphic
unicode maintains that ligaturing is a presentation issue rather than a character definition issue and that for example if a modern font is asked to display h followed by r and the font has an hr ligature in it it can display the ligature. accordingly the use of the special unicode ligature characters is discouraged and no more will be encoded in any circumstances note however that ligatures such as and are never used to replace arbitrary ae or oe sequences does can never be written ds
notably microsoft word does not enable ligatures by default partly for backward compatibility reasons due to its long history this can be changed from the advanced tab of the font dialog box
