prepositions and postpositions together called adpositions (or broadly in english simply prepositions) are a class of words that express spatial or temporal relations (in under towards before) or marking various semantic roles (of for)
a preposition or postposition typically combines with a noun or pronoun or more generally a noun phrase this being called its complement or sometimes object a preposition comes before its complement a postposition comes after its complement english generally has prepositions rather than postpositions words such as in under and of precede their objects as in in england under the table of jane although there are a small handful of exceptions including ago and notwithstanding as in three days ago and financial limitations notwithstanding some languages which use a different word order have postpositions instead or have both types the phrase formed by a preposition or postposition together with its complement is called a prepositional phrase (or postpositional phrase adpositional phrase etc.) such phrases usually play an adverbial role in a sentence
a less common type of adposition is the circumposition which consists of two parts that appear on each side of the complement other terms sometimes used for particular types of adposition include ambiposition inposition and interposition some linguists use the word preposition in place of adposition regardless of the applicable word order
== terminology ==
the word preposition comes from latin prae ("before") and latin ponere ("to put") this refers to the situation in latin and greek (and in english) where such words are placed before their complement and are hence pre-positioned
in some languages including urdu turkish hindi korean and japanese the same kind of words typically come after their complement to indicate this they are called postpositions (using the prefix post- from latin post meaning behind after") there are also some cases where the function is performed by two parts coming before and after the complement this is called a circumposition (from latin circum around")
prepositions postpositions and circumpositions are collectively known as adpositions (using the latin prefix ad- meaning to") however some linguists prefer to use the well-known and longer established term preposition in place of adposition irrespective of position relative to the complement
== grammatical properties ==
an adposition typically combines with exactly one complement most often a noun phrase (or in a different analysis a determiner phrase) in english this is generally a noun (or something functioning as a noun e.g. a gerund) together with its modifiers such as adjectives articles etc the complement is sometimes called the object of the adposition the resulting phrase formed by the adposition together with its complement is called an adpositional phrase or prepositional phrase (pp) (or for specificity a postpositional or circumpositional phrase)
an adposition establishes a grammatical relationship that links its complement to another word or phrase in the context it also generally establishes a semantic relationship which may be spatial (in on under ) temporal (after during ) or of some other type (of for via ) the world atlas of language structures treats a word as an adposition if it takes a noun phrase as complement and indicates the grammatical or semantic relationship of that phrase to the verb in the containing clause
some examples of the use of english prepositions are given below in each case the prepositional phrase appears in italics and the preposition within it appears in bold the word to which the phrase expresses a relation that is the word to which the prepositional phrase is an adjunct or complement is underlined in some of the examples the same word has two prepositional phrases as adjuncts
as an adjunct to a noun
the weather in march
cheese from france with live bacteria
as a predicative expression (complement of a copula)
the key is under the stone
as an adjunct to a verb
sleep throughout the winter
danced atop the tables for hours
dispense with the formalities (see semantic functions below)
as an adjunct to an adjective
happy for them
sick until recently
in the last of these examples the complement has the form of an adverb which has been nominalised to serve as a noun phrase see different forms of complement below prepositional phrases themselves are sometimes nominalized
in the cellar was chosen as the best place to hide the bodies
an adposition may determine the grammatical case of its complement in english the complements of prepositions take the objective case where available (from him not *from he) in koine greek for example certain prepositions always take their objects in a certain case (e.g. always takes its object in the dative) while other prepositions may take their object in one of two or more cases depending on the meaning of the preposition (e.g. takes its object in the genitive or in the accusative depending on the meaning) some languages have cases that are used exclusively after prepositions (prepositional case) or special forms of pronouns for use after prepositions (prepositional pronoun)
the functions of adpositions overlap with those of case markings (for example the meaning of the english preposition of is expressed in many languages by a genitive case ending) but adpositions are classed as syntactic elements while case markings are morphological
adpositions themselves are usually non-inflecting ("invariant") they do not have paradigms of form (such as tense case gender etc.) the same way that verbs adjectives and nouns can there are exceptions though such as prepositions that have fused with a pronominal object to form inflected prepositions
the following properties are characteristic of most adpositional systems
adpositions are among the most frequently occurring words in languages that have them for example one frequency ranking for english word forms begins as follows (prepositions in bold)
the of and to a in that it is was i for on you
the most common adpositions are single monomorphemic words according to the ranking cited above for example the most common english prepositions are on in to by for with at of from as all of which are single-syllable words and cannot be broken down into smaller units of meaning
adpositions form a closed class of lexical items and cannot be productively derived from words of other categories
== classification by position ==
as noted above adpositions are referred to by various terms depending on their position relative to the complement
while the term preposition is sometimes used to denote any adposition in its stricter meaning it refers only to one which precedes its complement examples of this from english have been given above similar examples can be found in many european and other languages for example
german mit einer frau ("with a woman")
french sur la table ("on the table")
polish na stole ("on the table")
khmer [l kdakin] ("on (the) blackboard")
in certain grammatical constructions the complement of a preposition may be absent or may be moved from its position directly following the preposition this may be referred to as preposition stranding (see also below) as in who did you go with? and there's only one thing worse than being talked about. there are also some (mainly colloquial) expressions in which a preposition's complement may be omitted such as i'm going to the park do you want to come with? and the french il fait trop froid je ne suis pas habille pour ("it's too cold i'm not dressed for [the situation].") the bolded words in these examples are generally still considered prepositions because when they form a phrase with a complement (in more ordinary constructions) they must appear first
a postposition follows its complement to form a postpositional phrase examples include
latin mecum ("with me literally me with")
turkish benimle or benim ile) ("with me literally my with")
chinese zhuzi shng (lit table on") this is a nominal form which usually requires an additional preposition to form an adverbial phrase (see chinese locative phrases)
english ten months ago (ago is normally considered an adverb but is sometimes analyzed as a postposition)
some adpositions can appear either before or after their complement
english he slept through the whole night or the whole night through
german meiner meinung nach or nach meiner meinung ("in my opinion")
german die strae entlang or entlang der strae ("along the road here a different case is used when entlang precedes the noun)
an adposition like the above which can be either a preposition or a postposition can be called an ambiposition however ambiposition may also be used to refer to a circumposition (see below) or to a word that appears to function as a preposition and postposition simultaneously as in the vedic sanskrit construction (noun-1) (noun-2) meaning from (noun-1) to (noun-2)
whether a language has primarily prepositions or postpositions is seen as an aspect of its typological classification and tends to correlate with other properties related to head directionality since an adposition is regarded as the head of its phrase prepositional phrases are head-initial (or right-branching) while postpositional phrases are head-final (or left-branching) there is a tendency for languages that feature postpositions also to have other head-final features such as verbs that follow their objects and for languages that feature prepositions to have other head-initial features such as verbs that precede their objects this is only a tendency however an example of a language that behaves differently is latin which employs mostly prepositions even though it typically places verbs after their objects
a circumposition consists of two or more parts positioned on both sides of the complement circumpositions are very common in pashto and kurdish the following are examples from northern kurdish (kurmanji)
bi  re ("with")
di  de ("in for things not places)
di  re ("via through")
ji  re ("for")
ji  ve ("since")
various constructions in other languages might also be analyzed as circumpositional for example
english from now on
dutch naar het einde toe ("towards the end lit to the end to")
chinese cng bngxing l ("from the inside of the refrigerator lit from refrigerator inside")
french un dtail prs ("except for one detail lit at one detail near")
swedish fr tre timmar sedan ("three hours ago lit for three hours since")
german aus dem zimmer heraus ("out from the room lit from the room out")
most such phrases however can be analyzed as having a different hierarchical structure (such as a prepositional phrase modifying a following adverb) the chinese example could be analyzed as a prepositional phrase headed by cng ("from") taking the locative noun phrase bngxang l ("refrigerator inside") as its complement
an inposition is a rare type of adposition that appears between parts of a complex complement for example in the native californian timbisha language the phrase from a mean cold can be translated using the word order cold from mean"the inposition follows the noun but precedes any following modifiers that form part of the same noun phrase
the term interposition has been used for adpositions in structures such as word for word (french) coup sur coup ("one after another repeatedly") (russian) ("one with the other") this is not a case of an adposition appearing inside its complement as the two nouns do not form a single phrase (there is no phrase *word word for example) such uses have more of a coordinating character
== stranding ==
preposition stranding is a syntactic construct in which a preposition occurs somewhere other than immediately before its complement for example in the english sentence what did you sit on? the preposition on has what as its complement but what is moved to the start of the sentence because it is an interrogative word this sentence is much more common and natural than the equivalent sentence without stranding on what did you sit? preposition stranding is commonly found in english as well as north germanic languages such as swedish its existence in german and dutch is debated preposition stranding is also found in some nigercongo languages such as vata and gbadi and in some north american varieties of french
some prescriptive english grammars teach that prepositions cannot end a sentence although there is no rule prohibiting that use similar rules arose during the rise of classicism when they were applied to english in imitation of classical languages such as latin otto jespersen in his essentials of english grammar (first published 1933) commented on this definition-derived rule ...nor need a preposition (latin praepositio) stand before the word it governs (go the fools among (sh[akespeare]) what are you laughing at?) you might just as well believe that all blackguards are black or that turkeys come from turkey many names have either been chosen unfortunately at first or have changed their meanings in course of time.
== simple complex and improper ==
simple adpositions consist of a single word (on in for towards etc.) complex adpositions consist of a group of words that act as one unit examples of complex prepositions in english include in spite of with respect to except for by dint of and next to
the distinction between simple and complex adpositions is not clear-cut many simple adpositions are derived from complex forms (e.g. with + in within by + side beside) through grammaticalization this change takes time and during the transitional stages the adposition acts in some ways like a single word and in other ways like a multi-word unit for example current german orthographic conventions recognize the indeterminate status of certain prepositions allowing two spellings anstelle/an stelle ("instead of") aufgrund/auf grund ("because of") mithilfe/mit hilfe ("by means of") zugunsten/zu gunsten ("in favor of") zuungunsten/zu ungunsten ("to the disadvantage of") zulasten/zu lasten ("at the expense of")
the distinction between complex adpositions and free combinations of words is not a black and white issue complex adpositions (in english prepositional idioms") can be more fossilized or less fossilized in english this applies to a number of structures of the form preposition + (article) + noun + preposition such as in front of for the sake of the following characteristics are good indications that a given combination is frozen enough to be considered a complex preposition in english
it contains a word that cannot be used in any other context by dint of in lieu of
the first preposition cannot be replaced with a view to but not *for/without a view to
it is impossible to insert an article or to use a different article on account of but not *on an/the account of for the sake of but not *for a sake of
the range of possible adjectives is very limited in great favor of but not *in helpful favor of
the grammatical number of the noun cannot be changed by virtue of but not *by virtues of
it is impossible to use a possessive determiner in spite of him not *in his spite
in descriptions of some languages prepositions are divided into proper (or essential") and improper (or accidental") a preposition is called improper if it is some other part of speech being used in the same way as a preposition examples of simple and complex prepositions that have been so classified include prima di ("before") and davanti (a) ("in front of") in italian and ergo ("on account of") and causa ("for the sake of") in latin in reference to ancient greek however an improper preposition is one that cannot also serve as a prefix to a verb
== different forms of complement ==
as noted above adpositions typically have noun phrases as complements this can include nominal clauses and certain types of non-finite verb phrase
we can't agree on whether to have children or not (complement is a nominal clause)
let's think about solving this problem (complement is a gerund phrase)
pour encourager les autres (french to encourage the others complement is an infinitive phrase)
the word to when it precedes the infinitive in english may be regarded as a preposition but may be viewed as a grammatical particle outside of any main word class
in other cases the complement may have the form of an adjective or adjective phrase or an adverbial this may be regarded as a complement representing a different syntactic category or simply as an atypical form of noun phrase (see nominalization)
the scene went from blindingly bright to pitch black (complements are adjective phrases)
i worked there until recently (complement is an adverb)
come out from under the bed (complement is an adverbial)
in the last example the complement of the preposition from is in fact another prepositional phrase the resulting sequence of two prepositions (from under) may be regarded as a complex preposition in some languages such a sequence may be represented by a single word as russian - iz-pod ("from under")
some adpositions appear to combine with two complements
with sammy president we can all come out of hiding again
for sammy to become president they'd have to seriously modify the constitution
it is more commonly assumed however that sammy and the following predicate forms a small clause which then becomes the single complement of the preposition (in the first example a word such as as may be considered elided which if present would clarify the grammatical relationship.)
== semantic functions ==
adpositions can be used to express a wide range of semantic relations between their complement and the rest of the context the relations expressed may be spatial (denoting location or direction) temporal (denoting position in time) or relations expressing comparison content agent instrument means manner cause purpose reference etc
most common adpositions are highly polysemous (they have various different meanings) in many cases a primary spatial meaning becomes extended to non-spatial uses by metaphorical or other processes because of the variety of meanings a single adposition often has many possible equivalents in another language depending on the exact context in which it is used this can cause significant difficulties in foreign language learning usage can also vary between dialects of the same language (for example american english has on the weekend where british english uses at the weekend)
in some contexts (as in the case of some phrasal verbs) the choice of adposition may be determined by another element in the construction or be fixed by the construction as a whole here the adposition may have little independent semantic content of its own and there may be no clear reason why the particular adposition is used rather than another examples of such expressions are
english dispense with listen to insist on proud of good at
russian otvechat na vopros ("answer the question literally answer on the question") obvinenie v obmane ("accusation of [literally in] fraud")
spanish soar con ganar el ttulo ("dream about [lit with] winning the title") consistir en dos grupos ("consist of [lit in] two groups")
prepositions sometimes mark roles that may be considered largely grammatical
possession (in a broad sense) the pen of my aunt (sometimes marked by genitive or possessive forms)
the agent in passive constructions killed by a lone gunman
the recipient of a transfer give it to him (sometimes marked by a dative or an indirect object)
spatial meanings of adpositions may be either directional or static a directional meaning usually involves motion in a particular direction ("kay went to the store") the direction in which something leads or points ("a path into the woods") or the extent of something ("the fog stretched from london to paris") a static meaning indicates only a location ("at the store behind the chair on the moon") some prepositions can have both uses he sat in the water (static) he jumped in the water (probably directional) in some languages the case of the complement varies depending on the meaning as with several prepositions in german such as in
in seinem zimmer ("in his room static meaning takes the dative)
in sein zimmer ("into his room directional meaning takes the accusative)
in english and many other languages prepositional phrases with static meaning are commonly used as predicative expressions after a copula ("bob is at the store") this may happen with some directional prepositions as well ("bob is from australia") but this is less common directional prepositional phrases combine mostly with verbs that indicate movement ("jay is going into her bedroom but not *"jay is lying down into her bedroom")
directional meanings can be further divided into telic and atelic telic prepositional phrases imply movement all the way to the endpoint ("she ran to the fence") while atelic ones do not ("she ran towards the fence")
static meanings can be divided into projective and non-projective where projective meanings are those whose understanding requires knowledge of the perspective or point of view for example the meaning of behind the rock is likely to depend on the position of the speaker (projective) whereas the meaning of on the desk is not (non-projective) sometimes the interpretation is ambiguous as in behind the house which may mean either at the natural back of the house or on the opposite side of the house from the speaker
== overlaps with other categories ==
=== adverbs and particles ===
there are often similarities in form between adpositions and adverbs some adverbs are derived from the fusion of a preposition and its complement (such as downstairs from down (the) stairs and underground from under (the) ground) some words can function both as adverbs and as prepositions such as inside aboard underneath (for instance one can say go inside with adverbial use or go inside the house with prepositional use) such cases are analogous to verbs that can be used either transitively or intransitively and the adverbial forms might therefore be analyzed as intransitive prepositions this analysis could also be extended to other adverbs such as here there afterwards etc. even though these never take complements
many english phrasal verbs contain particles that are used adverbially even though they mostly have the form of a preposition (such words may be called prepositional adverbs) examples are on in carry on get on etc. over in take over fall over and so on the equivalents in dutch and german are separable prefixes which also often have the same form as prepositions for example dutch aanbieden and german anbieten (both meaning to offer") contain the separable prefix aan/an which is also a preposition meaning on or to
=== conjunctions ===
some words can be used both as adpositions and as subordinating conjunctions
(preposition) before/after/since the end of the summer
(conjunction) before/after/since the summer ended
(preposition) it looks like another rainy day
(conjunction) it looks like it's going to rain again today
it would be possible to analyze such conjunctions (or even other subordinating conjunctions) as prepositions that take an entire clause as a complement
=== verbs ===
in some languages including a number of chinese varieties many of the words that serve as prepositions can also be used as verbs for instance in standard chinese do can be used in either a prepositional or a verbal sense
w do bijng q ("i go to beijing q meaning to go is the main verb do is prepositional meaning to")
w do le ("i have arrived do is the main verb meaning to arrive")
because of this overlap and the fact that a sequence of prepositional phrase and verb phrase often resembles a serial verb construction chinese prepositions (and those of other languages with similar grammatical structures) are often referred to as coverbs
as noted in previous sections chinese can also be said to have postpositions although these can be analyzed as nominal (noun) elements for more information see the article on chinese grammar particularly the sections on coverbs and locative phrases
=== case affixes ===
some grammatical case markings have a similar function to adpositions a case affix in one language may be equivalent in meaning to a preposition or postposition in another for example in english the agent of a passive construction is marked by the preposition by while in russian it is marked by use of the instrumental case sometimes such equivalences exist within a single language for example the genitive case in german is often interchangeable with a phrase using the preposition von (just as in english the preposition of is often interchangeable with the possessive suffix s)
adpositions combine syntactically with their complement whereas case markings combine with a noun morphologically in some instances it may not be clear which applies the following are some possible means of making such a distinction
two adpositions can usually be joined with a coordinating conjunction and share a single complement (of and for the people) whereas this is generally not possible with case affixes
one adposition can usually combine with two coordinated complements (of the city and the world) whereas a case affix would need to be repeated with each noun (latin urbis et orbis not *urb- et orbis)
case markings combine primarily with nouns whereas adpositions can combine with (nominalized) phrases of different categories
a case marking usually appears directly on the noun but an adposition can be separated from the noun by other words
within the noun phrase determiners and adjectives may agree with the noun in case (case spreading) but an adposition only appears once
a language can have hundreds of adpositions (including complex adpositions) but no language has that many distinct morphological cases
even so a clear distinction cannot always be made for example the post-nominal elements in japanese and korean are sometimes called case particles and sometimes postpositions sometimes they are analysed as two different groups because they have different characteristics (e.g. the ability to combine with focus particles) but in such analysis it is unclear which words should fall into which group
turkish and finnish have both extensive case-marking and postpositions but here there is evidence to help distinguish the two
turkish (case) sinemaya (cinema-dative to the cinema") vs (postposition) sinema iin ("for the cinema")
finnish (case) talossa (house-inessive in the house") vs (postposition) talon edess (house-genitive in front in front of the house")
in these examples the case markings form a word with their hosts (as shown by vowel harmony other word-internal effects and agreement of adjectives in finnish) while the postpositions are independent words as is seen in the last example adpositions are often used in conjunction with case affixes in languages that have case a given adposition usually takes a complement in a particular case and sometimes (as has been seen above) the choice of case helps specify the meaning of the adposition
