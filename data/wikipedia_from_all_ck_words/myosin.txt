myosins (/masn/) comprise a family of atp-dependent motor proteins and are best known for their role in muscle contraction and their involvement in a wide range of other motility processes in eukaryotes they are responsible for actin-based motility the term was originally used to describe a group of similar atpases found in the cells of both striated muscle tissue and smooth muscle tissue following the discovery by pollard and korn (1973) of enzymes with myosin-like function in acanthamoeba castellanii a large number of divergent myosin genes have been discovered throughout eukaryotes thus although myosin was originally thought to be restricted to muscle cells (hence myo-(s) + -in) there is no single myosin but rather a huge superfamily of genes whose protein products share the basic properties of actin binding atp hydrolysis (atpase enzyme activity) and force transduction virtually all eukaryotic cells contain myosin isoforms some isoforms have specialized functions in certain cell types (such as muscle) while other isoforms are ubiquitous the structure and function of myosin is strongly conserved across species to the extent that rabbit muscle myosin ii will bind to actin from an amoeba
== structure and functionedit ==
=== domainsedit ===
most myosin molecules are composed of a head neck and tail domain
the head domain binds the filamentous actin and uses atp hydrolysis to generate force and to walk along the filament towards the barbed (+) end (with the exception of myosin vi which moves towards the pointed (-) end)
the neck domain acts as a linker and as a lever arm for transducing force generated by the catalytic motor domain the neck domain can also serve as a binding site for myosin light chains which are distinct proteins that form part of a macromolecular complex and generally have regulatory functions
the tail domain generally mediates interaction with cargo molecules and/or other myosin subunits in some cases the tail domain may play a role in regulating motor activity
=== power strokeedit ===
multiple myosin ii molecules generate force in skeletal muscle through a power stroke mechanism fuelled by the energy released from atp hydrolysis the power stroke occurs at the release of phosphate from the myosin molecule after the atp hydrolysis while myosin is tightly bound to actin the effect of this release is a conformational change in the molecule that pulls against the actin the release of the adp molecule and binding of a new atp molecule will release myosin from actin atp hydrolysis within the myosin will cause it to bind to actin again to repeat the cycle the combined effect of the myriad power strokes causes the muscle to contract
== nomenclature evolution and the family treeedit ==
the wide variety of myosin genes found throughout the eukaryotic phyla were named according to different schemes as they were discovered the nomenclature can therefore be somewhat confusing when attempting to compare the functions of myosin proteins within and between organisms
skeletal muscle myosin the most conspicuous of the myosin superfamily due to its abundance in muscle fibers was the first to be discovered this protein makes up part of the sarcomere and forms macromolecular filaments composed of multiple myosin subunits similar filament-forming myosin proteins were found in cardiac muscle smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells however beginning in the 1970s researchers began to discover new myosin genes in simple eukaryotes encoding proteins that acted as monomers and were therefore entitled class i myosins these new myosins were collectively termed unconventional myosins and have been found in many tissues other than muscle these new superfamily members have been grouped according to phylogenetic relationships derived from a comparison of the amino acid sequences of their head domains with each class being assigned a roman numeral (see phylogenetic tree) the unconventional myosins also have divergent tail domains suggesting unique functions the now diverse array of myosins likely evolved from an ancestral precursor (see picture)
analysis of the amino acid sequences of different myosins shows great variability among the tail domains but strong conservation of head domain sequences presumably this is so the myosins may interact via their tails with a large number of different cargoes while the goal in each case to move along actin filaments remains the same and therefore requires the same machinery in the motor for example the human genome contains over 40 different myosin genes
these differences in shape also determine the speed at which myosins can move along actin filaments the hydrolysis of atp and the subsequent release of the phosphate group causes the power stroke, in which the lever arm or neck region of the heavy chain is dragged forward since the power stroke always moves the lever arm by the same angle the length of the lever arm determines the displacement of the cargo relative to the actin filament a longer lever arm will cause the cargo to traverse a greater distance even though the lever arm undergoes the same angular displacement just as a person with longer legs can move farther with each individual step the velocity of a myosin motor depends upon the rate at which it passes through a complete kinetic cycle of atp binding to the release of adp
=== myosin classesedit ===
==== myosin iedit ====
myosin i a ubiquitous cellular protein functions as monomer and functions in vesicle transport it has step size of 10 nm and has been implicated as being responsible for the adaptation response of the stereocilia in the inner ear
==== myosin iiedit ====
myosin ii (also known as conventional myosin) is the myosin type responsible for producing muscle contraction in muscle cells
myosin ii contains two heavy chains each about 2000 amino acids in length which constitute the head and tail domains each of these heavy chains contains the n-terminal head domain while the c-terminal tails take on a coiled-coil morphology holding the two heavy chains together (imagine two snakes wrapped around each other as in a caduceus) thus myosin ii has two heads the intermediate neck domain is the region creating the angle between the head and tail in smooth muscle a single gene (myh11) codes for the heavy chains myosin ii but splice variants of this gene result in four distinct isoforms
it also contains 4 myosin light chains (mlc) resulting in 2 per head weighing 20 (mlc20) and 17 (mlc17) kda these bind the heavy chains in the neck region between the head and tail
the mlc20 is also known as the regulatory light chain and actively participates in muscle contraction
the mlc17 is also known as the essential light chain its exact function is unclear but is believed to contribute to the structural stability of the myosin head along with mlc20 two variants of mlc17 (mlc17a/b) exist as a result of alternative splicing at the mlc17 gene
in muscle cells the long coiled-coil tails of the individual myosin molecules join together forming the thick filaments of the sarcomere the force-producing head domains stick out from the side of the thick filament ready to walk along the adjacent actin-based thin filaments in response to the proper chemical signals
==== myosin iiiedit ====
myosin iii is a poorly understood member of the myosin family it has been studied in vivo in the eyes of drosophila where it is thought to play a role in phototransduction a human homologue gene for myosin iii myo3a has been uncovered through the human genome project and is expressed in the retina and cochlea
==== myosin ivedit ====
myosin iv has a single iq motif and a tail that lacks any coiled-coil forming sequence it has homology similar to the tail domains of myosin vii and xv
==== myosin vedit ====
myosin v is an unconventional myosin motor which is functional as a dimer and has a step size of 36 nm it translocates (walks) along actin filaments traveling towards the barbed end (+ end) of the filaments myosin v was thought to be critical in vesicle movement from the center of the cell to the periphery but has been shown to be more like a dynamic tether retaining vesicles and organelles in the actin-rich periphery of cells
==== myosin viedit ====
myosin vi is an unconventional myosin motor which is primarily functional as a dimer but also acts as a nonprocessive monomer it walks along actin filaments travelling towards the minus end of the filaments myosin vi is thought to transport endocytic vesicles into the cell
==== myosin viiedit ====
myosin vii is an unconventional myosin with two ferm domains in the tail region it has a very short coiled-coiled region myosin vii is required for phagocytosis in dictyostelium discoideum spermatogenesis in c elegans and stereocilia formation in mice and zebrafish
==== myosin viiiedit ====
myosin viii is a plant-specific myosin linked to cell division specifically it is involved in regulating the flow of cytoplasm between cells and in the localization of vesicles to the phragmoplast
==== myosin ixedit ====
myosin ix is a single-headed minus-end directed group of motor proteins the movement mechanism for this myosin is poorly understood
==== myosin xedit ====
myosin x is an unconventional myosin motor which is functional as a dimer the dimerization of myosin x is thought to be antiparallel this behavior has not been observed in other myosins in mammalian cells the motor is found to localize to filopodia myosin x walks towards the barbed ends of filaments some research suggests it preferentially walks on bundles of actin rather than single filaments it is the first myosin motor found to exhibit this behavior
==== myosin xiedit ====
myosin xi directs the movement of organelles such as plastids and mitochondria in plant cells it is responsible for the light-directed movement of chloroplasts according to light intensity and the formation of stromules interconnecting different plastids
==== myosin xiiedit ====
==== myosin xiiiedit ====
==== myosin xivedit ====
this myosin group has been found in the apicomplexa phylum the myosins localize to plasma membranes of the intracellular parasites and may then be involved in the cell invasion process
this myosin is also found in the ciliated protozoan tetrahymena thermaphila known functions include transporting phagosomes to the nucleus and perturbing the developmentally regulated elimination of the macronucleus during conjugation
==== myosin xvedit ====
myosin xv is necessary for the development of the actin core structure of the non-motile stereocilia located in the inner ear it is thought to be functional as a monomer
==== myosin xviedit ====
