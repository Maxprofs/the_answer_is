basketball is a sport played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court the objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.048 m) high mounted to a backboard at each end basketball is one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports the national basketball association (nba) is the most popular and widely considered to be the highest level of professional basketball in the world and nba players are the world's best paid sportsmen by average annual salary per player
a team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket during regular play a field goal scores three points for the shooting team if the player shoots from behind the three-point line and two points if shot from in front of the line a team can also score via free throws which are worth one point after the other team was assessed with certain fouls the team with the most points at the end of the game wins but additional time (overtime) is issued when the score is tied at the end of regulation the ball can be advanced on the court by bouncing it while walking or running or throwing it to a teammate it is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball to carry it or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling
as well as many techniques for shooting passing dribbling and rebounding basketball teams generally have player positions and offensive and defensive structures (player positioning) traditionally the tallest and strongest members of a team are called a center or power forward while slightly shorter and more agile players are called small forward and the shortest players or those who possess the best ball handling skills are called a point guard or shooting guard

=== creationedit ===
in early december 1891 canadian dr james naismith a physical education professor and instructor at the international young men's christian association training school (ymca) (today springfield college) in springfield massachusetts was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day he sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long new england winters after rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums he wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto a 10-foot (3.05 m) elevated track in contrast with modern basketball nets this peach basket retained its bottom and balls had to be retrieved manually after each basket or point scored this proved inefficient however so the bottom of the basket was removed allowing the balls to be poked out with a long dowel each time
basketball was originally played with a soccer ball the first balls made specifically for basketball were brown and it was only in the late 1950s that tony hinkle searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike introduced the orange ball that is now in common use dribbling was not part of the original game except for the bounce pass to teammates passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls dribbling only became a major part of the game around the 1950s as manufacturing improved the ball shape
the peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards a further change was soon made so the ball merely passed through whenever a person got the ball in the basket his team would gain a point whichever team got the most points won the game the baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court but this proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to interfere with shots the backboard was introduced to prevent this interference it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots naismith's handwritten diaries discovered by his granddaughter in early 2006 indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented which incorporated rules from a children's game called duck on a rock as many had failed before it naismith called the new game basket ball the first official game was played in the ymca gymnasium in albany new york on january 20 1892 with nine players the game ended at 10 the shot was made from 25 feet (7.6 m) on a court just half the size of a present-day streetball or national basketball association (nba) court by 18971898 teams of five became standard

basketball's early adherents were dispatched to ymcas throughout the united states and it quickly spread through the usa and canada by 1895 it was well established at several women's high schools while the ymca was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game within a decade it discouraged the new sport as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from the ymca's primary mission however other amateur sports clubs colleges and professional clubs quickly filled the void in the years before world war i the amateur athletic union and the intercollegiate athletic association of the united states (forerunner of the ncaa) vied for control over the rules for the game the first pro league the national basketball league was formed in 1898 to protect players from exploitation and to promote a less rough game this league only lasted five years
dr james naismith was instrumental in establishing college basketball his colleague c.o beamis fielded the first college basketball team just a year after the springfield ymca game at the suburban pittsburgh geneva college naismith himself later coached at the university of kansas for six years before handing the reins to renowned coach forrest phog allen naismith's disciple amos alonzo stagg brought basketball to the university of chicago while adolph rupp a student of naismith's at kansas enjoyed great success as coach at the university of kentucky on february 9 1895 the first intercollegiate 5-on-5 game was played at hamline university between hamline and the school of agriculture which was affiliated with the university of minnesota the school of agriculture won in a 93 game
in 1901 colleges including the university of chicago columbia university dartmouth college the university of minnesota the u.s naval academy the university of colorado and yale university began sponsoring men's games in 1905 frequent injuries on the football field prompted president theodore roosevelt to suggest that colleges form a governing body resulting in the creation of the intercollegiate athletic association of the united states (iaaus) in 1910 that body would change its name to the national collegiate athletic association (ncaa) the first canadian interuniversity basketball game was played at the ymca in kingston ontario on february 6 1904 when mcgill university visited queen's university mcgill won 97 in overtime the score was 77 at the end of regulation play and a ten-minute overtime period settled the outcome a good turnout of spectators watched the game
the first men's national championship tournament the national association of intercollegiate basketball tournament which still exists as the national association of intercollegiate athletics (naia) tournament was organized in 1937 the first national championship for ncaa teams the national invitation tournament (nit) in new york was organized in 1938 the ncaa national tournament would begin one year later college basketball was rocked by gambling scandals from 1948 to 1951 when dozens of players from top teams were implicated in match fixing and point shaving partially spurred by an association with cheating the nit lost support to the ncaa tournament
=== high school basketballedit ===
before widespread school district consolidation most american high schools were far smaller than their present-day counterparts during the first decades of the 20th century basketball quickly became the ideal interscholastic sport due to its modest equipment and personnel requirements in the days before widespread television coverage of professional and college sports the popularity of high school basketball was unrivaled in many parts of america perhaps the most legendary of high school teams was indiana's franklin wonder five which took the nation by storm during the 1920s dominating indiana basketball and earning national recognition
today virtually every high school in the united states fields a basketball team in varsity competition basketball's popularity remains high both in rural areas where they carry the identification of the entire community as well as at some larger schools known for their basketball teams where many players go on to participate at higher levels of competition after graduation in the 200304 season 1,002,797 boys and girls represented their schools in interscholastic basketball competition according to the national federation of state high school associations the states of illinois indiana and kentucky are particularly well known for their residents devotion to high school basketball commonly called hoosier hysteria in indiana the critically acclaimed film hoosiers shows high school basketball's depth of meaning to these communities
there is currently no national tournament to determine a national high school champion the most serious effort was the national interscholastic basketball tournament at the university of chicago from 1917 to 1930 the event was organized by amos alonzo stagg and sent invitations to state champion teams the tournament started out as a mostly midwest affair but grew in 1929 it had 29 state champions faced with opposition from the national federation of state high school associations and north central association of colleges and schools that bore a threat of the schools losing their accreditation the last tournament was in 1930 the organizations said they were concerned that the tournament was being used to recruit professional players from the prep ranks the tournament did not invite minority schools or private/parochial schools
the national catholic interscholastic basketball tournament ran from 1924 to 1941 at loyola university the national catholic invitational basketball tournament from 1954 to 1978 played at a series of venues including catholic university georgetown and george mason the national interscholastic basketball tournament for black high schools was held from 1929 to 1942 at hampton institute the national invitational interscholastic basketball tournament was held from 1941 to 1967 starting out at tuskegee institute following a pause during world war ii it resumed at tennessee state college in nashville the basis for the champion dwindled after 1954 when brown v board of education began an integration of schools the last tournaments were held at alabama state college from 1964 to 1967
=== professional basketballedit ===
teams abounded throughout the 1920s there were hundreds of men's professional basketball teams in towns and cities all over the united states and little organization of the professional game players jumped from team to team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls leagues came and went barnstorming squads such as the original celtics and two all-african american teams the new york renaissance five ("rens") and the (still existing) harlem globetrotters played up to two hundred games a year on their national tours
in 1946 the basketball association of america (baa) was formed the first game was played in toronto ontario canada between the toronto huskies and new york knickerbockers on november 1 1946 three seasons later in 1949 the baa merged with the national basketball league to form the national basketball association (nba) by the 1950s basketball had become a major college sport thus paving the way for a growth of interest in professional basketball in 1959 a basketball hall of fame was founded in springfield massachusetts site of the first game its rosters include the names of great players coaches referees and people who have contributed significantly to the development of the game the hall of fame has people who have accomplished many goals in their career in basketball an upstart organization the american basketball association emerged in 1967 and briefly threatened the nba's dominance until the aba-nba merger in 1976 today the nba is the top professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity salaries talent and level of competition
the nba has featured many famous players including george mikan the first dominating big man ball-handling wizard bob cousy and defensive genius bill russell of the boston celtics wilt chamberlain who originally played for the barnstorming harlem globetrotters all-around stars oscar robertson and jerry west more recent big men kareem abdul-jabbar shaquille o'neal and karl malone playmaker john stockton crowd-pleasing forward julius erving european stars dirk nowitzki and draen petrovi more recent stars lebron james kevin durant and kobe bryant and the three players who many credit with ushering the professional game to its highest level of popularity larry bird earvin magic johnson and michael jordan in 2001 the nba formed a developmental league the nba development league as of 2015 the d-league has 19 teams
=== international basketballedit ===
fiba (international basketball federation) was formed in 1932 by eight founding nations argentina czechoslovakia greece italy latvia portugal romania and switzerland at this time the organization only oversaw amateur players its acronym derived from the french fdration internationale de basket-ball amateur was thus fiba men's basketball was first included at the berlin 1936 summer olympics although a demonstration tournament was held in 1904 the united states defeated canada in the first final played outdoors this competition has usually been dominated by the united states whose team has won all but three titles the first of these came in a controversial final game in munich in 1972 against the soviet union in which the ending of the game was replayed three times until the soviet union finally came out on top in 1950 the first fiba world championship for men now known as the fiba basketball world cup was held in argentina three years later the first fiba world championship for women now known as the fiba women's basketball world cup was held in chile women's basketball was added to the olympics in 1976 which were held in montreal canada with teams such as the soviet union brazil and australia rivaling the american squads
fiba dropped the distinction between amateur and professional players in 1989 and in 1992 professional players played for the first time in the olympic games the united states dominance continued with the introduction of their dream team in the 2004 athens olympics the united states suffered its first olympic loss while using professional players falling to puerto rico (in a 19-point loss) and lithuania in group games and being eliminated in the semifinals by argentina it eventually won the bronze medal defeating lithuania finishing behind argentina and italy the redeem team won gold at the 2008 olympics and the so-called b-team won gold at the 2010 fiba world championship in turkey despite featuring no players from the 2008 squad the united states continued its dominance as they won gold at the 2012 olympics and the 2014 fiba world cup
worldwide basketball tournaments are held for boys and girls of all age levels the global popularity of the sport is reflected in the nationalities represented in the nba players from all six inhabited continents currently play in the nba top international players began coming into the nba in the mid-1990s including croatians draen petrovi and toni kuko serbian vlade divac lithuanians arvydas sabonis and arnas mariulionis and german detlef schrempf
in the philippines the philippine basketball association's first game was played on april 9 1975 at the araneta coliseum in cubao quezon city philippines it was founded as a rebellion of several teams from the now-defunct manila industrial and commercial athletic association which was tightly controlled by the basketball association of the philippines (now defunct) the then-fiba recognized national association nine teams from the micaa participated in the league's first season that opened on april 9 1975 the nbl is australia's pre-eminent men's professional basketball league the league commenced in 1979 playing a winter season (aprilseptember) and did so until the completion of the 20th season in 1998 the 199899 season which commenced only months later was the first season after the shift to the current summer season format (octoberapril) this shift was an attempt to avoid competing directly against australia's various football codes it features 8 teams from around australia and one in new zealand a few players including luc longley andrew gaze shane heal chris anstey and andrew bogut made it big internationally becoming poster figures for the sport in australia the women's national basketball league began in 1981
=== women's basketballedit ===
women's basketball began in 1892 at smith college when senda berenson a physical education teacher modified naismith's rules for women shortly after she was hired at smith she went to naismith to learn more about the game fascinated by the new sport and the values it could teach she organized the first women's collegiate basketball game on march 21 1893 when her smith freshmen and sophomores played against one another however the first women's interinstitutional game was played in 1892 between the university of california and miss head's school berenson's rules were first published in 1899 and two years later she became the editor of a g spalding's first women's basketball guide berenson's freshmen played the sophomore class in the first women's intercollegiate basketball game at smith college march 21 1893 the same year mount holyoke and sophie newcomb college (coached by clara gregory baer) women began playing basketball by 1895 the game had spread to colleges across the country including wellesley vassar and bryn mawr the first intercollegiate women's game was on april 4 1896 stanford women played berkeley 9-on-9 ending in a 21 stanford victory
women's basketball development was more structured than that for men in the early years in 1905 the executive committee on basket ball rules (national women's basketball committee) was created by the american physical education association these rules called for six to nine players per team and 11 officials the international women's sports federation (1924) included a women's basketball competition 37 women's high school varsity basketball or state tournaments were held by 1925 and in 1926 the amateur athletic union backed the first national women's basketball championship complete with men's rules the edmonton grads a touring canadian women's team based in edmonton alberta operated between 1915 and 1940 the grads toured all over north america and were exceptionally successful they posted a record of 522 wins and only 20 losses over that span as they met any team that wanted to challenge them funding their tours from gate receipts the grads also shone on several exhibition trips to europe and won four consecutive exhibition olympics tournaments in 1924 1928 1932 and 1936 however women's basketball was not an official olympic sport until 1976 the grads players were unpaid and had to remain single the grads style focused on team play without overly emphasizing skills of individual players the first women's aau all-america team was chosen in 1929 women's industrial leagues sprang up throughout the united states producing famous athletes including babe didrikson of the golden cyclones and the all american red heads team which competed against men's teams using men's rules by 1938 the women's national championship changed from a three-court game to two-court game with six players per team
the nba-backed women's national basketball association (wnba) began in 1997 though it had shaky attendance figures several marquee players (lisa leslie diana taurasi and candace parker among others) have helped the league's popularity and level of competition other professional women's basketball leagues in the united states such as the american basketball league (199698) have folded in part because of the popularity of the wnba the wnba has been looked at by many as a niche league however the league has recently taken steps forward in june 2007 the wnba signed a contract extension with espn the new television deal runs from 2009 to 2016 along with this deal came the first ever rights fees to be paid to a women's professional sports league over the eight years of the contract millions and millions of dollars will be dispersed to the league's teams. the wnba gets more viewers on national television broadcasts (413,000) than both major league soccer (253,000) and the nhl (310,732) in a march 12 2009 article nba commissioner david stern said that in the bad economy the nba is far less profitable than the wnba we're losing a lot of money among a large number of teams we're budgeting the wnba to break even this year.
== rules and regulationsedit ==
measurements and time limits discussed in this section often vary among tournaments and organizations international and nba rules are used in this section
the object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the ball through the opponents basket from above while preventing the opponents from doing so on their own an attempt to score in this way is called a shot a successful shot is worth two points or three points if it is taken from beyond the three-point arc 6.75 metres (22 ft 2 in) from the basket in international games and 23 feet 9 inches (7.24 m) in nba games a one-point shot can be earned when shooting from the foul line after a foul is made
=== playing regulationsedit ===
games are played in four quarters of 10 (fiba) or 12 minutes (nba) college men's games use two 20-minute halves college women's games use 10-minute quarters and united states high school varsity games use 8 minute quarters 15 minutes are allowed for a half-time break under fiba nba and ncaa rules and 10 minutes in united states high schools overtime periods are five minutes in length except for high school which is four minutes in length teams exchange baskets for the second half the time allowed is actual playing time the clock is stopped while the play is not active therefore games generally take much longer to complete than the allotted game time typically about two hours
five players from each team may be on the court at one time substitutions are unlimited but can only be done when play is stopped teams also have a coach who oversees the development and strategies of the team and other team personnel such as assistant coaches managers statisticians doctors and trainers
for both men's and women's teams a standard uniform consists of a pair of shorts and a jersey with a clearly visible number unique within the team printed on both the front and back players wear high-top sneakers that provide extra ankle support typically team names players names and outside of north america sponsors are printed on the uniforms
a limited number of time-outs clock stoppages requested by a coach (or sometimes mandated in the nba) for a short meeting with the players are allowed they generally last no longer than one minute (100 seconds in the nba) unless for televised games a commercial break is needed
the game is controlled by the officials consisting of the referee (referred to as crew chief in the nba) one or two umpires (referred to as referees in the nba) and the table officials for college the nba and many high schools there are a total of three referees on the court the table officials are responsible for keeping track of each teams scoring timekeeping individual and team fouls player substitutions team possession arrow and the shot clock
=== equipmentedit ===
the only essential equipment in a basketball game is the ball and the court a flat rectangular surface with baskets at opposite ends competitive levels require the use of more equipment such as clocks score sheets scoreboard(s) alternating possession arrows and whistle-operated stop-clock systems
a regulation basketball court in international games is 91.9 feet long (28 meters) and 49.2 (15 meters) feet wide in the nba and ncaa the court is 94 feet (28.6 meters) by 50 feet (15.24 meters) most courts have wood flooring usually constructed from maple planks running in the same direction as the longer court dimension the name and logo of the home team is usually painted on or around the center circle
the basket is a steel rim 18 inches (45.72 cm) diameter with an attached net affixed to a backboard that measures 6 feet (1.82 meters) by 3.5 feet (1.06 meters) and one basket is at each end of the court the white outlined box on the backboard is 18 inches (45.72 cm) high and 2 feet (60.96 cm) wide at almost all levels of competition the top of the rim is exactly 10 feet (3.05 meters) above the court and 4 feet (1.21 meters) inside the baseline while variation is possible in the dimensions of the court and backboard it is considered important for the basket to be of the correct height a rim that is off by just a few inches can have an adverse effect on shooting
the size of the basketball is also regulated for men the official ball is 29.5 inches (74.93 cm) in circumference (size 7 or a 295 ball") and weighs 22 oz (623.69 grams) if women are playing the official basketball size is 28.5 inches (72.39 cm) in circumference (size 6 or a 285 ball") with a weight of 20 oz (567 grams) in 3x3 a formalized version of the halfcourt 3-on-3 game a dedicated ball with the circumference of a size 6 ball but the weight of a size 7 ball is used in all competitions (men's women's and mixed teams)
=== violationsedit ===
the ball may be advanced toward the basket by being shot passed between players thrown tapped rolled or dribbled (bouncing the ball while running)
the ball must stay within the court the last team to touch the ball before it travels out of bounds forfeits possession the ball is out of bounds if it touches a boundary line or touches any player or object that is out of bounds
there are limits placed on the steps a player may take without dribbling which commonly results in an infraction known as traveling nor may a player stop his dribble and then resume dribbling a dribble that touches both hands is considered stopping the dribble giving this infraction the name double dribble within a dribble the player cannot carry the ball by placing his hand on the bottom of the ball doing so is known as carrying the ball a team once having established ball control in the front half of their court may not return the ball to the backcourt and be the first to touch it a violation of these rules results in loss of possession
the ball may not be kicked nor be struck with the fist for the offense a violation of these rules results in loss of possession for the defense most leagues reset the shot clock and the offensive team is given possession of the ball out of bounds
there are limits imposed on the time taken before progressing the ball past halfway (8 seconds in fiba and the nba 10 seconds in ncaa and high school for both sexes) before attempting a shot (24 seconds in fiba the nba and canadian interuniversity sport play for both sexes and 30 seconds in ncaa play for both sexes) holding the ball while closely guarded (5 seconds) and remaining in the restricted area known as the free-throw lane (or the key") (3 seconds) these rules are designed to promote more offense
basket interference or goaltending is a violation charged when a player illegally interferes with a shot this violation is incurred when a player touches the ball on its downward trajectory to the basket unless it is obvious that the ball has no chance of entering the basket if a player touches the ball while it is in the rim or in the area extended upwards from the basket or if a player reaches through the basket to interfere with the shot when a defensive player is charged with goaltending the basket is awarded if an offensive player commits the infraction the basket is cancelled in either case possession of the ball is turned over to the defensive team
=== foulsedit ===
an attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through certain types physical contact is illegal and is called a personal foul these are most commonly committed by defensive players however they can be committed by offensive players as well players who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again or receive one or more free throws if they are fouled in the act of shooting depending on whether the shot was successful one point is awarded for making a free throw which is attempted from a line 15 feet (4.6 m) from the basket
the referee is responsible for judging whether contact is illegal sometimes resulting in controversy the calling of fouls can vary between games leagues and referees
there is a second category of fouls called technical fouls which may be charged for various rules violations including failure to properly record a player in the scorebook or for unsportsmanlike conduct these infractions result in one or two free throws which may be taken by any of the five players on the court at the time repeated incidents can result in disqualification a blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul (flagrant foul in the nba) in fiba a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul while in leagues other than the nba such a foul is referred to as flagrant
if a team exceeds a certain limit of team fouls in a given period (quarter or half) four for nba ncaa women's and international games the opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all subsequent non-shooting fouls for that period the number depending on the league in the us college men's game and high school games for both sexes if a team reaches 7 fouls in a half the opposing team is awarded one free throw along with a second shot if the first is made this is called shooting one-and-one if a team exceeds 10 fouls in the half the opposing team is awarded two free throws on all subsequent fouls for the half
when a team shoots foul shots the opponents may not interfere with the shooter nor may they try to regain possession until the last or potentially last free throw is in the air
after a team has committed a specified number of fouls the other team is said to be in the bonus on scoreboards this is usually signified with an indicator light reading bonus or penalty with an illuminated directional arrow or dot indicating that team is to receive free throws when fouled by the opposing team (some scoreboards also indicate the number of fouls committed.)
if a team misses the first shot of a two-shot situation the opposing team must wait for the completion of the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and continuing play
if a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot a player fouled while attempting a regular two-point shot thus receives two shots a player fouled while attempting a three-point shot on the other hand receives three shots
if a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is successful typically the player will be awarded one additional free throw for one point in combination with a regular shot this is called a three-point play or four-point play (or more colloquially an and one") because of the basket made at the time of the foul (2 or 3 points) and the additional free throw (1 point)
== common techniques and practicesedit ==
=== positionsedit ===
although the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever they have evolved as part of basketball during the early years of basketball's evolution,two guards two forwards and one center were used in more recent times specific positions evolved but the current trend advocated by many top coaches including mike krzyzewski is towards positionless basketball where big guys are free to shoot from outside and dribble if their skill allows it popular descriptions of positions include
point guard (often called the 1")  usually the fastest player on the team organizes the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time
shooting guard (the 2")  creates a high volume of shots on offense mainly long-ranged and guards the opponent's best perimeter player on defense
small forward (the 3")  often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration on defense seeks rebounds and steals but sometimes plays more actively
power forward (the 4") plays offensively often with their back to the basket on defense plays under the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing power forward (in man-to-man defense)
center (the 5") uses height and size to score (on offense) to protect the basket closely (on defense) or to rebound
the above descriptions are flexible for most teams today the shooting guard and small forward have very similar responsibilities and are often called the wings as do the power forward and center who are often called post players while most teams describe two players as guards two as forwards and one as a center on some occasions teams choose to call them by different designations
=== strategyedit ===
there are two main defensive strategies zone defense and man-to-man defense in a zone defense each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court zone defenses often allow the defense to double team the ball a manoeuver known as a trap in a man-to-man defense each defensive player guards a specific opponent
offensive plays are more varied normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball a quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is known as a cut a legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate by standing in the defender's way such that the teammate cuts next to him is a screen or pick the two plays are combined in the pick and roll in which a player sets a pick and then rolls away from the pick towards the basket screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays these allow the quick passes and teamwork which can lead to a successful basket teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable on court the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which play will occur
=== shootingedit ===
shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket methods varying with players and situations
typically a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket a player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head with the other hand supporting the side of the ball the ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm the shooting arm fully extended with the wrist fully bent is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball known as a follow-through players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim the ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial but generally a proper arc is recommended players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket
the two most common shots that use the above described setup are the set-shot and the jump-shot the set-shot is taken from a standing position with neither foot leaving the floor typically used for free throws and in other circumstances while the jump-shot is taken in mid-air the ball released near the top of the jump this provides much greater power and range and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation
another common shot is called the lay-up this shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket and to lay the ball up and into the basket typically off the backboard (the backboard-free underhand version is called a finger roll) the most crowd-pleasing and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the slam dunk in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward through the basket while touching it
another shot that is becoming common is the circus shot the circus shot is a low-percentage shot that is flipped heaved scooped or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is off-balance airborne falling down and/or facing away from the basket a back-shot is a shot taken when the player is facing away from the basket and may be shot with the dominant hand or both but there is a very low chance that the shot will be successful
a shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an air-ball a particularly bad shot or one that only hits the backboard is jocularly called a brick the hang time is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping either to make a slam dunk lay-up or jump shot
=== reboundingedit ===
the objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard this plays a major role in the game as most possessions end when a team misses a shot there are two categories of rebounds offensive rebounds in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession and defensive rebounds in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball the majority of rebounds are defensive as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots
=== passingedit ===
a pass is a method of moving the ball between players most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy
a staple pass is the chest pass the ball is passed directly from the passer's chest to the receiver's chest a proper chest pass involves an outward snap of the thumbs to add velocity and leaves the defence little time to react
another type of pass is the bounce pass here the passer bounces the ball crisply about two-thirds of the way from his own chest to the receiver the ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver the bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation) thus players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments or to pass around a defender
the overhead pass is used to pass the ball over a defender the ball is released while over the passer's head
the outlet pass occurs after a team gets a defensive rebound the next pass after the rebound is the outlet pass
the crucial aspect of any good pass is it being difficult to intercept good passers can pass the ball with great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball a special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate this is called a no-look pass
another advanced style of passing is the behind-the-back pass which as the description implies involves throwing the ball behind the passer's back to a teammate although some players can perform such a pass effectively many coaches discourage no-look or behind-the-back passes believing them to be difficult to control and more likely to result in turnovers or violations
=== dribblingedit ===
dribbling is the act of bouncing the ball continuously with one hand and is a requirement for a player to take steps with the ball to dribble a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with the fingertips rather than patting it this ensures greater control
when dribbling past an opponent the dribbler should dribble with the hand farthest from the opponent making it more difficult for the defensive player to get to the ball it is therefore important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands
good dribblers (or ball handlers") tend to bounce the ball low to the ground reducing the distance of travel of the ball from the floor to the hand making it more difficult for the defender to steal the ball good ball handlers frequently dribble behind their backs between their legs and switch directions suddenly making a less predictable dribbling pattern that is more difficult to defend against this is called a crossover which is the most effective way to move past defenders while dribbling
a skilled player can dribble without watching the ball using the dribbling motion or peripheral vision to keep track of the ball's location by not having to focus on the ball a player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities as well as avoid the danger of having someone steal the ball away from him/her
=== blockingedit ===
a block is performed when after a shot is attempted a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball in almost all variants of play it is illegal to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc this is known as goaltending it is also illegal under nba and men's ncaa basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim under international rules it is illegal to block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc or one that has touched the backboard until the ball has hit the rim after the ball hits the rim it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a block performed
to block a shot a player has to be able to reach a point higher than where the shot is released thus height can be an advantage in blocking players who are taller and playing the power forward or center positions generally record more blocks than players who are shorter and playing the guard positions however with good timing and a sufficiently high vertical leap even shorter players can be effective shot blockers

at the professional level most male players are above 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) and most women above 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m) guards for whom physical coordination and ball-handling skills are crucial tend to be the smallest players almost all forwards in the top men's pro leagues are 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) or taller most centers are over 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 m) tall according to a survey given to all nba teams the average height of all nba players is just under 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) with the average weight being close to 222 pounds (101 kg) the tallest players ever in the nba were manute bol and gheorghe murean who were both 7 feet 7 inches (2.31 m) tall the tallest current nba player is sim bhullar who stands at 7 feet 5 inches (2.26 m) at 7 feet 2 inches (2.18 m) margo dydek was the tallest player in the history of the wnba
the shortest player ever to play in the nba is muggsy bogues at 5 feet 3 inches (1.60 m) other short players have thrived at the pro level anthony spud webb was just 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m) tall but had a 42-inch (1.07 m) vertical leap giving him significant height when jumping while shorter players are often at a disadvantage in certain aspects of the game their ability to navigate quickly through crowded areas of the court and steal the ball by reaching low are strengths
== race and ethnicityedit ==
the composition of race and ethnicity in the national basketball association (nba) has changed throughout the league's history the first non-white player entered the league in 1947 according to racial equality activist richard lapchick the nba in 2011 was composed of 78 percent black players 17 percent white players four percent latinos (of any race) and one percent asian
hall of fame player larry bird who is white stated in 2004 that the league needed more white players since the league's fans are mostly white and if you just had a couple of white guys in there you might get them [the fans not the guys] a little excited but it is a black man's game and it will be forever i mean the greatest athletes in the world are african-american, said bird
