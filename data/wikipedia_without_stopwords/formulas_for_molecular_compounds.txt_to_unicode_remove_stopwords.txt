monotremes mammals lay eggs prototheria instead giving birth live young like marsupials metatheria placental mammals eutheria surviving examples monotremes indigenous australia new guinea although evidence widespread existing monotreme species platypus four species echidnas spiny anteaters currently debate regarding monotreme taxonomy
word monotreme comes greek monos single trema hole referring cloaca
general characteristics
like mammals monotremes warmblooded high metabolic rate though high mammals see hair bodies produce milk mammary glands feed young single bone lower jaw three middleear bones
common reptiles marsupials monotremes lack connective structure corpus callosum placental mammals primary communication route right left brain hemispheres anterior commissure provide alternate communication route two hemispheres though monotremes marsupials carries commissural fibers arising neocortex whereas placental mammals anterior commissure carries fibers
extant monotremes lack teeth adults fossil forms modern platypus young tribosphenic form molars occlusal surface formed three cusps arranged triangle one hallmarks extant mammals recent work suggests monotremes acquired form molar independently placental mammals marsupials although well established monotreme jaws constructed somewhat differently mammals jaw opening muscle different true mammals tiny bones conduct sound inner ear fully incorporated skull rather lying jaw cynodonts premammalian synapsids feature claimed evolved independently monotremes therians although analogous evolution tribosphenic molar disputed external opening ear still lies base jaw
sequencing platypus genome also provided insight evolution number monotreme traits venom electroreception well showing new unique features fact monotremes possess sex chromosomes x chromosome resembles sex chromosome birds suggesting two sex chromosomes marsupial placental mammals evolved recently split monotreme lineage feature along genetic similarities birds shared genes related egglaying thought provide insight recent common ancestor synapsid lineage leading mammals sauropsid lineage leading birds modern reptiles believed split million years ago carboniferous presence vitellogenin genes protein necessary egg shell formation shared birds suggesting common ancestor mammals million years ago split monotremes marsupials placental mammals egg laying retained monotremes lost mammals dna suggests trait shared synapomorphic birds platypuses still mammals evolved lactation mammals lascorbic acid synthesized kidneys
monotremes also extra bones shoulder girdle including interclavicle coracoid found mammals monotremes retain reptilelike gait legs sides rather underneath bodies monotreme leg bears spur ankle region spur functional echidnas contains powerful venom male platypus venom derived bdefensins proteins present mammals create holes viral bacterial pathogens reptile venom also composed different types bdefensins another trait shared reptiles
reproductive system
key anatomical difference monotremes mammals lends animals name monotreme means single opening greek derived fact urinary defecatory reproductive systems open single duct called cloaca anatomical structure similar one found reptiles monotremes marsupials single cloaca though marsupial reproductive systems also separate genital tract placental mammal females separate openings reproduction urination defecation vagina urethra anus respectively penis carries semen urine excreted cloaca
monotremes lay eggs however egg retained time within mother actively provides egg nutrients monotremes also lactate defined nipples excreting milk mammary glands via openings skin species longlived low rates reproduction relatively prolonged parental care infants
another noteworthy trait monotremes involves developmental characteristics zygotic development platypuses mammal zygotes go holoblastic cleavage meaning following fertilization ovum split due cell divisions multiple divisible daughter cells zygotes monotremes however undergo meroplastic division birds reptiles causes ovum split completely means cells edge yolk cytoplasmically continuous eggs cytoplasm thereby allowing yolk contains embryo exchange waste nutrients cytoplasm
physiology
monotremes metabolic rate remarkably low mammalian standards platypus average body temperature c f rather averages c f marsupials c f placental mammals research suggests gradual adaptation harsh environmental conditions part small number surviving monotreme species rather historical characteristic monotremes
monotremes may less developed thermoregulation mammals recent research shows maintain constant body temperature wide variety circumstances without difficulty example platypus living icy mountain stream early researchers misled two factors firstly monotremes maintain lower average temperature mammals secondly shortbeaked echidna much easier study reclusive platypus maintains normal temperature active cold weather conserves energy switching temperature regulation additional perspective came reduced thermal regulation observed hyraxes placental mammals
echidna originally thought enter rapid eye movement sleep however recent study showed rem sleep accounted total sleep time observed subjects environmental temperature c f surveying range environmental temperatures study observed little rem reduced temperatures c f c f also substantial reduction elevated temperature c f
monotreme milk contains highly expressed antibacterial protein found mammals perhaps compensate less sterile manner milk intake associated absence nipples
taxonomy
monotremes conventionally treated comprising single order monotremata though recent classification proposes divide orders platypoda platypus along fossil relatives tachyglossa echidnas spiny anteaters entire grouping also traditionally placed subclass prototheria extended include several fossil orders longer seen constituting group allied monotreme ancestry controversial hypothesis relates monotremes different assemblage fossil mammals clade termed australosphenida
traditional theria hypothesis states divergence monotreme lineage metatheria marsupial eutheria placental mammal lineages happened prior divergence marsupials placental mammals explains monotremes retain number primitive traits presumed present synapsid ancestors later mammals egglaying morphological evidence supports theria hypothesis one possible exception similar pattern tooth replacement seen monotremes marsupials originally provided basis competing marsupionata hypothesis divergence monotremes marsupials happened later divergence lineages placental mammals analysis van rheede concluded genetic evidence favors theria hypothesis hypothesis continues widely accepted one

fossil monotremes
fossil record monotremes relatively sparse first mesozoic monotreme discovered steropodon galmani lightning ridge new south wales although biochemical anatomical evidence suggests monotremes diverged mammalian lineage marsupials placental mammals arose handful monotreme fossils known miocene epoch known mesozoic monotremes steropodon kollikodon teinolophos australian deposits cretaceous suggesting monotremes already diversified time platypus tooth found palaeocene argentina michael benton suggests vertebrate palaeontology monotremes arose australia late jurassic early cretaceous subsequently migrated across antarctica reach south america still united australia time however number genetic studies suggest much earlier origin triassic
