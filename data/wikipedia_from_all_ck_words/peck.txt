a peck is an imperial and united states customary unit of dry volume equivalent to 2 gallons or 8 dry quarts or 16 dry pints (9.09 (uk) or 8.81 (us) liters) two pecks make a kenning (obsolete) and four pecks make a bushel although the peck is no longer widely used some produce such as apples is still often sold by the peck despite being referenced in a common tongue twister pickled peppers are so rarely sold by the peck that any association between pickled peppers and the peck unit of measurement is considered humorous in nature
== scotland before 1824edit ==
in scotland the peck was used as a dry measure until the introduction of imperial units as a result of the weights and measures act of 1824 the peck was equal to about 9 litres (1.98 imp gal) (in the case of certain crops such as wheat peas beans and meal) and about 13 litres (2.86 imp gal) (in the case of barley oats and malt) a firlot was equal to 4 pecks
