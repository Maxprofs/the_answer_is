basic concept
key feature ward leonard control system ability smoothly vary speed dc motor including reversing controlling field windings hence output voltage dc generator speed dc motor dictated supplied voltage gives simple speed control dc generator could driven means provided also supplied voltage source field windings prime mover could ac motor could internal combustion engine application vehicles patented hw leonard
ward leonard drive viewed highpower amplifier multikilowatt range built rotating electrical machinery prime mover electrical ward leonard drive unit consists motor generator shafts coupled together prime mover turns constant speed may ac dc powered generator dc generator field windings armature windings input amplifier applied field windings higher power output comes armature windings see excitation magneticamplifier principle generator act amplifier amplifier output usually connected second motor moves load elevator arrangement small changes current applied input thus generator field result large changes output allowing smooth speed control
flywheel may used reduce voltage fluctuations sudden load changes ward leonard system modification known ward leonard ilgner control
