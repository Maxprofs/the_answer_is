management in businesses and organizations is the function that coordinates the efforts of people to accomplish goals and objectives by using available resources efficiently and effectively
management includes planning organizing staffing leading or directing and controlling an organization to accomplish the goal or target resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources financial resources technological resources and natural resources management is also an academic discipline a social science whose objective is to study social organization
== etymology ==
the english verb manage comes from the italian maneggiare (to handle especially tools) which derives from the two latin words manus (hand) and agere (to act)
the french word for housekeeping mnagerie derived from mnager ("to keep house compare mnage for household") also encompasses taking care of domestic animals the french word mesnagement (or mnagement) influenced the semantic development of the english word management in the 17th and 18th centuries
note that mnagerie is the french translation of xenophon's famous book oeconomicus (greek ) on household matters and husbandry
while the italian word maneggiare refers to subaltern responsibilities the modern italian language would characterize the work of an executive as gestire
== definitions ==
views on the definition and scope of management include
according to henri fayol to manage is to forecast and to plan to organise to command to co-ordinate and to control.
fredmund malik defines it as the transformation of resources into utility.
management included as one of the factors of production - along with machines materials and money
ghislain deslandes defines it as a vulnerable force under pressure to achieve results and endowed with the triple power of constraint imitation and imagination operating on subjective interpersonal institutional and environmental levels
peter drucker (19092005) saw the basic task of a management as twofold marketing and innovation nevertheless innovation is also linked to marketing (product innovation is a central strategic marketing issue) peter drucker identifies marketing as a key essence for business success but management and marketing are generally understood as two different branches of business administration knowledge
andreas kaplan specifically defines european management as a cross-cultural societal management approach based on interdisciplinary principles
directors and managers should have the authority and responsibility to make decisions to direct an enterprise when given the authority
as a discipline management comprises the interlocking functions of formulating corporate policy and organizing planning controlling and directing a firm's resources to achieve a policy's objectives
the size of management can range from one person in a small firm to hundreds or thousands of managers in multinational companies
in large firms the board of directors formulates the policy that the chief executive officer implements
=== theoretical scope ===
management involves identifying the mission objective procedures rules and manipulation of the human capital of an enterprise to contribute to the success of the enterprise this implies effective communication an enterprise environment (as opposed to a physical or mechanical mechanism) implies human motivation and implies some sort of successful progress or system outcome as such management is not the manipulation of a mechanism (machine or automated program) not the herding of animals and can occur either in a legal or in an illegal enterprise or environment management does not need to be seen from enterprise point of view alone because management is an essential function to improve one's life and relationships management is therefore everywhere and it has a wider range of application based on this management must have humans communication and a positive enterprise endeavor plans measurements motivational psychological tools goals and economic measures (profit etc.) may or may not be necessary components for there to be management at first one views management functionally such as measuring quantity adjusting plans meeting goals this applies even in situations where planning does not take place from this perspective henri fayol (18411925) considers management to consist of six functions
forecasting
planning
organizing
commanding
coordinating
controlling
(henri fayol was one of the most influential contributors to modern concepts of management.)
in another way of thinking mary parker follett (18681933) allegedly defined management as the art of getting things done through people she described management as philosophy
critics however find this definition useful but far too narrow the phrase management is what managers do occurs widely suggesting the difficulty of defining management without circularity the shifting nature of definitions and the connection of managerial practices with the existence of a managerial cadre or of a class
one habit of thought regards management as equivalent to business administration and thus excludes management in places outside commerce as for example in charities and in the public sector more broadly every organization must manage its work people processes technology etc to maximize effectiveness nonetheless many people refer to university departments that teach management as business schools some such institutions (such as the harvard business school) use that name while others (such as the yale school of management) employ the broader term management
english-speakers may also use the term management or the management as a collective word describing the managers of an organization for example of a corporation historically this use of the term often contrasted with the term labor - referring to those being managed
but in the present era the concept of management is identified in the wide areas and its frontiers have been pushed to a broader range apart from profitable organizations even non-profitable organizations (ngos) apply management concepts the concept and its uses are not constrained management on the whole is the process of planning organizing staffing leading and controlling
== nature of managerial work ==
in profitable organizations management's primary function is the satisfaction of a range of stakeholders this typically involves making a profit (for the shareholders) creating valued products at a reasonable cost (for customers) and providing great employment opportunities for employees in nonprofit management add the importance of keeping the faith of donors in most models of management and governance shareholders vote for the board of directors and the board then hires senior management some organizations have experimented with other methods (such as employee-voting models) of selecting or reviewing managers but this is rare
in the public sector of countries constituted as representative democracies voters elect politicians to public office such politicians hire many managers and administrators and in some countries like the united states political appointees lose their jobs on the election of a new president/governor/mayor
== historical development ==
some see management (by definition) as late-modern (in the sense of late modernity) conceptualization on those terms it cannot have a pre-modern history only harbingers (such as stewards) others however detect management-like-thought back to sumerian traders and to the builders of the pyramids of ancient egypt slave-owners through the centuries faced the problems of exploiting/motivating a dependent but sometimes unenthusiastic or recalcitrant workforce but many pre-industrial enterprises given their small scale did not feel compelled to face the issues of management systematically however innovations such as the spread of hindu numerals (5th to 15th centuries) and the codification of double-entry book-keeping (1494) provided tools for management assessment planning and control
with the changing workplaces of industrial revolutions in the 18th and 19th centuries military theory and practice contributed approaches to managing the newly-popular factories
given the scale of most commercial operations and the lack of mechanized record-keeping and recording before the industrial revolution it made sense for most owners of enterprises in those times to carry out management functions by and for themselves but with growing size and complexity of organizations the split between owners (individuals industrial dynasties or groups of shareholders) and day-to-day managers (independent specialists in planning and control) gradually became more common
=== early writing ===
while management (according to some definitions) has existed for millennia several writers have created a background of works that assisted in modern management theories
some ancient military texts have been cited for lessons that civilian managers can gather for example chinese general sun tzu in the 6th century bce the art of war recommends being aware of and acting on strengths and weaknesses of both a manager's organization and a foe's
various ancient and medieval civilizations have produced mirrors for princes books which aim to advise new monarchs on how to govern examples include the indian arthashastra by chanakya (written around 300bce) and the prince by italian author niccol machiavelli (c 1515)
written in 1776 by adam smith a scottish moral philosopher the wealth of nations discussed efficient organization of work through division of labour smith described how changes in processes could boost productivity in the manufacture of pins while individuals could produce 200 pins per day smith analyzed the steps involved in manufacture and with 10 specialists enabled production of 48,000 pins per day
=== 19th century ===
classical economists such as adam smith (17231790) and john stuart mill (18061873) provided a theoretical background to resource-allocation production and pricing issues about the same time innovators like eli whitney (17651825) james watt (17361819) and matthew boulton (17281809) developed elements of technical production such as standardization quality-control procedures cost-accounting interchangeability of parts and work-planning many of these aspects of management existed in the pre-1861 slave-based sector of the us economy that environment saw 4 million people as the contemporary usages had it managed in profitable quasi-mass production
salaried managers as an identifiable group first became prominent in the late 19th century
=== 20th century ===
by about 1900 one finds managers trying to place their theories on what they regarded as a thoroughly scientific basis (see scientism for perceived limitations of this belief) examples include henry r towne's science of management in the 1890s frederick winslow taylor's the principles of scientific management (1911) lillian gilbreth's psychology of management (1914) frank and lillian gilbreth's applied motion study (1917) and henry l gantt's charts (1910s) j duncan wrote the first college management-textbook in 1911 in 1912 yoichi ueno introduced taylorism to japan and became the first management consultant of the japanese-management style his son ichiro ueno pioneered japanese quality assurance
the first comprehensive theories of management appeared around 1920 the harvard business school offered the first master of business administration degree (mba) in 1921 people like henri fayol (18411925) and alexander church described the various branches of management and their inter-relationships in the early 20th century people like ordway tead (18911973) walter scott and j mooney applied the principles of psychology to management other writers such as elton mayo (18801949) mary parker follett (18681933) chester barnard (18861961) max weber (18641920) who saw what he called the administrator as bureaucrat) rensis likert (19031981) and chris argyris (* 1923) approached the phenomenon of management from a sociological perspective
peter drucker (19092005) wrote one of the earliest books on applied management concept of the corporation (published in 1946) it resulted from alfred sloan (chairman of general motors until 1956) commissioning a study of the organisation drucker went on to write 39 books many in the same vein
h dodge ronald fisher (18901962) and thornton c fry introduced statistical techniques into management-studies in the 1940s patrick blackett worked in the development of the applied-mathematics science of operations research initially for military operations operations research sometimes known as management science (but distinct from taylor's scientific management) attempts to take a scientific approach to solving decision-problems and can apply directly to multiple management problems particularly in the areas of logistics and operations
some of the more recent developments include the theory of constraints management by objectives reengineering six sigma and various information-technology-driven theories such as agile software development as well as group-management theories such as cog's ladder
as the general recognition of managers as a class solidified during the 20th century and gave perceived practitioners of the art/science of management a certain amount of prestige so the way opened for popularised systems of management ideas to peddle their wares in this context many management fads may have had more to do with pop psychology than with scientific theories of management
towards the end of the 20th century business management came to consist of six separate branches namely
financial management
human resource management
information technology management (responsible for management information systems)
marketing management
operations management or production management
strategic management
=== 21st century ===
in the 21st century observers find it increasingly difficult to subdivide management into functional categories in this way more and more processes simultaneously involve several categories instead one tends to think in terms of the various processes tasks and objects subject to management
branches of management theory also exist relating to nonprofits and to government such as public administration public management and educational management further management programs related to civil-society organizations have also spawned programs in nonprofit management and social entrepreneurship
note that many of the assumptions made by management have come under attack from business-ethics viewpoints critical management studies and anti-corporate activism
as one consequence workplace democracy (sometimes referred to as workers self-management) has become both more common and advocated to a greater extent in some places distributing all management functions among workers each of whom takes on a portion of the work however these models predate any current political issue and may occur more naturally than does a command hierarchy all management embraces to some degree a democratic principlein that in the long term the majority of workers must support management otherwise they leave to find other work or go on strike despite the move toward workplace democracy command-and-control organization structures remain commonplace as de facto organization structure indeed the entrenched nature of command-and-control is evident in the way that recent layoffs have been conducted with management ranks affected far less than employees at the lower levels in some cases management has even rewarded itself with bonuses after laying off lower-level workers
according to leadership academic manfred f.r kets de vries a contemporary senior management team will almost inevitably have some personality disorders

mid and lower-level management may add their own plans to the business's strategies
== levels ==
most organizations have three management levels first-level middle-level and top-level managers these managers are classified in a hierarchy of authority and perform different tasks in many organizations the number of managers in every level resembles a pyramid each level is explained below in specifications of their different responsibilities and likely job titles
=== top-level management ===
the top consists of the board of directors (including non-executive directors and executive directors) president vice-president ceos and other members of the c-level executives they are responsible for controlling and overseeing the entire organization they set a tone at the top and develop strategic plans company policies and make decisions on the direction of the business in addition top-level managers play a significant role in the mobilization of outside resources and are accountable to the shareholders and general public
the board of directors is typically primarily composed of non-executives which owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders and are not closely involved in the day-to-day activities of the organization although this varies depending on the type (e.g. public versus private) size and culture of the organization these directors are theoretically liable for breaches of that duty and typically insured under directors and officers liability insurance fortune 500 directors are estimated to spend 4.4 hours per week on board duties and median compensation was $212,512 in 2010 the board sets corporate strategy makes major decisions such as major acquisitions and hires evaluates and fires the top-level manager (chief executive officer or ceo) and the ceo typically hires other positions however board involvement in the hiring of other positions such as the chief financial officer (cfo) has increased in 2013 a survey of over 160 ceos and directors of public and private companies found that the top weaknesses of ceos were mentoring skills and board engagement and 10% of companies never evaluated the ceo the board may also have certain employees (e.g. internal auditors) report to them or directly hire independent contractors for example the board (through the audit committee) typically selects the auditor
helpful skills of top management vary by the type of organization but typically include a broad understanding competition world economies and politics in addition the ceo is responsible for implementing and determining (within the board's framework) the broad policies of the organization executive management accomplishes the day-to-day details including instructions for preparation of department budgets procedures schedules appointment of middle level executives such as department managers coordination of departments media and governmental relations and shareholder communication
=== middle-level managers ===
consist of general managers branch managers and department managers they are accountable to the top management for their department's function they devote more time to organizational and directional functions their roles can be emphasized as executing organizational plans in conformance with the company's policies and the objectives of the top management they define and discuss information and policies from top management to lower management and most importantly they inspire and provide guidance to lower level managers towards better performance
middle management is the midway management of a categorized organization being secondary to the senior management but above the deepest levels of operational members an operational manager may be well-thought-out the middle management or may be categorized as non-management operate liable to the policy of the specific organization efficiency of the middle level is vital in any organization since they bridge the gap between top level and bottom level staffs
their functions include
design and implement effective group and inter-group work and information systems
define and monitor group-level performance indicators
diagnose and resolve problems within and among work groups
design and implement reward systems that support cooperative behavior they also make decision and share ideas with top managers
