for bilayers in biology see lipid bilayer
a bilayer is a double layer of closely packed atoms or molecules
the properties of bilayers are often studied in condensed matter physics particularly in the context of semiconductor devices where two distinct materials are united to form junctions (such as p-n junctions schottky junctions etc.)
layered materials such as graphene boron nitride or transition metal dichalchogenides have unique electronic properties as a bilayer system and are an active area of current research
in biology a common example is the lipid bilayer
