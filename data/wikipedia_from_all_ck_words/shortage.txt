for the opposite see surplus (also called excess supply)
in economics a shortage or excess demand is when the demand for a product or service exceeds its supply in a market it is the opposite of an excess supply (surplus)
== definitions ==
in a perfect market (one that matches a simple microeconomic model) an excess of demand will prompt sellers to increase prices until demand at that price matches the available supply - market equilibrium in economic terminology a shortage occurs when for some reason (such as government intervention or decisions by buyers not to raise prices) the price does not rise to reach equilibrium in this circumstance there are more buyers at the market price than the quantity of the good or service that is available and some non-price mechanism (such as first come first served or a lottery) determines which buyers are served
in common use the term shortage may refer to a situation where most people are unable to find a desired good at an affordable price especially where supply problems have increased the price market clearing happens when all buyers and sellers willing to transact at the equilibrium price are able to find partners there are almost always willing buyers at a lower-than-market-clearing price the narrower technical definition doesn't consider failure to serve this demand as a shortage even if it would be described that way in a social or political context (which the simple model of supply and demand does not attempt to encompass)
== causes ==
shortages (in the technical sense) may be caused by
price ceilings a type of price control which involves a government-imposed limit on the price of a product service
anti-price gouging laws
government ban on the sale of a product or service such as prostitution or certain recreational drugs
decisions by suppliers not to raise prices for example to maintain friendly relationships with potential future customers during a supply disruption
== effects ==
decisions which result in a below-market-clearing price help some people and hurt others in this case shortages may be accepted because they theoretically enable a certain portion of the population to purchase a product that they couldn't afford at the market-clearing price the cost is to those who are willing to pay for a product and either can't or experience greater difficulty in doing so
in the case of government intervention in the market there is always a trade-off with positive and negative effects for example a price ceiling may cause a shortage but it will also enable a certain percentage of the population to purchase a product that they couldn't afford at market costs economic shortages caused by higher transaction costs and opportunity costs (e.g. in the form of lost time) also mean that the distribution process is wasteful both of these factors contribute to a decrease in aggregate wealth
shortages may cause
black markets illegal markets in which products that are unavailable in conventional markets are sold or in which products with excess demand are sold at higher prices than in the conventional market
artificial controls of demand such as time (such as waiting in line) and rationing
non-monetary bargaining methods such as time (for example queuing) nepotism or even violence
price discrimination
the inability to purchase a product
== examples ==
rationing in the united kingdom occurred mainly during and after the world wars
from 1920 to 1933 during prohibition in the united states the creation of a black market for liquor was created due to the low supply of alcoholic beverages
during the 1973 oil crisis during which long lines and rationing was used to control demand
in the former soviet union during the 1980s prices were artificially low by fiat (i.e. high prices were outlawed) soviet citizens waited in line (or queued") for various price-controlled goods and services such as cars apartments or some types of clothing from the point of view of those waiting in line such goods were in perpetual short supply some of them were willing and able to pay more than the official price ceiling but were legally prohibited from doing so this method for determining the allocation of goods in short supply is known as rationing
from the mid-2000s through the 2010s shortages in venezuela occurred due to the venezuelan government's economic policies and hoarding by antigovernment businesses such as relying on foreign imports while creating strict foreign exchange controls put price controls in place and having expropriations result with lower domestic production as a result of such shortages venezuelans had to search for products wait in lines for hours and rationing was initiated with the government allowing the purchase of a certain amount of products through fingerprint recognition
whether an economic shortage of a certain good or service is beneficial or detrimental to society often depends on one's ethical and political views for instance consider the shortage of recreational drugs discussed above and the controversies around the use of such drugs likewise consider the economic shortage of cars in the soviet union during the 1980s on the one hand people had to wait in line to buy a new car on the other hand cars were more affordable than they would have been at market prices
== shortages and longages ==
garrett hardin emphasised that a shortage of supply can just as well be viewed as a longage of demand for instance a shortage of food can just as well be called a longage of people (overpopulation) by looking at it from this view he felt the problem could be better dealt with
== labour shortage ==
in its narrowest definition a labour shortage is an economic condition in which there are insufficient qualified candidates (employees) to fill the market-place demands for employment at any price such a condition is sometimes referred to by economists as an insufficiency in the labour force. an ageing population and a contracting workforce may curb u.s economic expansion for several decades for example
=== wage factors ===
wage levels have been suggested as one way to measure a labour shortage however this often does not match people's common perceptions for example if wages alone are the best measure of labour shortages then that would imply that we should be importing doctors instead of farm workers because doctors are far more expensive than farm workers however there are institutionally-imposed limits on the number of doctors that are allowed to be licensed if foreign migrant workers were not allowed into a nation then farm wages may go up but probably not enough to approach the wages of doctors
the atlantic slave trade (which originated in the early 17th century but ended by the early 19th century) was said to have originated due to perceived shortages of agricultural labour in the americas (particularly in the american south) as this was the only means of malaria resistance available at the time ironically malaria seems to itself have been introduced to the new world via the slave trade
