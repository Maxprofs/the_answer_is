a centimetre (international spelling as used by the international bureau of weights and measures symbol cm) or centimeter (american spelling) is a unit of length in the metric system equal to one hundredth of a metre centi being the si prefix for a factor of 1100 the centimetre was the base unit of length in the now deprecated centimetregramsecond (cgs) system of units
though for many physical quantities si prefixes for factors of 103like milli- and kilo-are often preferred by technicians the centimetre remains a practical unit of length for many everyday measurements a centimetre is approximately the width of the fingernail of an average adult person
== equivalence to other units of length ==
one cubic centimetre is equal to 1 millilitre under the current si system of units
== other uses ==
in addition to its use in the measurement of length the centimetre is used
sometimes to report the level of rainfall as measured by a rain gauge
in the cgs system the centimetre is used to measure capacitance where 1 cm of capacitance = 69881113000000000001.1131012 farads
in maps centimetres are used to make conversions from map scale to real world scale (kilometres)
to represent second moment of areas (cm4)
as the inverse of the kayser a cgs unit and thus a non-si metric unit of wavenumber 1 kayser = 1 wave per centimetre or more generally (wavenumber in kaysers) = 1/(wavelength in centimetres) the si unit of wavenumber is the inverse metre m1
== unicode symbols ==
for the purposes of compatibility with chinese japanese and korean (cjk) characters unicode has symbols for
centimetre () code 339d
square centimetre () code 33a0
cubic centimetre () code 33a4
they are mostly used only with east asian fixed-width cjk fonts because they are equal in size to one chinese character
