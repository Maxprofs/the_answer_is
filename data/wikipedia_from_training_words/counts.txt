count (male) or countess (female) is a title in european countries for a noble of varying status but historically deemed to convey an approximate rank intermediate between the highest and lowest titles of nobility the word count came into english from the french comte itself from latin comesin its accusative comitemmeaning companion and later companion of the emperor delegate of the emperor the adjective form of the word is comital the british and irish equivalent is an earl (whose wife is a countess for lack of an english term) alternative names for the count rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries such as graf in germany and hakushaku during the japanese imperial era
== definitionedit ==
in the late roman empire the latin title comes meaning (imperial) companion denoted the high rank of various courtiers and provincial officials either military or administrative before anthemius became emperor in the west in 467 he was military comes charged with strengthening defenses on the danube frontier
in the western roman empire count came to indicate generically a military commander but was not a specific rank in the eastern roman empire from about the seventh century count was a specific rank indicating the commander of two centuries (i.e 200 men)
military counts in the late empire and the germanic successor kingdoms were often appointed by a dux and later by a king from the start the count was not in charge of a roving warband but settled in a locality known as a countship his main rival for power was the bishop whose diocese was often coterminous with the countship
in many germanic and frankish kingdoms in the early middle ages a count might also be a count palatine whose authority derived directly from the royal household the palace in its original sense of the seat of power and administration this other kind of count had vague antecedents in late antiquity too the father of cassiodorus held positions of trust with theodoric as comes rerum privatarum in charge of the imperial lands then as comes sacrarum largitionum ("count of the sacred doles") concerned with the finances of the realm
the position of comes was originally not hereditary by virtue of their large estates many counts could pass the title to their heirsbut not always for instance in piast poland the position of komes was not hereditary resembling the early merovingian institution the title had disappeared by the era of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the office replaced with other institutions only after the partitions of poland did the title of count resurface in the german-derived title hrabia
the title of count was also often conferred by the monarch as an honorific title for special services rendered without an attaching feudal estate (countship county) it was merely a title with or without a domain name attached to it in the united kingdom the equivalent earl can also used as a courtesy title for the eldest son of a duke in italy by contrast all the sons of certain counts are counts (contini) in sweden there is a distinction between counts (swedish greve) introduced before and after 1809 all children in comital families introduced before 1809 are called count/countess in families introduced after 1809 only the head of the family is called count the rest had a status similar to barons and were called by the equivalent of mr/ms/mrs before the use of titles was abolished
== comital titles in different european languagesedit ==
the following lists are originally based on a glossary on heraldica.org by alexander krischnig the male form is followed by the female and when available by the territorial circumscription
=== etymological derivations from the latin comesedit ===
=== etymological parallels of the german graf (some unclear)edit ===
=== compound and related titlesedit ===
apart from all these a few unusual titles have been of comital rank not necessarily to remain there
dauphin (english dolphin spanish delfn italian delfino portuguese delfim latin delphinus) was a multiple (though rare) comital title in southern france used by the dauphins of vienne and auvergne before 1349 when it became the title of the heir to the french throne the dauphin was the lord of the province still known as the rgion dauphin
conde-duque count-duke is a rare title used in spain notably by gaspar de guzmn count-duke of olivares who had inherited the title of count of olivares but being created duke of sanlucar la mayor by king philip iv of spain begged permission to preserve his inherited title in combination with the new honouraccording to a practice almost unique in spanish history logically the incumbent ranks as duke (higher than count) just as he would when simply concatenating both titles
conde-baro count-baron is a rare title used in portugal notably by d lus lobo da silveira 7th baron of alvito who received the title of count of oriola in 1653 from king john iv of portugal his palace in lisbon still exists located in a square named after him (largo do conde-baro)
archcount is a very rare title etymologically analogous to archduke apparently never recognized officially used by or for
the count of flanders (an original pairie of the french realm in present belgium very rich once expected to be raised to the rank of kingdom) the informal rather descriptive use on account of the countship's de facto importance is rather analogous to the unofficial epithet grand duc de l'occident (before grand duke became a formal title) for the even wealthier duke of burgundy
at least one count of burgundy (i.e freigraf of franche-comt)
in german kingdoms the title graf was combined with the word for the jurisdiction or domain the nobleman was holding as a fief and/or as a conferred or inherited jurisdiction such as markgraf (see also marquess) landgraf freigraf ("free count") burggraf where burg signifies castle see also viscount pfalzgraf (translated both as count palatine and historically as palsgrave") raugraf ("raugrave see graf and waldgraf (comes nemoris) where wald signifies a large forest)
the german graf and dutch graaf (latin grafio) stems from the byzantine-greek grapheus meaning he who calls a meeting [i.e the court] together")
the ottoman military title of serdar was used in montenegro and serbia as a lesser noble title with the equivalent rank of a count
these titles are not to be confused with various minor administrative titles containing the word -graf in various offices which are not linked to nobility of feudality such as the dutch titles pluimgraaf (a court sinecure so usually held by noble courtiers may even be rendered hereditary) and dijkgraaf (to the present in the low countries a managing official in the local or regional administration of water household trough dykes ditches controls etcetera also in german deichgraf synonymous with deichhauptmann dike captain")

since louis vii (113780) the highest precedence amongst the vassals (prince-bishops and secular nobility) of the french crown was enjoyed by those whose benefice or temporal fief was a pairie i.e carried the exclusive rank of pair within the first (i.e clerical) and second (noble) estates the first three of the original twelve anciennes pairies were ducal the next three comital comt-pairies

==== in italyedit ====
the title of conte is very prolific on the peninsula in the eleventh century conti like the count of savoy or the norman count of apulia were virtually sovereign lords of broad territories even apparently lower"-sounding titles like viscount could describe powerful dynasts such as the visconti family who ruled a major city such as milan the essential title of a feudatory introduced by the normans was signore modelled on the french seigneur used with the name of the fief by the fourteenth century conte and the imperial title barone were virtually synonymous
some titles of count according to the particulars of the patent might be inherited by the eldest son of a count younger brothers might be distinguished as x dei conti di y ("x of the counts of y") however if there is no male to inherit the title and the count has a daughter in some regions she could inherit the title the papacy and the kingdom of the two sicilies might appoint counts palatine with no particular territorial fief until 1812 in some regions the purchaser of land designated feudal was ennobled by the noble seat that he held and became a conte this practice ceased with the formal abolition of feudalism in the various principalities of early-19th century italy last of all in the papal states
many italian counts left their mark on italian history as individuals yet only a few contadi (countships the word contadini for inhabitants of a county remains the italian word for peasant") were politically significant principalities notably
norman count of apulia
count of savoy later duke (also partly in france and in switzerland)

the japanese equivalent hakushaku () adapted during the meiji restoration
the korean equivalent baekjak or poguk
in vietnam it is rendered b one of the lower titles reserved for male members of the imperial clan above t (viscount) nam (baron) and vinh phong (lowest noble title) but lower thanin ascending orderhu (marquis) cng (prince) quan-cong (duke) and quc-cng (grand duke) all under vng (king)
