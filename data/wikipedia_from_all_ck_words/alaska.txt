alaska (/lsk/) is a u.s state situated in the northwest extremity of the north american continent bordering the state to the east are the canadian territory of yukon and the canadian province of british columbia to the north are the chukchi and beaufort seas southern parts of the arctic ocean to the west and south is the pacific ocean with russia (specifically chukotka autonomous okrug and kamchatka krai) farther west across the bering strait alaska is the largest state in the united states by area the 4th least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 united states approximately half of alaska's residents (estimated at 736,732 by the census bureau in 2014) live within the anchorage metropolitan area alaska's economy is dominated by the oil natural gas and fishing industries resources which it has in abundance tourism and military bases are also a significant part of the economy
although it had been occupied for over ten thousand years by indigenous peoples from the 18th century onward european powers considered the territory of alaska ripe for exploitation and trade the united states purchased alaska from the russian empire on march 30 1867 for 7.2 million u.s dollars at approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km2) the area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on may 11 1912 it was admitted as the 49th state of the u.s on january 3 1959
== etymology ==
the name alaska () was introduced in the russian colonial period when it was used to refer to the peninsula it was derived from an aleut or unangam idiom which figuratively refers to the mainland of alaska literally it means object to which the action of the sea is directed it is also known as alyeska the great land an aleut word derived from the same root
== geography ==
alaska is the northernmost easternmost and westernmost state in the united states and has the most easterly longitude in the united states because the aleutian islands extend into the eastern hemisphere alaska is the only non-contiguous u.s state on continental north america about 500 miles (800 km) of british columbia (canada) separates alaska from washington it is technically part of the continental u.s. but is sometimes not included in colloquial use alaska is not part of the contiguous u.s. often called the lower 48 the capital city juneau is situated on the mainland of the north american continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the north american highway system
the state is bordered by yukon and british columbia in canada to the east the gulf of alaska and the pacific ocean to the south the bering sea bering strait and chukchi sea to the west and the arctic ocean to the north alaska's territorial waters touch russia's territorial waters in the bering strait as the russian big diomede island and alaskan little diomede island are only 3 miles (4.8 km) apart alaska has a longer coastline than all the other u.s states combined
alaska is the largest state in the united states in land area at 663,268 square miles (1,717,856 km2) over twice the size of texas the next largest state alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign countries counting territorial waters alaska is larger than the combined area of the next three largest states texas california and montana it is also larger than the combined area of the 22 smallest u.s states
=== regions ===
there are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of alaska but there are six widely accepted regions
==== south central ====
the most populous region of alaska containing anchorage the matanuska-susitna valley and the kenai peninsula rural mostly unpopulated areas south of the alaska range and west of the wrangell mountains also fall within the definition of south central as do the prince william sound area and the communities of cordova and valdez
==== southeast ====
also referred to as the panhandle or inside passage this is the region of alaska closest to the rest of the united states as such this was where most of the initial non-indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the alaska purchase the region is dominated by the alexander archipelago as well as the tongass national forest the largest national forest in the united states it contains the state capital juneau the former capital sitka and ketchikan at one time alaska's largest city the alaska marine highway provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area as only three communities (haines hyder and skagway) enjoy direct connections to the contiguous north american road system
==== interior ====
the interior is the largest region of alaska much of it is uninhabited wilderness fairbanks is the only large city in the region denali national park and preserve is located here denali is the highest mountain in north america
==== southwest ====
southwest alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some 500 miles (800 km) inland from the bering sea most of the population lives along the coast kodiak island is also located in southwest the massive yukonkuskokwim delta one of the largest river deltas in the world is here portions of the alaska peninsula are considered part of southwest with the remaining portions included with the aleutian islands (see below)
==== north slope ====
the north slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages the area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil and contains both the national petroleum reservealaska and the prudhoe bay oil field barrow the northernmost city in the united states is located here the northwest arctic area anchored by kotzebue and also containing the kobuk river valley is often regarded as being part of this region however the respective inupiat of the north slope and of the northwest arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people
==== aleutian islands ====
more than 300 small volcanic islands make up this chain which stretches over 1,200 miles (1,900 km) into the pacific ocean some of these islands fall in the eastern hemisphere but the international date line was drawn west of 180 to keep the whole state and thus the entire north american continent within the same legal day two of the islands attu and kiska were occupied by japanese forces during world war ii
=== natural features ===
with its myriad islands alaska has nearly 34,000 miles (54,720 km) of tidal shoreline the aleutian islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the alaska peninsula many active volcanoes are found in the aleutians and in coastal regions unimak island for example is home to mount shishaldin which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to 10,000 feet (3,048 m) above the north pacific it is the most perfect volcanic cone on earth even more symmetrical than japan's mount fuji the chain of volcanoes extends to mount spurr west of anchorage on the mainland geologists have identified alaska as part of wrangellia a large region consisting of multiple states and canadian provinces in the pacific northwest which is actively undergoing continent building
one of the world's largest tides occurs in turnagain arm just south of anchorage tidal differences can be more than 35 feet (10.7 m)
alaska has more than three million lakes.marshlands and wetland permafrost cover 188,320 square miles (487,747 km2) (mostly in northern western and southwest flatlands) glacier ice covers some 16,000 square miles (41,440 km2) of land and 1,200 square miles (3,110 km2) of tidal zone the bering glacier complex near the southeastern border with yukon covers 2,250 square miles (5,827 km2) alone with over 100,000 glaciers alaska has half of all in the world
=== land ownership ===
according to an october 1998 report by the united states bureau of land management approximately 65% of alaska is owned and managed by the u.s federal government as public lands including a multitude of national forests national parks and national wildlife refuges of these the bureau of land management manages 87 million acres (35 million hectares) or 23.8% of the state the arctic national wildlife refuge is managed by the united states fish and wildlife service it is the world's largest wildlife refuge comprising 16 million acres (6.5 million hectares)
of the remaining land area the state of alaska owns 101 million acres (41 million hectares) its entitlement under the alaska statehood act a portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities these are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations the university of alaska as a land grant university also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently
another 44 million acres (18 million hectares) are owned by 12 regional and scores of local native corporations created under the alaska native claims settlement act (ancsa) of 1971 regional native corporation doyon limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in alaska in advertisements and other communications provisions of ancsa allowing the corporations land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect effectively the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases a privilege denied to individual alaskans) but cannot sell the land individual native allotments can be and are sold on the open market however
various private interests own the remaining land totaling about one percent of the state alaska is by a large margin the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when native corporation holdings are excluded
=== climate ===
the climate in southeast alaska is a mid-latitude oceanic climate (kppen climate classification cfb) in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate (kppen cfc) in the northern parts on an annual basis southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year juneau averages over 50 in (130 cm) of precipitation a year and ketchikan averages over 150 in (380 cm) this is also the only region in alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months
the climate of anchorage and south central alaska is mild by alaskan standards due to the region's proximity to the seacoast while the area gets less rain than southeast alaska it gets more snow and days tend to be clearer on average anchorage receives 16 in (41 cm) of precipitation a year with around 75 in (190 cm) of snow although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow it is a subarctic climate (kppen dfc) due to its brief cool summers
the climate of western alaska is determined in large part by the bering sea and the gulf of alaska it is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north the temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is this region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation an area stretching from the northern side of the seward peninsula to the kobuk river valley (i e. the region around kotzebue sound) is technically a desert with portions receiving less than 10 in (25 cm) of precipitation annually on the other extreme some locations between dillingham and bethel average around 100 in (250 cm) of precipitation
the climate of the interior of alaska is subarctic some of the highest and lowest temperatures in alaska occur around the area near fairbanks the summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s f (the low-to-mid 30s c) while in the winter the temperature can fall below 60 f (51 c) precipitation is sparse in the interior often less than 10 in (25 cm) a year but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter
the highest and lowest recorded temperatures in alaska are both in the interior the highest is 100 f (38 c) in fort yukon (which is just 8 mi or 13 km inside the arctic circle) on june 27 1915 making alaska tied with hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the united states the lowest official alaska temperature is 80 f (62 c) in prospect creek on january 23 1971 one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental north america (in snag yukon canada)
the climate in the extreme north of alaska is arctic (kppen et) with long very cold winters and short cool summers even in july the average low temperature in barrow is 34 f (1 c) precipitation is light in this part of alaska with many places averaging less than 10 in (25 cm) per year mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year
== history ==
=== alaska natives ===
numerous indigenous peoples occupied alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of european peoples to the area linguistic and dna studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of north america by way of the bering land bridge the tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today southeast alaska along with parts of british columbia and the yukon also in southeast were the haida now well known for their unique arts the tsimshian people came to alaska from british columbia in 1887 when president grover cleveland and later the u.s congress granted them permission to settle on annette island and found the town of metlakatla all three of these peoples as well as other indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s resulting in high fatalities and social disruption
the aleutian islands are still home to the aleut people's seafaring society although they were the first native alaskans to be exploited by russians western and southwestern alaska are home to the yup'ik while their cousins the alutiiq ~ sugpiaq lived in what is now southcentral alaska the gwich'in people of the northern interior region are athabaskan and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much-contested arctic national wildlife refuge the north slope and little diomede island are occupied by the widespread inupiat people
=== colonization ===
some researchers believe that the first russian settlement in alaska was established in the 17th century according to this hypothesis in 1648 several koches of semyon dezhnyov's expedition came ashore in alaska by storm and founded this settlement this hypothesis is based on the testimony of chukchi geographer nikolai daurkin who had visited alaska in 17641765 and who had reported on a village on the kheuveren river populated by bearded men who pray to the icons some modern researchers associate kheuveren with koyuk river
the first european vessel to reach alaska is generally held to be the st gabriel under the authority of the surveyor m s gvozdev and assistant navigator i fyodorov on august 21 1732 during an expedition of siberian cossak a f shestakov and belorussian explorer dmitry pavlutsky (17291735)
another european contact with alaska occurred in 1741 when vitus bering led an expedition for the russian navy aboard the st peter after his crew returned to russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of siberia toward the aleutian islands the first permanent european settlement was founded in 1784
between 1774 and 1800 spain sent several expeditions to alaska in order to assert its claim over the pacific northwest in 1789 a spanish settlement and fort were built in nootka sound these expeditions gave names to places such as valdez bucareli sound and cordova later the russian-american company carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century
sitka renamed new archangel from 1804 to 1867 on baranof island in the alexander archipelago in what is now southeast alaska became the capital of russian america it remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the united states the russians never fully colonized alaska and the colony was never very profitable evidence of russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast alaska
william h seward the united states secretary of state negotiated the alaska purchase (also known as seward's folly) with the russians in 1867 for $7.2 million alaska was loosely governed by the military initially and was administered as a district starting in 1884 with a governor appointed by the president of the united states a federal district court was headquartered in sitka
for most of alaska's first decade under the united states flag sitka was the only community inhabited by american settlers they organized a provisional city government, which was alaska's first municipal government but not in a legal sense legislation allowing alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900 and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in 1959
=== u.s territory ===
starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s gold rushes in alaska and the nearby yukon territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to alaska alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912 alaska's capital which had been in sitka until 1906 was moved north to juneau construction of the alaska governor's mansion began that same year european immigrants from norway and sweden also settled in southeast alaska where they entered the fishing and logging industries
during world war ii the aleutian islands campaign focused on the three outer aleutian islands attu agattu and kiska that were invaded by japanese troops and occupied between june 1942 and august 1943 unalaska/dutch harbor became a significant base for the u.s army air forces and navy submariners
the u.s lend-lease program involved the flying of american warplanes through canada to fairbanks and thence nome soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft ferrying them to fight the german invasion of the soviet union the construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some alaskan cities
=== statehood ===
statehood for alaska was an important cause of james wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate decades later the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946 the alaska statehood committee and alaska's constitutional convention would soon follow statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes mostly in the u.s congress but also within alaska statehood was approved by congress on july 7 1958 alaska was officially proclaimed a state on january 3 1959
in 1960 the census bureau reported alaska's population as 77.2% white 3% black and 18.8% american indian and alaska native
on march 27 1964 the massive good friday earthquake killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides it was the second-most-powerful earthquake in the recorded history of the world with a moment magnitude of 9.2 it was over one thousand times more powerful than the 1989 san francisco earthquake the time of day (5:36 pm) time of year and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives particularly in anchorage
the 1968 discovery of oil at prudhoe bay and the 1977 completion of the trans-alaska pipeline system led to an oil boom royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward that same year not coincidentally alaska repealed its state income tax
in 1989 the exxon valdez hit a reef in the prince william sound spilling over 11 million u.s gallons (42 megaliters) of crude oil over 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of coastline today the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and the proposed pebble mine
=== alaska heritage resources survey ===
the alaska heritage resources survey (ahrs) is a restricted inventory of all reported historic and prehistoric sites within the state of alaska it is maintained by the office of history and archaeology the survey's inventory of cultural resources includes objects structures buildings sites districts and travel ways with a general provision that they are over 50 years old as of january 31 2012 over 35,000 sites have been reported
== demographics ==
the united states census bureau estimates that the population of alaska was 736,732 on july 1 2014 a 3.73% increase since the 2010 united states census
in 2010 alaska ranked as the 47th state by population ahead of north dakota vermont and wyoming (and washington d.c.) alaska is the least densely populated state and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world at 1.2 inhabitants per square mile (0.46/km2) with the next state wyoming at 5.8 inhabitants per square mile (2.2/km2) alaska is the largest u.s state by area and the tenth wealthiest (per capita income) as of november 2014 the state's unemployment rate was 6.6%
=== race and ancestry ===
according to the 2010 united states census alaska had a population of 710,231 in terms of race and ethnicity the state was 66.7% white (64.1% non-hispanic white) 14.8% american indian and alaska native 5.4% asian 3.3% black or african american 1.0% native hawaiian and other pacific islander 1.6% from some other race and 7.3% from two or more races hispanics or latinos of any race made up 5.5% of the population
as of 2011 50.7% of alaska's population younger than one year of age belonged to minority groups (i.e. did not have two parents of non-hispanic white ancestry)
=== languages ===
according to the 2011 american community survey 82.4% of people over the age of five speak only english at home about 3.5% speak spanish at home about 2.2% speak another indo-european language at home and about 4.3% speak an asian language at home about 5.3% speak other languages at home
the alaska native language center at the university of alaska fairbanks claims that at least 20 alaskan native languages exist and there are also some languages with different dialects most of alaska's native languages belong to either the eskimoaleut or na-dene language families however some languages are thought to be isolates (e.g haida) or have not yet been classified (e.g tsimshianic) as of 2014 nearly all of alaska's native languages were classified as either threatened shifting moribund nearly extinct or dormant languages
a total of 5.2% of alaskans speak one of the state's 20 indigenous languages known locally as native languages as the homeland of these two major language families of north america alaska has been described as the crossroads of the continent
in october 2014 the governor of alaska signed a bill declaring the state's 20 indigenous languages as official languages
=== religion ===
according to statistics collected by the association of religion data archives from 2010 about 34% of alaska residents were members of religious congregations 100,960 people identified as evangelical protestants 50,866 as roman catholic and 32,550 as mainline protestants roughly 4% are mormon 0.5% are jewish 1% are muslim 0.5% are buddhist and 0.5% are hindu the largest religious denominations in alaska as of 2010 were the catholic church with 50,866 adherents non-denominational evangelical protestants with 38,070 adherents the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints with 32,170 adherents and the southern baptist convention with 19,891 adherents alaska has been identified along with pacific northwest states washington and oregon as being the least religious states of the usa in terms of church membership
in 1795 the first russian orthodox church was established in kodiak intermarriage with alaskan natives helped the russian immigrants integrate into society as a result an increasing number of russian orthodox churches gradually became established within alaska alaska also has the largest quaker population (by percentage) of any state in 2009 there were 6,000 jews in alaska (for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems) alaskan hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other asian religious communities including sikhs and jains
estimates for the number of muslims in alaska range from 2,000 to 5,000 the islamic community center of anchorage began efforts in the late 1990s to construct a mosque in anchorage they broke ground on a building in south anchorage in 2010 and were nearing completion in late 2014 when completed the mosque will be the first in the state and one of the northernmost mosques in the world
== economy ==
the 2007 gross state product was $44.9 billion 45th in the nation its per capita personal income for 2007 was $40,042 ranking 15th in the nation according to a 2013 study by phoenix marketing international alaska had the fifth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the united states with a ratio of 6.75 percent the oil and gas industry dominates the alaskan economy with more than 80% of the state's revenues derived from petroleum extraction alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood primarily salmon cod pollock and crab
agriculture represents a very small fraction of the alaskan economy agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock dairy products vegetables and livestock manufacturing is limited with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere
employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction shipping and transportation military bases are a significant component of the economy in the fairbanks north star anchorage and kodiak island boroughs as well as kodiak federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy allowing the state to keep taxes low its industrial outputs are crude petroleum natural gas coal gold precious metals zinc and other mining seafood processing timber and wood products there is also a growing service and tourism sector tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging
=== energy ===
alaska has vast energy resources although its oil reserves have been largely depleted major oil and gas reserves were found in the alaska north slope (ans) and cook inlet basins but according to the energy information administration by february 2014 alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after texas north dakota and california prudhoe bay on alaska's north slope is still the second highest-yielding oil field in the united states typically producing about 400,000 barrels per day (64,000 m3/d) although by early 2014 north dakota's bakken formation was producing over 900,000 barrels per day (140,000 m3/d) prudhoe bay was the largest conventional oil field ever discovered in north america but was much smaller than canada's enormous athabasca oil sands field which by 2014 was producing about 1,500,000 barrels per day (240,000 m3/d) of unconventional oil and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate
the trans-alaska pipeline can transport and pump up to 2.1 million barrels (330,000 m3) of crude oil per day more than any other crude oil pipeline in the united states additionally substantial coal deposits are found in alaska's bituminous sub-bituminous and lignite coal basins the united states geological survey estimates that there are 85.4 trillion cubic feet (2,420 km3) of undiscovered technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the alaskan north slope alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers large swaths of the alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well
alaska's economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating transportation electric power and light though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g with special low-cost electric interties) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report 2001) due to low (less than 50/gal) fuel prices long distances and low population the cost of a gallon of gas in urban alaska today is usually 3060 higher than the national average prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs seasonal usage peaks nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors
==== permanent fund ====
the alaska permanent fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil largely in anticipation of the recently constructed trans-alaska pipeline system the fund was originally proposed by governor keith miller on the eve of the 1969 prudhoe bay lease sale out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900 million) at once it was later championed by governor jay hammond and kenai state representative hugh malone it has served as an attractive political prospect ever since diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund
the alaska constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation from its initial principal of $734,000 the fund has grown to $50 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside alaska this has led to frequent calls by alaskan politicians for the fund to make investments within alaska though such a stance has never gained momentum
starting in 1982 dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years payout as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 resource rebate") every year the state legislature takes out 8% from the earnings puts 3% back into the principal for inflation proofing and the remaining 5% is distributed to all qualifying alaskans to qualify for the permanent fund dividend one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment
the permanent fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a basic income policy in the world
=== cost of living ===
the cost of goods in alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states federal government employees particularly united states postal service (usps) workers and active-duty military members receive a cost of living allowance usually set at 25% of base pay because while the cost of living has gone down it is still one of the highest in the country
rural alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure
=== agriculture and fishing ===
due to the northern climate and short growing season relatively little farming occurs in alaska most farms are in either the matanuska valley about 40 miles (64 km) northeast of anchorage or on the kenai peninsula about 60 miles (97 km) southwest of anchorage the short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons the primary crops are potatoes carrots lettuce and cabbage
the tanana valley is another notable agricultural locus especially the delta junction area about 100 miles (160 km) southeast of fairbanks with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops these farms mostly lie north and east of fort greely this area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by hammond during his second term as governor delta-area crops consist predominately of barley and hay west of fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants the hotel and tourist industry and community-supported agriculture
alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of market gardeners small farms and farmers markets in recent years with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers markets in 2011 compared to 17% nationwide the peony industry has also taken off as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world thereby filling a niche in the flower market
alaska with no counties lacks county fairs however a small assortment of state and local fairs (with the alaska state fair in palmer the largest) are held mostly in the late summer the fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides concerts and food alaska grown is used as an agricultural slogan
alaska has an abundance of seafood with the primary fisheries in the bering sea and the north pacific seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it many alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence as well as sport this includes fish taken by hook net or wheel
hunting for subsistence primarily caribou moose and dall sheep is still common in the state particularly in remote bush communities an example of a traditional native food is akutaq the eskimo ice cream which can consist of reindeer fat seal oil dried fish meat and local berries
alaska's reindeer herding is concentrated on seward peninsula where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer
most food in alaska is transported into the state from outside and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive in rural areas subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive though most small towns and villages in alaska lie along the coastline the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high because of the terrain and difficult road conditions which change dramatically due to varying climate and precipitation changes the cost of transport can reach as high as 50 per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas during the most difficult times if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions the cost of delivering a 1 us gallon (3.8 l) of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less fuel cost per gallon is routinely 2030 higher than the continental united states average with only hawaii having higher prices
== transportation ==
=== roads ===
alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the u.s the state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state linking the central population centers and the alaska highway the principal route out of the state through canada the state capital juneau is not accessible by road only a car ferry which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system or building a road connection from haines the western part of alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of alaska
one unique feature of the alaska highway system is the anton anderson memorial tunnel an active alaska railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of whittier on prince william sound to the seward highway about 50 miles (80 km) southeast of anchorage at portage at 2.5 miles (4.0 km) the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in north america until 2007 the tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in north america
=== rail ===
built around 1915 the alaska railroad (arr) played a key role in the development of alaska through the 20th century it links north pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from seward to interior alaska by way of south central alaska passing through anchorage eklutna wasilla talkeetna denali and fairbanks with spurs to whittier palmer and north pole the cities towns villages and region served by arr tracks are known statewide as the railbelt in recent years the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in alaska's economy
the railroad played a vital role in alaska's development moving freight into alaska while transporting natural resources southward (i.e. coal from the usibelli coal mine near healy to seward and gravel from the matanuska valley to anchorage) it is well known for its summertime tour passenger service
the alaska railroad was one of the last railroads in north america to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains it continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country a stretch of about 60 miles (100 km) of track along an area north of talkeetna remains inaccessible by road the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area until construction of the parks highway in the 1970s the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route
in northern southeast alaska the white pass and yukon route also partly runs through the state from skagway northwards into canada (british columbia and yukon territory) crossing the border at white pass summit this line is now mainly used by tourists often arriving by cruise liner at skagway it was featured in the 1983 bbc television series great little railways
the alaska rail network is not connected to outside in 2000 the u.s congress authorized $6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between alaska canada and the lower 48
alaska rail marine provides car float service between whittier and seattle
=== marine transport ===
many cities towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access the only modes of access involve travel by air river or the sea
alaska's well-developed state-owned ferry system (known as the alaska marine highway) serves the cities of southeast the gulf coast and the alaska peninsula the ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers the system also operates a ferry service from bellingham washington and prince rupert british columbia in canada through the inside passage to skagway the inter-island ferry authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the prince of wales island region of southeast and works in concert with the alaska marine highway
in recent years cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market mainly connecting the pacific northwest to southeast alaska and to a lesser degree towns along alaska's gulf coast the population of ketchikan may rise by over 10,000 people on many days during the summer as up to four large cruise ships at a time can dock debarking thousands of passengers
=== air transport ===
cities not served by road sea or river can be reached only by air foot dogsled or snowmachine accounting for alaska's extremely well developed bush air servicesan alaskan novelty anchorage and to a lesser extent fairbanks is served by many major airlines because of limited highway access air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at ted stevens anchorage international airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2012-2013 alaska received almost 2 million visitors)
regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the essential air service program alaska airlines is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger boeing 737-400s) from anchorage and fairbanks to regional hubs like bethel nome kotzebue dillingham kodiak and other larger communities as well as to major southeast and alaska peninsula communities
the bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as ravn alaska penair and frontier flying service the smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the cessna caravan the most popular aircraft in use in the state much of this service can be attributed to the alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to alaskan rural communities the program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities
many communities have small air taxi services these operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas perhaps the most quintessentially alaskan plane is the bush seaplane the world's busiest seaplane base is lake hood located next to ted stevens anchorage international airport where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers cargo and many items from stores and warehouse clubs in 2006 alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any u.s state
=== other transport ===
another alaskan transportation method is the dogsled in modern times (that is any time after the mid-late 1920s) dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation various races are held around the state but the best known is the iditarod trail sled dog race a 1,150-mile (1,850 km) trail from anchorage to nome (although the distance varies from year to year the official distance is set at 1,049 miles or 1,688 km) the race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to nome in which mushers and dogs like togo and balto took much-needed medicine to the diphtheria-stricken community of nome when all other means of transportation had failed mushers from all over the world come to anchorage each march to compete for cash prizes and prestige the serum run is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay leaving from the community of nenana (southwest of fairbanks) to nome
in areas not served by road or rail primary transportation in summer is by all-terrain vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or snow machine, as it is commonly referred to in alaska
=== data transport ===
alaska's internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies gci and alaska communications gci owns and operates what it calls the alaska united fiber optic system and as of late 2011 alaska communications advertised that it has two fiber optic paths to the lower 48 and two more across alaska in january 2011 it was reported that a $1 billion project to run connect asia and rural alaska was being planned aided in part by $350 million in stimulus from the federal government

fairbanks has one of the highest property taxes in the state as no sales or income taxes are assessed in the fairbanks north star borough (fnsb) a sales tax for the fnsb has been voted on many times but has yet to be approved leading law makers to increase taxes dramatically on goods such as liquor and tobacco
in 2014 the tax foundation ranked alaska as having the fourth most business friendly tax policy behind only wyoming south dakota and nevada
=== federal politics ===
alaska regularly supports republicans in presidential elections and has done so since statehood republicans have won the state's electoral college votes in all but one election that it has participated in (1964) no state has voted for a democratic presidential candidate fewer times alaska was carried by democratic nominee lyndon b johnson during his landslide election in 1964 while the 1960 and 1968 elections were close since 1972 however republicans have carried the state by large margins in 2008 republican john mccain defeated democrat barack obama in alaska 59.49% to 37.83% mccain's running mate was sarah palin the state's governor and the first alaskan on a major party ticket obama lost alaska again in 2012 but he captured 40% of the state's vote in that election making him the first democrat to do so since 1968
the alaska bush central juneau midtown and downtown anchorage and the areas surrounding the university of alaska fairbanks campus and ester have been strongholds of the democratic party the matanuska-susitna borough the majority of fairbanks (including north pole and the military base) and south anchorage typically have the strongest republican showing as of 2004 well over half of all registered voters have chosen non-partisan or undeclared as their affiliation despite recent attempts to close primaries to unaffiliated voters
because of its population relative to other u.s states alaska has only one member in the u.s house of representatives this seat is held by republican don young who was re-elected to his 21st consecutive term in 2012 alaska's at-large congressional district is one of the largest parliamentary constituencies in the world

== cities towns and boroughs ==
alaska is not divided into counties as most of the other u.s states but it is divided into boroughs many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of alaska's 16 boroughs which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states however unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state the area not part of any borough is referred to as the unorganized borough
the unorganized borough has no government of its own but the u.s census bureau in cooperation with the state divided the unorganized borough into 11 census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation a recording district is a mechanism for administration of the public record in alaska the state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a state recorder all recording districts use the same acceptance criteria fee schedule etc. for accepting documents into the public record
whereas many u.s states use a three-tiered system of decentralizationstate/county/townshipmost of alaska uses only two tiersstate/borough owing to the low population density most of the land is located in the unorganized borough as the name implies it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government in 2000 57.71% of alaska's area has this status with 13.05% of the population
anchorage merged the city government with the greater anchorage area borough in 1975 to form the municipality of anchorage containing the city proper and the communities of eagle river chugiak peters creek girdwood bird and indian fairbanks has a separate borough (the fairbanks north star borough) and municipality (the city of fairbanks)

of alaska's 2010 census population figure of 710,231 20,429 people or 2.88% of the population did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of ketchikan kodiak palmer and wasilla cdps have not been established for these areas by the united states census bureau except that seven cdps were established for the ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the 1980 census (clover pass herring cove ketchikan east mountain point north tongass highway pennock island and saxman east) but have not been used since the remaining population was scattered throughout alaska both within organized boroughs and in the unorganized borough in largely remote areas
