facilitated diffusion also known facilitated transport passivemediated transport process spontaneous passive transport opposed active transport molecules ions across biological membrane via specific transmembrane integral proteins passive facilitated transport directly require chemical energy atp hydrolysis transport step rather molecules ions move concentration gradient reflecting diffusive nature
facilitated diffusion different free diffusion several ways first transport relies molecular binding cargo membraneembedded channel carrier protein second rate facilitated diffusion saturable respect concentration difference two phases unlike free diffusion linear concentration difference third temperature dependence facilitated transport substantially different due presence activated binding event compared free diffusion dependence temperature mild
polar molecules large ions dissolved water cannot diffuse freely across plasma membrane due hydrophobic nature fatty acid tails phospholipids make lipid bilayer small nonpolar molecules oxygen carbon dioxide diffuse easily across membrane hence nonpolar molecules transported proteins form transmembrane channels channels gated meaning open close thus deregulate flow ions small polar molecules across membranes sometimes osmotic gradient larger molecules transported transmembrane carrier proteins permeases change conformation molecules carried across eg glucose amino acids nonpolar molecules retinol lipids poorly soluble water transported aqueous compartments cells extracellular space watersoluble carriers eg retinol binding protein metabolites altered energy required facilitated diffusion permease changes shape order transport metabolites form transport cell membrane metabolite modified called group translocation transportation
glucose sodium ions chloride ions examples molecules ions must efficiently cross plasma membrane lipid bilayer membrane virtually impermeable transport must therefore facilitated proteins span membrane provide alternative route bypass mechanism
various attempts made engineers mimic process facilitated transport synthetic ie nonbiological membranes use industrialscale gas liquid separations met limited success date often reasons related poor carrier stability andor dissociation carrier membrane
