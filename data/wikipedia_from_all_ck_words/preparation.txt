== construction ==
in the u.s. older barns were built from timbers hewn from trees on the farm and built as a log crib barn or timber frame although stone barns were sometimes built in areas where stone was a cheaper building material in the mid to late 19th century in the u.s barn framing methods began to shift away from traditional timber framing to truss framed or plank framed buildings truss or plank framed barns reduced the number of timbers instead using dimensional lumber for the rafters joists and sometimes the trusses the joints began to become bolted or nailed instead of being mortised and tenoned the inventor and patentee of the jennings barn claimed his design used less lumber less work less time and less cost to build and were durable and provided more room for hay storage mechanization on the farm better transportation infrastructure and new technology like a hay fork mounted on a track contributed to a need for larger more open barns sawmills using steam power could produce smaller pieces of lumber affordably and machine cut nails were much less expensive than hand-made (wrought) nails concrete block began to be used for barns in the early 20th century in the u.s
modern barns are more typically steel buildings from about 1900 to 1940 many large dairy barns were built in northern usa these commonly have gambrel or hip roofs to maximize the size of the hay loft above the dairy roof and have become associated in the popular image of a dairy farm the barns that were common to the wheatbelt held large numbers of pulling horses such as clydesdales or percherons these large wooden barns especially when filled with hay could make spectacular fires that were usually total losses for the farmers with the advent of balers it became possible to store hay and straw outdoors in stacks surrounded by a plowed fireguard many barns in the northern united states are painted barn red with a white trim one possible reason for this is that ferric oxide which is used to create red paint was the cheapest and most readily available chemical for farmers in new england and nearby areas another possible reason is that ferric oxide acts a preservative and so painting a barn with it would help to protect the structure
with the popularity of tractors following world war ii many barns were taken down or replaced with modern quonset huts made of plywood or galvanized steel beef ranches and dairies began building smaller loftless barns often of quonset huts or of steel walls on a treated wood frame (old telephone or power poles) by the 1960s it was found that cattle receive sufficient shelter from trees or wind fences (usually wooden slabs 20% open)

== historic farm buildings ==
old farm buildings of the countryside contribute to the landscape and help define the history of the location i.e how farming took place in the past and how the area has been settled throughout the ages they also can show the agricultural methods building materials and skills that were used most were built with materials reflecting the local geology of the area building methods include earth walling and thatching
buildings in stone and brick roofed with tile or slate increasingly replaced buildings in clay timber and thatch from the later 18th century metal roofs started to be used from the 1850s the arrival of canals and railways brought about transportation of building materials over greater distances
clues determining their age and historical use can be found from old maps sale documents estate plans and from a visual inspection of the building itself,noting (for example) reused timbers former floors partitions doors and windows
the arrangement of the buildings within the farmstead can also yield valuable information on the historical farm usage and landscape value linear farmsteads were typical of small farms where there was an advantage to having cattle and fodder within one building due to the colder climate dispersed clusters of unplanned groups were more widespread loose courtyard plans built around a yard were associated with bigger farms whereas carefully laid out courtyard plans designed to minimize waste and labour were built in the latter part of the 18th century
the barns are typically the oldest and biggest buildings to be found on the farm many barns were converted into cow houses and fodder processing and storage buildings after the 1880s many barns had owl holes to allow for access by barn owls encouraged to aid vermin control
the stable is typically the second-oldest building type on the farm they were well built and placed near the house due to the value that the horses had as draught animals
modern granaries were built from the 18th century complete granary interiors with plastered walls and wooden partitioning to grain bins are very rare
longhouses are an ancient building where people and animals used the same entrance these can still be seen for example in north germany where the low saxon house occurs
few interiors of the 19th century cow houses have survived unaltered due to dairy-hygiene regulations in many countries
old farm buildings may show the following signs of deterioration rotting in timber-framed constructions due to damp cracks in the masonry from movement of the walls e.g ground movement roofing problems (e.g outward thrust of it deterioration of purlins and gable ends) foundation problems penetration of tree roots lime mortar being washed away due to inadequate weather-protection walls made of cob earth mortars or walls with rubble cores are all highly vulnerable to water penetration and replacement or covering of breathable materials with cement or damp-proofing materials may trap moisture within the walls
in england and wales some of these historical buildings have been given listed building status which provides them some degree of archaeological protection
some grant schemes are available to restore historic farmland buildings for example natural england's environmental stewardship countryside stewardship and environmentally sensitive areas schemes
