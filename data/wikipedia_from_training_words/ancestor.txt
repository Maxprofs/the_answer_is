an ancestor or forebear is a parent or (recursively) the parent of an ancestor (i.e. a grandparent great-grandparent great-great-grandparent and so forth) ancestor is any person from whom one is descended in law the person from whom an estate has been inherited.
two individuals have a genetic relationship if one is the ancestor of the other or if they share a common ancestor from the past in evolutionary theory species which share an evolutionary ancestor are said to be of common descent however this concept of ancestry does not apply to some bacteria and other organisms capable of horizontal gene transfer
assuming that all of an individual's ancestors are otherwise unrelated to each other that individual has 2n ancestors in the nth generation before him and a total of about 2g+1 ancestors in the g generations before him in practice however it is clear that the vast majority of ancestors of humans (and indeed any other species) are multiply related (see pedigree collapse) consider n = 40 the human species is more than 40 generations old yet the number 240 approximately 1012 or one trillion dwarfs the number of humans who have ever lived
ignoring the possibility of other inter-relationships (even distant ones) among ancestors an individual has a total of 2046 ancestors up to the 10th generation 1024 of which are 10th-generation ancestors with the same assumption any given person has over a billion 30th-generation ancestors (who lived roughly 1000 years ago) and this theoretical number increases past the estimated total population of the world in around ad 1000 (all of these ancestors will have contributed to one's autosomal dna this excludes y-chromosomal dna and mitochondrial dna.)
some cultures confer reverence to ancestors both living and dead in contrast some more youth-oriented cultural contexts display less veneration of elders in other cultural contexts some people seek providence from their deceased ancestors this practice is sometimes known as ancestor worship or more accurately ancestor veneration
