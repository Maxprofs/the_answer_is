in recent decades various states modeled some of their assets and enterprises after business enterprises in 2003 for example the people's republic of china modeled 80% of its state-owned enterprises on a company-type management system many state institutions and enterprises in china and russia have transformed into joint-stock companies with part of their shares being listed on public stock markets

== organization and government regulationedit ==
most legal jurisdictions specify the forms of ownership that a business can take creating a body of commercial law for each type
the major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually
the size and scope of the business firm and its structure management and ownership broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm generally a smaller business is more flexible while larger businesses or those with wider ownership or more formal structures will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships in addition a business that wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so
the sector and country private profit-making businesses are different from government-owned bodies in some countries certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways
limited liability companies (llc) limited liability partnerships and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from business failure by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections in contrast unincorporated businesses or persons working on their own are usually not so protected
tax advantages different structures are treated differently in tax law and may have advantages for this reason
disclosure and compliance requirements different business structures may be required to make less or more information public (or report it to relevant authorities) and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations
many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability) most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant secretary of state or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations the relationships and legal rights of shareholders limited partners or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized generally speaking shareholders in a corporation limited partners in a limited partnership and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity which is legally treated as a separate person this means that unless there is misconduct the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed
where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle they will be treated as a general partnership the terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located no paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership and without an agreement the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located a single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a sole proprietor whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity
a few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include
general partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership) plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business
generally corporations are required to pay tax just like real people in some tax systems this can give rise to so-called double taxation because first the corporation pays tax on the profit and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed
in most countries there are laws which treat small corporations differently from large ones they may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws have simplified procedures in specialized areas and have simplified advantageous or slightly different tax treatment
going public through a process known as an initial public offering (ipo) means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public this requires organization as a distinct entity and compliance with a tighter set of laws and procedures most public entities are corporations that have sold shares but increasingly there are also public llcs that sell units (sometimes also called shares) and other more exotic entities as well such as for example real estate investment trusts in the usa and unit trusts in the uk a general partnership cannot go public.
=== commercial lawedit ===
a very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions the need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts the code of hammurabi dates back to about 1772 bc for example and contains provisions that relate among other matters to shipping costs and dealings between merchants and brokers the word corporation derives from the latin corpus meaning body and the maurya empire in iron-age india accorded legal rights to business entities
in many countries it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source laws can govern treatment of labour and employee relations worker protection and safety discrimination on the basis of age gender disability race and in some jurisdictions sexual orientation and the minimum wage as well as unions worker compensation and working hours and leave
some specialized businesses may also require licenses either due to laws governing entry into certain trades occupations or professions that require special education or to raise revenue for local governments professions that require special licenses include law medicine piloting aircraft selling liquor radio broadcasting selling investment securities selling used cars and roofing local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business
some businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation for example public utilities investment securities banking insurance broadcasting aviation and health care providers environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many businesses
=== capitaledit ===
when businesses need to raise money (called capital) they sometimes offer securities for sale
capital may be raised through private means by an initial public offering or ipo on a stock exchange or in other ways
major stock exchanges include the shanghai stock exchange singapore exchange hong kong stock exchange new york stock exchange and nasdaq (usa) the london stock exchange (uk) the tokyo stock exchange (japan) and bombay stock exchange (india) most countries with capital markets have at least one
businesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance such as how executive officers compensation is determined and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public in the united states these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the united states securities and exchange commission (sec) other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies the regulations are implemented and enforced by the china securities regulation commission (csrc) in china in singapore the regulation authority is the monetary authority of singapore (mas) and in hong kong it is the securities and futures commission (sfc)
the proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law it is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation commercial law spans general corporate law employment and labor law health-care law securities law mergers and acquisitions tax law employee benefit plans food and drug regulation intellectual property law on copyrights patents trademarks and such telecommunications law financing
other types of capital sourcing includes crowd sourcing on the internet venture capital bank loans and debentures
=== intellectual propertyedit ===
businesses often have important intellectual property that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable this could require patents copyrights trademarks or preservation of trade secrets most businesses have names logos and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking patents and copyrights in the united states are largely governed by federal law while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law because of the nature of intellectual property a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors many countries are signatories to international treaties concerning intellectual property and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties in order to protect trade secrets companies may require employees to sign non-compete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee's interactions with stakeholders and competitors
