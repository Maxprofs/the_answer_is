general features apicomplexaedit
members phylum infectious stage sporozoite possesses three distinct structures apical complex apical complex consists set spirally arranged microtubules conoid secretory body rhoptry one polar rings additional slender electrondense secretory bodies micronemes surrounded one two polar rings may also present structure gives phylum name
group spherical organelles distributed throughout cell rather localized apical complex known dense granules typically mean diameter m secretion densegranule content takes place parasite invasion localization within parasitophorous vacuole persists several minutes
morphological findings common members phylum include
nucleus haploid
flagella found motile gamete posteriorly directed vary number usually one three
basal bodies present although hemosporidians piroplasmids normal triplets microtubules basal bodies coccidians gregarines nine singlets
mitochondria tubular cristae
golgi apparatus present
centrioles chloroplasts ejectile organelles inclusions absent
colourless plastids present species
cell surrounded pellicle three membrane layers alveolar structure penetrated micropores
replication
mitosis usually closed intranuclear spindle species open poles
cell division usually schizogony
meiosis occurs zygote
mobility
apicomplexans unique gliding capability enables cross tissues enter leave host cells gliding ability made possible use adhesions small static myosin motors
features common phylum lack cilia sexual reproduction use micropores feeding production oocysts containing sporozoites infective form
apicomplexans apicoplast nonphotosynthetic plastid mitochondrial nuclear genomes although cryptosporidium species gregarines possible exceptions thought lost plastids diverging last common ancestor apicomplexans

gregarinesedit
gregarines generally parasites annelids arthropods mollusks often found guts hosts may invade tissues typical gregarine lifecycle trophozoite develops within host cell schizont divides number merozoites schizogony merozoites released lysing host cell turn invade cells point apicomplexan lifecycle gametocytes formed released lysis host cells group together gametocyte forms multiple gametes gametes fuse another form oocysts oocysts leave host taken new host
coccidiansedit
general coccidians parasites vertebrates like gregarines commonly parasites epithelial cells gut may infect tissues
coccidian lifecycle involves merogony gametogony sporogony similar gregarines differs zygote formation trophozoites enlarge become macrogamete whereas others divide repeatedly form microgametes anisogamy microgametes motile must reach macrogamete fertilize fertilized macrogamete forms zygote turn forms oocyst normally released body syzygy occurs involves markedly anisogamous gametes lifecycle typically haploid diploid stage occurring zygote normally shortlived
main difference coccidians gregarines gamonts coccida small intracellular without epimerites mucrons gregarines large extracellular possess epimerites mucrons second difference coccidia gregarines also lies gamonts coccidian single gamont becomes macrogametocyte whereas gregarines gamonts give rise multiple gametocytes
haemosporidiaedit
haemosporidia complex lifecycles alternate arthropod vertebrate host trophozoite parasitises erythrocytes tissues vertebrate host microgametes macrogametes always found blood gametes taken insect vector blood meal microgametes migrate within gut insect vector fuse macrogametes fertilized macrogamete becomes ookinete penetrates body vector ookinete transforms oocyst divides initially meiosis mitosis haplontic lifecycle give rise sporozoites sporozoites escape oocyst migrate within body vector salivary glands injected new vertebrate host insect vector feeds
reproduction lifecycleedit
members complex lifecycle involving asexual sexual reproduction typically host infected via active invasion parasites similar entosis divide produce sporozoites enter cells eventually cells burst releasing merozoites infect new cells may occur several times gamonts produced forming gametes fuse create new cysts many variations occur basic pattern however many apicomplexa one host
apical complex includes vesicles called rhoptries micronemes open anterior cell secrete enzymes allow parasite enter cells tip surrounded band microtubules called polar ring among conoidasida also funnel tubulin proteins called conoid rest cell except diminished mouth called micropore membrane supported vesicles called alveoli forming semirigid pellicle
presence alveoli traits place apicomplexa among group called alveolates several related flagellates perkinsus colpodella structures similar polar ring formerly included appear closer relatives dinoflagellates probably similar common ancestor two groups
another similarity many apicomplexan cells contain single plastid called apicoplast surrounded either three four membranes functions thought include tasks lipid heme biosynthesis appears necessary survival general plastids considered common origin chloroplasts dinoflagellates evidence points origin red algae rather green
