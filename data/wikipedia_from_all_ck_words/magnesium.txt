magnesium is a chemical element with symbol mg and atomic number 12 it is a shiny gray solid which bears a close physical resemblance to the other five elements in the second column (group 2 or alkaline earth metals) of the periodic table they each have the same electron configuration in their outer electron shell producing a similar crystal structure
magnesium is the ninth most abundant element in the universe it is synthesized in large aging stars from the sequential addition of three helium nuclei to a carbon nucleus when such a star explodes as a supernova much of its magnesium is expelled into the interstellar medium where it can be recycled into new star systems consequently magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the earth's crust and the fourth most common element in the earth (below iron oxygen and silicon) making up 13% of the planet's mass and a large fraction of the planet's mantle it is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater after sodium and chlorine
magnesium only occurs naturally in combination with other elements where it invariably has a +2 oxidation state the free element (metal) can be produced artificially and is highly reactive (though once produced it is coated in a thin layer of oxide which partly inhibits this reactivity see passivation) the free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant-white light making it a useful ingredient in flares the metal is now obtained mainly by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine in commerce the chief use for the metal is as an alloying agent to make aluminium-magnesium alloys sometimes called magnalium or magnelium since magnesium is less dense than aluminium this alloy is prized for its properties of lightness combined with strength
magnesium is the eleventh most abundant element by mass in the human body its ions are essential to all cells they interact with polyphosphate compounds such as atp dna and rna hundreds of enzymes require magnesium ions to function magnesium compounds are used medicinally as common laxatives antacids (e.g. milk of magnesia) and to stabilize abnormal nerve excitation or blood vessel spasm such as in eclampsia magnesium ions are sour to the taste and in low concentrations they help impart a natural tartness to fresh mineral waters magnesium is the metallic ion at the center of chlorophyll and is a common additive to fertilizers

=== physical propertiesedit ===
elemental magnesium is a gray-white lightweight metal two-thirds the density of aluminium it tarnishes slightly when exposed to air although unlike the other alkaline earth metals an oxygen-free environment is unnecessary for storage because magnesium is protected by a thin layer of oxide that is fairly impermeable and difficult to remove magnesium has both the lowest melting and the lowest boiling points of any of the alkali earth metals at 923 k (1,202 f) and 1,363 k (1,994 f) respectively
magnesium reacts with water at room temperature though it reacts much more slowly than the similar earth alkali metal calcium when submerged in water hydrogen bubbles almost unnoticeably begin to form on the surface of the metalthough if powdered it reacts much more rapidly the reaction occurs faster with higher temperatures (see precautions) magnesium's ability to react with water can be harnessed to produce energy and run a magnesium-based engine
magnesium also reacts exothermically with most acids such as hydrochloric acid (hcl) this reaction with hcl produces the chloride of the metal and releases hydrogen gas (just as when hcl reacts with aluminium zinc and many other metals)
=== chemical propertiesedit ===
==== flammabilityedit ====
magnesium is a highly flammable metal especially when powdered or shaved into thin strips (it is however difficult to ignite in mass or bulk) flame temperatures of magnesium and magnesium alloys can reach 3,100 c (3,370 k 5,610 f) although flame height above the burning metal is usually less than 300 mm (12 in) once ignited it is difficult to extinguish being able to burn in nitrogen (forming magnesium nitride) carbon dioxide (forming magnesium oxide and carbon) and water (forming magnesium oxide and hydrogen) this property was used in incendiary weapons used in the firebombing of cities in world war ii the only practical civil defense being to smother a burning flare under dry sand to exclude the atmosphere magnesium may also be used as an ignition source for thermite a mixture of aluminium and iron oxide powder that is otherwise difficult to ignite
==== source of lightedit ====
upon burning in air magnesium produces a brilliant-white light that includes strong ultraviolet thus magnesium powder (flash powder) was used as a source of illumination in the early days of photography later magnesium ribbon was used in electrically ignited flashbulbs magnesium powder is used in the manufacture of fireworks and marine flares where a brilliant white light is required
=== occurrenceedit ===
magnesium is the eighth-most-abundant element in the earth's crust by mass and tied in seventh place with iron in terms of molarity it is found in large deposits of magnesite dolomite and other minerals and in mineral waters where magnesium ion is soluble
although magnesium is found in over 60 minerals only dolomite magnesite brucite carnallite talc and olivine are of commercial importance
the mg2+ cation is the second-most-abundant cation in seawater (occurring at about 12% of the mass of sodium there) which makes seawater and sea-salt an attractive commercial source of mg to extract the magnesium calcium hydroxide is added to seawater to form magnesium hydroxide precipitate

=== alloyedit ===
as of 2013 magnesium alloy consumption was less than one million tons per year compared with 50 million tons of aluminum alloys its use has been historically limited by its tendency to corrode high-temperature creep and flammability
==== corrosionedit ====
the presence of iron nickel copper and cobalt strongly activates corrosion this is due to their low solid solubility limits (above a very small percentage they precipitate out as intermetallic compounds) and because they behave as active cathodic sites that reduce water and cause the loss of magnesium reducing the quantity of these metals improves corrosion resistance sufficient manganese overcomes the corrosive effects of iron this requires precise control over composition increasing costs adding a cathodic poison captures atomic hydrogen within the structure of a metal this prevents the formation of free hydrogen gas which is required for corrosive chemical processes the addition of about one-third of a percent of arsenic reduces its corrosion rate in a salt solution by a factor of nearly ten
==== high-temperature creep and flammabilityedit ====
research and development eliminated magnesium's tendency toward high-temperature creep by inclusion of scandium and gadolinium flammability was greatly reduced by introducing a small amount of calcium into the mix
=== compoundsedit ===
magnesium forms a variety of industrially and biologically important compounds including magnesium carbonate magnesium chloride magnesium citrate magnesium hydroxide (milk of magnesia) magnesium oxide magnesium sulfate and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (epsom salts)
=== isotopesedit ===
magnesium has three stable isotopes 24mg 25mg and 26mg all are present in significant amounts (see table of isotopes above) about 79% of mg is 24mg the isotope 28mg is radioactive and in the 1950s to 1970s was made commercially by several nuclear power plants for use in scientific experiments this isotope has a relatively short half-life (21 hours) and so its use was limited by shipping times
26mg has found application in isotopic geology similar to that of aluminium 26mg is a radiogenic daughter product of 26al which has a half-life of 717,000 years large enrichments of stable 26mg have been observed in the ca-al-rich inclusions of some carbonaceous chondrite meteorites the anomalous abundance of 26mg is attributed to the decay of its parent 26al in the inclusions therefore the meteorite must have formed in the solar nebula before the 26al had decayed hence these fragments are among the oldest objects in the solar system and have preserved information about its early history
it is conventional to plot 26mg/24mg against an al/mg ratio in an isochron dating plot the al/mg ratio plotted is27al/24mg the slope of the isochron has no age significance but indicates the initial 26al/27al ratio in the sample at the time when the systems were separated from a common reservoir
== productionedit ==
china is the dominant supplier of magnesium with approximately 80% of the world market share china is almost completely reliant on the silicothermic pidgeon process (the reduction of the oxide at high temperatures with silicon often provided by a ferrosilicon alloy in which the iron is but a spectator in the reactions) to obtain the metal the process can also be carried out with carbon at approx 2300 c

the united states has traditionally been the major world supplier of this metal supplying 45% of world production even as recently as 1995 today the us market share is at 7% with a single domestic producer left us magnesium a renco group company in utah born from now-defunct magcorp
== historyedit ==
the name magnesium originates from the greek word for a district in thessaly called magnesia it is related to magnetite and manganese which also originated from this area and required differentiation as separate substances see manganese for this history
in 1618 a farmer at epsom in england attempted to give his cows water from a well there the cows refused to drink because of the water's bitter taste but the farmer noticed that the water seemed to heal scratches and rashes the substance became known as epsom salts and its fame spread it was eventually recognized as hydrated magnesium sulfate mgso

=== dietary sources recommended intake and supplementationedit ===
spices nuts cereals cocoa and vegetables are rich sources of magnesium green leafy vegetables such as spinach are also rich in magnesium since they contain chlorophyll
the uk recommended daily values for magnesium is 300 mg for men and 270 mg for women observations of reduced dietary magnesium intake in modern western countries compared to earlier generations may be related to food refining and modern fertilizers that contain no magnesium
numerous pharmaceutical preparations of magnesium as well as magnesium dietary supplements are available magnesium oxide one of the most common forms in magnesium dietary supplements because it has high magnesium content per weight is the least bioavailable
=== metabolismedit ===
an adult has 2226 grams of magnesium with 60% in the skeleton 39% intracellular (20% in skeletal muscle) and 1% extracellular serum levels are typically 0.71.0 mmol/l or 1.82.4 meq/l serum magnesium levels may be normal even when intracellular magnesium is deficient the mechanisms for maintaining the magnesium level in the serum are varying gastrointestinal absorption and renal excretion intracellular magnesium is correlated with intracellular potassium increased magnesium lowers calcium and can either prevent hypercalcemia or cause hypocalcemia depending on the initial level low and high protein intake inhibit magnesium absorption as does the amount of phosphate phytate and fat in the gut excess dietary magnesium is excreted in feces urine and sweat magnesium status may be assessed via serum and erythrocyte magnesium concentrations coupled with urinary and fecal magnesium content but intravenous magnesium loading tests are more accurate and practical a retention of 20% or more of the injected amount indicates deficiency no biomarker has been established for magnesium
=== detection in serum and plasmaedit ===
magnesium concentrations in plasma or serum may be measured to monitor for efficacy and safety in those receiving the drug therapeutically to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage the newborn children of mothers having received parenteral magnesium sulfate during labor may exhibit toxicity with normal serum magnesium levels
=== deficiencyedit ===
magnesium deficiency (hypomagnesemia) is common it is found in 2.515% of the general population the primary cause of deficiency is decreased dietary intake only 32% of people in the united states meet the recommended daily allowance other causes are increased renal or gastrointestinal loss an increased intracellular shift and proton-pump inhibitor antacid therapy most are asymptomatic but symptoms referable to neuromuscular cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction may occur alcoholism is often associated with magnesium deficiency chronically low serum magnesium levels are associated with metabolic syndrome diabetes mellitus type 2 fasciculation and hypertension
