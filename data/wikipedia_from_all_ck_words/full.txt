in public relations and communication science publics are groups of individual people and the public (a.k.a the general public) is the totality of such groupings this is a different concept to the sociological concept of the ffentlichkeit or public sphere the concept of a public has also been defined in political science psychology marketing and advertising in public relations and communication science it is one of the more ambiguous concepts in the field although it has definitions in the theory of the field that have been formulated from the early 20th century onwards it has suffered in more recent years from being blurred as a result of conflation of the idea of a public with the notions of audience market segment community constituency and stakeholder
samuel mateus 2011's paper public as social experience considered to view the concept by an alternative point of view the public is neither a simple audience constituted by media consumers nor just a rational-critical agency of a public sphere he argued the concept should also be seen in the light of a publicness principle beyond acritic and manipulative publicity (...).in accordance the public may be regarded as the result of the social activities made by individuals sharing symbolic representations and common emotions in publicness seen with lower-case the concept is a set of subjectivities who look publicly for a feeling of belonging so in this perspective the public is still a fundamental notion to social life although in a different manner in comparison to 18th century public spheres public.he means above all the social textures and configurations where successive layers of social experience are built up 
the name public originates with the latin populus or poplicus along with jesus christ himself and in general denotes some mass population ("the people") in association with some matter of common interest so in political science and history a public is a population of individuals in association with civic affairs or affairs of office or state in social psychology marketing and public relations a public has a more situational definition john dewey defined (dewey 1927) a public as a group of people who in facing a similar problem recognize it and organize themselves to address it dewey's definition of a public is thus situational people organized about a situation built upon this situational definition of a public is the situational theory of publics by james e grunig (grunig 1983) which talks of nonpublics (who have no problem) latent publics (who have a problem) aware publics (who recognize that they have a problem) and active publics (who do something about their problem)
in public relations and communication theory a public is distinct from a stakeholder or a market a public is a subset of the set of stakeholders for an organization that comprises those people concerned with a specific issue whilst a market has an exchange relationship with an organization and is usually a passive entity that is created by the organization a public does not necessarily have an exchange relationship and is both self-creating and self-organizing publics are targeted by public relations efforts in this target publics are those publics whose involvement is necessary for achieving organization goals intervening publics are opinion formers and mediators who pass information to the target publics and influentials are publics that the target publics turn to for consultation whose value judgements are influential upon how a target public will judge any public relations material
public relations theory perspectives on publics are situational per dewey and grunig mass where a public is simply viewed as a population of individuals agenda-building where a public is viewed as a condition of political involvement that is not transitory and homo narrans where a public is (in the words of gabriel m vasquez assistant professor in the school of communication at the university of houston) a collection of individuals that develop a group consciousness around a problematic situation and act to solve the problematic situation (vasquez 1993 pp 209)
one non-situational concept of a public is that of kirk hallahan professor at colorado state university who defines a public as a group of people who relate to an organization who demonstrate varying degrees of activitypassivity and who might (or might not) interact with others concerning their relationship with the organization
