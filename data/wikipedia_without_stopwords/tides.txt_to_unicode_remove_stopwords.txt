characteristics
tide changes proceed via following stages
sea level rises several hours covering intertidal zone flood tide
water rises highest level reaching high tide
sea level falls several hours revealing intertidal zone ebb tide
water stops falling reaching low tide
tides produce oscillating currents known tidal streams moment tidal current ceases called slack water slack tide tide reverses direction said turning slack water usually occurs near high water low water locations moments slack tide differ significantly high low water
tides commonly semidiurnal two high waters two low waters day diurnal one tidal cycle per day two high waters given day typically height daily inequality higher high water lower high water tide tables similarly two low waters day higher low water lower low water daily inequality consistent generally small moon equator
