adenine /dnn/ (a ade) is a nucleobase (a purine derivative) its derivatives have a variety of roles in biochemistry including cellular respiration in the form of both the energy-rich adenosine triphosphate (atp) and the cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad) it also has functions in protein synthesis and as a chemical component of dna and rna the shape of adenine is complementary to either thymine in dna or uracil in rna
the image right shows pure adenine as an independent molecule when connected into dna a covalent bond is formed between deoxyribose sugar and the bottom left nitrogen so removing the hydrogen the remaining structure is called an adenine residue as part of a larger molecule adenosine is adenine reacted with ribose as used in rna and atp deoxyadenosine adenine attached to deoxyribose as is used to form dna
== structure ==
adenine forms several tautomers compounds that can be rapidly interconverted and are often considered equivalent however in isolated conditions i.e in an inert gas matrix and in the gas phase mainly the 9h-adenine tautomer is found
== biosynthesis ==
purine metabolism involves the formation of adenine and guanine both adenine and guanine are derived from the nucleotide inosine monophosphate (imp) which in turn is synthesized from a pre-existing ribose phosphate through a complex pathway using atoms from the amino acids glycine glutamine and aspartic acid as well as the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate
== function ==
adenine is one of the two purine nucleobases (the other being guanine) used in forming nucleotides of the nucleic acids in dna adenine binds to thymine via two hydrogen bonds to assist in stabilizing the nucleic acid structures in rna which is used for protein synthesis adenine binds to uracil
adenine forms adenosine a nucleoside when attached to ribose and deoxyadenosine when attached to deoxyribose it forms adenosine triphosphate (atp) a nucleoside triphosphate when three phosphate groups are added to adenosine adenosine triphosphate is used in cellular metabolism as one of the basic methods of transferring chemical energy between chemical reactions
== history ==
in older literature adenine was sometimes called vitamin b4 it is no longer considered a true vitamin or part of the vitamin b complex however two b vitamins niacin and riboflavin bind with adenine to form the essential cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad) respectively hermann emil fischer was one of the early scientists to study adenine
it was named in 1885 by albrecht kossel in reference to the pancreas (a specific gland - in greek aden") from which kossel's sample had been extracted
experiments performed in 1961 by joan or have shown that a large quantity of adenine can be synthesized from the polymerization of ammonia with five hydrogen cyanide (hcn) molecules in aqueous solution whether this has implications for the origin of life on earth is under debate
on august 8 2011 a report based on nasa studies with meteorites found on earth was published suggesting building blocks of dna and rna (adenine guanine and related organic molecules) may have been formed extraterrestrially in outer space in 2011 physicists reported that adenine has an unexpectedly variable range of ionization energies along its reaction pathways which suggested that understanding experimental data on how adenine survives exposure to uv light is much more complicated than previously thought these findings have implications for spectroscopic measurements of heterocyclic compounds according to one report
