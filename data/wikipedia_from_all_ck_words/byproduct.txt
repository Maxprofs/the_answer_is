a by-product is a secondary product derived from a manufacturing process or chemical reaction it is not the primary product or service being produced in the context of production a by-product can be defined as the output from a joint production process that is minor in quantity and/or net realizable value (nvr) when compared to the main products because they are deemed to have no influence on reported financial results by-products do not receive allocations of joint costs by-products also by convention are not inventoried but the nrv from by-products is typically recognized as other income or as a reduction of joint production processing costs when the by-product is produced a by-product can be useful and marketable or it can be considered waste
iea offers the following definition for the purpose of life-cycle assessment
 main products co-products (which involve similar revenues to the main product) by-products (which result in smaller revenues) and waste products (which provide little or no revenue)
