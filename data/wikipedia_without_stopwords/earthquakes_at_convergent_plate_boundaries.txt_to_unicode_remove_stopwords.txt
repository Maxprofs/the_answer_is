two continental plates collide plates either buckle compress cases one plate delves called subduction either action create extensive mountain ranges dramatic effect seen northern margin indian plate thrust portion eurasian plate lifting creating himalayas tibetan plateau beyond may also pushed nearby parts asian continent aside east

plates may collide oblique angle rather headon eg one plate moving north moving southeast may cause strikeslip faulting along collision zone addition subduction compression
plate boundaries easily defined broad belts whose movements unclear scientists one example would mediterraneanalpine boundary involves two major plates african eurasian several micro plates boundaries plates necessarily coincide continents instance north american plate covers north america also far northeastern siberia plus substantial portion atlantic ocean
