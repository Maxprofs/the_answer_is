quantum numbers describe values conserved quantities dynamics quantum system case quantum numbers electrons defined sets numerical values give acceptable solutions schrdinger wave equation hydrogen atom perhaps important aspect quantum mechanics quantization observable quantities since quantum numbers discrete sets integers halfintegers although could approach infinity cases distinguished classical mechanics values range continuously quantum numbers often describe specifically energy levels electrons atoms possibilities include angular momentum spin etc quantum system one quantum numbers thus difficult list possible quantum numbers
many quantum numbersedit
question many quantum numbers needed describe given system universal answer hence system one must find answer full analysis system quantized system requires least one quantum number dynamics quantum system described quantum hamiltonian h one quantum number system corresponding energy ie eigenvalue hamiltonian also one quantum number operator o commutes hamiltonian quantum numbers system note operators o defining quantum numbers independent often one way choose set independent operators consequently different situations different sets quantum numbers may used description system

traditional nomenclaturesedit
many different models proposed throughout history quantum mechanics prominent system nomenclature spawned hundmulliken molecular orbital theory friedrich hund robert mulliken contributions schrdinger slater john lennardjones system nomenclature incorporated bohr energy levels hundmulliken orbital theory observations electron spin based spectroscopy hunds rules
model describes electrons using four quantum numbers n m ms given also common nomenclature classical description nuclear particle states eg protons neutrons molecular orbitals require different quantum numbers hamiltonian symmetries quite different
note universal fixed value m ms values rather m ms values random requirement naming schematic used within particular set calculations descriptions must consistent eg orbital occupied first electron p orbital could described m m m m value electron orbital must different yet m assigned electrons orbitals m m m
rules summarized follows
example quantum numbers used refer outermost valence electrons carbon c atom located p atomic orbital n nd electron shell p orbital subshell m ms parallel spins
results spectroscopy indicated two electrons occupy single orbital however two electrons never exact quantum state set quantum numbers according hunds rules addresses pauli exclusion principle fourth quantum number two possible values added ad hoc assumption resolve conflict supposition could later explained detail relativistic quantum mechanics results renowned sterngerlach experiment
total angular momenta numbersedit
total momentum particleedit
one takes spinorbit interaction consideration l operators longer commute hamiltonian eigenvalues therefore change time thus another set quantum numbers used set includes
example consider following eight states defined quantum numbers
quantum states system described linear combination eight states however presence spinorbit interaction one wants describe system eight states eigenvectors hamiltonian ie represents state mix others time consider following eight states
nuclear angular momentum quantum numbersedit

elementary particlesedit
elementary particles contain many quantum numbers usually said intrinsic however understood elementary particles quantum states standard model particle physics hence quantum numbers particles bear relation hamiltonian model quantum numbers bohr atom hamiltonian words quantum number denotes symmetry problem useful quantum field theory distinguish spacetime internal symmetries
typical quantum numbers related spacetime symmetries spin related rotational symmetry parity cparity tparity related poincar symmetry spacetime typical internal symmetries lepton number baryon number electric charge full list quantum numbers kind see article flavour
minor often confusing point follows conserved quantum numbers additive elementary particle reaction sum quantum numbers reaction however usually called parity multiplicative ie product conserved multiplicative quantum numbers belong symmetry like parity applying symmetry transformation twice equivalent nothing involution examples abstract group called z
