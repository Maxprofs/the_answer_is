the circumference (from latin circumferentia meaning carrying around") of a closed curve or circular object is the linear distance around its edge the circumference of a circle is of special importance in geometry and trigonometry informally circumference may also refer to the edge itself rather than to the length of the edge circumference is a special case of perimeter the perimeter is the length around any closed figure but conventionally perimeter is typically used in reference to a polygon while circumference typically refers to a continuously differentiable curve
== circumference of a circle ==
the circumference of a circle is the distance around it the term is used when measuring physical objects as well as when considering abstract geometric forms
=== relationship with pi ===
the circumference of a circle relates to one of the most important mathematical constants in all of mathematics this constant pi is represented by the greek letter  the numerical value of is 3.14159 26535 89793  (see a000796) pi is defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference c to its diameter d
or equivalently as the ratio of the circumference to twice the radius the above formula can be rearranged to solve for the circumference
the use of the mathematical constant is ubiquitous in mathematics engineering and science the constant ratio of circumference to radius also has many uses in mathematics engineering and science these uses include but are not limited to radians computer programming and physical constants the greek letter (tau) is sometimes used to represent this constant but is not generally accepted as proper notation
== circumference of an ellipse ==
the circumference of an ellipse can be expressed in terms of the complete elliptic integral of the second kind
== circumference of a graph ==
in graph theory the circumference of a graph refers to the longest cycle contained in that graph
