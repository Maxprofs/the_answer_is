evolution birds thought begun jurassic period earliest birds derived clade theropoda dinosaurs named paraves birds categorized biological class aves earliest known archaeopteryx lithographica late jurassic period though archaeopteryx commonly considered true bird modern phylogenies place birds dinosaur clade theropoda according current consensus aves sister group order crocodilia together sole living members unranked reptile clade archosauria
phylogenetically aves usually defined descendants recent common ancestor specific modern bird species house sparrow passer domesticus either archaeopteryx prehistoric species closer neornithes avoid problems caused unclear relationships archaeopteryx theropods latter classification used larger group termed avialae currently relationship dinosaurs archaeopteryx modern birds still debate
origins
significant evidence birds emerged within theropod dinosaurs specifically birds members maniraptora group theropods includes dromaeosaurs oviraptorids among others nonavian theropods closely related birds discovered formerly clear distinction nonbirds birds becomes less noted already th century thomas huxley writing
stretch definition class birds include birds teeth birds pawlike fore limbs long tails evidence compsognathus possessed feathers would hard indeed say whether called reptilian bird avian reptile
discoveries northeast china liaoning province demonstrate many small theropod dinosaurs indeed feathers among compsognathid sinosauropteryx microraptorian dromaeosaurid sinornithosaurus contributed ambiguity draw line birds reptiles cryptovolans dromaeosaurid found may junior synonym microraptor capable powered flight possessed sternal keel ribs uncinate processes cryptovolans seems make better bird archaeopteryx lacks modern bird features paleontologists suggested dromaeosaurs actually basal birds whose larger members secondarily flightless ie dromaeosaurs evolved birds way around evidence theory currently inconclusive digs continue unearth fossils especially china feathered dromaeosaurs rate fairly certain flight utilizing feathered wings existed midjurassic theropods cretaceous unenlagiine rahonavis also possesses features suggesting least partially capable powered flight
although ornithischian birdhipped dinosaurs share hip structure birds birds actually originated saurischian lizardhipped dinosaurs dinosaurian origin theory correct thus arrived hip structure condition independently fact birdlike hip structure also developed third time among peculiar group theropods therizinosauridae
alternate theory dinosaurian origin birds espoused scientists notably larry martin alan feduccia states birds including maniraptoran dinosaurs evolved early archosaurs like longisquama theory contested paleontologists experts feather development evolution
mesozoic birds
basal bird archaeopteryx jurassic well known one first missing links found support evolution late th century though considered direct ancestor modern birds gives fair representation flight evolved first bird might looked may predated protoavis texensis though fragmentary nature fossil leaves open considerable doubt whether bird ancestor skeleton early bird candidates basically small theropod dinosaur long clawed hands though exquisite preservation solnhofen plattenkalk shows archaeopteryx covered feathers wings archaeopteryx relatives may good fliers would least competent gliders setting stage evolution life wing
evolutionary trend among birds reduction anatomical elements save weight first element disappear bony tail reduced pygostyle tail function taken feathers confuciusornis example trend keeping clawed fingers perhaps climbing pygostyle tail though longer modern birds large group birds enantiornithes evolved ecological niches similar modern birds flourished throughout mesozoic though wings resembled many modern bird groups retained clawed wings snout teeth rather beak forms loss long tail followed rapid evolution legs evolved become highly versatile adaptable tools opened new ecological niches
cretaceous saw rise modern birds rigid ribcage carina shoulders able allow powerful upstroke essential sustained powered flight another improvement appearance alula used achieve better control landing flight low speeds also derived pygostyle ploughshareshaped end early example yanornis many coastal birds strikingly resembling modern shorebirds like ichthyornis ducks like gansus evolved swimming hunters like hesperornithiformes group flightless divers resembling grebes loons modern respects birds retained typical reptilianlike teeth sharp claws manus
modern toothless birds evolved toothed forefathers cretaceous earlier primitive birds particularly enantiornithes continued thrive diversify alongside pterosaurs groups toothless neornithes cut short chicxulub impact surviving lineages birds comparatively primitive paleognathae ostrich allies aquatic duck lineage terrestrial fowl highly volant neoaves
adaptive radiation modern birds
modern birds classified neornithes known evolved basic lineages end cretaceous see vegavis neornithes split paleognaths neognaths
paleognaths include tinamous found central south america ratites nowadays found almost exclusively southern hemisphere ratites large flightless birds include ostriches rheas cassowaries kiwis emus scientists propose ratites represent artificial grouping birds independently lost ability fly number unrelated lineages case available data regarding evolution still confusing partly uncontroversial fossils mesozoic
basal divergence remaining neognathes galloanserae superorder containing anseriformes ducks geese swans galliformes chickens turkeys pheasants allies presence basal anseriform fossils mesozoic likely galliform fossils implies presence paleognaths time spite absence fossil evidence
dates splits matter considerable debate amongst scientists agreed neornithes evolved cretaceous split galloanserae neognaths neoaves occurred cretaceouspaleogene extinction event different opinions whether radiation remaining neognaths occurred extinction dinosaurs disagreement part caused divergence evidence molecular dating suggesting cretaceous radiation small equivocal neoavian fossil record cretaceous living families turning paleogene attempts made reconcile molecular fossil evidence proved controversial
hand two factors must considered first molecular clocks cannot considered reliable absence robust fossil calibration whereas fossil record naturally incomplete second reconstructed phylogenetic trees time pattern lineage separation corresponds evolution characters dna sequences morphological traits etc studied actual evolutionary pattern lineages ideally differ much may well practice
considering easy see fossil data compared molecular data tends accurate general also underestimate divergence times morphological traits product entire developmental genetics networks usually start diverge time lineage split would become apparent dna sequence comparison especially sequences used contain many silent mutations
classification modern species
phylogenetic classification birds contentious issue sibley ahlquists phylogeny classification birds landmark work classification birds although frequently debated constantly revised preponderance evidence suggests modern bird orders constitute good clades however scientists agreement precise relationships main clades evidence modern bird anatomy fossils dna brought bear problem strong consensus emerged mids new fossil molecular data provide increasingly clear picture evolution modern bird orders relationships example charadriiformes seem constitute ancient distinct lineage mirandornithes cypselomorphae supported wealth anatomical molecular evidence understanding interrelationships lower level taxa also continues increase particularly massively diverse perching bird group passeriformes
bird classification phylogenetic analysis still debate requires research study published science examined dna sequences species birds represented major extant groups findings may necessitate wholesale restructuring avian phylogenetic tree findings also supported unestablished relationships orders confirmed disputes particular groupings
current evolutionary trends birds
evolution generally occurs scale far slow witnessed humans however bird species currently going extinct far greater rate possible speciation generation new species disappearance population subspecies species represents permanent loss range genes
another concern evolutionary implications suspected increase hybridization may arise human alteration habitats enabling related allopatric species overlap forest fragmentation create extensive open areas connecting previously isolated patches open habitat populations isolated sufficient time diverge significantly sufficient incapable producing fertile offspring may interbreeding broadly integrity original species may compromised example many hybrid hummingbirds found northwest south america may represent threat conservation distinct species involved
several species birds bred captivity create variations wild species birds limited color variations others bred larger egg meat production flightlessness characteristics
