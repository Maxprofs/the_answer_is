== behaviour ==
chinese gorals live in small groups of up to 12 individuals though older males are usually solitary they are wary and retiring spending their time on high rocky slopes where they can evade such predators as the wolf and leopard they move to lower ground in winter they browse predominately on twigs and leaves of bushes but also consume grass nuts and acorns breeding takes place in late spring when one or two kids are born after a gestation period of about 215 days the young can walk soon after birth and are weaned in the autumn remaining with the mother throughout the winter
== status ==
the chief threat faced by the chinese goral is hunting animals are killed for their meat and fur and also for medicine part of their range is in protected areas where they should be safe but elsewhere populations are declining this is thought to be due to overhunting and the international union for conservation of nature has assessed the chinese goral as being a vulnerable species
