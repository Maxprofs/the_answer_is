phanerozoic fnrzok british english phanrozoic current geologic eon geologic time scale one abundant animal plant life existed covers million years present goes back period diverse hardshelled animals first appeared name derives ancient greek words faners zo meaning visible life since believed life began cambrian first period eon time phanerozoic called precambrian supereon divided hadean archaean proterozoic eons plant life also appeared early phanerozoic eon
time span phanerozoic includes rapid emergence number animal phyla evolution phyla diverse forms emergence development complex plants evolution fish emergence insects tetrapods development modern faunas time span tectonic forces caused continents move eventually collect single landmass known pangaea separated current continental landmasses
proterozoicphanerozoic boundary
proterozoicphanerozoic boundary million years ago th century boundary set time appearance first abundant animal metazoan fossils several hundred groups taxa metazoa earlier proterozoic era identified since systematic study forms started geologists paleontologists would probably set proterozoicphanerozoic boundary either classic point first trilobites reef building animals archaeocyatha corals others appear first appearance complex feeding burrow called treptichnus pedum first appearance group small generally disarticulated armored forms termed small shelly fauna three different dividing points within million years
older literature term phanerozoic generally used label time period interest paleontologists use term seems falling disuse modern literature
eras phanerozoic
phanerozoic divided three eras paleozoic mesozoic cenozoic consisting periods cambrian ordovician silurian devonian carboniferous permian triassic jurassic cretaceous paleogene neogene quaternary paleozoic features rise fish amphibians reptiles mesozoic ruled reptiles features evolution mammals birds famously dinosaurs cenozoic time mammals recently humans
paleozoic era
paleozoic time earths history complex life forms evolve take first breath oxygen dry land forerunners life earth begin diversify six periods paleozoic era cambrian ordovician silurian devonian carboniferous permian
cambrian
cambrian spans million years million years ago first period paleozoic phanerozoic eon cambrian sparks boom evolution event known cambrian explosion largest number creatures evolve history earth one period plants like algae evolve fauna dominated armored arthropods like trilobites almost marine phyla evolved period time supercontinent pannotia begins break becomes supercontinent gondwana
ordovician
ordovician spans million years million years ago ordovician time earths history many species still prevalent today evolved primitive fish cephalopods coral common forms life however trilobites snails shellfish importantly first arthropods went ashore colonize empty continent gondwana end period gondwana south pole early north america collided europe closing atlantic ocean glaciation africa resulted major drop sea level killing life staked claim along coastal gondwana glaciation caused snowball earth leading ordoviciansilurian extinction marine invertebrates families went extinct considered first mass extinction second deadliest extinction history earth
silurian
silurian spans million years million years ago silurian saw healing earth recovered snowball earth period saw mass evolution fish jawless fish became numerous jawed fish evolved first freshwater fish evolved though arthropods sea scorpions still apex predators fully terrestrial life evolved included early arachnids fungi centipedes also evolution vascular plants cooksonia allowed plants gain foothold land early terrestrial plants forerunners plant life land time four continents gondwana africa south america australia antarctica india laurentia north america parts europe baltica rest europe siberia northern asia recent rise sea levels provided many new species thrive water
devonian
devonian spans million years million years ago also known age fish devonian features huge diversification fish including armored fish like dunkleosteus lobefinned fish eventually evolved first tetrapods land plant groups diversified incredibly event known devonian explosion first trees evolved well seeds event also diversified arthropod life first amphibians also evolved fish top food chain near end devonian species went extinct event known late devonian extinction second mass extinction known happened
carboniferous
carboniferous spans million million years ago time average global temperatures exceedingly high early carboniferous averaged degrees celsius cooled degrees middle carboniferous tropical swamps dominated earth large amounts trees created much carbon coal used today hence name carboniferous perhaps important evolutionary development time evolution amniotic eggs allowed amphibians head farther inland remain dominant vertebrae throughout period also first reptiles synapsids evolved swamps throughout carboniferous cooling pattern eventually led glaciation gondwana much situated around south pole event known permocarboniferous glaciation carboniferous rainforest collapse
permian
permian spans million million years ago last period paleozoic beginning continents clamped together form supercontinent pangaea surrounded one ocean called panthalassa earth dry time harsh seasons climate interior pangaea wasnt regulated large bodies water reptiles synapsids flourished new dry climate creatures dimetrodon edaphosaurus ruled new continent first conifers evolved dominated terrestrial landscape nearing end period scutosaurus gorgonopsids filled empty desert eventually disappeared along life earth event simply known great dying worlds third mass extinction event
mesozoic era
also known age dinosaurs mesozoic features rise reptiles million year conquest rule earth seas land even air periods mesozoic triassic jurassic cretaceous
triassic
triassic ranges million million years ago triassic desolate transitional state earths history permian extinction lush jurassic period three major epochs early triassic middle triassic late triassic
early triassic lasted million million years ago dominated deserts pangaea yet broken thus interior nothing arid earth witnessed massive dieoff life went extinct common life earth lystrosaurus labyrinthodonts euparkeria along many creatures managed survive great dying temnospondyli evolved time would dominant predator much triassic
middle triassic spans million million years ago middle triassic featured beginnings breakup pangaea beginning tethys sea ecosystem recovered devastation great dying phytoplankton coral crustaceans recovered reptiles began get bigger bigger new aquatic reptiles evolved ichthyosaurs nothosaurs meanwhile land pine forests flourished bringing along mosquitoes fruit flies first ancient crocodilians evolved sparked competition large amphibians since rule freshwater world
late triassic spans million million years ago following bloom middle triassic late triassic featured frequent heat spells well moderate precipitation inches per year recent warming led boom reptilian evolution land first true dinosaurs evolve well pterosaurs climactic change however resulted large dieout known triassicjurassic extinction event archosaurs excluding ancient crocodiles synapsids almost large amphibians went extinct well marine life fourth mass extinction event world cause debatable
jurassic
jurassic ranges million years million years ago features major epochs early jurassic middle jurassic late jurassic
early jurassic spans million years million years ago climate much humid triassic result world tropical oceans plesiosaurs ichthyosaurs ammonites filled waters dominant creatures seas land dinosaurs reptiles staked claim dominant race land species dilophosaurus top first true crocodiles evolved pushing large amphibians near extinction allinall reptiles rise rule world meanwhile first true mammals evolve never exceed height shrew
middle jurassic spans million million years ago epoch reptiles flourished huge herds sauropods brachiosaurus diplodicus filled fern prairies middle jurassic many predators rose well allosaurus conifer forests made large portion forests oceans plesiosaurs quite common ichthyosaurs flourishing epoch peak reptiles
late jurassic spans million million years ago late jurassic featured massive extinction sauropods ichthyosaurs due separation pangaea laurasia gondwana extinction known jurassiccretaceous extinction sea levels rose destroying fern prairies creating shallows wake ichthyosaurs went extinct whereas sauropods whole die jurassic fact species like titanosaurus lived kt extinction increase sealevels opened atlantic sea way would continue get larger time divided world would give opportunity diversification new dinosaurs
cretaceous
cretaceous longest period mesozoic two periods early cretaceous late cretaceous
early cretaceous spans million million years ago early cretaceous saw expansion seaways result decline extinction sauropods except south america many coastal shallows created caused ichthyosaurs die mosasaurs evolved replace head seas islandhopping dinosaurs like eustreptospondylus evolved cope coastal shallows small islands ancient europe dinosaurs rose fill empty space jurassiccretaceous extinction left behind carcharodontosaurus spinosaurus successful would iguanodon spread every continent seasons came back effect poles got seasonally colder dinosaurs still inhabited area like leaellynasaura inhabited polar forests yearround many dinosaurs migrated summer like muttaburrasaurus since cold crocodiles last stronghold large amphibians like koolasuchus pterosaurs got larger species like tapejara ornithocheirus evolved importantly first true birds evolved sparked competition pterosaurs
late cretaceous spans million million years ago late cretaceous featured cooling trend would continue cenozoic period eventually tropics restricted equator areas beyond tropic lines featured extreme seasonal changes weather dinosaurs still thrived new species tyrannosaurus ankylosaurus triceratops hadrosaurs dominated food web pterosaurs however going decline birds took skies last pterosaur die quetzalcoatlus marsupials evolved within large conifer forests scavengers oceans mosasaurs ruled seas fill role ichthyosaurs huge plesiosaurs elasmosaurus evolved also first flowering plants evolved end cretaceous deccan traps volcanic eruptions poisoning atmosphere continuing thought large meteor smashed earth creating chicxulub crater event known kt extinction fifth recent mass extinction event life earth went extinct including nonavian dinosaurs everything kilograms went extinct age dinosaurs officially
cenozoic era
cenozoic features rise mammals conquest rule land dinosaurs left huge opening top dog three division cenozoic paleogene neogene quaternary
paleogene
paleogene spans extinction dinosaurs million years ago dawn neogene twenty three million years ago features three epochs paleocene eocene oligocene
paleocene ranged million million years ago paleocene transitional point devastation kt extinction rich jungles environment early eocene early paleocene saw recovery earth continents began take modern shape continents india separated afroeurasia separated tethys sea americas separated strait panama isthmus yet formed epoch features general warming trend jungles eventually reaching poles oceans dominated sharks large reptiles ruled went extinct archaic mammals filled world creodonts early primates evolved mesozoic result nothing kilograms mammals still quite small
eocene epoch ranged million years million years ago early eocene life small living cramped jungles much like paleocene nothing weight kilograms among early primates whales horses along many early forms mammals top food chains huge birds gastornis time recorded history birds ruled world excluding ancestors dinosaurs temperature degrees celsius little temperature gradient pole pole mid eocene circumantarctic current australia antarctica formed disrupted ocean currents worldwide result caused global cooling effect shrinking jungles allowed mammals grow mammoth proportions whales almost fully aquatic mammals like andrewsarchus top foodchain sharks replaced whales basilosaurus rulers seas late eocene saw rebirth seasons caused expansion savannalike areas along evolution grass
oligocene epoch spans million million years ago oligocene feature expansion grass led many new species evolve including first elephants cats dogs marsupials many species still prevalent today many species plants evolved period evergreen trees cooling period still effect seasonal rains well mammals still continued grow larger larger paraceratherium largest land mammal ever live evolved period along many perissodactyls event known grand coupre
neogene
neogene spans million million years ago shortest geological period phanerozoic features two epochs miocene pliocene
miocene spans million years ago period grass spreads across effectively dominating large portion world diminishing forests process kelp forests evolved leading new species sea otters evolve time perissodactyls thrived evolved many different varieties alongside apes evolved staggering species overall arid mountainous land dominated world grazers tethys sea finally closed creation arabian peninsula wake left black red mediterranean caspian seas increased aridity many new plants evolved modern seed plants evolved midmiocene
pliocene ranges million years ago pliocene features dramatic climactic changes ultimately leads modern species plants dramatic formation panama accumulation ice poles leading massive dieoff india asia collide forming himalayas rockies appalachian mountain ranges formed mediterranean sea dried next several million years along major geological events australopithecus evolves africa beginning human branch also isthmus panama animals migrate across north south america wreaking havoc local ecology climactic changes bring along savannas still continuing spread across world indian monsoons deserts east asia beginnings sahara desert earths continents seas move present shapes world map hasnt changed much since
quaternary
quaternary ranges million present day features modern animals dramatic climate changes features two epochs pleistocene holocene
pleistocene lasted million years ago epoch features ice ages result cooling effect started mideocene ice progressively migrated towards equator areas north south tropic line featured intense winters yet mild summers meanwhile africa experienced terrible droughts resulted creation sahara namib kalahari deserts cope many animals evolved including mammoths giant ground sloths dire wolves famously homo sapiens years ago marked end one worst droughts africa expansion primitive man pleistocene draws close one largest dieouts causes many megafauna die including last hominid species excluding homo sapiens continents affected africa isnt hit quite hard
holocene ranges years ago present day also known age man holocene features rise humans path sentience recorded history history world lies within boundaries holocene epoch human activity however blamed dieout going since bce commonly referred sixth extinction estimated extinction rate species per year
