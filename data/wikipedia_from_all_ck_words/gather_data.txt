zond 4 part of the soviet zond program and an unmanned version of soyuz 7k-l1 manned moon-flyby spacecraft was one of the first soviet experiments towards manned circumlunar spaceflight it was launched to test the spaceworthiness of the new capsule and to gather data about flights in circumterrestrial space it was the first soviet spacecraft to possess a computer the 34 kg argon 11
the spacecraft was successfully launched into a 354,000 km apogee orbit 180 degrees away from the moon it was launched away from the moon probably to avoid trajectory complications with lunar gravity however on re-entry the l1's guidance system failed it hit the atmosphere precisely at the calculated time but was not guided to generate lift and fly out of the atmosphere again a ballistic re-entry would mean no recovery on soviet soil so the apo destruct system automatically blew up the capsule at 10 to 15 km altitude 180200 km off the african coast at guinea
