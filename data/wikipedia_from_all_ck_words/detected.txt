a single-family detached home also called a single-detached dwelling single-family residence (sfr) or separate house is a free-standing residential building it is defined in opposition to a multi-family residential dwelling
== definitionsedit ==
the definition of this type of house may vary between legal jurisdictions or statistical agencies the definition however generally includes two elements
a single-family (home house or dwelling) means that the building is usually occupied by just one household or family and consists of just one dwelling unit or suite in some jurisdictions allowances are made for basement suites or mother-in-law suites without changing the description from single family it does exclude however any short-term accommodation (hotel motels inns) large-scale rental accommodation (rooming or boarding houses apartments) or condominia
most single-family homes are built on lots larger than the structure itself adding an area surrounding the house which is commonly called a yard in north american english or a garden in british english garages can also be found on most lots houses with an attached front entry garage that is closer to the street than any other part of the house is often derisively called a snout house
=== regional terminologyedit ===
terms corresponding to single-family detached home in common use are single-family home (in the u.s and canada) single-detached dwelling (in canada) detached house (in the united kingdom and canada) and separate house (in new zealand)
in the united kingdom the term single-family home is almost unknown except through internet exposure to u.s media whereas in the u.s. housing is commonly divided into single-family homes multi-family dwellings condo/townhouse etc. the primary division of residential property in british terminology is between houses (including detached semi-detached and terraced houses and bungalows) and flats (i.e. apartments or condominia in american english)
== history and distributionedit ==
in pre-industrial societies most people live in multi-family dwelling for most of their lives a child will live with their parents from birth until marriage and then generally move in with the parents of the man (patrilocal) or the woman (matrilocal) so that the grandparents can help raise the young children and so the middle generation can care for their aging parents this type of arrangement also saves on the effort and materials used for construction and in colder climates heating if people had to move to a new place or were wealthy enough they could build or buy a home for their own family of course but this was not the norm
the idea of a nuclear family living separately from their relatives as the norm is a relatively recent development related to rising living standards in north america and europe during the early modern and modern eras in the new world where land was plentiful settlement patterns were quite different from the close-knit villages of europe meaning many more people lived in large farms separated from their neighbours this has produced a cultural preference in settler societies for privacy and space a countervailing trend has been industrialization and urbanization which as seen more and more people around the world move into multi-story apartment blocks in the new world this type of densification was halted and reversed following the second world war when increased automobile ownership and cheaper building and heating costs produced suburbanization instead
single-family homes are now common in rural and suburban and even some urban areas across the new world and europe as well as wealthier enclaves within the third world they are most common in low-density high-income regions for example in canada according to the 2006 census 55.3% of the population lived single-detached houses but this varied substantially by region in the ville (city) of montreal canada's second most populous municipality only 7.5% of the population lived in a single-detached house while in the city of calgary the third most populous 57.8% did note that this includes the city limits populations only not the wider region
the term single-family detached describes how a house is built and who lives in it it does not indicate size shape or location because they are not surrounded by other buildings the potential size of a single-family house is limited only by the budget of the builder and local law they can range from a tiny country cottage or cabin or a small suburban prefabricated home to a large mansion aristocratic estate or stately home sizes in real estate advertising are given in area (square feet or square metres) or by the number of bedrooms or bathrooms/toilets the choice in materials used or the shape chosen will depend on what is common to the vernacular architecture of that region or the lasted trends in professionally-designed tract housing a traditional log and plaster hut a timber frame and drywall north american starter home or a european-style concrete-and-slate house are all equally varieties of single-family detached housing
== pros and consedit ==
single-detached homes have both advantages and disadvantages
advantages are that the entire space around the building is private to the owner and family and in most cases (depending on national/federal state/provincial and local laws) one can add onto the existing house if more room is needed and they typically have no property management fees such as the ones associated with condominia and townhomes
disadvantages are that all maintenance and repair costs interior exterior and everything in between are at the owner's expense amenities such as pools and playgrounds are usually absent unless built at private expense or if a municipal playground is available some single-detached homes do have these features within the lot or nearby given that their owners pay a homeowners fee similar to those in condos or townhomes landscaping and lawn upkeep costs are at the owner's expense
from an environmental point of view single-family houses are likely to require much more energy to heat in cold weather than do buildings with shared walls because of their very high surface-area-to-volume ratio in rich countries the people who live in single-family houses are much more likely to own and use a private automobile rather than walking biking or using public transit to commute the low density of housing leads to less frequent bus service and longer distances to commute thus leading to increased car use this makes single-family houses part of a much more energy and carbon-intensive lifestyle the low-density nature of this type of housing requires using more land which could otherwise be used for agriculture or as natural habitat
inner city neighborhoods of larger cities tend to be densely populated and without significant room for houses devoted to just a single family by contrast the outer districts of larger cities are usually transitional areas with equal shares of smaller apartment buildings and single-detached homes
culturally single-family houses are associated with suburbanization in many parts of the world owning a home with a yard and a white picket fence is seen as a key component of the american dream (which also exists with variations in other parts of the world) single-family homes can also be associated with gated communities particularly in developing countries (e.g alphaville so paulo)
