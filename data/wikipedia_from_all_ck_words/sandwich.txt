== historyedit ==
the modern concept of a sandwich using slices of bread (as found within the western world) can arguably be traced to 18th century europe however the use of some kind of bread or bread-like substance to lie under (or under and over) some other food or used to scoop up and enclose or wrap some other type of food long predates the 18th century and is found in numerous much older cultures worldwide
the ancient jewish sage hillel the elder is said to have wrapped meat from the paschal lamb and bitter herbs between two pieces of old-fashioned soft matzahflat unleavened breadduring passover in the manner of a modern wrap made with flatbread flat breads of only slightly varying kinds have long been used to scoop or wrap small amounts of food en route from platter to mouth throughout western asia and northern africa from morocco to ethiopia to india bread is baked in flat rounds contrasting with the european loaf tradition
during the middle ages in europe thick slabs of coarse and usually stale bread called trenchers were used as plates after a meal the food-soaked trencher was fed to a dog or to beggars at the tables of the wealthy and eaten by diners in more modest circumstances the immediate culinary precursor with a direct connection to the english sandwich was to be found in the netherlands of the 17th century where the naturalist john ray observed that in the taverns beef hung from the rafters which they cut into thin slices and eat with bread and butter laying the slices upon the butter explanatory specifications that reveal the dutch belegde broodje open-faced sandwich was as yet unfamiliar in england
initially perceived as food that men shared while gaming and drinking at night the sandwich slowly began appearing in polite society as a late-night meal among the aristocracy the sandwich's popularity in spain and england increased dramatically during the 19th century when the rise of industrial society and the working classes made fast portable and inexpensive meals essential
it was at the same time that the european-stye sandwich finally began to appear outside of europe in the united states the sandwich was first promoted as an elaborate meal at supper by the early 20th century as bread became a staple of the american diet the sandwich became the same kind of popular quick meal as was already widespread in the mediterranean
=== etymologyedit ===
the first written usage of the english word appeared in edward gibbon's journal in longhand referring to bits of cold meat as a sandwich it was named after john montagu 4th earl of sandwich an 18th-century english aristocrat it is said that he ordered his valet to bring him meat tucked between two pieces of bread and others began to order the same as sandwich! it is commonly said that lord sandwich was fond of this form of food because it allowed him to continue playing cards particularly cribbage while eating without using a fork and without getting his cards greasy from eating meat with his bare hands
the rumour in its familiar form appeared in pierre-jean grosley's londres (neichatel 1770) translated as a tour to london 1772 grosley's impressions had been formed during a year in london in 1765 the sober alternative is provided by sandwich's biographer n a m rodger who suggests sandwich's commitments to the navy and to politics and the arts mean the first sandwich was more likely to have been consumed at his desk
before being known as sandwiches this food combination seems to simply have been known as bread and meat or bread and cheese
== usageedit ==
in the united states a court in boston massachusetts ruled that sandwich includes at least two slices of bread and under this definition this court finds that the term sandwich is not commonly understood to include burritos tacos and quesadillas which are typically made with a single tortilla and stuffed with a choice filling of meat rice and beans. the issue stemmed from the question of whether a restaurant that sold burritos could move into a shopping centre where another restaurant had a no-compete clause in its lease prohibiting other sandwich shops
in spain where the word sandwich is borrowed from the english language it refers to a food item made with english sandwich bread it is otherwise known as a bocadillo
in the united kingdom and australia the term sandwich is more narrowly defined than in the us it refers only to an item which uses sliced bread from a loaf an item with similar fillings but using an entire bread roll cut horizontally in half is always referred to as a roll (in south australia there is a regional variant of the roll superficially similar to a club sandwich where the bread roll is sliced three times (parallel cuts) and filling is put in the first and third openings but not the second this makes the resulting double cut roll easier to handle the top half and the bottom half are eaten separately.) any hot item based on a bread roll is referred to as a burger never as a sandwich however hot sliced (not ground) beef between two slices of toasted bread is referred to as a steak sandwich - it is the sliced loaf bread that distinguishes the steak sandwich from a burger
the verb to sandwich has the meaning to position anything between two other things of a different character or to place different elements alternately and the noun sandwich has related meanings derived from this more general definition for example an ice cream sandwich consists of a layer of ice cream between two layers of cake or biscuit similarly oreos and custard creams are described as sandwich biscuits because they consist of a soft filling between layers of biscuit
the word butty (a reference to the fact that butter is often used in british sandwiches) is common in some northern parts of england as a slang synonym for sandwich particularly to refer to certain kinds of sandwiches including the chip butty bacon butty or sausage butty though some people make the distinction that a butty is made using a single buttered slice folded over rather than cut sarnie is a similar colloquialism as is the australian english colloquialism sanger likewise the words sanger and piece are used for sandwich in scottish dialect regarding the latter an example of the use of piece is piece and ham meaning piece of bread and ham
