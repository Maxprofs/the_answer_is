a full-size car is a marketing term used in north america for an automobile larger than a mid-size car traditional u.s full-size passenger cars were designed to be comfortable for six occupants and their luggage for long-distance driving the united states environmental protection agency (epa) currently uses the term large car to denote full-size cars based on their combined interior passenger and luggage volume
== definitionedit ==
the traditional full-size passenger cars that were built by the u.s automakers (general motors ford chrysler and american motors) up to the 1970s can carry six occupants plus vast amounts of luggage over long distances in great comfort with more than adequate performance and will give reasonable gas mileage under such conditions.
full-size cars were also denoted for their length nearing 4,953 mm (195 in) in basic low-priced family sedans the luxury models often tended to reach 5,350 mm (211 in) previously a wheelbase greater than 2,794 mm (110 in) was the criterion for full-size the term first appeared in the early 1960s to distinguish what also became known as standard"-size cars from the new compact and intermediate models then being introduced full-size is also defined in space measurement as greater than 3,300 l (120 ft) of combined passenger and cargo interior volume a majority of u.s manufactured full size automobiles (with the exception of the chrysler c platform and amc's ambassador) were constructed using a body-on-frame platform this platform was phased out in 2011 when the ford panther vehicles ended production
use of the term in north america became popular (and necessary) after the introduction of compacts by the u.s detroit big three for the 1960 model year and then a few years later the introduction of what became known as mid-size cars while length and wheelbase varied (increasing over time) being considered full-size required a width as close as practical to the 80 in (2,032 mm) width limit over which the federal government required vehicles to have clearance lights the term was most correctly applied to cars close to the width limit carrying nameplates of the low priced three chevrolet ford and plymouth
manufacturers hoped their slightly more expensive brands such as pontiac mercury and dodge would be perceived by the public as more desirable than a full-size car even in situations where they were not any larger however while the difference between a full-size car a basic large chevrolet ford or plymouth and a luxury car such as cadillac lincoln or imperial was clear both manufacturers and consumers had difficulty classifying those in between such as large pontiacs mercurys or dodges manufacturers contributed to the lack of distinction by marketing models of their premium brands into the lower price ranges with what had previously been considered medium-priced brands
for 1977 general motors downsized its full-size (and higher priced) cars with overall width cut from approximately 80 in (2,032 mm) to the mid-70 inch range chevrolet pontiac and the less expensive oldsmobile and buick models had a 116-inch wheelbase more expensive oldsmobile and buick models plus the cadillac had a 119 in (3,023 mm) wheelbase but no more width the cars sold less well than the 1976 models ford and chrysler downsized for 1979 the latter even building its chrysler r platform which was comparable in size to the new platforms designed by gm and ford by this time a huge increase in gasoline prices had made it difficult to sell any large cars downsized or not chrysler had the huge misfortune of introducing two consecutive new designs of its largest cars in 1974 and 1979 during times when gasoline prices suddenly increased
the epa interior and trunk volume categories for the most part resulted in mid-size full-size and luxury cars common in the mid-1970s all being classified as large cars the 1980s chrysler m platform classified as large cars at the time were derived from the dodge aspen and plymouth volare originally marketed as compacts
while many modern cars are referred to as full-size they do not qualify for the term as used in the 1960s and 1970s consumer acceptance of large suvs approaching 80 inches in width shows interest remains in vehicles capable of three-across seating with reasonable comfort a strong point of a true full-size car
police cars in the united states are almost always full-size cars such as the ford crown victoria this is usually due to the amount of interior space for an arrestee as well as trunk volume for computer and electrical equipment interior space and trunk volume also make such vehicles popular for taxi use since the discontinuation of the ford crown victoria police interceptor the de facto replacement has been the chevrolet tahoe since it is a body-on-frame suv
== decline and renaissanceedit ==
the sales of full-size vehicles in the united states declined after the early 1970s fuel crisis by that time full-size cars had grown to wheelbases of 121127 inches (3.13.2 m) and overall lengths of around 225 in (5,715 mm) in the 1970s due to the fuel crisis and the resulting rise in fuel costs many people traded in their full-size cars for smaller models such as the chevrolet nova ford maverick and plymouth valiant also it was during this time small japanese cars such as the toyota corolla and honda civic gained popularity american motors discontinued its full-size 122-inch (3,099 mm) wheelbase amc ambassador in 1974 and starting in the late-1970s the other american automakers began selling full-size cars with smaller exterior dimensions and smaller more fuel efficient engines that combined with gas being cheap once again in the late-1980s full-size cars regained popularity
chrysler discontinued its full-size cars (dodge st regis chrysler newport and new yorker plymouth gran fury) in 1981 (it continued to produce its midsize m-bodies (dodge diplomat chrysler fifth avenue and plymouth gran fury) to the 1989 model year) general motors discontinued its full-size cars ( chevrolet impala ss/chevrolet caprice buick roadmaster oldsmobile custom cruiser and cadillac fleetwood) in 1996 the 2011 model year was the final year of production of the ford panther platform (the ford crown victoria/ford police interceptor mercury grand marquis and lincoln town car)
during the 1980s and 1990s full-size cars lost ground to other vehicle types as family vehicles initially full-size sedans and station wagons lost ground to vans which offered additional seating and cargo capacity with lower fuel consumption during the 1990s full-size sedans and wagons lost further ground to mid-size and full-size suvs as they had similar towing capacity and a v8 engine started becoming an option in mid-size versions in north america full-size station wagons would vanish during the 1990s ford was the first to discontinue theirs after the 1991 model year with gm following suit after 1996
as fuel costs increase more consumers select more efficient vehicles these include automobiles such as compact and mid-size vehicles powered by smaller more efficient engines american-brand full-size sedans such as buicks and luxury full-size deville dts (cadillac dts) are still best-selling in the full-size segment however there is a serious attack on full-size by automakers to replace the size with price range for example a review by usa news named best luxury large cars of 2008 included only one large car (cadillac dts) while the others are mid-size cars this is mostly because in europe full-size cars only exist as absolute luxury cars (f segment) in 2010 less than a half percent of the new cars sold in germany fit into this category in other european countries even the d- and e segments (making together the equivalent to u.s mid-size cars) are not common
== outside north americaedit ==
