a reagent /riednt/ is a substance or compound added to a system to cause a chemical reaction or added to see if a reaction occurs the terms reactant and reagent are often used interchangeablyhowever a reactant is more specifically a substance consumed in the course of a chemical reaction solvents though involved in the reaction are usually not called reactants similarly catalysts are not consumed by the reaction so are not reactants
in organic chemistry reagents are compounds or mixturesusually composed of inorganic or small organic moleculesthat cause a transformation on an organic substrate examples of organic reagents include the collins reagent fenton's reagent and grignard reagent analytical reagents confirm the presence of another substance examples of these are fehling's reagent millon's reagent and tollens reagent
when purchasing or preparing chemicals reagent-grade describes chemical substances of sufficient purity for use in chemical analysis chemical reactions or physical testing purity standards for reagents are set by organizations such as astm international or the american chemical society for instance reagent-quality water must have very low levels of impurities such as sodium and chloride ions silica and bacteria as well as a very high electrical resistivity
