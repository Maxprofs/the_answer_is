meiosis maoss specialized type cell division reduces chromosome number half process occurs sexually reproducing singlecelled multicelled eukaryotes including animals plants fungi errors meiosis resulting aneuploidy leading known cause miscarriage frequent genetic cause developmental disabilities
meiosis dna replication followed two rounds cell division produce four daughter cells half number chromosomes original parent cell two meiotic divisions known meiosis meiosis ii meiosis begins phase cell cycle dna chromosome replicated consists two identical sister chromatids meiosis homologous chromosomes pair exchange genetic material process called chromosomal crossover homologous chromosomes segregated two new daughter cells containing half number chromosomes parent cell end meiosis sister chromatids remain attached may differ one another crossingover occurred meiosis ii two cells produced meiosis divide sister chromatids segregate one another produce four total daughter cells cells mature various types gametes ova sperm spores pollen
number chromosomes halved meiosis gametes fuse ie fertilization form zygote complete chromosome count containing combination paternal maternal chromosomes thus meiosis fertilization facilitate sexual reproduction successive generations maintaining number chromosomes example typical diploid human cell contains pairs chromosomes total half maternal origin half paternal origin meiosis produces haploid gametes one set chromosomes two gametes egg sperm fuse resulting zygote diploid mother father contributing chromosomes pattern number chromosomes occurs organisms utilize meiosis thus species chromosomes somatic cells produce gametes chromosomes
overviewedit
process meiosis bears number similarities mitosis differs two important respects
meiosis begins diploid cell contains two copies chromosome termed homologs first cell undergoes dna replication homolog consists two identical sister chromatids set homologs pair exchange dna homologous recombination leading physical connections crossovers homologs first meiotic division homologs segregated separate daughter cells spindle apparatus cells proceed second division without intervening round dna replication sister chromatids segregated separate daughter cells produce total four haploid cells female animals employ slight variation pattern produce one large ovum two small polar bodies recombination individual chromatid consist new combination maternal paternal dna resulting offspring genetically distinct either parent furthermore individual gamete include assortment maternal paternal recombinant chromatids genetic diversity resulting sexual reproduction contributes variation traits upon natural selection act
meiosis uses many mechanisms mitosis type cell division used eukaryotes divide one cell two identical daughter cells plants fungi protists meiosis results formation spores haploid cells divide vegetatively without undergoing fertilization eukaryotes like bdelloid rotifers ability carry meiosis acquired ability reproduce parthenogenesis
meiosis occur archaea bacteria generally reproduce via asexual processes binary fission however sexual process known horizontal gene transfer involves transfer dna one bacterium archaeon another recombination dna molecules different parental origin

occurrence eukaryotic life cyclesedit
meiosis occurs eukaryotic life cycles involving sexual reproduction consisting constant cyclical process meiosis fertilization takes place alongside normal mitotic cell division multicellular organisms intermediary step diploid haploid transition organism grows certain stages life cycle germ cells produce gametes somatic cells make body organism involved gamete production
cycling meiosis fertilization events produces series transitions back forth alternating haploid diploid states organism phase life cycle occur either diploid state gametic diploid life cycle haploid state zygotic haploid life cycle sporic haplodiploid life cycle two distinct organism phases one haploid state diploid state sense three types life cycles utilize sexual reproduction differentiated location organism phases
gametic life cycle diplontic life cycle humans part organism diploid grown diploid cell called zygote organisms diploid germline stem cells undergo meiosis create haploid gametes spermatozoa males ova females fertilize form zygote diploid zygote undergoes repeated cellular division mitosis grow organism
zygotic life cycle organism haploid instead spawned proliferation differentiation single haploid cell called gamete two organisms opposing gender contribute haploid gametes form diploid zygote zygote undergoes meiosis immediately creating four haploid cells cells undergo mitosis create organism many fungi many protozoa utilize zygotic life cycle
finally sporic life cycle living organism alternates haploid diploid states consequently cycle also known alternation generations diploid organisms germline cells undergo meiosis produce spores spores proliferate mitosis growing haploid organism haploid organisms gamete combines another haploid organisms gamete creating zygote zygote undergoes repeated mitosis differentiation become diploid organism sporic life cycle considered fusion gametic zygotic life cycles

preparatory steps lead meiosis identical pattern name interphase mitotic cell cycle
interphase divided three phases
growth g phase active phase cell synthesizes vast array proteins including enzymes structural proteins need growth g chromosomes consists single linear molecule dna
synthesis phase genetic material replicated cells chromosomes duplicates become two identical sister chromatids attached centromere replication change ploidy cell since centromere number remains identical sister chromatids yet condensed densely packaged chromosomes visible light microscope take place prophase meiosis
growth g phase g phase seen mitosis present meiosis first four stages prophase many respects correspond g phase mitotic cell cycle
interphase followed meiosis meiosis ii meiosis separates homologous chromosome still made two sister chromatids two daughter cells thus reducing chromosome number half meiosis ii sister chromatids decouple resultant daughter chromosomes segregated four daughter cells diploid organisms daughter cells resulting meiosis haploid contain one copy chromosome species cells enter resting phase known interkinesis meiosis meiosis ii
meiosis ii divided prophase metaphase anaphase telophase stages similar purpose analogous subphases mitotic cell cycle therefore meiosis includes stages meiosis prophase metaphase anaphase telophase meiosis ii prophase ii metaphase ii anaphase ii telophase ii
meiosis generates gamete genetic diversity two ways independent orientation homologous chromosome pairs along metaphase plate metaphase subsequent separation homologs anaphase allows random independent distribution chromosomes daughter cell ultimately gametes physical exchange homologous chromosomal regions homologous recombination prophase results new combinations dna within chromosomes
meiosis specific genes highly transcribed addition strong meiotic stagespecific expression mrna also pervasive translational controls eg selective usage preformed mrna regulating ultimate meiotic stagespecific protein expression genes meiosis thus transcriptional translational controls determine broad restructuring meiotic cells needed carry meiosis

meiosis iedit
meiosis segregates homologous chromosomes producing two haploid cells n chromosomes humans ploidy reduced diploid haploid meiosis referred reductional division meiosis ii equational division analogous mitosis sister chromatids segregated creating four haploid daughter cells
prophase iedit
prophase longest phase meiosis prophase dna exchanged homologous chromosomes process called homologous recombination often results chromosomal crossover process critical pairing homologous chromosomes hence accurate segregation chromosomes first meiosis division new combinations dna created crossover significant source genetic variation result new combinations alleles may beneficial paired replicated chromosomes called bivalents tetrads two chromosomes four chromatids one chromosome coming parent process pairing homologous chromosomes called synapsis stage nonsister chromatids may crossover points called chiasmata plural singular chiasma
leptoteneedit
first stage prophase leptotene stage also known leptonema greek words meaning thin threadsin stage prophase individual chromosomeseach consisting two sister chromatidscondense diffuse interphase conformation visible strands within nucleus however two sister chromatids still tightly bound indistinguishable one another leptotene lateral elements synaptonemal complex assemble leptotene short duration progressive condensation coiling chromosome fibers takes place
zygoteneedit
zygotene stage also known zygonema greek words meaning paired threads occurs chromosomes approximately line homologous chromosome pairs organisms called bouquet stage way telomeres cluster one end nucleus stage synapsis pairingcoming together homologous chromosomes takes place facilitated assembly central element synaptonemal complex pairing brought zipperlike fashion may start centromere procentric chromosome ends proterminal portion intermediate individuals pair equal length position centromere thus pairing highly specific exact paired chromosomes called bivalent tetrad chromosomes
pachyteneedit
pachytene pronounced pktin pakteen stage also known pachynema greek words meaning thick threads point tetrad chromosomes formed known bivalent stage chromosomal crossover crossing occurs nonsister chromatids homologous chromosomes may exchange segments regions homology sex chromosomes however wholly identical exchange information small region homology sites exchange happens chiasmata form exchange information nonsister chromatids results recombination information chromosome complete set information gaps formed result process chromosomes cannot distinguished synaptonemal complex actual act crossing perceivable microscope chiasmata visible next stage
diploteneedit
diplotene stage also known diplonema greek words meaning two threads synaptonemal complex degrades homologous chromosomes separate one another little chromosomes uncoil bit allowing transcription dna however homologous chromosomes bivalent remain tightly bound chiasmata regions crossingover occurred chiasmata remain chromosomes severed transition anaphase
