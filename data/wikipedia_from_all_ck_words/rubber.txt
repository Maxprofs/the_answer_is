natural rubber also called india rubber or caoutchouc as initially produced consists of polymers of the organic compound isoprene with minor impurities of other organic compounds plus water malaysia is a leading producer of rubber forms of polyisoprene that are used as natural rubbers are classified as elastomers natural rubber is used by many manufacturing companies for the production of rubber products currently rubber is harvested mainly in the form of the latex from certain trees the latex is a sticky milky colloid drawn off by making incisions into the bark and collecting the fluid in vessels in a process called tapping the latex then is refined into rubber ready for commercial processing natural rubber is used extensively in many applications and products either alone or in combination with other materials in most of its useful forms it has a large stretch ratio and high resilience and is extremely waterproof
== usesedit ==
compared to vulcanized rubber uncured rubber has relatively few uses it is used for cements for adhesive insulating and friction tapes and for crepe rubber used in insulating blankets and footwear vulcanized rubber on the other hand has numerous applications resistance to abrasion makes softer kinds of rubber valuable for the treads of vehicle tires and conveyor belts and makes hard rubber valuable for pump housings and piping used in the handling of abrasive sludge
the flexibility of rubber is often used in hose tires and rollers for a wide variety of devices ranging from domestic clothes wringers to printing presses its elasticity makes it suitable for various kinds of shock absorbers and for specialized machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration being relatively impermeable to gases rubber is useful in the manufacture of articles such as air hoses balloons balls and cushions the resistance of rubber to water and to the action of most fluid chemicals has led to its use in rainwear diving gear and chemical and medicinal tubing and as a lining for storage tanks processing equipment and railroad tank cars because of their electrical resistance soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves shoes and blankets hard rubber is used for articles such as telephone housings parts for radio sets meters and other electrical instruments the coefficient of friction of rubber which is high on dry surfaces and low on wet surfaces leads to the use of rubber both for power-transmission belting and for water-lubricated bearings in deep-well pumps
== varietiesedit ==
the major commercial source of natural rubber latex is the par rubber tree (hevea brasiliensis) a member of the spurge family euphorbiaceae this species is widely used because it grows well under cultivation and a properly managed tree responds to wounding by producing more latex for several years
congo rubber formerly a major source of rubber came from vines in the genus landolphia (l kirkii l heudelotis and l owariensis) these cannot be cultivated and the intense drive to collect latex from wild plants was responsible for many of the atrocities committed under the congo free state
many other plants produce forms of latex rich in isoprene polymers though not all produce usable forms of polymer as easily as the par rubber tree does some of them require more elaborate processing to produce anything like usable rubber and most are more difficult to tap some produce other desirable materials for example gutta-percha (palaquium gutta) and chicle from manilkara species others that have been commercially exploited or at least have shown promise as sources of rubber include the rubber fig (ficus elastica) panama rubber tree (castilla elastica) various spurges (euphorbia spp.) lettuce (lactuca species) the related scorzonera tau-saghyz various taraxacum species including common dandelion (taraxacum officinale) and russian dandelion (taraxacum kok-saghyz) and perhaps most importantly for its hypoallergenic properties guayule (parthenium argentatum) the term gum rubber is sometimes applied to the tree-obtained version of natural rubber in order to distinguish it from the synthetic version
== discovery of commercial potentialedit ==
the para rubber tree is indigenous to south america charles marie de la condamine is credited with introducing samples of rubber to the acadmie royale des sciences of france in 1736 in 1751 he presented a paper by franois fresneau to the acadmie (eventually published in 1755) which described many of the properties of rubber this has been referred to as the first scientific paper on rubber in england joseph priestley in 1770 observed that a piece of the material was extremely good for rubbing off pencil marks on paper hence the name rubber later it slowly made its way around england
south america remained the main source of the limited amounts of latex rubber used during much of the 19th century the trade was well protected and exporting seeds from brazil was said to be a capital offense although there was no law against it nevertheless in 1876 henry wickham smuggled 70,000 par rubber tree seeds from brazil and delivered them to kew gardens england only 2,400 of these germinated after which the seedlings were then sent to india ceylon (sri lanka) indonesia singapore and british malaya malaya (now peninsular malaysia) was later to become the biggest producer of rubber in the early 1900s the congo free state in africa was also a significant source of natural rubber latex mostly gathered by forced labor liberia and nigeria also started production of rubber
in india commercial cultivation of natural rubber was introduced by the british planters although the experimental efforts to grow rubber on a commercial scale in india were initiated as early as 1873 at the botanical gardens calcutta the first commercial hevea plantations in india were established at thattekadu in kerala in 1902
in singapore and malaya commercial production of rubber was heavily promoted by sir henry nicholas ridley who served as the first scientific director of the singapore botanic gardens from 1888 to 1911 he distributed rubber seeds to many planters and developed the first technique for tapping trees for latex without causing serious harm to the tree because of his very fervent promotion of this crop he is popularly remembered by the nickname mad ridley
== propertiesedit ==
rubber exhibits unique physical and chemical properties rubber's stress-strain behavior exhibits the mullins effect and the payne effect and is often modeled as hyperelastic rubber strain crystallizes
due to the presence of a double bond in each repeat unit natural rubber is susceptible to vulcanisation and sensitive to ozone cracking
the two main solvents for rubber are turpentine and naphtha (petroleum) the former has been in use since 1764 when franois fresnau made the discovery giovanni fabbroni is credited with the discovery of naphtha as a rubber solvent in 1779 because rubber does not dissolve easily the material is finely divided by shredding prior to its immersion
an ammonia solution can be used to prevent the coagulation of raw latex while it is being transported from its collection site
=== elasticityedit ===
on a microscopic scale relaxed rubber is a disorganized cluster of erratically changing wrinkled chains in stretched rubber the chains are almost linear the restoring force is due to the preponderance of wrinkled conformations over more linear ones for the quantitative treatment see ideal chain for more examples see entropic force
cooling below the glass transition temperature still permits local conformational changes but a reordering is practically impossible because of the larger energy barrier for the concerted movement of longer chains frozen rubber's elasticity is low and strain results from small changes of bond lengths and angles this caused the challenger disaster when the american space shuttle's flattened o-rings failed to relax to fill a widening gap the glass transition is fast and reversible the force resumes on heating
the parallel chains of stretched rubber are susceptible to crystallization this takes some time because turns of twisted chains have to move out of the way of the growing crystallites crystallization has occurred for example when after days an inflated toy balloon is found withered at a relatively large remaining volume where it is touched it shrinks because the temperature of the hand is enough to melt the crystals
vulcanization of rubber creates disulfide bonds between chains which limits the degrees of freedom and results in chains that tighten more quickly for a given strain thereby increasing the elastic force constant and making the rubber harder and less extensible
== chemical makeupedit ==
latex is the polymer cis-1,4-polyisoprene with a molecular weight of 100,000 to 1,000,000 daltons typically a small percentage (up to 5% of dry mass) of other materials such as proteins fatty acids resins and inorganic materials (salts) are found in natural rubber polyisoprene can also be created synthetically producing what is sometimes referred to as synthetic natural rubber but the synthetic and natural routes are completely different some natural rubber sources such as gutta-percha are composed of trans-1,4-polyisoprene a structural isomer that has similar but not identical properties
natural rubber is an elastomer and a thermoplastic once the rubber is vulcanized it will turn into a thermoset most rubber in everyday use is vulcanized to a point where it shares properties of both i.e. if it is heated and cooled it is degraded but not destroyed
the final properties of a rubber item depend not just on the polymer but also on modifiers and fillers such as carbon black factice whiting and a host of others
=== biosynthesisedit ===
rubber particles are formed in the cytoplasm of specialized latex-producing cells called laticifers within rubber plants rubber particles are surrounded by a single phospholipid membrane with hydrophobic tails pointed inward the membrane allows biosynthetic proteins to be sequestered at the surface of the growing rubber particle which allows new monomeric units to be added from outside the biomembrane but within the lacticifer the rubber particle is an enzymatically active entity that contains three layers of material the rubber particle a biomembrane and free monomeric units the biomembrane is held tightly to the rubber core due to the high negative charge along the double bonds of the rubber polymer backbone free monomeric units and conjugated proteins make up the outer layer the rubber precursor is isopentenyl pyrophosphate (an allylic compound) which elongates by mg2+-dependent condensation by the action of rubber transferase the monomer adds to the pyrophosphate end of the growing polymer the process displaces the terminal high-energy pyrophosphate the reaction produces a cis polymer the initiation step is catalyzed by prenyltransferase which converts three monomers of isopentenyl pyrophosphate into farnesyl pyrophosphate the farnesyl pyrophosphate can bind to rubber transferase to elongate a new rubber polymer
the required isopentenyl pyrophosphate is obtained from the mevalonate pathway which derives from acetyl-coa in the cytosol in plants isoprene pyrophosphate can also be obtained from 1-deox-d-xyulose-5-phosphate/2-c-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway within plasmids the relative ratio of the farnesyl pyrophosphate initiator unit and isoprenyl pyrophosphate elongation monomer determines the rate of new particle synthesis versus elongation of existing particles though rubber is known to be produced by only one enzyme extracts of latex have shown numerous small molecular weight proteins with unknown function the proteins possibly serve as cofactors as the synthetic rate decreases with complete removal
== current sourcesedit ==
close to 28 million tons of rubber were produced in 2013 of which approximately 44% was natural since the bulk of the rubber produced is of the synthetic variety which is derived from petroleum the price of natural rubber is determined to a large extent by the prevailing global price of crude oil today asia is the main source of natural rubber accounting for about 94% of output in 2005 the three largest producing countries thailand indonesia (2.4 million tons) and malaysia together account for around 72% of all natural rubber production natural rubber is not cultivated widely in its native continent of south america due to the existence of south american leaf blight and other natural predators of the rubber tree
=== cultivationedit ===
rubber latex is extracted from rubber trees the economic life period of rubber trees in plantations is around 32 years up to 7 years of immature phase and about 25 years of productive phase
the soil requirement of the plant is generally well-drained weathered soil consisting of laterite lateritic types sedimentary types nonlateritic red or alluvial soils
the climatic conditions for optimum growth of rubber trees are
rainfall of around 250 cm evenly distributed without any marked dry season and with at least 100 rainy days per year
temperature range of about 20 to 34 c with a monthly mean of 25 to 28 c
high atmospheric humidity of around 80%
bright sunshine amounting to about 2000 hours per year at the rate of six hours per day throughout the year
absence of strong winds
many high-yielding clones have been developed for commercial planting these clones yield more than 2,000 kg of dry rubber per hectare per year when grown under ideal conditions
=== collectionedit ===
in places such as kerala where coconuts are in abundance the half shell of coconut is used as the collection container for the latex but glazed pottery or aluminium or plastic cups are more common elsewhere the cups are supported by a wire that encircles the tree this wire incorporates a spring so it can stretch as the tree grows the latex is led into the cup by a galvanised spout knocked into the bark tapping normally takes place early in the morning when the internal pressure of the tree is highest a good tapper can tap a tree every 20 seconds on a standard half-spiral system and a common daily task size is between 450 and 650 trees trees are usually tapped on alternate or third days although many variations in timing length and number of cuts are used the latex which contains 2540% dry rubber is in the bark so the tapper must avoid cutting right through to the wood else the growing cambial layer will be damaged and the renewing bark will be badly deformed making later tapping difficult it is usual to tap a pannel at least twice sometimes three times during the tree's life the economic life of the tree depends on how well the tapping is carried out as the critical factor is bark consumption a standard in malaysia for alternate daily tapping is 25 cm (vertical) bark consumption per year the latex tubes in the bark ascend in a spiral to the right for this reason tapping cuts usually ascend to the left to cut more tubes
the trees will drip latex for about four hours stopping as latex coagulates naturally on the tapping cut thus blocking the latex tubes in the bark tappers usually rest and have a meal after finishing their tapping work then start collecting the liquid field latex at about midday some trees will continue to drip after the collection and this leads to a small amount of cup lump which is collected at the next tapping the latex that coagulates on the cut is also collected as tree lace tree lace and cup lump together account for 1020% of the dry rubber produced latex that drips onto the ground earth scrap is also collected periodically for processing of low-grade product
==== field coagulaedit ====
there are four types of field coagula cuplump treelace smallholders lump and earth scrap each has significantly different properties
cup lump is the coagulated material found in the collection cup when the tapper next visits the tree to tap it again it arises from latex clinging to the walls of the cup after the latex was last poured into the bucket and from late-dripping latex exuded before the latex-carrying vessels of the tree become blocked it is of higher purity and of greater value than the other three types
tree lace is the coagulum strip that the tapper peels off the previous cut before making a new cut it usually has higher copper and manganese contents than cup lump both copper and manganese are pro-oxidants and can lower the physical properties of the dry rubber
smallholders lump is produced by smallholders who collect rubber from trees far away from the nearest factory many indonesian smallholders who farm paddies in remote areas tap dispersed trees on their way to work in the paddy fields and collect the latex (or the coagulated latex) on their way home as it is often impossible to preserve the latex sufficiently to get it to a factory that processes latex in time for it to be used to make high quality products and as the latex would anyway have coagulated by the time it reached the factory the smallholder will coagulate it by any means available in any container available some smallholders use small containers buckets etc. but often the latex is coagulated in holes in the ground which are usually lined with plastic sheeting acidic materials and fermented fruit juices are used to coagulate the latex a form of assisted biological coagulation little care is taken to exclude twigs leaves and even bark from the lumps that are formed which may also include tree lace collected by the smallholder
earth scrap is the material that gathers around the base of the tree it arises from latex overflowing from the cut and running down the bark of the tree from rain flooding a collection cup containing latex and from spillage from tappers buckets during collection it contains soil and other contaminants and has variable rubber content depending on the amount of contaminants mixed with it earth scrap is collected by the field workers two or three times a year and may be cleaned in a scrap-washer to recover the rubber or sold off to a contractor who will clean it and recover the rubber it is of very low quality and under no circumstances should it be included in block rubber or brown crepe
=== processingedit ===
the latex will coagulate in the cups if kept for long the latex has to be collected before coagulation the collected latex field latex is transferred into coagulation tanks for the preparation of dry rubber or transferred into air-tight containers with sieving for ammoniation ammoniation is necessary to preserve the latex in a colloidal state for longer periods of time
latex is generally processed into either latex concentrate for manufacture of dipped goods or it can be coagulated under controlled clean conditions using formic acid the coagulated latex can then be processed into the higher-grade technically specified block rubbers such as svr 3l or svr cv or used to produce ribbed smoke sheet grades
naturally coagulated rubber (cup lump) is used in the manufacture of tsr10 and tsr20 grade rubbers the processing of the rubber for these grades is a size reduction and cleaning process to remove contamination and prepare the material for the final stage of drying
the dried material is then baled and palletized for storage and shipment in various methods of transportation
=== transportationedit ===
natural rubber latex is shipped from factories in south-west asia south america and north africa to destinations around the world as the cost of natural rubber has risen significantly the shipping methods which offer the lowest cost per unit of weight are preferred depending on the destination warehouse availability and transportation conditions some methods are more suitable to certain buyers than others in international trade latex rubber is mostly shipped in 20-foot ocean containers inside the ocean container various types of smaller containers are used by factories to store latex rubber
== usesedit ==
=== contemporary manufacturingedit ===
around 25 million tonnes of rubber is produced each year of which 42 percent is natural rubber the remainder is synthetic rubber derived from petrochemical sources around 70 percent of the world's natural rubber is used in tires the top end of latex production results in latex products such as surgeons gloves condoms balloons and other relatively high-value products the mid-range which comes from the technically specified natural rubber materials ends up largely in tires but also in conveyor belts marine products windshield wipers and miscellaneous rubber goods natural rubber offers good elasticity while synthetic materials tend to offer better resistance to environmental factors such as oils temperature chemicals or ultraviolet light and suchlike cured rubber is rubber which has been compounded and subjected to the vulcanisation process which creates cross-links within the rubber matrix
=== prehistoric usesedit ===
the first use of rubber is thought to have been by the olmecs who centuries later passed on the knowledge of natural latex from the hevea tree in 1600 bc to the ancient mayans they boiled the harvested latex to make a ball for a mesoamerican ballgame
=== pre-world war ii manufacturingedit ===
other significant uses of rubber are door and window profiles hoses belts gaskets matting flooring and dampeners (antivibration mounts) for the automotive industry gloves (medical household and industrial) and toy balloons are also large consumers of rubber although the type of rubber used is concentrated latex significant tonnage of rubber is used as adhesives in many manufacturing industries and products although the two most noticeable are the paper and the carpet industries rubber is also commonly used to make rubber bands and pencil erasers
=== pre-world war ii textile applicationsedit ===
rubber produced as a fiber sometimes called elastic has significant value for use in the textile industry because of its excellent elongation and recovery properties for these purposes manufactured rubber fiber is made as either an extruded round fiber or rectangular fibers that are cut into strips from extruded film because of its low dye acceptance feel and appearance the rubber fiber is either covered by yarn of another fiber or directly woven with other yarns into the fabric in the early 1900s for example rubber yarns were used in foundation garments while rubber is still used in textile manufacturing its low tenacity limits its use in lightweight garments because latex lacks resistance to oxidizing agents and is damaged by aging sunlight oil and perspiration seeking a way to address these shortcomings the textile industry has turned to neoprene (polymer of chloroprene) a type of synthetic rubber as well as another more commonly used elastomer fiber spandex (also known as elastane) because of their superiority to rubber in both strength and durability
== vulcanizationedit ==
natural rubber is often vulcanized a process by which the rubber is heated and sulfur peroxide or bisphenol are added to improve resistance and elasticity and to prevent it from perishing the development of vulcanization is most closely associated with charles goodyear in 1839 before world war ii era manufacturing carbon black was often used as an additive to rubber to improve its strength especially in vehicle tires
== allergic reactionsedit ==
some people have a serious latex allergy and exposure to natural latex rubber products such as latex gloves can cause anaphylactic shock the antigenic proteins found in hevea latex may be deliberately reduced (though not eliminated) through processing
latex from non-hevea sources such as guayule can be used without allergic reaction by persons with an allergy to hevea latex
some allergic reactions are not to the latex itself but from residues of chemicals used to accelerate the cross-linking process although this may be confused with an allergy to latex it is distinct from it typically taking the form of type iv hypersensitivity in the presence of traces of specific processing chemicals
== alternative sourcesedit ==
dandelion milk has long been known to contain latex the latex exhibits the same quality as the natural rubber from rubber trees yet in the wild types of dandelion the latex content is low and varies greatly
in nazi germany research projects tried to use dandelions as a base for rubber production but failed
in 2013 by inhibiting one key enzyme and using modern cultivation methods and optimization techniques scientists in the fraunhofer institute for molecular biology and applied ecology (ime) in germany developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber in collaboration with continental tires ime is building a pilot facility the first prototype test tires made with blends from dandelion-rubber are scheduled to be tested on public roads over the next few years
