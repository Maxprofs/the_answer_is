exoskeletonedit
arthropod exoskeletons made cuticle noncellular material secreted epidermis cuticles vary details structure generally consist three main layers epicuticle thin outer waxy coat moistureproofs layers gives protection exocuticle consists chitin chemically hardened proteins endocuticle consists chitin unhardened proteins exocuticle endocuticle together known procuticle body segment limb section encased hardened cuticle joints body segments limb sections covered flexible cuticle
exoskeletons aquatic crustaceans biomineralized calcium carbonate extracted water terrestrial crustaceans developed means storing mineral since land cannot rely steady supply dissolved calcium carbonate biomineralization generally affects exocuticle outer part endocuticle two recent hypotheses evolution biomineralization arthropods groups animals propose provides tougher defensive armor allows animals grow larger stronger providing rigid skeletons either case mineralorganic composite exoskeleton cheaper build allorganic one comparable strength
cuticle may setae bristles growing special cells epidermis setae varied form function appendages example often used sensors detect air water currents contact objects aquatic arthropods use featherlike setae increase surface area swimming appendages filter food particles water aquatic insects airbreathers use thick feltlike coats setae trap air extending time spend water heavy rigid setae serve defensive spines
although arthropods use muscles attached inside exoskeleton flex limbs still use hydraulic pressure extend system inherited prearthropod ancestors example spiders extend legs hydraulically generate pressures eight times resting level
moultingedit
exoskeleton cannot stretch thus restricts growth arthropods therefore replace exoskeletons moulting shedding old exoskeleton growing new one yet hardened moulting cycles run nearly continuously arthropod reaches full size
initial phase moulting animal stops feeding epidermis releases moulting fluid mixture enzymes digests endocuticle thus detaches old cuticle phase begins epidermis secreted new epicuticle protect enzymes epidermis secretes new exocuticle old cuticle detaching stage complete animal makes body swell taking large quantity water air makes old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses old exocuticle thinnest commonly takes several minutes animal struggle old cuticle point new one wrinkled soft animal cannot support finds difficult move new endocuticle yet formed animal continues pump stretch new cuticle much possible hardens new exocuticle eliminates excess air water end phase new endocuticle formed many arthropods eat discarded cuticle reclaim materials
arthropods unprotected nearly immobilized new cuticle hardened danger trapped old cuticle attacked predators moulting may responsible arthropod deaths

myriapods comprise millipedes centipedes relatives many body segments bearing one two pairs legs sometimes grouped hexapods
crustaceans primarily aquatic notable exception woodlice characterised biramous appendages include lobsters crabs barnacles crayfish shrimp many others
hexapods comprise insects three small orders insectlike animals six thoracic legs sometimes grouped myriapods group called uniramia though genetic evidence tends support closer relationship hexapods crustaceans
