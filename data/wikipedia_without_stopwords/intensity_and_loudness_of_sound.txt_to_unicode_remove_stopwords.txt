loudness characteristic sound primarily psychological correlate physical strength amplitude formally defined attribute auditory sensation terms sounds ordered scale extending quiet loud
loudness subjective measure often confused objective measures sound strength sound pressure sound pressure level decibels sound intensity sound power filters aweighting attempt adjust sound measurements correspond loudness perceived typical human however loudness perception much complex process aweighting
loudness also affected parameters sound pressure including frequency bandwidth duration
explanation
perception loudness related sound pressure level spl duration sound human auditory system averages effects spl ms interval sound constant spl perceived increase loudness samples duration ms heard duration second point perception loudness stabilize sounds duration greater second momentbymoment perception loudness related average loudness preceding ms
sounds duration longer second relationship spl loudness approximated power function spl exponent spl intensity approximated power function exponent stevens power law precise measurements indicate loudness increases higher exponent low high levels lower exponent moderate levels

sensitivity human ear changes function frequency shown equalloudness graph line graph shows spl required frequencies perceived equally loud also shows humans good hearing sensitive sounds around khz sensitivity declining either side region complete model perception loudness include integration spl frequency duration
hearing loss
sensorineural hearing loss damage cochlea brain present perception loudness altered sounds low levels often perceived without hearing loss relatively quiet longer audible hearing impaired interestingly sounds high levels often perceived loudness would unimpaired listener phenomenon explained two theories loudness grows rapidly listeners normal listeners changes level theory called loudness recruitment accepted classical explanation recently proposed listeners sensorineural hearing loss may fact exhibit normal rate loudness growth instead elevated loudness threshold softest sound audible listeners louder softest sound audible normal listeners theory called softness imperception term coined mary florentine
compensation
loudness control consumer stereos alters frequency response curve correspond roughly equal loudness characteristic ear loudness compensation intended make recorded music sound natural played lower sound pressure level
normalization
loudness normalization equalizes perceived level instance commercials sound louder television programs loudness normalisation schemes exist number audio applications
