work overview
odum left large legacy many fields associated ecology systems energetics studied ecosystems world pioneered study several areas distinct fields research according hall pix odum published one first significant papers following areas
ecological modeling odum
ecological engineering odum et al
ecological economics odum
estuarine ecology odum hoskins
tropical ecosystems ecology odum pidgeon
general systems theory
odums contributions areas summarized
odum also wrote radiation ecology systems ecology unified science microcosm one first discuss use ecosystems lifesupport function space travel suggested odum technocratic orientation others believe sided calling new values
ecological modeling
new integrative approach ecology
phd thesis htodum gave novel definition ecology study large entities ecosystems natural level integration hence traditional role ecologist one odums doctoral aims recognize classify large cyclic entities ecosystems however another aims make predictive generalizations ecosystems whole world example odum large entity world constituted revolving cycle high stability presence stability odum believed enabled talk teleology systems moreover time writing thesis odum felt principle natural selection empirical teleological stability time component ecologist interested behavior function large entities time odum therefore sought give general statement natural selection equally applicable large entities small entities traditionally studied biology
hence odum also aim extending scope generality natural selection include large entities world extension relied definition entity combination properties stability time odums approach motivated lotkas ideas energetics evolution
ecosystem simulation
writing history ecosystem concept golley noted odum tended think form analogies gave example world heat engine vein odum understood extending dynamical analogies establish analogies electrical mechanical acoustical magnetic electronic systems include ecological systems
odum used analog electrical energy networks model energy flow pathways ecosystems odums analog electrical models significant role development approach systems recognized one earliest instances systems ecology
electron flow electrical network represented flow material eg carbon ecosystem charge capacitor analogous storage material model scaled ecosystem interest adjusting size electrical component
ecological analog ohms law
odum introduced electrical circuit diagrams ecosystems ecological society america claimed energy driven ecological systems ecoforce analogous role voltage electrical circuits
odum developed analogue ohms law aimed representation energy flows ecosystems terms steady state thermodynamics ohms law considered special case general flux law flux proportional driving thermodynamic force conductivity
kangas states odum also concluded thermodynamic systems ecosystems also obey forceflux law hence ohms law passive electrical analog circuits used simulate ecosystems ibid simulation odum attempted derive ecological analog electrical voltage voltage driving force related something measured years biomass pounds per acre analogous concept required biomass activity thermodynamic thrust may linear exactly nature still uncertain new concept
consideration led odum ask two important methodological questions electrical significance function observed nature given electrical unit circuit ecological system example diode nature one needs diode allow biomass accumulate voltage sun gone otherwise circuit reverses higher organisms like fish diodes
silver springs study
silver springs common type springfed stream florida constant temperature chemical composition study howard odum conducted first complete analysis natural ecosystem
odum started overall model early work used diagramming methodology similar sankey diagrams used chemical process engineering model energy matter flows ecosystem h herbivores c carnivores tc top carnivores d decomposers squares represent biotic pools ovals fluxes energy nutrients system
started overall model odum mapped detail flow routes stream measured energy input sun rain organic matter even bread tourists threw ducks fish measured energy gradually left spring way able establish streams energy budget
energetics
ecological biological energetics
around odum directed studies radioecology included effects radiation tropical rainforest el verde puerto rico odum pidgeon coral reefs ocean ecology eniwetok atoll odum brothers approached atomic energy commission undertake detailed study atoll nuclear testing apparently atoll sufficiently radioactive upon arrival odums able produce autoradiographic image coral head placing photographic paper studies early applications energy concepts ecological systems exploring implications laws thermodynamics used new settings
view biogeochemical cycles driven radiant energy odum expressed balance energy input output ratio production p respiration r pr classified water bodies based pr ratios separated autotrophic heterotrophic ecosystems measurements flowing water metabolism measurements whole systems odum measuring community system adding metabolism components lindeman many others done reasoning appears followed odums doctoral supervisor gehutchinson expressed view community organism must form metabolism however golley notes htodum attempted go beyond reporting mere ratios move resulted first serious disagreement systems energetics
maximum power theory proposal additional laws thermodynamicsenergetics
controversial move odum together richard pinkerton time physicist university florida motivated alfred j lotkas articles energetics evolution subsequently proposed theory natural systems tend operate efficiency produces maximum power output maximum efficiency theory turn motivated odum propose maximum power fundamental thermodynamic law odum also mooted two additional thermodynamic laws see energetics far consensus scientific community proposals many scientists never heard ht odum views
energese energy systems language
end odums electronic circuit ecological simulation models replaced general set energy symbols combined form systems diagrams symbols considered odum others language macroscope could portray generalized patterns energy flow describing patterns reducing ecosystem complexities flows energy odum believed would permit discovery general ecosystem principles attempted link universal scientific language projects appeared throughout history natural philosophy
kitching claimed language direct result working analogue computers reflected electrical engineers approach problem system representation electrical analogy odum system relatively easy turn mathematical equations one building model energy flow certainly odum system given serious consideration
due focus systems thinking odums language appears similar approach systems modeling language recently developed incose international systems engineering body
energy quality
taking energybased view hierarchical organization odum also developed systems ecology understanding energy quality
emergy
latter part career ht odum together david m scienceman developed ideas emergy specific use term embodied energy consider concept emergy sometimes briefly defined energy memory one odums significant contributions however concept neither free controversy without critics odum looked natural systems formed use various forms energy past emergy measure energy used past thus different measure energy unit emergy past available energy use emjoule distinguished joules used available energy remaining conceived principle maximum empower might explain evolution selforganising open systems however principle demonstrated experiments widely recognized scientific community

ecosystem concept
macroscope
hagen identified systems thinking odum form holistic thinking odum contrasted holistic thinking systems science reductionistic microscopic thinking used term macroscope refer holistic view kind detail eliminator allowing simple diagram created
microcosms
htodum pioneer use small closed open ecosystems classroom teaching small ecosystems often constructed fish tanks bottles called microcosms odums microcosm studies influenced design biosphere
hierarchical organization
observing way higher order trophic levels control function ecosystems ht odum arrived concept termed hierarchical organization
ecological economics
ecological economics active field economics ecology annual conferences international societies international journal htodum worked director marine institute university texas time odum became aware interplay ecologicalenergetic economic forces therefore funded research use conventional economic approaches quantify dollar values ecological resources recreational treatment uses research calculated potential value primary production per bay surface area
hall importance odums work came integration systems ecology energy economics together odums view economics evaluated objective terms energy rather subjective willingness pay basis
ecological engineering
ecological engineering emerging field study ecology engineering concerned designing monitoring constructing ecosystems term ecological engineering first coined howard odum well worked university florida ecological engineering wrote cases energy supplied man small relative natural sources sufficient produce large effects resulting patterns processes ecological engineering practical field developed former graduate student bill mitsch started continues edit standard journal field helped start international us societies devoted ecological engineering written two textbooks subject one ht odums last papers assessment ecological engineering published journal ecological engineering year odum died
general systems theory
odum described technocratic optimist approach significantly influenced father also advocate viewing social world various lenses physical science within processes earth htodum viewed humans playing central role said human biospheres programmatic pragmatic information processor maximum performance
