it was founded in 1987 by hafez saeed abdullah azzam and zafar iqbal in afghanistan with funding from osama bin laden with its headquarters based in muridke near lahore in punjab province of pakistan the group operates several training camps in pakistan-administered kashmir

== objectives ==
while the primary area of operations of let's militant activities is the kashmir valley their professed goal is not limited to challenging india's sovereignty over jammu and kashmir
let sees the issue of kashmir as part of a wider global struggle the group has repeatedly claimed through its journals and websites that its main aim is to destroy the indian republic and to annihilate hinduism and judaism let has declared hindus and jews to be the enemies of islam as well as india and israel to be the enemies of pakistan in a pamphlet entitled why are we waging jihad? the group defined its agenda as the restoration of islamic rule over all parts of india and declared india israel and the united states as existential enemies of islam the let believes that violent jihad is the duty of all muslims and must be waged until eight objectives are met ending persecution against muslims establishing islam as the dominant way of life in the world forcing infidels to pay jizya fighting for the weak and feeble against oppressors exacting revenge for killed muslims punishing enemies for violating oaths and treaties defending all muslim states and recapturing occupied muslim territory
in the wake of the november 2008 mumbai attacks investigations of computer and email accounts revealed a list of 320 locations worldwide deemed as possible targets for attack 20 of the targets were locations within india analysts believed that the list was a statement of intent rather than a list of locations where let cells had been established and were ready to strike
in january 2009 let publicly declared that it would pursue a peaceful resolution in the kashmir issue and that it did not have global jihadist aims but the group is still believed to be active in several other spheres of anti-indian terrorism the disclosures of abu jundal who was extradited to india by the saudi arabian government however revealed that let is planning to revive militancy in jammu and kashmir and conduct major terror strikes in india

== history ==
=== formation ===
in 1985 hafiz mohammed saeed and zafar iqbal formed the jamaat-ud-dawa (organization for preaching or jud) as a small missionary group dedicated to promoting an ahl-e-hadith version of islam in the next year zaki-ur rehman lakvi merged his group of anti-soviet jihadists with the jud to form the markaz-ud dawa-wal-irshad (center for preaching and guidance or mdi) the mdi had 17 founders originally and notable among them was abdullah azzam
the let was formed in afghanistan's kunar province in 1990 and gained prominence in the early 1990s as a military offshoot of mdi mdi's primary concerns were dawah and the let focused on jihad although the members did not distinguish between the two groups functions according to hafiz saeed islam propounds both dawa[h] and jihad both are equally important and inseparable since our life revolves around islam therefore both dawa and jihad are essential we cannot prefer one over the other.
most of these training camps were located in north-west frontier province (nwfp) and many were shifted to azad kashmir for the sole purpose of training volunteers for the kashmir jihad from 1991 onwards militancy surged in indian kashmir as many lashkar-e-taiba volunteers were infiltrated into indian kashmir from azad kashmir with the help of the pakistan army and isi as of 2010 the degree of control that pakistani intelligence retains over let's operations is not known
=== designation as terrorist group ===
on 28 march 2001 in statutory instrument 2001 no 1261 british home secretary jack straw designated the group a proscribed terrorist organization under the terrorism act 2000
on 5 december 2001 the group was added to the terrorist exclusion list in a notification dated 26 december 2001 united states secretary of state colin powell designated lashkar-e-taiba a foreign terrorist organisation
lashkar-e-taiba was banned in pakistan on 12 january 2002
it is banned in india as a designated terrorist group under the unlawful activities (prevention) act
it was listed as a terrorist organisation in australia under the security legislation amendment (terrorism) act 2002 on 11 april 2003 and was re-listed 11 april 2005 and 31 march 2007
on 2 may 2008 it was placed on the consolidated list established and maintained by the committee established by the united nations security council resolution 1267 as an entity associated with al-qaeda the report also proscribed jamaat-ud-dawa as a front group of the let bruce riedel an expert on terrorism believes that let with the support of its pakistani backers is more dangerous than al-qaeda
=== aftermath of mumbai attacks ===
according to a media report the u.s accused jud of being the front group for the prime suspects of the november 2008 mumbai attacks the lashkar-e-taiba the organization that trained the 10 gunmen involved in these attacks
on 7 december 2008 under pressure from usa and india pakistani army launched an operation against let and raided a markaz (centre) of the let at shawai nullah 5 km from muzaffarabad in pakistan-controlled azad kashmir the army arrested more than twenty members of the lashkar-e-taiba and zaki-ur-rehman lakhvi the alleged mastermind of the november 2008 mumbai attacks they are said to have sealed off the centre which included a madrasah and a mosque alongside offices of the let according to the government of pakistan
on 10 december 2008 india formally requested the united nations security council to designate jud as a terrorist organization subsequently pakistan's ambassador to the united nations abdullah hussain gave an undertaking saying
after the designation of jamaat-ud-dawah (jud) under (resolution) 1267 the government on receiving communication from the security council shall proscribe the jud and take other consequential actions as required including the freezing of assets
a similar assurance was given by pakistan in 2002 when it clamped down on the let however the let was covertly allowed to function under the guide of the jud while arrests have been made the pakistani government has categorically refused to allow any foreign investigators access to hafiz saeed
on 11 december 2008 the united nations security council imposed sanctions on jud declaring it a global terrorist group hafiz muhammad saeed the chief of jud declared that his group will challenge the sanctions imposed on it in all forums pakistan's government also banned the jud on the same day and issued an order to seal the jud in all four provinces as well as pakistan-controlled kashmir before the ban jud ran a weekly newspaper named ghazwah two monthly magazines called majalla tud dawaa and zarb e taiba and a fortnightly magazine for children nanhe mujahid the publications have since been banned by the pakistani government in addition to the prohibition of jud's print publications the organisation's websites were also shut down by the pakistani government
after the ban imposed by unsc hindu minority groups in pakistan came out in support of jud at protest marches in hyderabad hindu groups said that jud does charity work such as setting up water wells in desert regions and providing food to the poor however the credibility of the level of support during the protest is questionable several protesters claim to have been under the impression they were protesting price rises the bbc reported that protesters on their way to what they believed was a rally against price rises were handed signs in support of jud the organizations banning has been met with heavy criticism in many pakistani circles as jud was the first to react to the kashmir earthquake and the ziarat earthquake it also ran over 160 schools with thousands of students and provided aid in hospitals as well
in january 2009 the jud spokesperson abdullah muntazir stressed that the group did not have global jihadist aspirations and would welcome a peaceful resolution of the kashmir issue he also publicly disowned let commanders zaki-ur-rehman lakhvi and zarrar shah who have both been accused of being the masterminds behind the november 2008 mumbai attacks
in response to the un resolution and the government ban the jud reorganized itself under the name of tehreek-e-tahafuz qibla awal (ttqa)
on 25 june 2014 united states added several of let affiliates including jamaat-ud-dawa al-anfal trust tehrik-e-hurmat-e-rasool and tehrik-e-tahafuz qibla awwal to the list of foreign terrorist organisations

==== use of charity aid to fund operations ====
let assisted victims after the 2005 kashmir earthquake in many instances they were the first on the scene arriving before the army or other civilians
a large amount of funds collected among the pakistani expatriate community in britain to aid victims of the earthquake were funneled for the activities of lashkar-e-taiba although the donors were unaware about 5 million were collected but more than half of the funds were directed towards let rather than towards relief efforts intelligence officials stated that some of the funds were used to prepare for an attack that would have detonated explosives on board transatlantic airflights other investigations also indicated the aid given for earthquake victims was directly involved to expand lashkar-e-taiba's activities within india
