a space probe is a robotic spacecraft that leaves earth orbit and explores space it may approach the moon enter interplanetary space flyby orbit or land on other planetary bodies or approach interstellar space
see list of active solar system probes for a list of active probes the space agencies of the ussr (now russia and ukraine) the united states the european union japan china and india have in the aggregate launched probes to several planets and moons of the solar system as well as to a number of asteroids and comets more than twenty missions are currently operational
== interplanetary trajectories ==
once a probe has left the vicinity of earth its trajectory will likely take it along an orbit around the sun similar to the earth's orbit to reach another planet the simplest practical method is a hohmann transfer orbit more complex techniques such as gravitational slingshots can be more fuel-efficient though they may require the probe to spend more time in transit some high delta-v missions (such as those with high inclination changes) can only be performed within the limits of modern propulsion using gravitational slingshots a technique using very little propulsion but requiring a considerable amount of time is to follow a trajectory on the interplanetary transport network
== some notable probes ==
=== luna 9 ===
first man-made object to soft land on the moon or any other extra terrestrial surface
=== luna 3 ===
first mission to photograph the far side of the moon launched in 1959
=== luna 16 ===
first robotic sample return probe from the moon
=== lunokhod 1 ===
first rover on moon it was sent to the moon on november 10 1970
=== mariner 10 ===
first probe to mercury
=== venera 4 ===
first successful in-place analysis of another planet it may have also been the first space probe to impact the surface of another planet although it is unclear whether it reached venus surface
=== venera 7 ===
the venera 7 probe was the first spacecraft to successfully soft land on another planet (venus) and to transmit data from there back to earth
=== mariner 9 ===
upon its arrival at mars on november 13 1971 mariner 9 became the first space probe to maintain orbit around another planet
=== mars 3 ===
first soft landing on mars (between 1960 and 1973) although the spacecraft failed shortly after landing
=== sojourner ===
first successful rover on mars
=== spirit and opportunity ===
the mars exploration rovers spirit and opportunity surface and geology and searched for clues to past water activity on mars they were each launched in 2003 and landed in 2004 communication with spirit stopped on sol 2210 (march 22 2010) jpl continued to attempt to regain contact until may 24 2011 when nasa announced that efforts to communicate with the unresponsive rover had ended opportunity arrived at endeavour crater on 9 august 2011 at a landmark called spirit point named after its rover twin after traversing 13 miles from victoria crater over a three-year period as of january 16 2012 opportunity has lasted for more than eight years on mars although the rovers were intended to last only three months
=== halley armada ===
the first dedicated missions to a comet in this case to halley's comet during its 198586 journey through the inner solar system it was also the first massive international coordination of space probes on an interplanetary mission with probes specifically launched by the soviet (now russian) space agency european space agency and japan's isas (now integrated with nasda to jaxa)
==== ice ====
original a solar observatory in the international sun-earth explorer series it was sent into solar orbit to make the first close observations of a comet comet giacobini-zinner in 1985 as a prelude to studies of halley's comet
==== vega ====
two russian/french spacecraft they dropped landers and balloons (first weather balloons deployed on another planet) at venus before their rendezvous with halley's comet
==== sakigake ====
this japanese probe was the first non-us non-soviet interplanetary probe
==== suisei ====
a second japanese probe it made ultraviolet wavelength observations of the comet
==== giotto ====
the first space probe to penetrate a comet's coma and take close-up images of its nucleus
=== genesis ===
first solar wind sample return probe from sun-earth l1
=== stardust ===
first sample return probe from a comet tail
=== near shoemaker ===
first probe to land on an asteroid
=== hayabusa ===
first sample return probe to launch from an asteroid
=== rosetta ===
the rosetta space probe has flown by two asteroids and is aiming to rendezvous and explore comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko it rendezvoused with the comet in november 2014
=== pioneer 10 ===
first probe to jupiter radio communications were lost with pioneer 10 on january 23 2003 because of the loss of electric power for its radio transmitter with the probe at a distance of 12 billion kilometers (80 au) from earth
=== pioneer 11 ===
first probe to fly by two planets and first probe to saturn (communications were lost due to power constraints and vast distance.)
=== voyager 1 ===
voyager 1 is a 733-kilogram probe launched september 5 1977 it is currently still operational making it the longest-lasting mission of the u.s national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) it visited jupiter and saturn and was the first probe to provide detailed images of the moons of these planets
voyager 1 is the farthest human-made object from earth traveling away from both the earth and the sun at a relatively faster speed than any other probe as of september 12 2013 voyager 1 is about 12 billion miles from the sun
on august 25 2012 voyager 1 became the first human made object to enter interstellar space voyager 1 has not had a functioning plasma sensor since 1980 but a solar flare in 2012 allowed scientists from nasa to measure vibrations of the plasma surrounding the craft the vibrations allowed scientists to measure the plasma to be much denser than measurements taken in the far layers of our heliosphere thus concluding the craft had broken beyond the heliopause
=== voyager 2 ===
voyager 2 was the first probe to complete the planetary grand tour of the gas giants and the first probe to visit uranus and neptune voyager 2 is the second-farthest human-made object from earth next to voyager 1 at a distance of 101.2 au as of july 11 2013
=== cassini-huygens ===
probe sent to orbit saturn significantly expanded our knowledge of the ringed system detached a lander to land on titan on january 14 2005
=== new horizons ===
first probe to be launched to pluto launched on 19 january 2006 it flew by the plutocharon system on 14 july 2015
=== dawn ===
first spacecraft to visit and orbit a protoplanet (4 vesta) entering orbit on july 16 2011 entered orbit around dwarf planet ceres in early 2015 currently orbiting ceres as of april 2015
=== juno ===
first probe to jupiter without atomic battery launched august 8 2011
=== chang'e 2 ===
first probe to orbit the moon visit sun-earth l2 langrangian point and make a flyby of asteroid 4179 toutatis
=== beyond the solar system ===
along with pioneer 10 pioneer 11 and its sister space probe voyager 2 voyager 1 is now an interstellar probe voyager 1 and voyager 2 have both achieved solar escape velocity meaning that their trajectories will not return them to the solar system
== probe imagers ==
examples of space probe imaging telescope/cameras (focused on visible spectrum)
image forming systems on space probes typically have a multitude of specifications but aperture can be useful because it constrains the best diffraction limit and light gathering area
