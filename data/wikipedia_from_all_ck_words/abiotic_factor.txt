in biology and ecology abiotic components or abiotic factors are non-living chemical and physical parts of the environment that affect living organisms and the functioning of ecosystems abiotic factors and phenomena associated with them underpin all biology
== definition ==
in biology and ecology abiotic components include physical conditions and non-living resources that affect living organisms in terms of growth maintenance and reproduction resources are distinguished as substances or objects in the environment required by one organism and consumed or otherwise made unavailable for use by other organisms
component degradation of a substance by chemical or physical processes e.g hydrolysis all non-living components of an ecosystem is called abiotic components to make it more easy you could just say that abiotic is non-living factors such as the atmosphere or water is a non-living substance
== examples ==
in biology abiotic factors can include water light radiation temperature humidity atmosphere and soil the macroscopic climate often influences each of the above pressure and sound waves may also be considered in the context of marine or sub-terrestrial environments
all of these factors affect different organisms to different extents if there is little or no sunlight then plants may wither and die from not being able to get enough sunlight to complete the cycle of photosynthesis many archea require very high temperatures or pressures or unusual concentrations of chemical substances such as sulfur because of their specialization into extreme conditions certain fungi have evolved to survive mostly at the temperature the humidity and stability of their environment
for example there is a significant difference in access to water as well as humidity between temperate rain forests and deserts this difference in water access causes a diversity in the types of plants and animals that grow in these areas
