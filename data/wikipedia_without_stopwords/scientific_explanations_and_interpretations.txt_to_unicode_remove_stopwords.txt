confirmation bias also called confirmatory bias myside bias tendency search interpret favor recall information way confirms ones beliefs hypotheses giving disproportionately less consideration alternative possibilities type cognitive bias systematic error inductive reasoning people display bias gather remember information selectively interpret biased way effect stronger emotionally charged issues deeply entrenched beliefs people also tend interpret ambiguous evidence supporting existing position biased search interpretation memory invoked explain attitude polarization disagreement becomes extreme even though different parties exposed evidence belief perseverance beliefs persist evidence shown false irrational primacy effect greater reliance information encountered early series illusory correlation people falsely perceive association two events situations
series experiments suggested people biased toward confirming existing beliefs later work reinterpreted results tendency test ideas onesided way focusing one possibility ignoring alternatives certain situations tendency bias peoples conclusions explanations observed biases include wishful thinking limited human capacity process information another explanation people show confirmation bias weighing costs wrong rather investigating neutral scientific way
confirmation biases contribute overconfidence personal beliefs maintain strengthen beliefs face contrary evidence poor decisions due biases found political organizational contexts
types
confirmation biases effects information processing differ sometimes called behavioral confirmation effect commonly known selffulfilling prophecy persons expectations influence behavior bringing expected result
psychologists restrict term confirmation bias selective collection evidence supports one already believes ignoring rejecting evidence supports different conclusion psychologists apply term broadly tendency preserve ones existing beliefs searching evidence interpreting recalling memory
biased search information
experiments found repeatedly people tend test hypotheses onesided way searching evidence consistent current hypothesis rather searching relevant evidence phrase questions receive affirmative answer supports hypothesis look consequences would expect hypothesis true rather would happen false example someone using yesno questions find number suspects number might ask odd number people prefer type question called positive test even negative test even number would yield exactly information however mean people seek tests guarantee positive answer studies subjects could select either pseudotests genuinely diagnostic ones favored genuinely diagnostic
preference positive tests bias since positive tests highly informative however combination effects strategy confirm existing beliefs assumptions independently whether true realworld situations evidence often complex mixed example various contradictory ideas someone could supported concentrating one aspect behavior thus search evidence favor hypothesis likely succeed one illustration way phrasing question significantly change answer example people asked happy social life report greater satisfaction asked unhappy social life
even small change questions wording affect people search available information hence conclusions reach shown using fictional child custody case participants read parent moderately suitable guardian multiple ways parent b mix salient positive negative qualities close relationship child job would take away long periods time asked parent custody child majority participants chose parent b looking mainly positive attributes however asked parent denied custody child looked negative attributes majority answered parent b denied custody implying parent custody
similar studies demonstrated people engage biased search information also phenomenon may limited preference genuine diagnostic tests initial experiment participants rated another person introversionextroversion personality dimension basis interview chose interview questions given list interviewee introduced introvert participants chose questions presumed introversion find unpleasant noisy parties interviewee described extroverted almost questions presumed extroversion would liven dull party loaded questions gave interviewees little opportunity falsify hypothesis later version experiment gave participants less presumptive questions choose shy away social interactions participants preferred ask diagnostic questions showing weak bias towards positive tests pattern main preference diagnostic tests weaker preference positive tests replicated studies
personality traits influence interact biased search processes individuals vary abilities defend attitudes external attacks relation selective exposure selective exposure occurs individuals search information consistent rather inconsistent personal beliefs experiment examined extent individuals could refute arguments contradicted personal beliefs people high confidence levels readily seek contradictory information personal position form argument individuals low confidence levels seek contradictory information prefer information supports personal position people generate evaluate evidence arguments biased towards beliefs opinions heightened confidence levels decrease preference information supports individuals personal beliefs
another experiment gave participants complex rulediscovery task involved moving objects simulated computer objects computer screen followed specific laws participants figure participants could fire objects across screen test hypotheses despite making many attempts tenhour session none participants figured rules system typically attempted confirm rather falsify hypotheses reluctant consider alternatives even seeing objective evidence refuted working hypotheses frequently continued tests participants taught proper hypothesistesting instructions almost effect
biased interpretation
confirmation biases limited collection evidence even two individuals information way interpret biased
team stanford university conducted experiment involving participants felt strongly capital punishment half favor half participant read descriptions two studies comparison us states without death penalty comparison murder rates state introduction death penalty reading quick description study participants asked whether opinions changed read detailed account studys procedure rate whether research wellconducted convincing fact studies fictional half participants told one kind study supported deterrent effect undermined participants conclusions swapped
participants whether supporters opponents reported shifting attitudes slightly direction first study read read detailed descriptions two studies almost returned original belief regardless evidence provided pointing details supported viewpoint disregarding anything contrary participants described studies supporting preexisting view superior contradicted detailed specific ways writing study seemed undermine deterrence effect death penalty proponent wrote research didnt cover long enough period time opponents comment study said strong evidence contradict researchers presented results illustrated people set higher standards evidence hypotheses go current expectations effect known disconfirmation bias supported experiments
another study biased interpretation occurred us presidential election involved participants reported strong feelings candidates shown apparently contradictory pairs statements either republican candidate george w bush democratic candidate john kerry politically neutral public figure also given statements made apparent contradiction seem reasonable three pieces information decide whether individuals statements inconsistent strong differences evaluations participants much likely interpret statements candidate opposed contradictory
experiment participants made judgments magnetic resonance imaging mri scanner monitored brain activity participants evaluated contradictory statements favored candidate emotional centers brains aroused happen statements figures experimenters inferred different responses statements due passive reasoning errors instead participants actively reducing cognitive dissonance induced reading favored candidates irrational hypocritical behavior
biases belief interpretation persistent regardless intelligence level participants experiment took sat test college admissions test used united states assess intelligence levels read information regarding safety concerns vehicles experimenters manipulated national origin car american participants provided opinion car banned sixpoint scale one indicated definitely yes six indicated definitely participants firstly evaluated would allow dangerous german car american streets dangerous american car german streets participants believed dangerous german car american streets banned quickly dangerous american car german streets difference among intelligence levels rate participants would ban car
biased interpretation restricted emotionally significant topics another experiment participants told story theft rate evidential importance statements arguing either particular character responsible hypothesized characters guilt rated statements supporting hypothesis important conflicting statements
biased memory
even people gather interpret evidence neutral manner may still remember selectively reinforce expectations effect called selective recall confirmatory memory accessbiased memory psychological theories differ predictions selective recall schema theory predicts information matching prior expectations easily stored recalled information match alternative approaches say surprising information stands memorable predictions theories confirmed different experimental contexts theory winning outright
one study participants read profile woman described mix introverted extroverted behaviors later recall examples introversion extroversion one group told assess woman job librarian second group told job real estate sales significant difference two groups recalled librarian group recalling examples introversion sales groups recalling extroverted behavior selective memory effect also shown experiments manipulate desirability personality types one group participants shown evidence extroverted people successful introverts another group told opposite subsequent apparently unrelated study asked recall events lives either introverted extroverted group participants provided memories connecting desirable personality type recalled memories quickly
changes emotional states also influence memory recall participants rated felt first learned oj simpson acquitted murder charges described emotional reactions confidence regarding verdict one week two months one year trial results indicated participants assessments simpsons guilt changed time participants opinion verdict changed less stable participants memories regarding initial emotional reactions participants recalled initial emotional reactions two months year later past appraisals closely resembled current appraisals emotion people demonstrate sizable myside bias discussing opinions controversial topics memory recall construction experiences undergo revision relation corresponding emotional states
myside bias shown influence accuracy memory recall experiment widows widowers rated intensity experienced grief six months five years deaths spouses participants noted higher experience grief six months rather five years yet participants asked five years felt six months death significant intensity grief participants recalled highly correlated current level grief individuals appear utilize current emotional states analyze must felt experiencing past events emotional memories reconstructed current emotional states
one study showed selective memory maintain belief extrasensory perception esp believers disbelievers shown descriptions esp experiments half group told experimental results supported existence esp others told subsequent test participants recalled material accurately apart believers read nonsupportive evidence group remembered significantly less information incorrectly remembered results supporting esp

polarization opinion
people opposing views interpret new information biased way views move even apart called attitude polarization effect demonstrated experiment involved drawing series red black balls one two concealed bingo baskets participants knew one basket contained black red balls black red experimenters looked happened balls alternating color drawn turn sequence favor either basket ball drawn participants one group asked state loud judgments probability balls drawn one basket participants tended grow confident successive drawwhether initially thought basket black balls one red balls likely source estimate probability increased another group participants asked state probability estimates end sequence drawn balls rather ball show polarization effect suggesting necessarily occur people simply hold opposing positions rather openly commit
less abstract study stanford biased interpretation experiment participants strong opinions death penalty read mixed experimental evidence twentythree percent participants reported views become extreme selfreported shift correlated strongly initial attitudes later experiments participants also reported opinions becoming extreme response ambiguous information however comparisons attitudes new evidence showed significant change suggesting selfreported changes might real based experiments deanna kuhn joseph lao concluded polarization real phenomenon far inevitable happening small minority cases found prompted considering mixed evidence merely thinking topic
charles taber milton lodge argued stanford teams result hard replicate arguments used later experiments abstract confusing evoke emotional response taber lodge study used emotionally charged topics gun control affirmative action measured attitudes participants towards issues reading arguments side debate two groups participants showed attitude polarization strong prior opinions politically knowledgeable part study participants chose information sources read list prepared experimenters example could read national rifle associations brady antihandgun coalitions arguments gun control even instructed evenhanded participants likely read arguments supported existing attitudes arguments biased search information correlated well polarization effect
backfire effect name finding given evidence beliefs people reject evidence believe even strongly phrase first coined brendan nyhan jason reifler
persistence discredited beliefs
confirmation biases used explain beliefs persist initial evidence removed belief perseverance effect shown series experiments using called debriefing paradigm participants read fake evidence hypothesis attitude change measured fakery exposed detail attitudes measured see belief returns previous level
common finding least initial belief remains even full debriefing one experiment participants distinguish real fake suicide notes feedback random told done well others told performed badly even fully debriefed participants still influenced feedback still thought better worse average kind task depending initially told
another study participants read job performance ratings two firefighters along responses risk aversion test fictional data arranged show either negative positive association participants told risktaking firefighter better others told less well riskaverse colleague even two case studies true would scientifically poor evidence conclusion firefighters general however participants found subjectively persuasive case studies shown fictional participants belief link diminished around half original effect remained followup interviews established participants understood debriefing taken seriously participants seemed trust debriefing regarded discredited information irrelevant personal belief
preference early information
experiments shown information weighted strongly appears early series even order unimportant example people form positive impression someone described intelligent industrious impulsive critical stubborn envious given words reverse order irrational primacy effect independent primacy effect memory earlier items series leave stronger memory trace biased interpretation offers explanation effect seeing initial evidence people form working hypothesis affects interpret rest information
one demonstration irrational primacy used colored chips supposedly drawn two urns participants told color distributions urns estimate probability chip drawn one fact colors appeared prearranged order first thirty draws favored one urn next thirty favored series whole neutral rationally two urns equally likely however sixty draws participants favored urn suggested initial thirty
another experiment involved slide show single object seen blur first slightly better focus succeeding slide slide participants state best guess object participants whose early guesses wrong persisted guesses even picture sufficiently focus object readily recognizable people
illusory association events
illusory correlation tendency see nonexistent correlations set data tendency first demonstrated series experiments late one experiment participants read set psychiatric case studies including responses rorschach inkblot test participants reported homosexual men set likely report seeing buttocks anuses sexually ambiguous figures inkblots fact case studies fictional one version experiment constructed homosexual men less likely report imagery survey group experienced psychoanalysts reported set illusory associations homosexuality
another study recorded symptoms experienced arthritic patients along weather conditions month period nearly patients reported pains correlated weather conditions although real correlation zero
effect kind biased interpretation objectively neutral unfavorable evidence interpreted support existing beliefs also related biases hypothesistesting behavior judging whether two events illness bad weather correlated people rely heavily number positivepositive cases example instances pain bad weather pay relatively little attention kinds observation pain andor good weather parallels reliance positive tests hypothesis testing may also reflect selective recall people may sense two events correlated easier recall times happened together
individual differences
myside bias believed associated greater intelligence however studies shown myside bias influenced ability rationally think opposed amount intelligence myside bias cause inability effectively logically evaluate opposite side argument studies stated myside bias absence active openmindedness meaning active search initial idea may wrong typically myside bias operationalized empirical studies quantity evidence used support side comparison opposite side
study found individual differences myside bias study investigates individual differences acquired learning cultural context mutable researcher found important individual difference argumentation studies suggested individual differences deductive reasoning ability ability overcome belief bias epistemological understanding thinking disposition significant predictors reasoning generating arguments counterarguments rebuttals

wasons research hypothesistesting
term confirmation bias coined english psychologist peter wason experiment published challenged participants identify rule applying triples numbers outset told fits rule participants could generate triples experimenter told whether triple conformed rule
actual rule simply ascending sequence participants great deal difficulty finding often announcing rules far specific middle number average first last participants seemed test positive examplestriples obeyed hypothesized rule example thought rule number two greater predecessor would offer triple fit rule rather triple violates
wason accepted falsificationism according scientific test hypothesis serious attempt falsify interpreted results showing preference confirmation falsification hence term confirmation bias wason also used confirmation bias explain results selection task experiment task participants given partial information set objects specify information would need tell whether conditional rule b applies found repeatedly people perform badly various forms test cases ignoring information could potentially refute rule
klayman critique
paper joshua klayman youngwon ha argued wason experiments actually demonstrated bias towards confirmation instead klayman ha interpreted results terms tendency make tests consistent working hypothesis called positive test strategy strategy example heuristic reasoning shortcut imperfect easy compute klayman ha used bayesian probability information theory standard hypothesistesting rather falsificationism used wason according ideas answer question yields different amount information depends persons prior beliefs thus scientific test hypothesis one expected produce information since information content depends initial probabilities positive test either highly informative uninformative klayman ha argued people think realistic problems looking specific answer small initial probability case positive tests usually informative negative tests however wasons rule discovery task answerthree numbers ascending orderis broad positive tests unlikely yield informative answers klayman ha supported analysis citing experiment used labels dax med place fits rule doesnt fit rule avoided implying aim find lowprobability rule participants much success version experiment

explanations
confirmation bias often described result automatic unintentional strategies rather deliberate deception according robert maccoun biased evidence processing occurs combination cold cognitive hot motivated mechanisms
cognitive explanations confirmation bias based limitations peoples ability handle complex tasks shortcuts called heuristics use example people may judge reliability evidence using availability heuristicie readily particular idea comes mind also possible people focus one thought time find difficult test alternative hypotheses parallel another heuristic positive test strategy identified klayman ha people test hypothesis examining cases expect property event occur heuristic avoids difficult impossible task working diagnostic possible question however universally reliable people overlook challenges existing beliefs
motivational explanations involve effect desire belief sometimes called wishful thinking known people prefer pleasant thoughts unpleasant ones number ways called pollyanna principle applied arguments sources evidence could explain desired conclusions likely believed true according experiments manipulate desirability conclusion people demand high standard evidence unpalatable ideas low standard preferred ideas words ask believe suggestions must believe others although consistency desirable feature attitudes excessive drive consistency another potential source bias may prevent people neutrally evaluating new surprising information social psychologist ziva kunda combines cognitive motivational theories arguing motivation creates bias cognitive factors determine size effect
explanations terms costbenefit analysis assume people test hypotheses disinterested way assess costs different errors using ideas evolutionary psychology james friedrich suggests people primarily aim truth testing hypotheses try avoid costly errors example employers might ask onesided questions job interviews focused weeding unsuitable candidates yaacov trope akiva libermans refinement theory assumes people compare two different kinds error accepting false hypothesis rejecting true hypothesis instance someone underestimates friends honesty might treat suspiciously undermine friendship overestimating friends honesty may also costly less case would rational seek evaluate remember evidence honesty biased way someone gives initial impression introverted extroverted questions match impression come across empathic suggests talking someone seems introvert sign better social skills ask feel awkward social situations rather like noisy parties connection confirmation bias social skills corroborated study college students get know people highly selfmonitoring students sensitive environment social norms asked matching questions interviewing highstatus staff member getting know fellow students
psychologists jennifer lerner philip tetlock distinguish two different kinds thinking process exploratory thought neutrally considers multiple points view tries anticipate possible objections particular position confirmatory thought seeks justify specific point view lerner tetlock say people expect justify position others whose views already know tend adopt similar position people use confirmatory thought bolster credibility however external parties overly aggressive critical people disengage thought altogether simply assert personal opinions without justification lerner tetlock say people push think critically logically know advance need explain others wellinformed genuinely interested truth whose views dont already know conditions rarely exist argue people using confirmatory thought time

science
distinguishing feature scientific thinking search falsifying well confirming evidence however many times history science scientists resisted new discoveries selectively interpreting ignoring unfavorable data previous research shown assessment quality scientific studies seems particularly vulnerable confirmation bias found several times scientists rate studies report findings consistent prior beliefs favorably studies reporting findings inconsistent previous beliefs however assuming research question relevant experimental design adequate data clearly comprehensively described found results importance scientific community viewed prejudicially regardless whether conform current theoretical predictions
context scientific research confirmation biases sustain theories research programs face inadequate even contradictory evidence field parapsychology particularly affected
experimenters confirmation bias potentially affect data reported data conflict experimenters expectations may readily discarded unreliable producing socalled file drawer effect combat tendency scientific training teaches ways prevent bias example experimental design randomized controlled trials coupled systematic review aims minimize sources bias social process peer review thought mitigate effect individual scientists biases even though peer review process may susceptible biases confirmation bias may thus especially harmful objective evaluations regarding nonconforming results since biased individuals may regard opposing evidence weak principle give little serious thought revising beliefs scientific innovators often meet resistance scientific community research presenting controversial results frequently receives harsh peer review
