the human earlobe is composed of tough areolar and adipose connective tissues lacking the firmness and elasticity of the rest of the auricle (the external structure of the ear) in some cases the lower lobe is connected to the side of the face since the earlobe does not contain cartilage it has a large blood supply and may help to warm the ears and maintain balance the zoologist desmond morris in his book the naked ape (1967) conjectured that the lobes developed as an additional erogenous zone to facilitate the extended sexuality necessary in the evolution of human monogamous pair bonding however earlobes are not generally considered to have any major biological function the earlobe contains many nerve endings and for some people is an erogenous zone
== structure ==
=== inheritance ===
earlobes average about 2 centimeters long and elongate slightly with age although the free vs attached appearance of earlobes is often presented as an example of a simple one gene - two alleles mendelian trait in humans earlobes do not all fall neatly into either category there is a continuous range from one extreme to the other suggesting the influence of several genes
==== distribution of recessive phenotype (attached ear lobe) ====
= relative frequency of recessive alleles =  = relative frequency of dominant alleles
== clinical significance ==
earlobes are normally smooth but occasionally exhibit creases creased earlobes are sometimes associated with genetic disorders in children including beckwith-wiedemann syndrome in some early studies earlobe creases were thought to be associated with an increased risk of heart attack and coronary heart disease however more recent studies have concluded that since earlobes become more creased with age and older people are more likely to experience heart disease than younger people age may account for the findings linking heart attack to earlobe creases the earlobe crease is also called frank's sign
== society and culture ==
=== earlobe piercing and stretching ===
piercing the earlobes is a commonplace activity in many cultures in many historical eras no other location on the body is as commonly pierced consequently injury to the earlobe due to the weight of heavy earrings is also common some cultures practice earlobe stretching using piercing ornaments to stretch and enlarge the earlobes to accommodate plugs
=== negative effects of wearing earrings ===
some research has found that the most frequent complications connected with wearing earrings are
inflammation
keloids
loss of tissue by tearing and
mechanical division of earlobes
there was noticeable relationship between the piercing of young girls earlobes and following development of allergy in the view of professor ewa czarnobilska the manager of the research team the primary reason for the allergies connected to earrings is the presence of nickel which is a common component of the alloys used in jewelry production the symptom seen is generally eczema and is often misdiagnosed as a food allergy for instance to milk the specific mechanism in allergies caused by earrings is the contact of nickel ions with the lymphatic system
the study noted that children who simply stopped wearing earrings did not see the disappearance of the allergic symptoms the immune system remembers the presence of the nickel ions in the person's blood and lymph so the child can still react to
metal parts of wardrobe
dental braces
dental prosthesis
orthotics
meals cooked in pots with addition of nickel
margarine (nickel is a catalyst in hydrogenation of unsaturated fats)
coins
chocolate
nuts
leguminous vegetables
wine and
beer
research by allergists has found that in a sample of 428 pupils of ages 78 and 1617 years old
30% of the research population showed an allergy to nickel and
the allergy occurred in girls who had started wearing earrings in early childhood
other symptoms of allergy to nickel are recurring infections asthma attacks and chronic larynxis
