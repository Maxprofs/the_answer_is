the workweek and weekend are those complementary parts of the week devoted to labour and rest respectively the legal working week (british english) or workweek (u.s english) is the part of the seven-day week devoted to labour in most western countries it is monday to friday the weekend is a time period including saturday and sunday a weekday is any day of the working week as well as places of work other institutions often follow the same days such as places of education
some people extend the weekend to friday nights as well in some christian traditions sunday is the lord's day and the day of rest and worship jewish shabbat or biblical sabbath lasts from sunset on friday to the fall of full darkness on saturday leading to a fridaysaturday weekend in israel some muslim-majority countries historically had a thursdayfriday or fridaysaturday weekend however recently many such countries have shifted from thursdayfriday to fridaysaturday or to saturdaysunday the french revolutionary calendar had ten-day weeks (called dcades) and allowed dcadi one out of the ten days as a leisure day
the present-day concept of the weekend first arose from the jewish sabbath the christian sabbath was just one day each week but the preceding day (the jewish sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century this shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week following changes in employer expectations proposals have continued to be put forward for further reductions in the number of days or hours worked per week on the basis of predicted social and economic benefits
== historyedit ==
in cultures with a six-day workweek the day of rest derives from the culture's main religious tradition friday (muslim) saturday (jewish and seventh-day adventist) and sunday (most christian) however numerous countries have adopted a two-day weekend over the past several decades i.e either thursdayfriday fridaysaturday or saturdaysunday
in 1908 the first five-day workweek in the united states was instituted by a new england cotton mill to afford jewish workers the ability to adhere to the sabbath
in 1926 henry ford began shutting down his automotive factories for all of saturday and sunday
in 1929 the amalgamated clothing workers of america union was the first union to demand a five-day workweek and receive it
after that the rest of the united states slowly followed but it was not until 1940 when a provision of the 1938 fair labor standards act mandating a maximum 40 hour workweek went into effect that the two-day weekend was adopted nationwide
over the succeeding decades particularly in the 1940s 1950s and 1960s an increasing number of countries adopted either a fridaysaturday or saturdaysunday weekend to harmonize with international markets a series of workweek reforms in the mid-to-late 2000s and early 2010s brought much of the arab world in synchronization with the majority of countries around the world in terms of working hours the length of the workweek and the days of the weekend
== reformedit ==
actual workweek lengths have been falling in the developed world every reduction of the length of the workweek has been accompanied by an increase in real per-capita income
in the united states the workweek length reduced slowly from before the civil war to the turn of the 20th century a rapid reduction took place from 1900 to 1920 especially between 1913 and 1919 when weekly hours fell by about eight percent in 1926 henry ford standardized on a five-day workweek instead of the prevalent six days without reducing employees pay hours worked stabilized at about 49 per week during the 1920s and during the great depression fell below 40 during the depression president herbert hoover called for a reduction in work hours in lieu of layoffs later president franklin roosevelt signed the fair labor standards act of 1938 which established a five-day 40-hour workweek for many workers the proportion of people working very long weeks has since risen and the full-time employment of women has increased dramatically
the new economics foundation has recommended moving to a 21-hour standard workweek to address problems with unemployment high carbon emissions low well-being entrenched inequalities overworking family care and the general lack of free time the center for economic and policy research states that reducing the length of the work week would slow climate change and have other environmental benefits
