principle original horizontality states layers sediment originally deposited horizontally action gravity relative dating technique principle important analysis folded tilted strata first proposed danish geological pioneer nicholas steno
observations derived conclusion earth static great forces work long periods time leading conclusions science plate tectonics movement collisions large plates earths crust cause folded strata
one stenos laws principle original horizontality served well nascent days geological science however known sedimentary layers deposited purely horizontally instance coarser grained sediments sand may deposited angles degrees held internal friction grains prevents slumping lower angle without additional reworking effort known angle repose prime example surface sand dunes
similarly sediments may drape preexisting inclined surface sediments usually deposited conformably preexisting surface also sedimentary beds may pinch along strike implying slight angles existed deposition thus principle original horizontality widely universally applicable study sedimentology stratigraphy structural geology
