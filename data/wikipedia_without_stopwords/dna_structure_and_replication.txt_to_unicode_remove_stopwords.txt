thymine amn thy one four nucleobases nucleic acid dna represented letters gcat others adenine guanine cytosine thymine also known methyluracil pyrimidine nucleobase rna thymine replaced nucleobase uracil thymine first isolated calves thymus glands albrecht kossel albert neumann
derivation
name suggests thymine may derived methylation uracil th carbon rna thymine replaced uracil cases dna thymine binds adenine via two hydrogen bonds thus stabilizing nucleic acid structures
thymine combined deoxyribose creates nucleoside deoxythymidine synonymous term thymidine thymidine phosphorylated one two three phosphoric acid groups creating respectively tmp tdp ttp thymidine mono di triphosphate
one common mutations dna involves two adjacent thymines cytosine presence ultraviolet light may form thymine dimers causing kinks dna molecule inhibit normal function
thymine could also target actions fluorouracil fu cancer treatment fu metabolic analog thymine dna synthesis uracil rna synthesis substitution analog inhibits dna synthesis actively dividing cells
thymine bases frequently oxidized hydantoins time death organism
thymine nuclear base
theoretical aspects
march nasa scientists reported first time complex dna rna organic compounds life including uracil cytosine thymine formed laboratory outer space conditions using starting chemicals pyrimidine found meteorites pyrimidine like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs carbonrich chemical found universe may formed red giants interstellar dust gas clouds according scientists
