aluminium (or aluminum see different endings) is a chemical element in the boron group with symbol al and atomic number 13 it is a silvery-white soft nonmagnetic ductile metal aluminium is the third most abundant element (after oxygen and silicon) and the most abundant metal in the earth's crust it makes up about 8% by mass of the crust though it is less common in the mantle below aluminium metal is so chemically reactive that native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments instead it is found combined in over 270 different minerals the chief ore of aluminium is bauxite
aluminium is remarkable for the metal's low density and for its ability to resist corrosion due to the phenomenon of passivation structural components made from aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and are important in other areas of transportation and structural materials such as building facades and window frames the most useful compounds of aluminium at least on a weight basis are the oxides and sulfates
despite its prevalence in the environment no known form of life uses aluminium salts metabolically in keeping with its pervasiveness aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals owing to their prevalence potential beneficial (or otherwise) biological roles of aluminium compounds are of continuing interest
== characteristics ==
=== physical ===
aluminium is a relatively soft durable lightweight ductile and malleable metal with appearance ranging from silvery to dull gray depending on the surface roughness it is nonmagnetic and does not easily ignite a fresh film of aluminium serves as a good reflector (approximately 92%) of visible light and an excellent reflector (as much as 98%) of medium and far infrared radiation the yield strength of pure aluminium is 711 mpa while aluminium alloys have yield strengths ranging from 200 mpa to 600 mpa aluminium has about one-third the density and stiffness of steel it is easily machined cast drawn and extruded
aluminium atoms are arranged in a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure aluminium has a stacking-fault energy of approximately 200 mj/m2
aluminium is a good thermal and electrical conductor having 59% the conductivity of copper both thermal and electrical while having only 30% of copper's density aluminium is capable of being a superconductor with a superconducting critical temperature of 1.2 kelvin and a critical magnetic field of about 100 gauss (10 milliteslas)
=== chemical ===
corrosion resistance can be excellent due to a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide that forms when the metal is exposed to air effectively preventing further oxidation the strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to galvanic reactions with alloyed copper this corrosion resistance is also often greatly reduced by aqueous salts particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals
in highly acidic solutions aluminium reacts with water to form hydrogen and in highly alkaline ones to form aluminates protective passivation under these conditions is negligible also chlorides such as common sodium chloride are well-known sources of corrosion of aluminium and are among the chief reasons that household plumbing is never made from this metal
however owing to its resistance to corrosion generally aluminium is one of the few metals that retain silvery reflectance in finely powdered form making it an important component of silver-colored paints aluminium mirror finish has the highest reflectance of any metal in the 200400 nm (uv) and the 3,00010,000 nm (far ir) regions in the 400700 nm visible range it is slightly outperformed by tin and silver and in the 7003000 (near ir) by silver gold and copper
aluminium is oxidized by water at temperatures below 280 c to produce hydrogen aluminium hydroxide and heat
2 al + 6 h2o 2 al(oh)3 + 3 h2
this conversion is of interest for the production of hydrogen challenges include circumventing the formed oxide layer which inhibits the reaction and the expenses associated with the storage of energy by regeneration of the al metal
=== isotopes ===
aluminium has many known isotopes whose mass numbers range from 21 to 42 however only 27al (stable isotope) and 26al (radioactive isotope t12 = 7.2105 y) occur naturally 27al has a natural abundance above 99.9% 26al is produced from argon in the atmosphere by spallation caused by cosmic-ray protons aluminium isotopes have found practical application in dating marine sediments manganese nodules glacial ice quartz in rock exposures and meteorites the ratio of 26al to 10be has been used to study the role of transport deposition sediment storage burial times and erosion on 105 to 106 year time scales cosmogenic 26al was first applied in studies of the moon and meteorites meteoroid fragments after departure from their parent bodies are exposed to intense cosmic-ray bombardment during their travel through space causing substantial 26al production after falling to earth atmospheric shielding drastically reduces 26al production and its decay can then be used to determine the meteorite's terrestrial age meteorite research has also shown that 26al was relatively abundant at the time of formation of our planetary system most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of 26al was responsible for the melting and differentiation of some asteroids after their formation 4.55 billion years ago
=== natural occurrence ===
stable aluminium is created when hydrogen fuses with magnesium either in large stars or in supernovae it is estimated to be the 14th most common element in the universe by mass-fraction however among the elements that have odd atomic numbers aluminium is the third most abundant by mass fraction after hydrogen and nitrogen
in the earth's crust aluminium is the most abundant (8.3% by mass) metallic element and the third most abundant of all elements (after oxygen and silicon) the earth's crust has a higher prevalence of aluminium than the rest of the planet due to aluminium silicates in the crust in the earths mantle which is only 2% aluminium by mass these aluminium silicate minerals are largely replaced by silica and magnesium oxides overall the earth is about 1.4% aluminium by mass (eighth in abundance by mass) in the earth as a whole aluminium gains in abundance as compared with the solar system and universe due to earth's loss of a number of elements which are common in the universe but which are volatiles at the earth's distance from the sun (hydrogen helium neon nitrogen carbon as hydrocarbon)
because of its strong affinity for oxygen aluminium is almost never found in the elemental state instead it is found in oxides or silicates feldspars the most common group of minerals in the earth's crust are aluminosilicates native aluminium metal can only be found as a minor phase in low oxygen fugacity environments such as the interiors of certain volcanoes native aluminium has been reported in cold seeps in the northeastern continental slope of the south china sea chen et al (2011) have proposed a theory of its origin as resulting by reduction from tetrahydroxoaluminate al(oh)4 to metallic aluminium by bacteria
it also occurs in the minerals beryl cryolite garnet spinel and turquoise impurities in al2o3 such as chromium or iron yield the gemstones ruby and sapphire respectively
although aluminium is an extremely common and widespread element the common aluminium minerals are not economic sources of the metal almost all metallic aluminium is produced from the ore bauxite (alox(oh)32x) bauxite occurs as a weathering product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic conditions large deposits of bauxite occur in australia brazil guinea and jamaica and the primary mining areas for the ore are in australia brazil china india guinea indonesia jamaica russia and suriname
== production and refinement ==
bauxite is converted to aluminium oxide (al2o3) via the bayer process relevant chemical equations are
al2o3 + 2 naoh 2 naalo2 + h2o
2 h2o + naalo2 al(oh)3 + naoh
the intermediate sodium aluminate given the simplified formula naalo2 is soluble in strongly alkaline water and the other components of the ore are not depending on the quality of the bauxite ore twice as much waste ("red mud") as alumina is generated
the conversion of alumina to aluminium metal is achieved by the hall-hroult process in this energy-intensive process a solution of alumina in a molten (950 and 980 c (1,740 and 1,800 f)) mixture of cryolite (na3alf6) with calcium fluoride is electrolyzed to give the metal
al3+ + 3 e al(l)
at the anode oxygen is formed
2 o2 + c co2(g) + 4 e
the liquid aluminium metal then sinks to the bottom of the solution and is tapped off usually cast into large blocks called aluminium billets for further processing the carbon anode is consumed by reaction with oxide to form carbon dioxide gas a small quantity of fluoride compounds flow with this gas in modern smelters this hot carbon dioxide gas is filtered through alumina to remove fluorine compounds and return fluorine as aluminium fluoride to the electrolytic cells the anodes in a reduction cell must therefore be replaced regularly since they are consumed in the process the cathodes do erode mainly due to electrochemical processes and liquid metal movement induced by intense electrolytic currents after five to ten years depending on the current used in the electrolysis a cell must be rebuilt because of cathode wear
aluminium electrolysis with the hall-hroult process consumes a lot of energy the worldwide average specific energy consumption is approximately 150.5 kilowatt-hours per kilogram of aluminium produced (52 to 56 mj/kg) the most modern smelters achieve approximately 12.8 kwh/kg (46.1 mj/kg) (compare this to the heat of reaction 31 mj/kg and the gibbs free energy of reaction 29 mj/kg.) reduction line currents for older technologies are typically 100 to 200 kiloamperes state-of-the-art smelters operate at about 350 ka trials have been reported with 500 ka cells
the hall-heroult process produces aluminium with a purity of above 99% further purification can be done by the hoopes process the process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium barium and aluminium fluoride electrolyte the resulting aluminium has a purity of 99.99%
electric power represents about 20% to 40% of the cost of producing aluminium depending on the location of the smelter aluminium production consumes roughly 5% of electricity generated in the u.s aluminium producers tend to locate smelters in places where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensivesuch as the united arab emirates with its large natural gas supplies and iceland and norway with energy generated from renewable sources the world's largest smelters of alumina are located in the people's republic of china russia and the provinces of quebec and british columbia in canada
in 2005 the people's republic of china was the top producer of aluminium with almost a one-fifth world share followed by russia canada and the us reports the british geological survey
over the last 50 years australia has become the world's top producer of bauxite ore and a major producer and exporter of alumina (before being overtaken by china in 2007) australia produced 77 million tonnes of bauxite in 2013 the australian deposits have some refining problems some being high in silica but have the advantage of being shallow and relatively easy to mine
=== recycling ===
aluminium is theoretically 100% recyclable without any loss of its natural qualities according to the international resource panel's metal stocks in society report the global per capita stock of aluminium in use in society (i.e in cars buildings electronics etc.) is 80 kg (180 lb) much of this is in more-developed countries (350500 kg (7701,100 lb) per capita) rather than less-developed countries (35 kg (77 lb) per capita) knowing the per capita stocks and their approximate lifespans is important for planning recycling
recovery of the metal via recycling has become an important use of the aluminium industry recycling was a low-profile activity until the late 1960s when the growing use of aluminium beverage cans brought it to the public awareness
recycling involves melting the scrap a process that requires only 5% of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore though a significant part (up to 15% of the input material) is lost as dross (ash-like oxide) an aluminium stack melter produces significantly less dross with values reported below 1% the dross can undergo a further process to extract aluminium
in europe aluminium experiences high rates of recycling ranging from 42% of beverage cans 85% of construction materials and 95% of transport vehicles
recycled aluminium is known as secondary aluminium but maintains the same physical properties as primary aluminium secondary aluminium is produced in a wide range of formats and is employed in 80% of alloy injections another important use is for extrusion
white dross from primary aluminium production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be extracted industrially the process produces aluminium billets together with a highly complex waste material this waste is difficult to manage it reacts with water releasing a mixture of gases (including among others hydrogen acetylene and ammonia) which spontaneously ignites on contact with air contact with damp air results in the release of copious quantities of ammonia gas despite these difficulties the waste has found use as a filler in asphalt and concrete
== compounds ==
=== oxidation state +3 ===
the vast majority of compounds including all al-containing minerals and all commercially significant aluminium compounds feature aluminium in the oxidation state 3+ the coordination number of such compounds varies but generally al3+ is six-coordinate or tetracoordinate almost all compounds of aluminium(iii) are colorless
==== halides ====
all four trihalides are well known unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides aluminium fluoride (alf3) features six-coordinate al the octahedral coordination environment for alf3 is related to the compactness of fluoride ion six of which can fit around the small al3+ center alf3 sublimes (with cracking) at 1,291 c (2,356 f) with heavier halides the coordination numbers are lower the other trihalides are dimeric or polymeric with tetrahedral al centers these materials are prepared by treating aluminium metal with the halogen although other methods exist acidification of the oxides or hydroxides affords hydrates in aqueous solution the halides often form mixtures generally containing six-coordinate al centers which are feature both halide and aquo ligands when aluminium and fluoride are together in aqueous solution they readily form complex ions such as [alf(h
2o)
5]2+ alf
3(h
2o)
3 and [alf
6]3 in the case of chloride polyaluminium clusters are formed such as [al13o4(oh)24(h2o)12]7+
==== oxide and hydroxides ====
aluminium forms one stable oxide known by its mineral name corundum sapphire and ruby are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals the two oxide-hydroxides alo(oh) are boehmite and diaspore there are three trihydroxides bayerite gibbsite and nordstrandite which differ in their crystalline structure (polymorphs) most are produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base heating the hydroxides leads to formation of corundum these materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful
==== carbide nitride and related materials ====
aluminium carbide (al4c3) is made by heating a mixture of the elements above 1,000 c (1,832 f) the pale yellow crystals consist of tetrahedral aluminium centers it reacts with water or dilute acids to give methane the acetylide al2(c2)3 is made by passing acetylene over heated aluminium
aluminium nitride (aln) is the only nitride known for aluminium unlike the oxides it features tetrahedral al centers it can be made from the elements at 800 c (1,472 f) it is air-stable material with a usefully high thermal conductivity aluminium phosphide (alp) is made similarly and hydrolyses to give phosphine
alp + 3 h2o al(oh)3 + ph3
=== organoaluminium compounds and related hydrides ===
a variety of compounds of empirical formula alr3 and alr1.5cl1.5 exist these species usually feature tetrahedral al centers e.g trimethylaluminium has the formula al2(ch3)6 (see figure) with large organic groups triorganoaluminium exist as three-coordinate monomers such as triisobutylaluminium such compounds are widely used in industrial chemistry despite the fact that they are often highly pyrophoric few analogues exist between organoaluminium and organoboron compounds except for large organic groups
the important aluminium hydride is lithium aluminium hydride (lialh4) which is used in as a reducing agent in organic chemistry it can be produced from lithium hydride and aluminium trichloride
4 lih + alcl3 lialh4 + 3 licl
several useful derivatives of lialh4 are known e.g sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)dihydridoaluminate the simplest hydride aluminium hydride or alane remains a laboratory curiosity it is a polymer with the formula (alh3)n in contrast to the corresponding boron hydride with the formula (bh3)2
=== oxidation states +1 and +2 ===
although the great majority of aluminium compounds feature al3+ centers compounds with lower oxidation states are known and sometime of significance as precursors to the al3+ species
==== aluminium(i) ====
alf alcl and albr exist in the gaseous phase when the trihalide is heated with aluminium the composition ali is unstable at room temperature with respect to the triiodide
3 ali ali3 + 2 al
a stable derivative of aluminium monoiodide is the cyclic adduct formed with triethylamine al4i4(net3)4 also of theoretical interest but only of fleeting existence are al2o and al2s al2o is made by heating the normal oxide al2o3 with silicon at 1,800 c (3,272 f) in a vacuum such materials quickly disproportionates to the starting materials
==== aluminium(ii) ====
very simple al(ii) compounds are invoked or observed in the reactions of al metal with oxidants for example aluminium monoxide alo has been detected in the gas phase after explosion and in stellar absorption spectra more thoroughly investigated are compounds of the formula r4al2 which contain an al-al bond and where r is a large organic ligand
=== analysis ===
the presence of aluminium can be detected in qualitative analysis using aluminon
== applications ==
=== general use ===
aluminium is the most widely used non-ferrous metal global production of aluminium in 2005 was 31.9 million tonnes it exceeded that of any other metal except iron (837.5 million tonnes) forecast for 2012 is 4245 million tonnes driven by rising chinese output
aluminium is almost always alloyed which markedly improves its mechanical properties especially when tempered for example the common aluminium foils and beverage cans are alloys of 92% to 99% aluminium the main alloying agents are copper zinc magnesium manganese and silicon (e.g. duralumin) and the levels of these other metals are in the range of a few percent by weight
some of the many uses for aluminium metal are in
transportation (automobiles aircraft trucks railway cars marine vessels bicycles spacecraft etc.) as sheet tube castings etc
packaging (cans foil frame of etc.)
construction (windows doors siding building wire etc.)
a wide range of household items from cooking utensils to baseball bats watches
street lighting poles sailing ship masts walking poles etc
outer shells of consumer electronics also cases for equipment e.g photographic equipment macbook pro's casing
electrical transmission lines for power distribution ("creep and oxidation are not issues in this application as the terminations are usually multi-sided crimps which enclose all sides of the conductor with a gas-tight seal)
mkm steel and alnico magnets
super purity aluminium (spa 99.980% to 99.999% al) used in electronics and cds and also in wires/cabling
heat sinks for electronic appliances such as transistors and cpus
substrate material of metal-core copper clad laminates used in high brightness led lighting
powdered aluminium is used in paint and in pyrotechnics such as solid rocket fuels and thermite
aluminium reacts with hydrochloric acid or with sodium hydroxide to produce hydrogen gas
aluminium is used to make food containers because of its resistance to corrosion
aluminium with magnesium [alloy] is used to make body of aircraft
aluminium with other metals used to make railway tracks
aluminium is used to make cooking utensils because it is resistant to corrosion and light-weight
a variety of countries including france italy poland finland romania israel and the former yugoslavia have issued coins struck in aluminium or aluminium-copper alloys
some guitar models sport aluminium diamond plates on the surface of the instruments usually either chrome or black kramer guitars and travis bean are both known for having produced guitars with necks made of aluminium which gives the instrument a very distinctive sound
aluminium is usually alloyed it is used as pure metal only when corrosion resistance and/or workability is more important than strength or hardness aluminium-based alloys abruptly increase their strength characteristics with small additions of scandium as well as zirconium and hafnium a thin layer of aluminium can be deposited onto a flat surface by physical vapor deposition or (very infrequently) chemical vapor deposition or other chemical means to form optical coatings and mirrors
=== aluminium compounds ===
because aluminium is abundant and most of its derivatives exhibit low toxicity the compounds of aluminium enjoy wide and sometimes large-scale applications
==== alumina ====
aluminium oxide (al2o3) and the associated oxy-hydroxides and trihydroxides are produced or extracted from minerals on a large scale the great majority of this material is converted to metallic aluminium in 2013 about 10% of the domestic shipments in the united states were used for other applications a major use is as an absorbent for example alumina removes water from hydrocarbons which enables subsequent processes that are poisoned by moisture aluminium oxides are common catalysts for industrial processes e.g the claus process for converting hydrogen sulfide to sulfur in refineries and for the alkylation of amines many industrial catalysts are supported meaning generally that an expensive catalyst (e.g. platinum) is dispersed over a high surface area material such as alumina being a very hard material (mohs hardness 9) alumina is widely used as an abrasive and the production of applications that exploit its inertness e.g. in high pressure sodium lamps
==== sulfates ====
several sulfates of aluminium find applications aluminium sulfate (al2(so4)3(h2o)18) is produced on the annual scale of several billions of kilograms about half of the production is consumed in water treatment the next major application is in the manufacture of paper it is also used as a mordant in fire extinguishers as a food additive (e number e173) in fireproofing and in leather tanning aluminium ammonium sulfate which is also called ammonium alum (nh4)al(so4)212h2o is used as a mordant and in leather tanning aluminium potassium sulfate ([al(k)](so4)2)(h2o)12 is used similarly the consumption of both alums is declining
==== chlorides ====
aluminium chloride (alcl3) is used in petroleum refining and in the production of synthetic rubber and polymers although it has a similar name aluminium chlorohydrate has fewer and very different applications e.g as a hardening agent and an antiperspirant it is an intermediate in the production of aluminium metal
==== niche compounds ====
the many aluminium compounds with niche applications include aluminium acetate a salt used in solution as an astringent aluminium borate (al2o3b2o3) and aluminium fluorosilicate (al2(sif6)3) which are used in the production of glass and ceramics and synthetic gemstones and aluminium phosphate (alpo4) used in the manufacture of glass ceramic pulp and paper products cosmetics paints and varnishes and in making dental cement aluminium hydroxide (al(oh)3) is used as an antacid as a mordant in water purification in the manufacture of glass and ceramic and in the waterproofing of fabrics lithium aluminium hydride is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry organoaluminiums are used as lewis acids and cocatalysts for example methylaluminoxane is a cocatalyst for ziegler-natta olefin polymerization to produce vinyl polymers such as polyethene aqueous aluminium ions (such as found in aqueous aluminium sulfate) are used to treat against fish parasites such as gyrodactylus salaris in many vaccines certain aluminium salts serve as an immune adjuvant (immune response booster) to allow the protein in the vaccine to achieve sufficient potency as an immune stimulant
=== aluminium alloys in structural applications ===
aluminium alloys with a wide range of properties are used in engineering structures alloy systems are classified by a number system (ansi) or by names indicating their main alloying constituents (din and iso)
the strength and durability of aluminium alloys vary widely not only as a result of the components of the specific alloy but also as a result of heat treatments and manufacturing processes a lack of knowledge of these aspects has from time to time led to improperly designed structures and gained aluminium a bad reputation
one important structural limitation of aluminium alloys is their fatigue strength unlike steels aluminium alloys have no well-defined fatigue limit meaning that fatigue failure eventually occurs under even very small cyclic loadings this implies that engineers must assess these loads and design for a fixed life rather than an infinite life
another important property of aluminium alloys is their sensitivity to heat workshop procedures involving heating are complicated by the fact that aluminium unlike steel melts without first glowing red forming operations where a blow torch is used therefore require some expertise since no visual signs reveal how close the material is to melting aluminium alloys like all structural alloys also are subject to internal stresses following heating operations such as welding and casting the problem with aluminium alloys in this regard is their low melting point which make them more susceptible to distortions from thermally induced stress relief controlled stress relief can be done during manufacturing by heat-treating the parts in an oven followed by gradual coolingin effect annealing the stresses
the low melting point of aluminium alloys has not precluded their use in rocketry even for use in constructing combustion chambers where gases can reach 3500 k the agena upper stage engine used a regeneratively cooled aluminium design for some parts of the nozzle including the thermally critical throat region
another alloy of some value is aluminium bronze (cu-al alloy)
== history ==
ancient greeks and romans used aluminium salts as dyeing mordants and as astringents for dressing wounds alum is still used as a styptic in 1761 guyton de morveau suggested calling the base alum alumine in 1808 humphry davy identified the existence of a metal base of alum which he at first termed alumium and later aluminum (see etymology section below)
the metal was first produced in 1825 in an impure form by danish physicist and chemist hans christian rsted he reacted anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium amalgam yielding a lump of metal looking similar to tin friedrich whler was aware of these experiments and cited them but after redoing the experiments of rsted he concluded that this metal was pure potassium he conducted a similar experiment in 1827 by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium and yielded aluminium whler is generally credited with isolating aluminium (latin alumen alum) further pierre berthier discovered aluminium in bauxite ore henri etienne sainte-claire deville improved whler's method in 1846 as described in his 1859 book aluminium trichloride could be reduced by sodium which was more convenient and less expensive than potassium used by whler in the mid-1880s aluminium metal was exceedingly difficult to produce which made pure aluminium more valuable than gold so celebrated was the metal that bars of aluminium were exhibited at the exposition universelle of 1855 napoleon iii of france is reputed to have held a banquet where the most honored guests were given aluminium utensils while the others made do with gold
aluminium was selected as the material to use for the 100 ounces (2.8 kg) capstone of the washington monument in 1884 a time when one ounce (30 grams) cost the daily wage of a common worker on the project (in 1884 about $1 for 10 hours of labor today a construction worker in the us working on such a project might earn $25$35 per hour and therefore around $300 in an equivalent single 10-hour day) the capstone which was set in place on 6 december 1884 in an elaborate dedication ceremony was the largest single piece of aluminium cast at the time
the cowles companies supplied aluminium alloy in quantity in the united states and england using smelters like the furnace of carl wilhelm siemens by 1886
=== hall-heroult process availability of cheap aluminium metal ===
charles martin hall of ohio in the u.s and paul hroult of france independently developed the hall-hroult electrolytic process that facilitated large-scale production of metallic aluminium this process remains in use today in 1888 with the financial backing of alfred e hunt the pittsburgh reduction company started today it is known as alcoa hroult's process was in production by 1889 in switzerland at aluminium industrie now alcan and at british aluminium now luxfer group and alcoa by 1896 in scotland
by 1895 the metal was being used as a building material as far away as sydney australia in the dome of the chief secretary's building
with the explosive expansion of the airplane industry during world war i (19141917) major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light strong airframes they often subsidized factories and the necessary electrical supply systems
many navies have used an aluminium superstructure for their vessels the 1975 fire aboard uss belknap that gutted her aluminium superstructure as well as observation of battle damage to british ships during the falklands war led to many navies switching to all steel superstructures
aluminium wire was once widely used for domestic electrical wiring (feeders and branch circuits) owing to creep and corrosion-induced failures a number of fires resulted however aluminum is still employed for services where special terminations are provided
== etymology ==
the various names all derive from its status as a base of alum it is borrowed from old french its ultimate source alumen in turn is a latin word that literally means bitter salt
two variants of the metal's name are in current use aluminium (pronunciation /ljmnim/) and aluminum (/lumnm/)besides the obsolete alumium the international union of pure and applied chemistry (iupac) adopted aluminium as the standard international name for the element in 1990 but three years later recognized aluminum as an acceptable variant hence their periodic table includes both iupac internal publications use either spelling in nearly the same number
=== different endings ===
most countries use the ending -ium for aluminium in the united states and canada the ending -um predominates the canadian oxford dictionary prefers aluminum whereas the australian macquarie dictionary prefers aluminium in 1926 the american chemical society officially decided to use aluminum in its publications american dictionaries typically label the spelling aluminium as chiefly british the earliest citation given in the oxford english dictionary for any word used as a name for this element is alumium which british chemist and inventor humphry davy employed in 1808 for the metal he was trying to isolate electrolytically from the mineral alumina the citation is from the journal philosophical transactions of the royal society of london had i been so fortunate as to have obtained more certain evidences on this subject and to have procured the metallic substances i was in search of i should have proposed for them the names of silicium alumium zirconium and glucium.
davy settled on aluminum by the time he published his 1812 book chemical philosophy this substance appears to contain a peculiar metal but as yet aluminum has not been obtained in a perfectly free state though alloys of it with other metalline substances have been procured sufficiently distinct to indicate the probable nature of alumina. but the same year an anonymous contributor to the quarterly review a british political-literary journal in a review of davy's book objected to aluminum and proposed the name aluminium for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word in preference to aluminum which has a less classical sound.
the -ium suffix conformed to the precedent set in other newly discovered elements of the time potassium sodium magnesium calcium and strontium (all of which davy isolated himself) nevertheless -um spellings for elements were not unknown at the time as for example platinum known to europeans since the 16th century molybdenum discovered in 1778 and tantalum discovered in 1802 the -um suffix is consistent with the universal spelling alumina for the oxide (as opposed to aluminia) as lanthana is the oxide of lanthanum and magnesia ceria and thoria are the oxides of magnesium cerium and thorium respectively
the aluminum spelling is used in the webster's dictionary of 1828 in his advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal in 1892 charles martin hall used the -um spelling despite his constant use of the -ium spelling in all the patents he filed between 1886 and 1903 hall's domination of production of the metal ensured that aluminum became the standard english spelling in north america
== biology ==
despite its widespread occurrence in nature aluminium has no known function in biology aluminium salts are remarkably nontoxic aluminium sulfate having an ld50 of 6207 mg/kg (oral mouse) which corresponds to 500 grams for an 80 kg (180 lb) person the extremely low acute toxicity notwithstanding the health effects of aluminium are of interest in view of the widespread occurrence of the element in the environment and in commerce
== health concerns ==
some toxicity can be traced to deposition in bone and the central nervous system which is particularly increased in patients with reduced renal function because aluminium competes with calcium for absorption increased amounts of dietary aluminium may contribute to the reduced skeletal mineralization (osteopenia) observed in preterm infants and infants with growth retardation in very high doses aluminium is associated with altered function of the bloodbrain barrier a small percentage of people are allergic to aluminium and experience contact dermatitis digestive disorders vomiting or other symptoms upon contact or ingestion of products containing aluminium such as antiperspirants and antacids in those without allergies aluminium is not as toxic as heavy metals but there is evidence of some toxicity if it is consumed in amounts greater than 40 mg/day per kg of body mass although the use of aluminium cookware has not been shown to lead to aluminium toxicity in general excessive consumption of antacids containing aluminium compounds and excessive use of aluminium-containing antiperspirants provide more significant exposure levels studies have shown that consumption of acidic foods or liquids with aluminium significantly increases aluminium absorption and maltol has been shown to increase the accumulation of aluminium in nervous and osseous tissue furthermore aluminium increases estrogen-related gene expression in human breast cancer cells cultured in the laboratory the estrogen-like effects of these salts have led to their classification as a metalloestrogen
the effects of aluminium in antiperspirants have been examined over the course of decades with little evidence of skin irritation nonetheless its occurrence in antiperspirants dyes (such as aluminium lake) and food additives has caused concern although there is little evidence that normal exposure to aluminium presents a risk to healthy adults some studies point to risks associated with increased exposure to the metal aluminium in food may be absorbed more than aluminium from water it is classified as a non-carcinogen by the us department of health and human services
in case of suspected sudden intake of a large amount of aluminium deferoxamine mesylate may be given to help eliminate it from the body by chelation
=== occupational safety ===
exposure to powdered aluminium or aluminium welding fumes can cause pulmonary fibrosis the united states occupational safety and health administration (osha) has set a permissible exposure limit of 15 mg/m3 time weighted average (twa) for total exposure and 5 mg/m3 twa for respiratory exposure the us national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh) recommended exposure limit is the same for respiratory exposure but is 10 mg/m3 for total exposure and 5 mg/m3 for fumes and powder fine aluminium powder can ignite or explode posing another workplace hazard
=== alzheimer's disease ===
aluminium has controversially been implicated as a factor in alzheimer's disease according to the alzheimer's society the medical and scientific opinion is that studies have not convincingly demonstrated a causal relationship between aluminium and alzheimer's disease nevertheless some studies such as those on the paquid cohort cite aluminium exposure as a risk factor for alzheimer's disease some brain plaques have been found to contain increased levels of the metal research in this area has been inconclusive aluminium accumulation may be a consequence of the disease rather than a causal agent
== effect on plants ==
aluminium is primary among the factors that reduce plant growth on acid soils although it is generally harmless to plant growth in ph-neutral soils the concentration in acid soils of toxic al3+ cations increases and disturbs root growth and function
most acid soils are saturated with aluminium rather than hydrogen ions the acidity of the soil is therefore a result of hydrolysis of aluminium compounds this concept of corrected lime potential to define the degree of base saturation in soils became the basis for procedures now used in soil testing laboratories to determine the lime requirement of soils
wheat's adaptation to allow aluminium tolerance is such that the aluminium induces a release of organic compounds that bind to the harmful aluminium cations sorghum is believed to have the same tolerance mechanism the first gene for aluminium tolerance has been identified in wheat it was shown that sorghum's aluminium tolerance is controlled by a single gene as for wheat this is not the case in all plants

a spanish scientific report from 2001 claimed that the fungus geotrichum candidum consumes the aluminium in compact discs however other reports on it always refer back to the 2001 spanish report and there is no supporting original research since that report better documented the bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fungus cladosporium resinae are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks using kerosene-based fuels (not av gas) and can degrade aluminium in cultures however this is not a matter of the bacteria or fungi directly attacking or consuming the aluminium but rather a result of the microbes waste having a corrosive nature
