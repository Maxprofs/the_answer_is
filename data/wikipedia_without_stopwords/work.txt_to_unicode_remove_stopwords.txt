recombinant dna rdna molecules dna molecules formed laboratory methods genetic recombination molecular cloning bring together genetic material multiple sources creating sequences would otherwise found genome recombinant dna possible dna molecules organisms share chemical structure differ nucleotide sequence within identical overall structure
introduction
recombinant dna general name piece dna created combination least two strands recombinant dna molecules sometimes called chimeric dna made material two different species like mythical chimera rdna technology uses palindromic sequences leads production sticky blunt ends
dna sequences used construction recombinant dna molecules originate species example plant dna may joined bacterial dna human dna may joined fungal dna addition dna sequences occur anywhere nature may created chemical synthesis dna incorporated recombinant molecules using recombinant dna technology synthetic dna literally dna sequence may created introduced wide range living organisms
proteins result expression recombinant dna within living cells termed recombinant proteins recombinant dna encoding protein introduced host organism recombinant protein necessarily produced expression foreign proteins requires use specialized expression vectors often necessitates significant restructure foreign coding sequence
recombinant dna differs genetic recombination former results artificial methods test tube latter normal biological process results remixing existing dna sequences essentially organisms
creating recombinant dna
molecular cloning laboratory process used create recombinant dna one two widely used methods along polymerase chain reaction pcr used direct replication specific dna sequence chosen experimentalist fundamental difference two methods molecular cloning involves replication dna within living cell pcr replicates dna test tube free living cells
formation recombinant dna requires cloning vector dna molecule replicates within living cell vectors generally derived plasmids viruses represent relatively small segments dna contain necessary genetic signals replication well additional elements convenience inserting foreign dna identifying cells contain recombinant dna appropriate expressing foreign dna choice vector molecular cloning depends choice host organism size dna cloned whether foreign dna expressed dna segments combined using variety methods restriction enzymeligase cloning gibson assembly
standard cloning protocols cloning dna fragment essentially involves seven steps choice host organism cloning vector preparation vector dna preparation dna cloned creation recombinant dna introduction recombinant dna host organism selection organisms containing recombinant dna screening clones desired dna inserts biological properties steps described detail related article molecular cloning
expression recombinant dna
following transplantation host organism foreign dna contained within recombinant dna construct may may expressed dna may simply replicated without expression may transcribed translated recombinant protein produced generally speaking expression foreign gene requires restructuring gene include sequences required producing mrna molecule used hosts translational apparatus eg promoter translational initiation signal transcriptional terminator specific changes host organism may made improve expression ectopic gene addition changes may needed coding sequences well optimize translation make protein soluble direct recombinant protein proper cellular extracellular location stabilize protein degradation
