an equator is the intersection of a sphere's surface with the plane perpendicular to the sphere's axis of rotation and midway between the poles the equator usually refers to the earth's equator an imaginary line on the earth's surface equidistant from the north pole and south pole dividing the earth into the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere other planets and astronomical bodies have equators similarly defined earth's equator is about 40,075 kilometres (24,901 mi) long 78.7% is across water and 21.3% is over land
== geodesy of the earth's equator ==
the latitude of the earth's equator is by definition 0 (zero degrees) the equator is one of the five notable circles of latitude on earth with the others being the two polar circles the arctic circle and the antarctic circle and the two tropical circles the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn the equator is the only line of latitude which is also a great circle the imaginary circle obtained when the earth's equator is projected onto the sky is called the celestial equator
in its seasonal apparent movement across the sky the sun passes over the equator twice each year at the march and september equinoxes at the moment of the equinox light rays from the center of the sun are perpendicular to the surface of the earth at the point on the equator experiencing solar noon
places on the equator experience the quickest sunrises and sunsets since the sun rises and sets almost vertically throughout the year the length of a day (sunrise to sunset) at the equator is almost constant during the year each day is about 14 minutes longer than night because of atmospheric refraction and the fact that sunrise/sunset is the moment when the edge of the sun's disk passes the horizon rather than its centre
the earth bulges slightly at the equator its average diameter is 12,750 kilometres (7,922 mi) but at the equator the diameter is about 43 kilometres (27 mi) greater than at the poles
locations near the equator are good sites for spaceports such as the guiana space centre in kourou french guiana as they are moving faster than other latitudes due to the earth's rotation and the added velocity reduces the fuel needed to launch spacecraft as the earth spins toward the east spacecraft must launch to the east southeast or northeast to take advantage of this
=== precise location ===
the equator like the tropics is not quite fixed the true equatorial plane is always perpendicular to the earth's spin axis this axis is fairly stable but its position drifts about 15 metres (49 ft) during a year and the equator shifts likewise
== equatorial seasons and climate ==
seasons result from the yearly revolution of the earth around the sun and the tilt of the earth's axis relative to the plane of revolution during the year the northern and southern hemispheres are inclined toward or away from the sun according to earth's position in its orbit the hemisphere inclined toward the sun receives more sunlight and is in summer while the other hemisphere receives less sun and is in winter (see solstice) at the equinoxes the earth's axis is not tilted toward the sun instead it is perpendicular to the sun meaning that the day is about 12 hours long as is the night across the whole of the earth
near the equator there is little distinction between summer winter autumn or spring the temperatures are usually high year-roundwith the exception of high mountains in south america and in africa (see andes mountains and mount kilimanjaro.) the temperature at the equator can plummet during rainstorms in many tropical regions people identify two seasons the wet season and the dry season but many places close to the equator are on the oceans or rainy throughout the year the seasons can vary depending on elevation and proximity to an ocean
the equator lies mostly on the three largest oceans the pacific ocean the atlantic ocean and the indian ocean the highest point on the equator is at the elevation of 4,690 metres (15,387 ft) at 000n 775931w found on the southern slopes of volcn cayambe [summit 5,790 metres (18,996 ft)] in ecuador this is slightly above the snow line and is the only place on the equator where snow lies on the ground at the equator the snow line is around 1,000 metres (3,280 ft) lower than on mount everest and as much as 2,000 metres (6,560 ft) lower than the highest snow line in the world near the tropic of capricorn on llullaillaco
== equatorial countries and territories ==
the equator traverses the land and/or territorial waters of 14 countries starting at the prime meridian and heading eastwards the equator passes through
despite its name no part of equatorial guinea's territory lies on the equator however its island of annobn is 155 kilometres (96 mi) south of the equator and the rest of the country lies to the north
== crossing the equator ==
certain navies such as the royal navy and the us navy have a tradition of holding ceremonies on board ship to mark sailors first crossing of the equator these rites of initiation have in the past been notorious for their brutality milder line-crossing ceremonies typically featuring king neptune are also held for passengers entertainment on some civilian ocean liners and cruise ships
== exact length ==
in two widely used geodetic standards the equator is modelled as a circle whose radius is a whole number of metres in 1976 the iau chose a radius of 6,378.140 kilometres (3,963.192 mi) later refined by the iugg to 6,378.137 kilometres (3,963.191 mi) and adopted in wgs-84 though the yet more recent iau-2000 has retained the old iau-1976 value if it were really circular the length of the equator would be exactly 2 times the radius namely 40,075.036 kilometres (24,901.473 mi) however due to the effect of tidal force on the earth's surface the actual circumference at the equator is 40,075.16 kilometres (24,901.55 mi)
the geographical mile is defined as one arc minute of the equator so it has different values depending on which radius is assumed e.g 1,855.3248 metres (6,087.024 ft) for wgs84 or 1,855.3257 metres (6,087.027 ft) for iau-2000
the earth is modelled commonly as a sphere flattened 0.336% along its axis this makes the equator 0.16% longer than a meridian (a great circle passing through the two poles) the iugg standard meridian is to the nearest millimetre 40,007.862917 kilometres (24,859.733480 mi) one arc minute of which is 1,852.216 metres (6,076.82 ft) explaining the si standardization of the nautical mile as 1,852 metres (6,076 ft) more than 3 metres (9.8 ft) less than the geographical mile
the sea-level surface of the earth (the geoid) is irregular so the actual length of the equator is not so easy to determine aviation week and space technology on 9 october 1961 reported that measurements using the transit iv-a satellite had shown the equatorial diameter from longitude 11 west to 169 east to be 1,000 feet (300 m) greater than its diameter ninety degrees away
== climate ==
lowlands around the equator generally have a tropical rainforest climate also known as an equatorial climate though cold currents cause some regions to have tropical monsoon climates with a dry season in the middle of the year usually average annual temperature is around 30 c (86 f) during the day and 23 c (73 f) at night rainfall is very high usually from 2,500 to 3,500 mm (98 to 138 in) per year average rainy days are around 200 per year and average annual sunshine hours around 2,000
