the joule (/dul/) symbol j is a derived unit of energy in the international system of units it is equal to the energy transferred (or work done) to an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre (1 newton metre or nm) it is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second it is named after the english physicist james prescott joule (18181889)
in terms firstly of base si units and then in terms of other si units
where kg is the kilogram m is the metre s is the second n is the newton pa is the pascal w is the watt c is the coulomb and v is the volt
one joule can also be defined as
the work required to move an electric charge of one coulomb through an electrical potential difference of one volt or one "coulomb volt (cv) this relationship can be used to define the volt
the work required to produce one watt of power for one second or one watt second (ws) (compare kilowatt hour - 3.6 megajoules) this relationship can be used to define the watt
== usageedit ==
this si unit is named after james prescott joule as with every international system of units (si) unit named for a person the first letter of its symbol is upper case (j) however when an si unit is spelled out in english it should always begin with a lower case letter (joule)except in a situation where any word in that position would be capitalized such as at the beginning of a sentence or in material using title case note that degree celsius conforms to this rule because the d is lowercase based on the international system of units section 5.2
== confusion with newton-metreedit ==
in angular mechanics torque is analogous to the linear newtonian mechanics parameter of force moment of inertia to mass and angle to distance energy is the same in both systems thus although the joule has the same dimensions as the newton-metre (1 j = 1 nm = 1 kgm2s2) these units are not interchangeable the cgpm has given the unit of energy the name joule but has not given the unit of torque any special name hence the unit of torque is known as the newton-metre (nm) - a compound name derived from its constituent parts torque and energy are related to each other using the equation
where e is the energy is the torque and is the angle moved (in radians) since radians are dimensionless it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensions
the use of newton-metres for torque and joules for energy is useful in helping avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications
an additional solution is to realize that joules are scalars they are the dot product of a vector force and a vector displacement whereas torque is a vector torque is the cross product of a distance vector and a force vector drawing a traditional vector arrow over newton-metre in a torque resolves the ambiguity
== practical examplesedit ==
one joule in everyday life represents approximately
the energy required to lift a small apple (with a mass of approximately 100 g) vertically through one metre of air
the energy released when that same apple falls one metre to the ground
the energy required to accelerate a 1 kg mass at 1 ms2 through a 1 m distance in space
the heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 0.24 k
the typical energy released as heat by a person at rest every 1/60 second (approximately 17 ms)
the kinetic energy of a 50 kg human moving very slowly (0.2 m/s or 0.72 km/h)
the kinetic energy of a 56 g tennis ball moving at 6 m/s (22 km/h)
the kinetic energy of an object with mass 1 kg moving at 2 1.4 m/s
the amount of electricity required to light a 1 watt led for 1 s
since the joule is also a watt-second and the common unit for electricity sales to homes is the kwh (kilowatt-hour) a kwh is thus 1000 (kilo) watt 3600 seconds = 3.6 mj (megajoules)
