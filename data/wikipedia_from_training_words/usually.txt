a convention is a set of agreed stipulated or generally accepted standards norms social norms or criteria often taking the form of a custom
certain types of rules or customs may become law and regulatory legislation may be introduced to formalize or enforce the convention (for example laws that define on which side of the road vehicles must be driven) in a social context a convention may retain the character of an unwritten law of custom (for example the manner in which people greet each other such as by shaking each other's hands)
in physical sciences numerical values (such as constants quantities or scales of measurement) are called conventional if they do not represent a measured property of nature but originate in a convention for example an average of many measurements agreed between the scientists working with these values

a convention is a selection from among two or more alternatives where the rule or alternative is agreed upon among participants often the word refers to unwritten customs shared throughout a community for instance it is conventional in many societies that strangers being introduced shake hands some conventions are explicitly legislated for example it is conventional in the united states and in germany that motorists drive on the right side of the road whereas in new zealand england australia mauritius and barbados motorists drive on the left the standardization of time is a human convention based on the solar cycle or calendar the extent to which justice is conventional (as opposed to natural or objective) is historically an important debate among philosophers
the nature of conventions has raised long-lasting philosophical discussion quine davidson and david lewis published influential writings on the subject lewis's account of convention received an extended critique in margaret gilbert's on social facts (1989) where an alternative account is offered another view of convention comes from ruth millikan's language a biological model (2005) once more against lewis
according to david kalupahana the buddha described conventions whether linguistic social political moral ethical or even religious as arising dependent on specific conditions according to his paradigm when conventions are considered absolute realities they contribute to dogmatism which in turn leads to conflict this does not mean that conventions should be absolutely ignored as unreal and therefore useless instead according to buddhist thought a wise person adopts a middle way without holding conventions to be ultimate or ignoring them when they are fruitful

in sociology a social rule refers to any social convention commonly adhered to in a society these rules are not written in law or otherwise formalized in social constructionism there is a great focus on social rules it is argued that these rules are socially constructed that these rules act upon every member of a society but at the same time are re-produced by the individuals
sociologists representing symbolic interactionism argue that social rules are created through the interaction between the members of a society the focus on active interaction highlights the fluid shifting character of social rules these are specific to the social context a context that varies through time and place that means a social rule changes over time within the same society what was acceptable in the past may no longer be the case similarly rules differ across space what is acceptable in one society may not be so in another
social rules reflect what is acceptable or normal behaviour in any situation michel foucault's concept of discourse is closely related to social rules as it offers a possible explanation how these rules are shaped and change it is the social rules that tell people what is normal behaviour for any specific category thus social rules tell a woman how to behave in a womanly manner and a man how to be manly other such rules are as follows
strangers being introduced shake hands as in western societies but
bow toward each other in korea japan and china
do not bow at each other in the jewish tradition
in the united states eye contact a nod of the head toward each other and a smile with no bowing the palm of the hand faces sideways neither upward nor downward in a business handshake
present business cards to each other in business meetings
click heels together in past eras of western history
a woman's curtsey in some societies
in the middle east never displaying the sole of the foot toward another as this would be seen as a grave insult
in many schools though seats for students are not assigned they are still claimed by certain students and sitting in someone else's seat is considered an insult
== government ==
