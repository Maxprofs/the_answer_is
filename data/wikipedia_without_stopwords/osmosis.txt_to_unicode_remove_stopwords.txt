osmosis spontaneous net movement solvent molecules semipermeable membrane region higher solute concentration direction tends equalize solute concentrations two sides may also used describe physical process solvent moves across semipermeable membrane permeable solvent solute separating two solutions different concentrations osmosis made work
osmotic pressure defined external pressure required applied net movement solvent across membrane osmotic pressure colligative property meaning osmotic pressure depends molar concentration solute identity
osmosis vital process biological systems biological membranes semipermeable general membranes impermeable large polar molecules ions proteins polysaccharides permeable nonpolar andor hydrophobic molecules like lipids well small molecules like oxygen carbon dioxide nitrogen nitric oxide permeability depends solubility charge chemistry well solute size water molecules travel plasma membrane tonoplast membrane vacuole protoplast diffusing across phospholipid bilayer via aquaporins small transmembrane proteins similar responsible facilitated diffusion ion channels osmosis provides primary means water transported cells turgor pressure cell largely maintained osmosis across cell membrane cell interior relatively hypotonic environment

osmosis movement solvent across semipermeable membrane toward higher concentration solute biological systems solvent typically water osmosis occur liquids supercritical liquids even gases
cell submerged water water molecules pass cell membrane area low solute concentration high solute concentration example cell submerged saltwater water molecules move cell cell submerged freshwater water molecules move cell
membrane volume pure water sides water molecules pass direction exactly rate net flow water membrane
mechanism responsible driving osmosis commonly represented biology chemistry texts either dilution water solute resulting lower concentration water higher solute concentration side membrane therefore diffusion water along concentration gradient solutes attraction water resulting less free water higher solute concentration side membrane therefore net movement water toward solute notions conclusively refuted
diffusion model osmosis rendered untenable fact osmosis drive water across membrane toward higher concentration water bound water model refuted fact osmosis independent size solute moleculesa colligative propertyor hydrophilic
osmosis unlike diffusion requires force work force supplied solutes interaction membrane solute particles move randomly due brownian motion move towards pores membrane repelled repelled acquire momentum directed away membrane momentum rapidly transferred surrounding water molecules driving away membrane well
osmotic pressure main cause support many plants osmotic entry water raises turgor pressure exerted cell wall equals osmotic pressure creating steady state
plant cell placed solution hypertonic relative cytoplasm water moves cell cell shrinks cell becomes flaccid extreme cases cell becomes plasmolyzed cell membrane disengages cell wall due lack water pressure
plant cell placed solution hypotonic relative cytoplasm water moves cell cell swells become turgid
osmosis responsible ability plant roots draw water soil plants concentrate solutes root cells active transport water enters roots osmosis osmosis also responsible controlling movement guard cells
osmosis demonstrated potato slices added high salt solution water inside potato moves solution causing potato shrink lose turgor pressure concentrated salt solution bigger difference size weight potato slice
unusual environments osmosis harmful organisms example freshwater saltwater aquarium fish placed water different salinity adapted die quickly case saltwater fish dramatically another example harmful osmotic effect use table salt kill leeches slugs
suppose animal plant cell placed solution sugar salt water
medium hypotonic relative cell cytoplasm cell gain water osmosis
medium isotonic net movement water across cell membrane
medium hypertonic relative cell cytoplasm cell lose water osmosis
essentially means cell put solution solute concentration higher shrivel put solution lower solute concentration cell swell may even burst

osmotic pressureedit
mentioned osmosis may opposed increasing pressure region high solute concentration respect low solute concentration region force per unit area pressure required prevent passage water selectively permeable membrane solution greater concentration equivalent osmotic pressure solution turgor osmotic pressure colligative property meaning property depends concentration solute identity also involved facilitated diffusion
osmotic gradientedit
osmotic gradient difference concentration two solutions either side semipermeable membrane used tell difference percentages concentration specific particle dissolved solution
usually osmotic gradient used comparing solutions semipermeable membrane allowing water diffuse two solutions toward hypertonic solution solution higher concentration eventually force column water hypertonic side semipermeable membrane equal force diffusion hypotonic side lesser concentration side creating equilibrium equilibrium reached water continues flow flows ways equal amounts well force therefore stabilizing solution
variationedit
reverse osmosisedit
reverse osmosis separation process uses pressure force solvent semipermeable membrane retains solute one side allows pure solvent pass side forcing region high solute concentration membrane region low solute concentration applying pressure excess osmotic pressure
forward osmosisedit
osmosis may used directly achieve separation water solution containing unwanted solutes draw solution higher osmotic pressure feed solution used induce net flow water semipermeable membrane feed solution becomes concentrated draw solution becomes dilute diluted draw solution may used directly ingestible solute like glucose sent secondary separation process removal draw solute secondary separation efficient reverse osmosis process would alone depending draw solute used feedwater treated forward osmosis area ongoing research focusing applications desalination water purification water treatment food processing etc
