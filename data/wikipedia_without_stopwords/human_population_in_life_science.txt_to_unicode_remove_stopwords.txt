molar conductivity defined conductivity electrolyte solution divided molar concentration electrolyte measures efficiency given electrolyte conducts electricity solution units siemens per meter per molarity siemens metersquared per mole usual symbol capital lambda m molar conductivity solution given concentration conductance volume v solution containing one mole electrolyte kept two electrodes area cross section distance unit length
history
friedrich kohlrausch established high accuracy dilute solutions molar conductivity composed individual contributions ions known law independent migration ions
description
definition molar conductivity given
measured conductivity
c electrolyte concentration
two cases distinguished strong electrolytes weak electrolytes
strong electrolytes salts strong acids strong bases molar conductivity depends weakly concentration based experimental data friedrich kohlrausch around year proposed nonlinear law strong electrolytes
molar conductivity infinite dilution limiting molar conductivity
k kohlrausch coefficient depends mainly stoichiometry specific salt solution
law valid low electrolyte concentrations fits debyehckelonsager equation
weak electrolytes ie incompletely dissociated electrolytes however molar conductivity strongly depends concentration dilute solution greater molar conductivity due increased ionic dissociation example case sdscoated proteins stacking gel sdspage
limiting molar conductivity decomposed contributions different ions kohlrauschs law independent migration ions
molar ionic conductivity ion
number ions formula unit electrolyte eg na naso
applications
ostwalds law dilution gives dissociation constant weak electrolyte function concentration written terms molar conductivity thus pka values acids calculated measuring molar conductivity extrapolating zero concentration namely pka pk mol dm zeroconcentration limit k dissociation constant ostwalds law
