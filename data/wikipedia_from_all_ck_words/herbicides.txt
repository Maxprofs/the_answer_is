herbicide(s) also commonly known as weedkillers are pesticides used to control unwanted plants selective herbicides control specific weed species while leaving the desired crop relatively unharmed some of these act by interfering with the growth of the weed and are often synthetic mimics of natural plant hormones herbicides used to clear waste ground industrial sites railways and railway embankments are not selective and control all plant material with which they come into contact smaller quantities are used in forestry pasture systems and management of areas set aside as wildlife habitat
some plants produce natural herbicides such as the genus juglans (walnuts) or the tree of heaven such action of natural herbicides and other related chemical interactions is called allelopathy
in the us in 2007 about 83% of all herbicide usage determined by weight applied was in agriculture in 2007 world pesticide expenditures totaled about $39.4 billion herbicides were about 40% of those sales and constituted the biggest portion followed by insecticides fungicides and other types
== historyedit ==
prior to the widespread use of chemical herbicides cultural controls such as altering soil ph salinity or fertility levels were used to control weeds mechanical control (including tillage) was also (and still is) used to control weeds
=== first herbicidesedit ===
although research into chemical herbicides began in the early 20th century the first major breakthrough was the result of research conducted in both the uk and the us during the second world war into the potential use of agents as biological weapons the first modern herbicide 2,4-d was first discovered and synthesized by w g templeman at imperial chemical industries in 1940 he showed that growth substances applied appropriately would kill certain broad-leaved weeds in cereals without harming the crops. by 1941 his team succeeded in synthesizing the chemical in the same year pokorny in the us achieved this as well
independently a team under juda hirsch quastel working at the rothamsted experimental station made the same discovery quastel was tasked by the agricultural research council (arc) to discover methods for improving crop yield by analyzing soil as a dynamic system rather than an inert substance he was able to apply techniques such as perfusion quastel was able to quantify the influence of various plant hormones inhibitors and other chemicals on the activity of microorganisms in the soil and assess their direct impact on plant growth while the full work of the unit remained secret certain discoveries were developed for commercial use after the war including the 2,4-d compound
when it was commercially released in 1946 it triggered a worldwide revolution in agricultural output and became the first successful selective herbicide it allowed for greatly enhanced weed control in wheat maize (corn) rice and similar cereal grass crops because it kills dicots (broadleaf plants) but not most monocots (grasses) the low cost of 2,4-d has led to continued usage today and it remains one of the most commonly used herbicides in the world like other acid herbicides current formulations use either an amine salt (often trimethylamine) or one of many esters of the parent compound these are easier to handle than the acid
=== further discoveriesedit ===
the triazine family of herbicides which includes atrazine were introduced in the 1950s they have the current distinction of being the herbicide family of greatest concern regarding groundwater contamination atrazine does not break down readily (within a few weeks) after being applied to soils of above neutral ph under alkaline soil conditions atrazine may be carried into the soil profile as far as the water table by soil water following rainfall causing the aforementioned contamination atrazine is thus said to have carryover a generally undesirable property for herbicides
glyphosate (roundup) was introduced in 1974 for nonselective weed control following the development of glyphosate-resistant crop plants it is now used very extensively for selective weed control in growing crops the pairing of the herbicide with the resistant seed contributed to the consolidation of the seed and chemistry industry in the late 1990s
many modern chemical herbicides for agriculture are specifically formulated to decompose within a short period after application this is desirable as it allows crops which may be affected by the herbicide to be grown on the land in future seasons however herbicides with low residual activity (i.e. that decompose quickly) often do not provide season-long weed control
== health and environmental effectsedit ==
herbicides have widely variable toxicity in addition to acute toxicity from occupational exposure levels
some herbicides cause a range of health effects ranging from skin rashes to death the pathway of attack can arise from intentional or unintentional direct consumption improper application resulting in the herbicide coming into direct contact with people or wildlife inhalation of aerial sprays or food consumption prior to the labeled preharvest interval under some conditions certain herbicides can be transported via leaching or surface runoff to contaminate groundwater or distant surface water sources generally the conditions that promote herbicide transport include intense storm events (particularly shortly after application) and soils with limited capacity to adsorb or retain the herbicides herbicide properties that increase likelihood of transport include persistence (resistance to degradation) and high water solubility
phenoxy herbicides are often contaminated with dioxins such as tcdd research has suggested such contamination results in a small rise in cancer risk after occupational exposure to these herbicides triazine exposure has been implicated in a likely relationship to increased risk of breast cancer although a causal relationship remains unclear
herbicide manufacturers have at times made false or misleading claims about the safety of their products chemical manufacturer monsanto company agreed to change its advertising after pressure from new york attorney general dennis vacco vacco complained about misleading claims that its spray-on glyphosate-based herbicides including roundup were safer than table salt and practically non-toxic to mammals birds and fish (though proof that this was ever said is hard to find) roundup is toxic and has resulted in death after being ingested in quantities ranging from 85 to 200 ml although it has also been ingested in quantities as large as 500 ml with only mild or moderate symptoms the manufacturer of tordon 101 (dow agrosciences owned by the dow chemical company) has claimed tordon 101 has no effects on animals and insects in spite of evidence of strong carcinogenic activity of the active ingredient picloram in studies on rats
the risk of parkinson's disease has been shown to increase with occupational exposure to herbicides and pesticides the herbicide paraquat is suspected to be one such factor
all commercially sold organic and nonorganic herbicides must be extensively tested prior to approval for sale and labeling by the environmental protection agency however because of the large number of herbicides in use concern regarding health effects is significant in addition to health effects caused by herbicides themselves commercial herbicide mixtures often contain other chemicals including inactive ingredients which have negative impacts on human health
=== ecological effectsedit ===
commercial herbicide use generally has negative impacts on bird populations although the impacts are highly variable and often require field studies to predict accurately laboratory studies have at times overestimated negative impacts on birds due to toxicity predicting serious problems that were not observed in the field most observed effects are due not to toxicity but to habitat changes and the decreases in abundance of species on which birds rely for food or shelter herbicide use in silviculture used to favor certain types of growth following clearcutting can cause significant drops in bird populations even when herbicides which have low toxicity to birds are used they decrease the abundance of many types of vegetation on which the birds rely herbicide use in agriculture in britain has been linked to a decline in seed-eating bird species which rely on the weeds killed by the herbicides heavy use of herbicides in neotropical agricultural areas has been one of many factors implicated in limiting the usefulness of such agricultural land for wintering migratory birds
frog populations may be affected negatively by the use of herbicides as well while some studies have shown that atrazine may be a teratogen causing demasculinization in male frogs the u.s environmental protection agency (epa) and its independent scientific advisory panel (sap) examined all available studies on this topic and concluded that atrazine does not adversely affect amphibian gonadal development based on a review of laboratory and field studies.
=== scientific uncertaintyedit ===
the health and environmental effects of many herbicides is unknown and even the scientific community often disagrees on the risk for example a 1995 panel of 13 scientists reviewing studies on the carcinogenicity of 2,4-d had divided opinions on the likelihood 2,4-d causes cancer in humans as of 1992 studies on phenoxy herbicides were too few to accurately assess the risk of many types of cancer from these herbicides even though evidence was stronger that exposure to these herbicides is associated with increased risk of soft tissue sarcoma and non-hodgkin lymphoma furthermore there is some suggestion that herbicides can play a role in sex reversal of certain organisms that experience temperature-dependent sex determination which could theoretically alter sex ratios
== resistanceedit ==
weed resistance to herbicides has become a major concern in crop production worldwide resistance to herbicides is often attributed to lack of rotational programmes of herbicides and to continuous applications of herbicides with the same sites of action thus a true understanding of the sites of action of herbicides is essential for strategic planning of herbicide-based weed control
plants have developed resistance to atrazine and to als-inhibitors and more recently to glyphosate herbicides marestail is one weed that has developed glyphosate resistance glyphosate-resistant weeds are present in the vast majority of soybean cotton and corn farms in some u.s states weeds that can resist multiple other herbicides are spreading few new herbicides are near commercialization and none with a molecular mode of action for which there is no resistance because most herbicides could not kill all weeds farmers rotated crops and herbicides to stop resistant weeds during its initial years glyphosate was not subject to resistance and allowed farmers to reduce the use of rotation
a family of weeds that includes waterhemp (amaranthus rudis) is the largest concern a 2008-9 survey of 144 populations of waterhemp in 41 missouri counties revealed glyphosate resistance in 69% weeds from some 500 sites throughout iowa in 2011 and 2012 revealed glyphosate resistance in approximately 64% of waterhemp samples the use of other killers to target residual weeds has become common and may be sufficient to have stopped the spread of resistance from 2005 through 2010 researchers discovered 13 different weed species that had developed resistance to glyphosate but since then only two more have been discovered weeds resistant to multiple herbicides with completely different biological action modes are on the rise in missouri 43% of samples were resistant to two different herbicides 6% resisted three and 0.5% resisted four in iowa 89% of waterhemp samples resist two or more herbicides 25% resist three and 10% resist five
for southern cotton herbicide costs has climbed from between $50 and $75 per hectare a few years ago to about $370 per hectare in 2013 resistance is contributing to a massive shift away from growing cotton over the past few years the area planted with cotton has declined by 70% in arkansas and by 60% in tennessee for soybeans in illinois costs have risen from about $25 to $160 per hectare
dow bayer cropscience syngenta and monsanto are all developing seed varieties resistant to herbicides other than glyphosate which will make it easier for farmers to use alternative weed killers even though weeds have already evolved some resistance to those herbicides powles says the new seed-and-herbicide combos should work well if used with proper rotation
=== biochemistry of herbicide resistanceedit ===
resistance to herbicides can be based on one of the following biochemical mechanisms
target-site resistance this is due to a reduced (or even lost) ability of the herbicide to bind to its target protein the effect usually relates to an enzyme with a crucial function in a metabolic pathway or to a component of an electron-transport system target-site resistance may also be caused by an overexpression of the target enzyme (via gene amplification or changes in a gene promoter)
non-target-site resistance this is caused by mechanisms that reduce the amount of herbicidal active compound reaching the target site one important mechanism is an enhanced metabolic detoxification of the herbicide in the weed which leads to insufficient amounts of the active substance reaching the target site a reduced uptake and translocation or sequestration of the herbicide may also result in an insufficient herbicide transport to the target site
cross-resistance in this case a single resistance mechanism causes resistance to several herbicides the term target-site cross-resistance is used when the herbicides bind to the same target site whereas non-target-site cross-resistance is due to a single non-target-site mechanism (e.g. enhanced metabolic detoxification) that entails resistance across herbicides with different sites of action
multiple resistance in this situation two or more resistance mechanisms are present within individual plants or within a plant population
=== prevention and management of herbicide resistanceedit ===
worldwide experience has been that farmers tend to do little to prevent herbicide resistance developing and only take action when it is a problem on their own farm or neighbors careful observation is important so that any reduction in herbicide efficacy can be detected this may indicate evolving resistance it is vital that resistance is detected at an early stage as if it becomes an acute whole-farm problem options are more limited and greater expense is almost inevitable table 1 lists factors which enable the risk of resistance to be assessed an essential pre-requisite for confirmation of resistance is a good diagnostic test ideally this should be rapid accurate cheap and accessible many diagnostic tests have been developed including glasshouse pot assays petri dish assays and chlorophyll fluorescence a key component of such tests is that the response of the suspect population to a herbicide can be compared with that of known susceptible and resistant standards under controlled conditions most cases of herbicide resistance are a consequence of the repeated use of herbicides often in association with crop monoculture and reduced cultivation practices it is necessary therefore to modify these practices in order to prevent or delay the onset of resistance or to control existing resistant populations a key objective should be the reduction in selection pressure an integrated weed management (iwm) approach is required in which as many tactics as possible are used to combat weeds in this way less reliance is placed on herbicides and so selection pressure should be reduced
table 1 agronomic factors influencing the risk of herbicide resistance development
=== alternative herbicidesedit ===
when resistance is first suspected or confirmed the efficacy of alternatives is likely to be the first consideration the use of alternative herbicides which remain effective on resistant populations can be a successful strategy at least in the short term the effectiveness of alternative herbicides will be highly dependent on the extent of cross-resistance if there is resistance to a single group of herbicides then the use of herbicides from other groups may provide a simple and effective solution at least in the short term for example many triazine-resistant weeds have been readily controlled by the use of alternative herbicides such as dicamba or glyphosate if resistance extends to more than one herbicide group then choices are more limited it should not be assumed that resistance will automatically extend to all herbicides with the same mode of action although it is wise to assume this until proved otherwise in many weeds the degree of cross-resistance between the five groups of als inhibitors varies considerably much will depend on the resistance mechanisms present and it should not be assumed that these will necessarily be the same in different populations of the same species these differences are due at least in part to the existence of different mutations conferring target site resistance consequently selection for different mutations may result in different patterns of cross-resistance enhanced metabolism can affect even closely related herbicides to differing degrees for example populations of alopecurus myosuroides (blackgrass) with an enhanced metabolism mechanism show resistance to pendimethalin but not to trifluralin despite both being dinitroanilines this is due to differences in the vulnerability of these two herbicides to oxidative metabolism consequently care is needed when trying to predict the efficacy of alternative herbicides
=== mixtures and sequencesedit ===
the use of two or more herbicides which have differing modes of action can reduce the selection for resistant genotypes ideally each component in a mixture should
be active at different target sites
have a high level of efficacy
be detoxified by different biochemical pathways
have similar persistence in the soil (if it is a residual herbicide)
exert negative cross-resistance
synergise the activity of the other component
no mixture is likely to have all these attributes but the first two listed are the most important there is a risk that mixtures will select for resistance to both components in the longer term one practical advantage of sequences of two herbicides compared with mixtures is that a better appraisal of the efficacy of each herbicide component is possible provided that sufficient time elapses between each application a disadvantage with sequences is that two separate applications have to be made and it is possible that the later application will be less effective on weeds surviving the first application if these are resistant then the second herbicide in the sequence may increase selection for resistant individuals by killing the susceptible plants which were damaged but not killed by the first application but allowing the larger less affected resistant plants to survive this has been cited as one reason why als-resistant stellaria media has evolved in scotland recently (2000) despite the regular use of a sequence incorporating mecoprop a herbicide with a different mode of action
=== herbicide rotationsedit ===
rotation of herbicides from different chemical groups in successive years should reduce selection for resistance this is a key element in most resistance prevention programmes the value of this approach depends on the extent of cross-resistance and whether multiple resistance occurs owing to the presence of several different resistance mechanisms a practical problem can be the lack of awareness by farmers of the different groups of herbicides that exist in australia a scheme has been introduced in which identifying letters are included on the product label as a means of enabling farmers to distinguish products with different modes of action
=== herbicide managementedit ===
optimising herbicide input to the economic threshold level should avoid the unnecessary use of herbicides and reduce selection pressure herbicides should be used to their greatest potential by ensuring that the timing dose application method soil and climatic conditions are optimal for good activity in the uk partially resistant grass weeds such as alopecurus myosuroides (blackgrass) and avena spp (wild oat) can often be controlled adequately when herbicides are applied at the 2-3 leaf stage whereas later applications at the 2-3 tiller stage can fail badly patch spraying or applying herbicide to only the badly infested areas of fields is another means of reducing total herbicide use
=== farming practicesedit ===
herbicide resistance became a critical problem after many australian sheep farmers began to exclusively grow wheat in their pastures in the 1970s introduced varieties of ryegrass while good for grazing sheep compete intensely with wheat ryegrasses produce so many seeds that if left unchecked they can completely choke a field herbicides provided excellent control while reducing soil disrupting because of less need to plough within little more than a decade ryegrass and other weeds began to develop resistance in response australian farmers changed methods
in 1983 patches of ryegrass had become immune to hoegrass a family of herbicides that inhibit an enzyme called acetyl coenzyme a carboxylase
ryegrass populations were large and had substantial genetic diversity because farmers had planted many varieties ryegrass is cross-pollinated by wind so genes shuffle frequently to control its distribution farmers sprayed inexpensive hoegrass creating selection pressure in addition farmers sometimes diluted the herbicide in order to save money which allowed some plants to survive application when resistance appeared farmers turned to a group of herbicides that block acetolactate synthase once again ryegrass in australia evolved a kind of cross-resistance that allowed it to rapidly break down a variety of herbicides four classes of herbicides become ineffective within a few years in 2013 only two herbicide classes called photosystem ii and long-chain fatty acid inhibitors were effective against ryegrass
== classificationedit ==
herbicides are classified/grouped in various ways e.g according to the activity timing of application method of application mechanism of action chemical family
=== activityedit ===
selective herbicides they control or suppress certain plants without affecting the growth of other plants species selectivity may be due to translocation differential absorption physical (morphological) or physiological differences between plant species 2,4-d mecoprop dicamba control many broadleaf weeds but remains ineffective against turfgrasses
non-selective herbicides these herbicides are not specific in acting against certain plant species and control all plant material with which they come into contact they are used to clear industrial sites waste ground railways and railway embankments paraquat glufosinate glyphosate are non-selective herbicides
=== timing of applicationedit ===
preplant preplant herbicides are nonselective herbicides applied to soil before planting some preplant herbicides may be mechanically incorporated into the soil the objective for incorporation is to prevent dissipation through photodecomposition and/or volatility the herbicides kill weeds as they grow through the herbicide treated zone volatile herbicides have to be incorporated into the soil before planting the pasture agricultural crops grown in soil treated with a preplant herbicide include tomatoes corn soybeans and strawberries soil fumigants like metam-sodium and dazomet are in use as preplant herbicides
preemergence preemergence herbicides are applied before the weed seedlings emerge through the soil surface herbicides do not prevent weeds from germinating but they kill weeds as they grow through the herbicide treated zone by affecting the cell division in the emerging seedling dithopyr and pendimethalin are preemergence herbicides weeds that have already emerged before application or activation are not affected by pre-herbicides as their primary growing point escapes the treatment
postemergence these herbicides are applied after weed seedlings have emerged through the soil surface they can be foliar or root absorbed selective or nonselective contact or systemic application of these herbicides is avoided during rain because the problem of being washed off to the soil makes it ineffective 2,4-d is a selective systemic foliar absorbed postemergence herbicide
=== method of applicationedit ===
soil applied herbicides applied to the soil are usually taken up by the root or shoot of the emerging seedlings and are used as preplant or preemergence treatment several factors influence the effectiveness of soil-applied herbicides weeds absorb herbicides by both passive and active mechanism herbicide adsorption to soil colloids or organic matter often reduces its amount available for weed absorption positioning of herbicide in correct layer of soil is very important which can be achieved mechanically and by rainfall herbicides on the soil surface are subjected to several processes that reduce their availability volatility and photolysis are two common processes that reduce the availability of herbicides many soil applied herbicides are absorbed through plant shoots while they are still underground leading to their death or injury eptc and trifluralin are soil applied herbicides
foliar applied these are applied to portion of the plant above the ground and are absorbed by exposed tissues these are generally postemergence herbicides and can either be translocated (systemic) throughout the plant or remain at specific site (contact) external barriers of plants like cuticle waxes cell wall etc affect herbicide absorption and action glyphosate 2,4-d and dicamba are foliar applied herbicide
=== mechanism of actionedit ===
herbicides are often classified according to their site of action because as a general rule herbicides within the same site of action class will produce similar symptoms on susceptible plants classification based on site of action of herbicide is comparatively better as herbicide resistance management can be handled more properly and effectively classification by mechanism of action (moa) indicates the first enzyme protein or biochemical step affected in the plant following application the main mechanisms of action are
accase inhibitors compounds kill grasses acetyl coenzyme a carboxylase (accase) is part of the first step of lipid synthesis thus accase inhibitors affect cell membrane production in the meristems of the grass plant the accases of grasses are sensitive to these herbicides whereas the accases of dicot plants are not
als inhibitors the acetolactate synthase (als) enzyme (also known as acetohydroxyacid synthase or ahas) is the first step in the synthesis of the branched-chain amino acids (valine leucine and isoleucine) these herbicides slowly starve affected plants of these amino acids which eventually leads to inhibition of dna synthesis they affect grasses and dicots alike the als inhibitor family includes sulfonylureas imidazolinones triazolopyrimidines pyrimidinyl oxybenzoates and sulfonylamino carbonyl triazolinones the als biological pathway exists only in plants and not animals thus making the als-inhibitors among the safest herbicides
epsps inhibitors the enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase enzyme epsps is used in the synthesis of the amino acids tryptophan phenylalanine and tyrosine they affect grasses and dicots alike glyphosate (roundup) is a systemic epsps inhibitor inactivated by soil contact
synthetic auxins inaugurated the era of organic herbicides they were discovered in the 1940s after a long study of the plant growth regulator auxin synthetic auxins mimic this plant hormone they have several points of action on the cell membrane and are effective in the control of dicot plants 2,4-d is a synthetic auxin herbicide
photosystem ii inhibitors reduce electron flow from water to nadph2+ at the photochemical step in photosynthesis they bind to the qb site on the d1 protein and prevent quinone from binding to this site therefore this group of compounds causes electrons to accumulate on chlorophyll molecules as a consequence oxidation reactions in excess of those normally tolerated by the cell occur and the plant dies the triazine herbicides (including atrazine) and urea derivatives (diuron) are photosystem ii inhibitors
photosystem i inhibitors steal electrons from the normal pathway through fes to fdx to nadp leading to direct discharge of electrons on oxygen as a result reactive oxygen species are produced and oxidation reactions in excess of those normally tolerated by the cell occur leading to plant death bipyridinium herbicides (such as diquat and paraquat) inhibit the fe-s fdx step of that chain while diphenyl ether herbicides (such as nitrofen nitrofluorfen and acifluorfen) inhibit the fdx nadp step
hppd inhibitors inhibit 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase which are involved in tyrosine breakdown tyrosine breakdown products are used by plants to make carotenoids which protect chlorophyll in plants from being destroyed by sunlight if this happens the plants turn white due to complete loss of chlorophyll and the plants die mesotrione and sulcotrione are herbicides in this class a drug nitisinone was discovered in the course of developing this class of herbicides
=== herbicide group (labeling)edit ===
one of the most important methods for preventing delaying or managing resistance is to reduce the reliance on a single herbicide mode of action to do this farmers must know which herbicides share the same mode of action but the relatively complex nature of plant biochemistry makes this difficult to determine attempts were made to simplify the understanding of herbicide mode of action by developing a classification system that grouped herbicides by mode of action eventually the herbicide resistance action committee (hrac) and the weed science society of america (wssa) developed a classification system the wssa and hrac systems differ in the group designation groups in the wssa and the hrac systems are designated by numbers and letters respectively the goal for adding the group classification and mode of action to the herbicide product label is to provide a simple and practical approach to deliver the information to users this information will make it easier to develop educational material that is consistent and effective it should increase users awareness of herbicide mode of action and provide more accurate recommendations for resistance management another goal is to make it easier for users to keep records on which herbicide mode of actions are being used on a particular field from year to year
=== chemical familyedit ===
detailed investigations on chemical structure of the active ingredients of the registered herbicides showed that some moieties (moiety is a part of a molecule that may include either whole functional groups or parts of functional groups as substructures a functional group has similar chemical properties whenever it occurs in different compounds) have the same mechanisms of action according to forouzesh et al 2015 these moieties have been assigned to the names of chemical families and active ingredients are then classified within the chemical families accordingly knowing about herbicide chemical family grouping could serve as a short-term strategy for managing resistance to site of action
== organic herbicidesedit ==
recently the term organic has come to imply products used in organic farming under this definition an organic herbicide is one that can be used in a farming enterprise that has been classified as organic commercially sold organic herbicides are expensive and may not be affordable for commercial farming depending on the application they may be less effective than synthetic herbicides and are generally used along with cultural and mechanical weed control practices
homemade organic herbicides include
corn gluten meal (cgm) is a natural pre-emergence weed control used in turfgrass which reduces germination of many broadleaf and grass weeds
vinegar is effective for 520% solutions of acetic acid with higher concentrations most effective but it mainly destroys surface growth so respraying to treat regrowth is needed resistant plants generally succumb when weakened by respraying
steam has been applied commercially but is now considered uneconomical and inadequate it controls surface growth but not underground growth and so respraying to treat regrowth of perennials is needed
flame is considered more effective than steam but suffers from the same difficulties
d-limonene (citrus oil) is a natural degreasing agent that strips the waxy skin or cuticle from weeds causing dehydration and ultimately death
saltwater or salt applied in appropriate strengths to the rootzone will kill most plants
monocerin produced by certain fungi will kill certain weeds such as johnson grass
== applicationedit ==
most herbicides are applied as water-based sprays using ground equipment ground equipment varies in design but large areas can be sprayed using self-propelled sprayers equipped with long booms of 60 to 120 feet (18 to 37 m) with spray nozzles spaced every 2030 inches (510760 mm) apart towed handheld and even horse-drawn sprayers are also used
some herbicides can also be applied aerially using helicopters or airplanes and can be applied through irrigation systems (chemigation)
a new method of herbicide application involves ridding the soil of its active weed seed bank rather than just killing the weed researchers at the agricultural research service have found the application of herbicides to fields late in the weeds growing season greatly reduces their seed production and therefore fewer weeds will return the following season because most weeds are annuals their seeds will only survive in soil for a year or two so this method will be able to weed out the weed with only a few years of herbicide application
weed-wiping may also be used where a wick wetted with herbicide is suspended from a boom and dragged or rolled across the tops of the taller weed plants this allows treatment of taller grassland weeds by direct contact without affecting related but desirable plants in the grassland sward beneath the method has the benefit of avoiding spray drift in wales a scheme offering free weed-wiper hire was launched in 2015 in an effort to reduce the levels of mcpa in water courses
=== misapplicationedit ===
herbicide volatilisation or spray drift may result in herbicide affecting neighboring fields or plants particularly in windy conditions sometimes the wrong field or plants may be sprayed due to error
== terminologyedit ==
control is the destruction of unwanted weeds or the damage of them to the point where they are no longer competitive with the crop
suppression is incomplete control still providing some economic benefit such as reduced competition with the crop
crop safety for selective herbicides is the relative absence of damage or stress to the crop most selective herbicides cause some visible stress to crop plants
== in current useedit ==
2,4-d is a broadleaf herbicide in the phenoxy group used in turf and no-till field crop production now it is mainly used in a blend with other herbicides to allow lower rates of herbicides to be used it is the most widely used herbicide in the world and third most commonly used in the united states it is an example of synthetic auxin (plant hormone)
aminopyralid is a broadleaf herbicide in the pyridine group used to control weeds on grassland such as docks thistles and nettles it is notorious for its ability to persist in compost
atrazine a triazine herbicide is used in corn and sorghum for control of broadleaf weeds and grasses still used because of its low cost and because it works well on a broad spectrum of weeds common in the us corn belt atrazine is commonly used with other herbicides to reduce the overall rate of atrazine and to lower the potential for groundwater contamination it is a photosystem ii inhibitor
clopyralid is a broadleaf herbicide in the pyridine group used mainly in turf rangeland and for control of noxious thistles notorious for its ability to persist in compost it is another example of synthetic auxin
dicamba a postemergent broadleaf herbicide with some soil activity is used on turf and field corn it is another example of a synthetic auxin
glufosinate ammonium a broad-spectrum contact herbicide is used to control weeds after the crop emerges or for total vegetation control on land not used for cultivation
fluazifop (fuselade forte) a post emergence foliar absorbed translocated grass-selective herbicide with little residual action it is used on a very wide range of broad leaved crops for control of annual and perennial grasses
fluroxypyr a systemic selective herbicide is used for the control of broad-leaved weeds in small grain cereals maize pastures rangeland and turf it is a synthetic auxin in cereal growing fluroxypyr's key importance is control of cleavers galium aparine other key broadleaf weeds are also controlled
glyphosate a systemic nonselective herbicide is used in no-till burndown and for weed control in crops genetically modified to resist its effects it is an example of an epsps inhibitor
imazapyr a nonselective herbicide is used for the control of a broad range of weeds including terrestrial annual and perennial grasses and broadleaf herbs woody species and riparian and emergent aquatic species
imazapic a selective herbicide for both the pre- and postemergent control of some annual and perennial grasses and some broadleaf weeds kills plants by inhibiting the production of branched chain amino acids (valine leucine and isoleucine) which are necessary for protein synthesis and cell growth
imazamox an imidazolinone manufactured by basf for postemergence application that is an acetolactate synthase (als) inhibitor sold under trade names raptor beyond and clearcast
linuron is a nonselective herbicide used in the control of grasses and broadleaf weeds it works by inhibiting photosynthesis
mcpa (2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid) is a phenoxy herbicide selective for broadleaf plants and widely used in cereals and pasture
metolachlor is a pre-emergent herbicide widely used for control of annual grasses in corn and sorghum it has displaced some of the atrazine in these uses
paraquat is a nonselective contact herbicide used for no-till burndown and in aerial destruction of marijuana and coca plantings it is more acutely toxic to people than any other herbicide in widespread commercial use
pendimethalin a pre-emergent herbicide is widely used to control annual grasses and some broad-leaf weeds in a wide range of crops including corn soybeans wheat cotton many tree and vine crops and many turfgrass species
picloram a pyridine herbicide mainly is used to control unwanted trees in pastures and edges of fields it is another synthetic auxin
sodium chlorate a nonselective herbicide is considered phytotoxic to all green plant parts it can also kill through root absorption
triclopyr a systemic foliar herbicide in the pyridine group is used to control broadleaf weeds while leaving grasses and conifers unaffected
== historical interest 2,4,5-tedit ==
2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-t) was a widely used broadleaf herbicide until being phased out starting in the late 1970s while 2,4,5-t itself is of only moderate toxicity the manufacturing process for 2,4,5-t contaminates this chemical with trace amounts of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (tcdd) tcdd is extremely toxic to humans with proper temperature control during production of 2,4,5-t tcdd levels can be held to about 005 ppm before the tcdd risk was well understood early production facilities lacked proper temperature controls individual batches tested later were found to have as much as 60 ppm of tcdd
2,4,5-t was withdrawn from use in the usa in 1983 at a time of heightened public sensitivity about chemical hazards in the environment public concern about dioxins was high and production and use of other (non-herbicide) chemicals potentially containing tcdd contamination was also withdrawn these included pentachlorophenol (a wood preservative) and pcbs (mainly used as stabilizing agents in transformer oil) some feel that the 2,4,5-t withdrawal was not based on sound science 2,4,5-t has since largely been replaced by dicamba and triclopyr
agent orange was a herbicide blend used by the british military during the malayan emergency and the u.s military during the vietnam war between january 1965 and april 1970 as a defoliant it was a 50/50 mixture of the n-butyl esters of 2,4,5-t and 2,4-d because of tcdd contamination in the 2,4,5-t component it has been blamed for serious illnesses in many people who were exposed to it however research on populations exposed to its dioxin contaminant have been inconsistent and inconclusive
