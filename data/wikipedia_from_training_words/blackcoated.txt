anemia also spelled anaemia is usually defined as a decrease in the amount of red blood cells (rbcs) or hemoglobin in the blood it can also be defined as a lowered ability of the blood to carry oxygen when anemia comes on slowly the symptoms are often vague and may include feeling tired weakness shortness of breath or a poor ability to exercise anemia that comes on quickly often has greater symptoms which may include confusion feeling like one is going to pass out and increased thirst anemia must be significant before a person becomes noticeably pale additional symptoms may occur depending on the underlying cause
there are three main types of anemia that due to blood loss that due to decreased red blood cell production and that due to increased red blood cell breakdown causes of blood loss include trauma and gastrointestinal bleeding among others causes of decreased production include iron deficiency a lack of vitamin b12 thalassemia and a number of neoplasms of the bone marrow among others causes of increased breakdown include a number of genetic conditions such as sickle cell anemia infections like malaria and some autoimmune diseases among others it can also be classified based on the size of red blood cells and amount of hemoglobin in each cell if the cells are small it is microcytic anemia if they are large it is macrocytic anemia and if they are normal sized it is normocytic anemia diagnosis in men is based on a hemoglobin of less than 130 to 140 g/l (13 to 14 g/dl) while in women it must be less than 120 to 130 g/l (12 to 13 g/dl) further testing is then required to determine the cause
certain groups of individuals such as pregnant women benefit from the use of iron pills for prevention dietary supplementation without determining the specific cause is not recommended the use of blood transfusions is typically based on a person's signs and symptoms in those without symptoms they are not recommended unless hemoglobin levels are less than 60 to 80 g/l (6 to 8 g/dl) these recommendations may also apply to some people with acute bleeding erythropoiesis-stimulating medications are only recommended in those with severe anemia
anemia is the most common disorder of the blood with it affecting about a quarter of people globally iron-deficiency anemia affects nearly 1 billion in 2013 anemia due to iron deficiency resulted in about 183,000 deaths down from 213,000 deaths in 1990 it is more common in females than males among children during pregnancy and in the elderly anemia increases costs of medical care and lowers a person's productivity through a decreased ability to work the name is derived from ancient greek anaimia meaning lack of blood from - an- not + haima blood
== signs and symptoms ==
anemia goes undetected in many people and symptoms can be minor or vague the signs and symptoms can be related to the underlying cause or the anemia itself most commonly people with anemia report feelings of weakness or fatigue general malaise and sometimes poor concentration they may also report dyspnea (shortness of breath) on exertion in very severe anemia the body may compensate for the lack of oxygen-carrying capability of the blood by increasing cardiac output the patient may have symptoms related to this such as palpitations angina (if pre-existing heart disease is present) intermittent claudication of the legs and symptoms of heart failure on examination the signs exhibited may include pallor (pale skin lining mucosa conjunctiva and nail beds) but this is not a reliable sign there may be signs of specific causes of anemia e.g. koilonychia (in iron deficiency) jaundice (when anemia results from abnormal break down of red blood cells in hemolytic anemia) bone deformities (found in thalassemia major) or leg ulcers (seen in sickle-cell disease) in severe anemia there may be signs of a hyperdynamic circulation tachycardia (a fast heart rate) bounding pulse flow murmurs and cardiac ventricular hypertrophy (enlargement) there may be signs of heart failure pica the consumption of non-food items such as ice but also paper wax or grass and even hair or dirt may be a symptom of iron deficiency although it occurs often in those who have normal levels of hemoglobin chronic anemia may result in behavioral disturbances in children as a direct result of impaired neurological development in infants and reduced scholastic performance in children of school age restless legs syndrome is more common in those with iron-deficiency anemia
== causes ==
broadly causes of anemia may be classified as impaired red blood cell (rbc) production increased rbc destruction (hemolytic anemias) blood loss and fluid overload (hypervolemia) several of these may interplay to cause anemia eventually indeed the most common cause of anemia is blood loss but this usually does not cause any lasting symptoms unless a relatively impaired rbc production develops in turn most commonly by iron deficiency (see iron deficiency anemia)
=== impaired production ===
disturbance of proliferation and differentiation of stem cells
pure red cell aplasia
aplastic anemia affects all kinds of blood cells fanconi anemia is a hereditary disorder or defect featuring aplastic anemia and various other abnormalities
anemia of renal failure by insufficient erythropoietin production
anemia of endocrine disorders
disturbance of proliferation and maturation of erythroblasts
pernicious anemia is a form of megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin b12 deficiency dependent on impaired absorption of vitamin b12 lack of dietary b12 causes non-pernicious megaloblastic anemia
anemia of folic acid deficiency as with vitamin b12 causes megaloblastic anemia
anemia of prematurity by diminished erythropoietin response to declining hematocrit levels combined with blood loss from laboratory testing generally occurs in premature infants at two to six weeks of age
iron deficiency anemia resulting in deficient heme synthesis
thalassemias causing deficient globin synthesis
congenital dyserythropoietic anemias causing ineffective erythropoiesis
anemia of renal failure (also causing stem cell dysfunction)
other mechanisms of impaired rbc production
myelophthisic anemia or myelophthisis is a severe type of anemia resulting from the replacement of bone marrow by other materials such as malignant tumors or granulomas
myelodysplastic syndrome
anemia of chronic inflammation
=== increased destruction ===
anemias of increased red blood cell destruction are generally classified as hemolytic anemias these are generally featuring jaundice and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels
intrinsic (intracorpuscular) abnormalities cause premature destruction all of these except paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria are hereditary genetic disorders.hereditary spherocytosis is a hereditary defect that results in defects in the rbc cell membrane causing the erythrocytes to be sequestered and destroyed by the spleen
hereditary elliptocytosis is another defect in membrane skeleton proteins
abetalipoproteinemia causing defects in membrane lipids
enzyme deficiencies
pyruvate kinase and hexokinase deficiencies causing defect glycolysis
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and glutathione synthetase deficiency causing increased oxidative stress
hemoglobinopathies
sickle cell anemia
hemoglobinopathies causing unstable hemoglobins
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
extrinsic (extracorpuscular) abnormalities
antibody-mediated
warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia is caused by autoimmune attack against red blood cells primarily by igg it is the most common of the autoimmune hemolytic diseases it can be idiopathic that is without any known cause drug-associated or secondary to another disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or a malignancy such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia
cold agglutinin hemolytic anemia is primarily mediated by igm it can be idiopathic or result from an underlying condition
rh disease one of the causes of hemolytic disease of the newborn
transfusion reaction to blood transfusions
mechanical trauma to red cells
microangiopathic hemolytic anemias including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and disseminated intravascular coagulation
infections including malaria
heart surgery
haemodialysis
=== blood loss ===
anemia of prematurity from frequent blood sampling for laboratory testing combined with insufficient rbc production
trauma or surgery causing acute blood loss
gastrointestinal tract lesions causing either acute bleeds (e.g variceal lesions peptic ulcers or chronic blood loss (e.g angiodysplasia)
gynecologic disturbances also generally causing chronic blood loss
from menstruation mostly among young women or older women who have fibroids
infection by intestinal nematodes feeding on blood such as hookworms and the whipworm trichuris trichiura
=== fluid overload ===
fluid overload (hypervolemia) causes decreased hemoglobin concentration and apparent anemia
general causes of hypervolemia include excessive sodium or fluid intake sodium or water retention and fluid shift into the intravascular space
anemia of pregnancy is induced by blood volume expansion experienced in pregnancy
== diagnosis ==
anemia is typically diagnosed on a complete blood count apart from reporting the number of red blood cells and the hemoglobin level the automatic counters also measure the size of the red blood cells by flow cytometry which is an important tool in distinguishing between the causes of anemia examination of a stained blood smear using a microscope can also be helpful and it is sometimes a necessity in regions of the world where automated analysis is less accessible
in modern counters four parameters (rbc count hemoglobin concentration mcv and rdw) are measured allowing others (hematocrit mch and mchc) to be calculated and compared to values adjusted for age and sex some counters estimate hematocrit from direct measurements
reticulocyte counts and the kinetic approach to anemia have become more common than in the past in the large medical centers of the united states and some other wealthy nations in part because some automatic counters now have the capacity to include reticulocyte counts a reticulocyte count is a quantitative measure of the bone marrow's production of new red blood cells the reticulocyte production index is a calculation of the ratio between the level of anemia and the extent to which the reticulocyte count has risen in response if the degree of anemia is significant even a normal reticulocyte count actually may reflect an inadequate response if an automated count is not available a reticulocyte count can be done manually following special staining of the blood film in manual examination activity of the bone marrow can also be gauged qualitatively by subtle changes in the numbers and the morphology of young rbcs by examination under a microscope newly formed rbcs are usually slightly larger than older rbcs and show polychromasia even where the source of blood loss is obvious evaluation of erythropoiesis can help assess whether the bone marrow will be able to compensate for the loss and at what rate when the cause is not obvious clinicians use other tests such as esr ferritin serum iron transferrin rbc folate level serum vitamin b12 hemoglobin electrophoresis renal function tests (e.g serum creatinine) although the tests will depend on the clinical hypothesis that is being investigated when the diagnosis remains difficult a bone marrow examination allows direct examination of the precursors to red cells although is rarely used as is painful invasive and is hence reserved for cases where severe pathology needs to be determined or excluded
=== red blood cell size ===
in the morphological approach anemia is classified by the size of red blood cells this is either done automatically or on microscopic examination of a peripheral blood smear the size is reflected in the mean corpuscular volume (mcv) if the cells are smaller than normal (under 80 fl) the anemia is said to be microcytic if they are normal size (80100 fl) normocytic and if they are larger than normal (over 100 fl) the anemia is classified as macrocytic this scheme quickly exposes some of the most common causes of anemia for instance a microcytic anemia is often the result of iron deficiency in clinical workup the mcv will be one of the first pieces of information available so even among clinicians who consider the kinetic approach more useful philosophically morphology will remain an important element of classification and diagnosis limitations of mcv include cases where the underlying cause is due to a combination of factors - such as iron deficiency (a cause of microcytosis) and vitamin b12 deficiency (a cause of macrocytosis) where the net result can be normocytic cells
=== production vs destruction or loss ===
the kinetic approach to anemia yields arguably the most clinically relevant classification of anemia this classification depends on evaluation of several hematological parameters particularly the blood reticulocyte (precursor of mature rbcs) count this then yields the classification of defects by decreased rbc production versus increased rbc destruction and/or loss clinical signs of loss or destruction include abnormal peripheral blood smear with signs of hemolysis elevated ldh suggesting cell destruction or clinical signs of bleeding such as guaiac-positive stool radiographic findings or frank bleeding the following is a simplified schematic of this approach
* for instance sickle cell anemia with superimposed iron deficiency chronic gastric bleeding with b12 and folate deficiency and other instances of anemia with more than one cause.** confirm by repeating reticulocyte count ongoing combination of low reticulocyte production index normal mcv and hemolysis or loss may be seen in bone marrow failure or anemia of chronic disease with superimposed or related hemolysis or blood loss here is a schematic representation of how to consider anemia with mcv as the starting point
other characteristics visible on the peripheral smear may provide valuable clues about a more specific diagnosis for example abnormal white blood cells may point to a cause in the bone marrow
==== microcytic ====
microcytic anemia is primarily a result of hemoglobin synthesis failure/insufficiency which could be caused by several etiologies
heme synthesis defect
iron deficiency anemia (microcytosis is not always present)
anemia of chronic disease (more commonly presenting as normocytic anemia)
globin synthesis defect
alpha- and beta-thalassemia
hbe syndrome
hbc syndrome
various other unstable hemoglobin diseases
sideroblastic defect
hereditary sideroblastic anemia
acquired sideroblastic anemia including lead toxicity
reversible sideroblastic anemia
iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia overall and it has many causes rbcs often appear hypochromic (paler than usual) and microcytic (smaller than usual) when viewed with a microscope
iron deficiency anemia is due to insufficient dietary intake or absorption of iron to meet the body's needs infants toddlers and pregnant women have higher than average needs increased iron intake is also needed to offset blood losses due to digestive tract issues frequent blood donations or heavy menstrual periods iron is an essential part of hemoglobin and low iron levels result in decreased incorporation of hemoglobin into red blood cells in the united states 12% of all women of childbearing age have iron deficiency compared with only 2% of adult men the incidence is as high as 20% among african american and mexican american women studies have shown iron deficiency without anemia causes poor school performance and lower iq in teenage girls although this may be due to socioeconomic factors iron deficiency is the most prevalent deficiency state on a worldwide basis it is sometimes the cause of abnormal fissuring of the angular (corner) sections of the lips (angular stomatitis)
in the united states the most common cause of iron deficiency is bleeding or blood loss usually from the gastrointestinal tract fecal occult blood testing upper endoscopy and lower endoscopy should be performed to identify bleeding lesions in older men and women the chances are higher that bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract could be due to colon polyps or colorectal cancer
worldwide the most common cause of iron deficiency anemia is parasitic infestation (hookworms amebiasis schistosomiasis and whipworms)
the mentzer index (mean cell volume divided by the rbc count) predicts whether microcytic anemia may be due to iron deficiency or thallasemia although it requires confirmation
==== macrocytic ====
megaloblastic anemia the most common cause of macrocytic anemia is due to a deficiency of either vitamin b12 folic acid or both deficiency in folate and/or vitamin b12 can be due either to inadequate intake or insufficient absorption folate deficiency normally does not produce neurological symptoms while b12 deficiency does
pernicious anemia is caused by a lack of intrinsic factor which is required to absorb vitamin b12 from food a lack of intrinsic factor may arise from an autoimmune condition targeting the parietal cells (atrophic gastritis) that produce intrinsic factor or against intrinsic factor itself these lead to poor absorption of vitamin b12
macrocytic anemia can also be caused by removal of the functional portion of the stomach such as during gastric bypass surgery leading to reduced vitamin b12/folate absorption therefore one must always be aware of anemia following this procedure
hypothyroidism
alcoholism commonly causes a macrocytosis although not specifically anemia other types of liver disease can also cause macrocytosis
drugs such as methotrexate zidovudine and other substances may inhibit dna replication such as heavy metals (e.g lead)
macrocytic anemia can be further divided into megaloblastic anemia or nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemia the cause of megaloblastic anemia is primarily a failure of dna synthesis with preserved rna synthesis which results in restricted cell division of the progenitor cells the megaloblastic anemias often present with neutrophil hypersegmentation (six to 10 lobes) the nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemias have different etiologies (i.e unimpaired dna globin synthesis,) which occur for example in alcoholism in addition to the nonspecific symptoms of anemia specific features of vitamin b12 deficiency include peripheral neuropathy and subacute combined degeneration of the cord with resulting balance difficulties from posterior column spinal cord pathology other features may include a smooth red tongue and glossitis the treatment for vitamin b12-deficient anemia was first devised by william murphy who bled dogs to make them anemic and then fed them various substances to see what (if anything) would make them healthy again he discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to cure the disease george minot and george whipple then set about to isolate the curative substance chemically and ultimately were able to isolate the vitamin b12 from the liver all three shared the 1934 nobel prize in medicine
==== normocytic ====
normocytic anemia occurs when the overall hemoglobin levels are decreased but the red blood cell size (mean corpuscular volume) remains normal causes include
acute blood loss
anemia of chronic disease
aplastic anemia (bone marrow failure)
hemolytic anemia
==== dimorphic ====
a dimorphic appearance on a peripheral blood smear occurs when there are two simultaneous populations of red blood cells typically of different size and hemoglobin content (this last feature affecting the color of the red blood cell on a stained peripheral blood smear) for example a person recently transfused for iron deficiency would have small pale iron deficient red blood cells (rbcs) and the donor rbcs of normal size and color similarly a person transfused for severe folate or vitamin b12 deficiency would have two cell populations but in this case the patient's rbcs would be larger and paler than the donor's rbcs a person with sideroblastic anemia (a defect in heme synthesis commonly caused by alcoholism but also drugs/toxins nutritional deficiencies a few acquired and rare congenital diseases) can have a dimorphic smear from the sideroblastic anemia alone evidence for multiple causes appears with an elevated rbc distribution width (rdw) indicating a wider-than-normal range of red cell sizes also seen in common nutritional anemia
==== heinz body anemia ====
heinz bodies form in the cytoplasm of rbcs and appear as small dark dots under the microscope heinz body anemia has many causes and some forms can be drug-induced it is triggered in cats by eating onions or acetaminophen (paracetamol) it can be triggered in dogs by ingesting onions or zinc and in horses by ingesting dry red maple leaves
=== hyperanemia ===
hyperanemia is a severe form of anemia in which the hematocrit is below 10%
=== refractory anemia ===
refractory anemia an anemia which does not respond to treatment is often seen secondary to myelodysplastic syndromes iron deficiency anemia may also be refractory as a clinical manifestation of gastrointestinal problems which disrupt iron absorption or cause occult bleeding
== treatments ==
treatments for anemia depend on cause and severity vitamin supplements given orally (folic acid or vitamin b12) or intramuscularly (vitamin b12) will replace specific deficiencies
=== oral iron ===
nutritional iron deficiency is common in developing nations an estimated two-thirds of children and of women of childbearing age in most developing nations are estimated to suffer from iron deficiency one-third of them have the more severe form of the disorder anemia iron deficiency from nutritional causes is rare in men and postmenopausal women the diagnosis of iron deficiency mandates a search for potential sources of loss such as gastrointestinal bleeding from ulcers or colon cancer mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia is treated by oral iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate ferrous fumarate or ferrous gluconate when taking iron supplements stomach upset and/or darkening of the feces are commonly experienced the stomach upset can be alleviated by taking the iron with food however this decreases the amount of iron absorbed vitamin c aids in the body's ability to absorb iron so taking oral iron supplements with orange juice is of benefit
in anemias of chronic disease associated with chemotherapy or associated with renal disease some clinicians prescribe recombinant erythropoietin or epoetin alfa to stimulate rbc production although since there is also concurrent iron deficiency and inflammation present parenteral iron is advised to be taken concurrently
=== injectable iron ===
in cases where oral iron has either proven ineffective would be too slow (for example pre-operatively) or where absorption is impeded (for example in cases of inflammation) parenteral iron can be used the body can absorb up to 6 mg iron daily from the gastrointestinal tract in many cases the patient has a deficit of over 1,000 mg of iron which would require several months to replace this can be given concurrently with erythropoietin to ensure sufficient iron for increased rates of erythropoiesis
=== blood transfusions ===
blood transfusions in those without symptoms is not recommended until the hemoglobin is below 60 to 80 g/l (6 to 8 g/dl) in those with coronary artery disease who are not actively bleeding transfusions are only recommended when the hemoglobin is below 70 to 80g/l (7 to 8 g/dl) transfusing earlier does not improve survival
transfusions otherwise should only be undertaken in cases of cardiovascular instability
=== erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ===
the motive for the administration of an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (esa) is to maintain hemoglobin at the lowest level that both minimizes transfusions and meets the individual persons needs they should not be used for mild or moderate anemia they are not recommended in people with chronic kidney disease unless hemoglobin levels are less than 10 g/dl or they have symptoms of anemia their use should be along with parenteral iron
=== hyperbaric oxygen ===
treatment of exceptional blood loss (anemia) is recognized as an indication for hyperbaric oxygen (hbo) by the undersea and hyperbaric medical society the use of hbo is indicated when oxygen delivery to tissue is not sufficient in patients who cannot be given blood transfusions for medical or religious reasons hbo may be used for medical reasons when threat of blood product incompatibility or concern for transmissible disease are factors the beliefs of some religions (ex jehovah's witnesses) may require they use the hbo method a 2005 review of the use of hbo in severe anemia found all publications reported positive results
== epidemiology ==
a moderate degree of iron-deficiency anemia affected approximately 610 million people worldwide or 8.8% of the population it is slightly more common in females (9.9%) than males (7.8%) mild iron deficiency anemia affects another 375 million
== history ==
evidence of anemia goes back more than 4000 years
