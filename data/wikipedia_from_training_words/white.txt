the ancient greeks saw the world in terms of darkness and light so white was a fundamental color according to pliny the elder in his natural history apelles (4th century bc) and the other famous painters of ancient greece used only four colors in their paintings white red yellow and black for painting the greeks used lead white made by a long and laborious process
a plain white toga known as a toga virilis was worn for ceremonial occasions by all roman citizens over the age of 1418 magistrates and certain priests wore a toga praetexta with a broad purple stripe in the time of the emperor augustus no roman man was allowed to appear in the roman forum without a toga

the middle ages and the renaissance
=== 18th and 19th centuriesedit ===
white was the dominant color of architectural interiors in the baroque period and especially the rococo style that followed it in the 18th century church interiors were designed to show the power glory and wealth of the church they seemed to be alive filled with curves asymmetry mirrors gilding statuary and reliefs unified by white
white was also a fashionable color for both men and women in the 18th century men in the aristocracy and upper classes wore powdered white wigs and white stockings and women wore elaborate embroidered white and pastel gowns
after the french revolution a more austere white (blanc cass) became the most fashionable color in women's costumes which were modeled after the outfits of ancient greece and republican rome because of the rather revealing design of these dresses the ladies wearing them were called les merveilleuses (the marvellous) by french men of that era the empire style under emperor napolon i was modeled after the more conservative outfits of ancient imperial rome the dresses were high in fashion but low in warmth considering the more severe weather conditions of northern france in 1814 the former wife of napoleon josphine de beauharnais caught pneumonia and died after taking a walk in the cold night air with tsar alexander i of russia
white was the universal color of both men and women's underwear and of sheets in the 18th and 19th centuries it was unthinkable to have sheets or underwear of any other color the reason was simple the manner of washing linen in boiling water caused colors to fade when linen was worn out it was collected and turned into high-quality paper
the 19th-century american painter james mcneill whistler (18341903) working at the same time as the french impressionists created a series of paintings with musical titles where he used color to create moods the way composers used music his painting symphony in white no 1 - the white girl which used his mistress joanna hiffernan as a model used delicate colors to portray innocence and fragility and a moment of uncertainty
=== 20th and 21st centuriesedit ===
the white movement was the opposition that formed against the bolsheviks during the russian civil war which followed the russian revolution in 1917 it was finally defeated by the bolsheviks in 1921-22 and many of its members emigrated to europe
at the end of the 19th century lead white was still the most popular pigment but between 1916 and 1918 chemical companies in norway and the united states began to produce titanium white made from titanium oxide it had first been identified in the 18th century by the german chemist martin klaproth who also discovered uranium it had twice the covering power of lead white and was the brightest white pigment known by 1945 80 percent of the white pigments sold were titanium white
the absoluteness of white appealed to modernist painters it was used in its simplest form by the russian suprematist painter kazimir malevich in his 1917 painting the white square, the companion to his earlier black square. it was also used by the dutch modernist painter piet mondrian his most famous paintings consisted of a pure white canvas with grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and rectangles of primary colors
black and white also appealed to modernist architects such as le corbusier (18871965) he said a house was a machine for living in and called for a calm and powerful architecture built of reinforced concrete and steel without any ornament or frills almost all the buildings of contemporary architect richard meier such as his museum in rome to house the ancient roman ara pacis or altar of peace are stark white in the tradition of le corbusier

=== optics and white lightedit ===
white is the color the human visual system senses when the incoming light to the eye stimulates all three types of color sensitive cone cells in the eye in nearly equal amounts materials that do not emit light themselves appear white if their surfaces reflect back most of the light that strikes them in a diffuse way
in 1666 isaac newton demonstrated that white light could be broken up into its composite colors by passing it through a prism then using a second prism to reassemble them before newton most scientists believed that white was the fundamental color of light
white light can be generated by the sun by stars or by earthbound sources such as fluorescent lamps white leds and incandescent bulbs on the screen of a color television or computer white is produced by mixing the primary colors of light red green and blue (rgb) at full intensity a process called additive mixing (see image below) white light can be fabricated using light with only two wavelengths for instance by mixing light from a red and cyan laser or yellow and blue lasers this light will however have very few practical applications since color rendering of objects will be greatly distorted
the fact that light sources with vastly different spectral power distributions can result in a similar sensory experience is due to the way the light is processed by the visual system one color that arise from two different spectral power distributions is called a metamerism
the international commission on illumination defines white (adapted) as a color stimulus that an observer who is adapted to the viewing environment would judge to be perfectly achromatic and to have a luminance factor of unity the color stimulus that is considered to be the adapted white may be different at different locations within a scene
the adaptation mentioned in the cie definition above is the chromatic adaptation by which the same colored object in a scene experienced under very different illuminations will be perceived as having nearly the same color the same principle is used in photography and cinematography where the choice of white point determines a transformation of all other color stimuli changes in or manipulation of the white point can be used to explain some optical illusions such as the dress
many of the light sources that emit white light emit light at almost all visible wavelengths (sun light incandescent lamps of various color temperatures) this has led to the notion that white light can be defined as a mixture of all colors or all visible wavelengths this misconception is widespread and might originally stem from the fact that newton discovered that sunlight is composed of light with wavelengths across the visible spectrum concluding that since all colors produce white light then white must be made up of all colors is a common logical error called affirming the consequent which might be the cause of the misunderstanding
=== why snow clouds and beaches are whiteedit ===
snow is a mixture of air and tiny ice crystals when white sunlight enters snow very little of the spectrum is absorbed almost all of the light is reflected or scattered by the air and water molecules so the snow appears to be the color of sunlight white sometimes the light bounces around inside the ice crystals before being scattered making the snow seem to sparkle
in the case of glaciers the ice is more tightly pressed together and contains little air as sunlight enters the ice more light of the red spectrum is absorbed so the light scattered will be bluish
clouds are white for the same reason as ice they are composed of water droplets or ice crystals mixed with air very little light that strikes them is absorbed and most of the light is scattered appearing to the eye as white shadows of other clouds above can make clouds look gray and some clouds have their own shadow on the bottom of the cloud
many mountains with winter or year-round snow cover are named accordingly mauna kea means white mountain in hawaiian mont blanc means white mountain in french changbai mountains literally meaning perpetually white mountains marks the border between china and korea
beaches with sand containing high amounts of quartz or eroded limestone also appear white since quartz and limestone reflect or scatter sunlight rather than absorbing it tropical white sand beaches may also have a high quantity of white calcium carbonate from tiny bits of seashells ground to fine sand by the action of the waves
=== chemistry- white pigments and dyesedit ===
chalk is a kind of limestone made of the mineral calcite or calcium carbonate it was originally deposited under the sea as the scales or plates of tiny micro-organisms called coccolithophore it was the first white pigment used by prehistoric artists in cave paintings the chalk used on blackboards today is usually made of gypsum or calcium sulphate a powder pressed into sticks
bianco di san giovanni is a pigment used in the renaissance which was described by the painter cennino cennini in the 15th century it is similar to chalk made of calcium carbonate with calcium hydroxide it was made of dried lime which was made into a powder then soaked in water for eight days with the water changed each day it was then made into cakes and dried in the sun
lead white was being produced during the 4th century bc the process is described is pliny the elder vitruvius and the ancient greek author theophrastus pieces of lead were put into clay pots which had a separate compartment filled with vinegar the pots in turn were piled on shelves close to cow dung the combined fumes of the vinegar and the cow dung caused the lead to corrode into lead carbonate it was a slow process which could take a month or more it made an excellent white and was used by artists for centuries but it was also toxic it was replaced in the 19th century by zinc white and titanium white
titanium white is the most popular white for artists today it is the brightest available white pigment and has twice the coverage of lead white it first became commercially available in 1921 it is made out of titanium dioxide from the minerals brookite anatase rutile or ilmenite currently the major source because of its brilliant whiteness it is used as a colorant for most toothpaste and sunscreen
zinc white is made from zinc oxide it is similar to but not as opaque as titanium white it is added to some breakfast cereals since zinc is an important nutrient
some materials can be made to look whiter than white this is achieved using optical brightener agents (oba) these are chemical compounds that absorb light in the ultraviolet and violet region (usually 340-370 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and re-emit light in the blue region (typically 420-470 nm) obas are often used in paper and clothing to create an impression of very bright white this is due to the fact that the materials actually send out more visible light than they receive
chinese white is a variety of zinc white made for artists
=== bleach and bleachingedit ===
bleaching is a process for whitening fabrics which has been practiced for thousands of years sometimes it was simply a matter of leaving the fabric in the sun to be faded by the bright light in the 18th century several scientists developed varieties of chlorine bleach including sodium hypochlorite and calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder) bleaching agents that do not contain chlorine most often are based on peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate while most bleaches are oxidizing agents a fewer number are reducing agents such as sodium dithionite
bleaches attack the chromophores the part of a molecule which absorbs light and causes fabrics to have different colors an oxidizing bleach works by breaking the chemical bonds that make up the chromophore this changes the molecule into a different substance that either does not contain a chromophore or contains a chromophore that does not absorb visible light a reducing bleach works by converting double bonds in the chromophore into single bonds this eliminates the ability of the chromophore to absorb visible light
sunlight acts as a bleach through a similar process high energy photons of light often in the violet or ultraviolet range can disrupt the bonds in the chromophore rendering the resulting substance colorless
some detergents go one step further they contain fluorescent chemicals which glow making the fabric look literally whiter than white
=== astronomyedit ===
a white dwarf is a stellar remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter they are very dense a white dwarf's mass is comparable to that of the sun and its volume is comparable to that of the earth its faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy
a white dwarf is very hot when it is formed but since it has no source of energy it will gradually radiate away its energy and cool down this means that its radiation which initially has a high color temperature will lessen and redden with time over a very long time a white dwarf will cool to temperatures at which it will no longer emit significant heat or light and it will become a cold black dwarf however since no white dwarf can be older than the age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years) even the oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins and no black dwarfs are thought to exist yet
