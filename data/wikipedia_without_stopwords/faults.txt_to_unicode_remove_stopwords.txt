type level measurement taxonomy methodological character comparison example two states property may compared ratio difference ordinal preference type commonly explicitly expressed implicit definition measurement procedure magnitude numerical value characterization usually obtained suitably chosen measuring instrument unit assigns mathematical weighting factor magnitude derived ratio property artifact used standard natural physical quantity uncertainty represents random systemic errors measurement procedure indicates confidence level measurement errors evaluated methodically repeating measurements considering accuracy precision measuring instrument

massedit
mass refers intrinsic property material objects resist changes momentum weight hand refers downward force produced mass gravitational field free fall net gravitational forces objects lack weight retain mass imperial units mass include ounce pound ton metric units gram kilogram units mass
one device measuring weight mass called weighing scale often simply scale spring scale measures force mass balance compares weight require gravitational field operate accurate instruments measuring weight mass based load cells digital readout require gravitational field function would work free fall

difficultiesedit
since accurate measurement essential many fields since measurements necessarily approximations great deal effort must taken make measurements accurate possible example consider problem measuring time takes object fall distance one metre using physics shown gravitational field earth take object second fall one metre however following sources error arise
computation used acceleration gravity metres per second squared fts measurement exact precise two significant digits
earths gravitational field varies slightly depending height sea level factors
computation seconds involved extracting square root mathematical operation required rounding number significant digits case two significant digits
additionally sources experimental error include
carelessness
determining exact time object released exact time hits ground
measurement height measurement time involve error
air resistance
scientific experiments must carried great care eliminate much error possible keep error estimates realistic

concept measurement often misunderstood merely assignment value possible assign value way measurement terms requirements additive conjoint measurement one may assign value persons height unless established correlation measurements height empirical relations measurement according additive conjoint measurement theory likewise computing assigning arbitrary values like book value asset accounting measurement satisfy necessary criteria
information theoryedit
information theory recognises data inexact statistical nature thus definition measurement set observations reduce uncertainty result expressed quantity definition implied scientists actually measure something report mean statistics measurements practical terms one begins initial guess value quantity using various methods instruments reduces uncertainty value note view unlike positivist representational theory measurements uncertain instead assigning one value range values assigned measurement also implies clear neat distinction estimation measurement
