a rearrangement reaction is a broad class of organic reactions where the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged to give a structural isomer of the original molecule often a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in the same molecule in the example below the substituent r moves from carbon atom 1 to carbon atom 2
intermolecular rearrangements also take place
a rearrangement is not well represented by simple and discrete electron transfers (represented by curly arrows in organic chemistry texts) the actual mechanism of alkyl groups moving as in wagner-meerwein rearrangement probably involves transfer of the moving alkyl group fluidly along a bond not ionic bond-breaking and forming in pericyclic reactions explanation by orbital interactions give a better picture than simple discrete electron transfers it is nevertheless possible to draw the curved arrows for a sequence of discrete electron transfers that give the same result as a rearrangement reaction although these are not necessarily realistic in allylic rearrangement the reaction is indeed ionic
three key rearrangement reactions are 1,2-rearrangements pericyclic reactions and olefin metathesis
== 1,2-rearrangements ==
a 1,2-rearrangement is an organic reaction where a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in a chemical compound in a 1,2 shift the movement involves two adjacent atoms but moves over larger distances are possible examples are the wagner-meerwein rearrangement
and the beckmann rearrangement
== pericyclic reactions ==
a pericyclic reaction is a type of reaction with multiple carbon-carbon bond making and breaking wherein the transition state of the molecule has a cyclic geometry and the reaction progresses in a concerted fashion examples are hydride shifts
and the claisen rearrangement
== olefin metathesis ==
olefin metathesis is a formal exchange of the alkylidene fragments in two alkenes it is a catalytic reaction with carbene or more accurately transition metal carbene complex intermediates
in this example a vinyl compound is dimerized with the expulsion of ethene
