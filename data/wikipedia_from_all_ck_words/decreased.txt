trichothiodystrophy (ttd) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder characterised by brittle hair and intellectual impairment the word breaks down into tricho hair thio sulphur and dystrophy wasting away or literally bad nourishment ttd is associated with a range of symptoms connected with organs of the ectoderm and neuroectoderm ttd may be subclassified into four syndromes approximately half of all patients with trichothiodystrophy have photosensitivity which divides the classification into syndromes with or without photosensitivity bids and pbids and ibids and pibids modern covering usage is ttd-p (photosensitive) and ttd
== acronyms ==
features of ttd can include photosensitivity icthyosis brittle hair and nails intellectual impairment decreased fertility and short stature the acronyms pibids ibids bids and pbids give the initials of the words involved bids syndrome also called amish brittle hair brain syndrome and hair-brain syndrome is an autosomal recessive inherited disease it is nonphotosensitive bids is characterized by brittle hair intellectual impairment decreased fertility and short stature there is a photosensitive syndrome pbids
bids is associated with the gene mplkip (ttdn1)
ibids syndrome following the acronym from ichthyosis brittle hair and nails intellectual impairment and short stature is the tay syndrome or sulfur-deficient brittle hair syndrome first described by tay in 1971 (chong hai tay was the singaporean doctor who was the first doctor in south east asia to have a disease named after him) tay syndrome should not be confused with the tay-sachs disease it is an autosomal recessive congenital disease in some cases it can be diagnosed prenatally ibids syndrome is nonphotosensitive
the photosensitive form is referred to as pibids and is associated with ercc2 and ercc3
== photosensitive forms ==
all photosensitive ttd syndromes have defects in the nucleotide excision repair (ner) pathway which is a vital dna repair system that removes many kinds of dna lesions this defect is not present in the nonphotosensitive ttd's these type of defects can result in other rare autosomal recessive diseases like xeroderma pigmentosum and cockayne syndrome
