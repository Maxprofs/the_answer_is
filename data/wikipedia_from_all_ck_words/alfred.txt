== types of audiences ==
=== particular (real) audiences ===
in rhetoric some audiences depend on circumstance and situation and are characterized by the individuals that make up the audience sometimes these audiences are subject to persuasion and engage with the ideas of the speaker ranging in size and composition this audience may come together and form a composite of multiple groups
==== immediate audiences ====
an immediate audience is a type of audience that is composed of individuals who are face-to-face subjects with a speaker and a speakers rhetorical text or speech this audience directly listens to engages with and consumes the rhetorical text in an unmediated fashion in measuring immediate audience reception and feedback (audience measurement) one can depend on personal interviews applause and verbal comments made during and after a rhetorical speech
==== mediated audiences ====
in contrast to immediate audiences mediated audiences are composed of individuals who consume rhetorical texts in a manner that is different from the time or place in which a speaker presents text audiences who consume texts or speeches through television radio and internet are considered mediated audiences because those mediums separate the rhetor and the audience understanding the size and composition of mediated audiences can be difficult because mediums such as television radio and internet can displace the audience from the time and circumstance of a rhetorical text or speech in measuring mediated audience reception and feedback (a practice called audience measurement) one can depend on opinion polls and ratings as well as comments and forums that may be featured on a website
=== theoretical (imagined) audiences ===
theoretical audiences are imagined for the purpose of helping a speaker compose practice or a critic to understand a rhetorical text or speech

==== universal audience ====
the universal audience is an imagined audience that serves as an ethical and argumentative test for the rhetor this also requires the speaker to imagine a composite audience that contains individuals from diverse backgrounds and to discern whether or not the content of the rhetorical text or speech would appeal to individuals within that audience scholars perelman and olbrechts-tyteca ascertain that the content addressed to a universal audience must convince the reader that the reasons adduced are of a compelling character that they are self-evident and possess an absolute and timeless validity the concept of the universal audience has received criticism for being idealistic because it can be considered as an impediment in achieving persuasive effect with particular audiences yet it still may be useful as an ethical guide for a speaker and a critical tool for a reader or audience
==== ideal audience ====
an ideal audience is a rhetor's imagined intended audience in creating a rhetorical text a rhetor imagines is the target audience a group of individuals that will be addressed persuaded or affected by the speech or rhetorical text this type of audience is not necessarily imagined as the most receptive audience but as the future particular audience that the rhetor will engage with imagining such an audience allows a rhetor to formulate appeals that will grant success in engaging with the future particular audience in considering an ideal audience a rhetor can imagine future conditions of mediation size demographics and shared beliefs among the audience to be persuaded
==== implied audience ====
an implied audience is an imaginary audience determined by an auditor or reader as the text's constructed audience the implied audience is not the actual audience but the one that can be inferred by reading or analyzing the text communications scholar edwin black in his essay the second persona presents the theoretical concept of the implied audience using the idea of two personae the first persona is the implied rhetoric (the idea of the speaker formed by the audience) and the second persona is the implied audience (the idea of the audience formed by and utilized for persuasion in the speech situation) a critic could also determine what the text wants that audience to become or do after the rhetorical situation
