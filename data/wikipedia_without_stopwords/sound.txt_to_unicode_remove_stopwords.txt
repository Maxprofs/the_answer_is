physics sound
sound propagate compressible media air water solids longitudinal waves also transverse waves solids see longitudinal transverse waves sound waves generated sound source vibrating diaphragm stereo speaker sound source creates vibrations surrounding medium source continues vibrate medium vibrations propagate away source speed sound thus forming sound wave fixed distance source pressure velocity displacement medium vary time instant time pressure velocity displacement vary space note particles medium travel sound wave intuitively obvious solid true liquids gases vibrations particles gas liquid transport vibrations average position particles time change propagation waves reflected refracted attenuated medium
behavior sound propagation generally affected three things
relationship density pressure relationship affected temperature determines speed sound within medium
propagation also affected motion medium example sound moving wind independent motion sound medium medium moving sound transported
viscosity medium also affects motion sound waves determines rate sound attenuated many media air water attenuation due viscosity negligible
sound moving medium constant physical properties may refracted either dispersed focused
mechanical vibrations interpreted sound able travel forms matter gases liquids solids plasmas matter supports sound called medium sound cannot travel vacuum
longitudinal transverse waves
sound transmitted gases plasma liquids longitudinal waves also called compression waves requires medium propagate solids however transmitted longitudinal waves transverse waves longitudinal sound waves waves alternating pressure deviations equilibrium pressure causing local regions compression rarefaction transverse waves solids waves alternating shear stress right angle direction propagation
sound waves may viewed using parabolic mirrors objects produce sound
energy carried oscillating sound wave converts back forth potential energy extra compression case longitudinal waves lateral displacement strain case transverse waves matter kinetic energy displacement velocity particles medium
sound wave properties characteristics
sound waves often simplified description terms sinusoidal plane waves characterized generic properties
frequency inverse period
wavelength
wave number

sound pressure
sound intensity
speed sound
direction
sound perceptible humans frequencies hz hz air standard temperature pressure corresponding wavelengths sound waves range m mm sometimes speed direction combined velocity vector wave number direction combined wave vector
transverse waves also known shear waves additional property polarization characteristic sound waves
speed sound
speed sound depends medium waves pass fundamental property material first significant effort towards measure speed sound made newton believed speed sound particular substance equal square root pressure acting stp divided density
later proven wrong found incorrectly derive speed french mathematician laplace corrected formula deducing phenomenon sound travelling isothermal believed newton adiabatic added another factor equationgammaand multiplied thus coming equation since final equation came also known newtonlaplace equation equation k elastic bulk modulus c velocity sound density thus speed sound proportional square root ratio bulk modulus medium density
physical properties speed sound change ambient conditions example speed sound gases depends temperature c f air sea level speed sound approximately ms kmh mph using formula v ms fresh water also c speed sound approximately ms kmh mph steel speed sound ms kmh mph speed sound also slightly sensitive secondorder anharmonic effect sound amplitude means nonlinear propagation effects production harmonics mixed tones present original sound see parametric array
perception sound
distinct use term sound use physics physiology psychology term refers subject perception brain field psychoacoustics dedicated studies
physical reception sound hearing organism limited range frequencies humans normally hear sound frequencies approximately hz hz khz upper limit decreases age
species different range hearing example dogs perceive vibrations higher khz deaf hz signal perceived one major senses sound used many species detecting danger navigation predation communication earths atmosphere water virtually physical phenomenon fire rain wind surf earthquake produces characterized unique sounds many species frogs birds marine terrestrial mammals also developed special organs produce sound species produce song speech furthermore humans developed culture technology music telephone radio allows generate record transmit broadcast sound
sometimes sound refers vibrations frequencies within hearing range humans particular animal
elements sound perception
six experimentally separable ways sound waves analysed pitch duration loudness timbre texture spatial location
pitch perceived low high sound represents cyclic repetitive nature vibrations make sound
duration perceived long short sound relates onset offset signals created nerve responses sounds duration sound usually lasts time sound first noticed sound identified changed ceased
loudness perceived loud soft sound relates totalled number auditory nerve stimulations short cyclic time periods likely duration theta wave cycles
timbre perceived quality different sounds eg thud fallen rock whir drill tone musical instrument quality voice represents preconscious allocation sonic identity sound identity based information gained frequency transients noisiness unsteadiness perceived pitch spread intensity overtones sound extended time frame
texture relates cognitive separation auditory objects musical context represents number sound sources differentiated interaction
spatial location see sound localization represents cognitive placement sound environmental context including placement sound horizontal vertical plane distance sound source characteristics sonic environment
noise
noise term often used refer unwanted sound science engineering noise undesirable component obscures wanted signal
soundscape
soundscape component acoustic environment perceived humans acoustic environment combination sounds whether audible humans within given area modified environment
sound pressure level
sound pressure difference given medium average local pressure pressure sound wave square difference ie square deviation equilibrium pressure usually averaged time andor space square root average provides root mean square rms value example pa rms sound pressure dbspl atmospheric air implies actual pressure sound wave oscillates atm pa atm pa pa human ear detect sounds wide range amplitudes sound pressure often measured level logarithmic decibel scale sound pressure level spl lp defined
p rootmeansquare sound pressure reference sound pressure commonly used reference sound pressures defined standard ansi pa air pa water without specified reference sound pressure value expressed decibels cannot represent sound pressure level
since human ear flat spectral response sound pressures often frequency weighted measured level matches perceived levels closely international electrotechnical commission iec defined several weighting schemes aweighting attempts match response human ear noise aweighted sound pressure levels labeled dba cweighting used measure peak levels
