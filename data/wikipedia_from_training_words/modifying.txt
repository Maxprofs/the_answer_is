markedness /mkdns/ a term that originated in linguistics is the state of standing out as unusual or difficult in comparison to a more common or regular form in a markedunmarked relation one term of an opposition is the broader dominant one the dominant default or minimum-effort form is known as unmarked the other secondary one is marked in other words markedness involves the characterization of a normal linguistic unit against one or more of its possible irregular forms
in linguistics markedness can apply to among others phonological grammatical and semantic oppositions defining them in terms of marked and unmarked oppositions such as honest (unmarked) vs dishonest (marked) marking may be purely semantic or may be realized as extra morphology the term derives from the marking of a grammatical role with a suffix or another element and has been extended to situations where there is no morphological distinction
in social sciences more broadly markedness is among other things used to distinguish two meanings of the same term where one is common usage (unmarked sense) and the other is specialized to a certain cultural context (marked sense)
== marked and unmarked word pairsedit ==
in terms of lexical opposites marked form is a non-basic often one with inflectional or derivational endings thus a morphologically negative word form is marked as opposed to a positive one happy/unhappy honest/dishonest fair/unfair clean/unclean and so forth similarly unaffixed masculine or singular forms are taken to be unmarked in contrast to affixed feminine or plural forms lion/lioness host/hostess automobile/automobiles child/children an unmarked form is also a default form for example the unmarked lion can refer to a male or female while lioness is marked because it can refer only to females
the default nature allows unmarked lexical forms to be identified even when the opposites are not morphologically related in the pairs old/young big/little happy/sad clean/dirty the first term of each pair is taken as unmarked because it occurs generally in questions for example english speakers typically ask how old (big happy clean) something or someone is to use the marked term presupposes youth smallness unhappiness or dirtiness
== background in the prague schooledit ==
while the idea of linguistic asymmetry predated the actual coining of the terms marked and unmarked the modern concept of markedness originated in the prague school structuralism of roman jakobson and nikolai trubetzkoy as a means of characterizing binary oppositions both sound and meaning were analyzed into systems of binary distinctive features edwin battistella said binarism suggests symmetry and equivalence in linguistic analysis markedness adds the idea of hierarchy. trubetzkoy and jakobson analyzed phonological oppositions such as nasal versus non-nasal as defined as the presence versus the absence of nasality the presence of the feature nasality was marked its absence non-nasality was unmarked for jakobson and trubetzkoy binary phonological features formed part of a universal feature alphabet applicable to all languages in his 1932 article structure of the russian verb jakobson extended the concept to grammatical meanings in which the marked element announces the existence of [some meaning] a while the unmarked element does not announce the existence of a i.e. does not state whether a is present or not forty years later jakobson described language by saying that every single constituent of a linguistic system is built on an opposition of two logical contradictories the presence of an attribute ('markedness') in contraposition to its absence ('unmarkedness').
in his 1941 child language aphasia and universals of language jakobson suggested that phonological markedness played a role in language acquisition and loss drawing on existing studies of acquisition and aphasia jakobson suggested a mirror-image relationship determined by a universal feature hierarchy of marked and unmarked oppositions today many still see jakobson's theory of phonological acquisition as identifying useful tendencies
== jakobsonian traditionedit ==
the work of cornelius van schooneveld edna andrews rodney sangster yishai tobin and others on semantic invariance (different general meanings reflected in the contextual specific meanings of features) has further developed the semantic analysis of grammatical items in terms of marked and unmarked features other semiotically-oriented work has investigated the isomorphism of form and meaning with less emphasis on invariance including the efforts of henning andersen michael shapiro and edwin battistella shapiro and andrews have especially made connections between the semiotic of c s peirce and markedness treating it as as species of interpretant in peirce's sign-object-interpretant triad
functional linguists such as thomas givon have suggested that markedness is related to cognitive complexity"in terms of attention mental effort or processing time linguistic naturalists view markedness relations in terms of the ways in which extralinguistic principles of perceptibility and psychological efficiency determine what is natural in language willi mayerthaler another linguist for example defines unmarked categories as those in agreement with the typical attributes of the speaker
== cultural markednessedit ==
since a main component of markedness is the information content and information value of an element some studies have taken markedness as an encoding of that which is unusual or informative and this is reflected in formal probabilistic definitions of markedness and informedness (as chance-correct unidirectional components of the matthews correlation coefficient corresponding to deltap and deltap conceptual familiarity with cultural norms provided by familiar categories creates a ground against which marked categories provide a figure opening the way for markedness to be applied to cultural and social categorization
as early as the 1930s jakobson had already suggested applying markedness to all oppositions explicitly mentioning such pairs as life/death liberty/bondage sin/virtue and holiday/working day linda waugh extended this to oppositions like male/female white/black sighted/blind hearing/deaf heterosexual/homosexual right/left fertility/barrenness clothed/nude and spoken language/written language battistella expanded this with the demonstration of how cultures align markedness values to create cohesive symbol systems illustrating with examples based on rodney needham's work other work has applied markedness to stylistics music and myth
== local markedness and markedness reversalsedit ==
markedness depends on context what is more marked in some general contexts may be less marked in other local contexts thus ant is less marked than ants on the morphological level but on the semantic (and frequency) levels it may be more marked since ants are more often encountered many at once than one at a time often a more general markedness relation may be reversed in a particular context thus voicelessness of consonants is typically unmarked but between vowels or in the neighborhood of voiced consonants voicing may be the expected or unmarked value
reversal is reflected in certain frisian words plural and singular forms in frisian nouns with irregular singular-plural stem variations are undergoing regularization usually this means that the plural is reformed to be a regular form of the singular
old paradigm koal (coal) kwallen (coals) regularized forms koal (coal) koalen (coals)
however a number of words instead reform the singular by extending the form of the plural
old paradigm earm (arm) jermen (arms) regularized forms jerm (arm) jermen (arms)
the common feature of the nouns that regularize the singular to match the plural is that they occur more often in pairs or groups than singly they are said to be semantically (but not morphologically) locally unmarked in the plural
== universals and frequencyedit ==
joseph greenberg's 1966 book language universals was an influential application of markedness to typological linguistics and a break from the tradition of jakobson and trubetzkoy greenberg took frequency to be the primary determining factor of markedness in grammar and suggested that unmarked categories could be determined by the frequency of association of things in the real world
greenberg also applied frequency cross-linguistically suggesting that unmarked categories would be those that are unmarked in a wide number of languages however critics have argued that frequency is problematic because categories that are cross-linguistically infrequent may have a high distribution in a particular language
more recently the insights related to frequency have been formalized as chance-corrected conditional probabilities with informedness (deltap') and markedness (deltap) corresponding to the different directions of prediction in human association research (binary associations or distinctions) and more generally (including features with more than two distinctions)
universals have also been connected to implicational laws this entails that a category is taken as marked if every language that has the marked category also has the unmarked one but not vice versa
== diagnosticsedit ==
markedness has been extended and reshaped over the past century and reflects a range of loosely connected theoretical approaches from emerging in the analysis of binary oppositions it has become a global semiotic principle a means of encoding naturalness and language universals and a terminology for studying defaults and preferences in language acquisition what connects various approaches is a concern for the evaluation of linguistic structure though the details of how markedness is determined and what its implications and diagnostics are varies widely other approaches to universal markedness relations focus on functional economic and iconic motivations tying recurring symmetries to properties of communication channels and communication events croft (1990) for example notes that asymmetries among linguistic elements may be explainable in terms economy of form in terms of iconism between the structure of language and conceptualization of the world
== markedness in generative grammaredit ==
markedness entered generative linguistic theory through chomsky and halle's the sound pattern of english for chomsky and halle phonological features went beyond a universal phonetic vocabulary to encompass an evaluation metric a means of selecting the most highly-valued adequate grammar in the sound pattern of english the value of a grammar was the inverse of the number of features required in that grammar however chomsky and halle realized that their initial approach to phonological features made implausible rules and segment inventories as highly valued as natural ones the unmarked value of a feature was cost-free with respect to the evaluation metric while the marked feature values were counted by the metric segment inventories could also be evaluated according to the number of marked features however the use of phonological markedness as part of the evaluation metric was never able to fully account for the fact that some features are more likely than others or for the fact that phonological systems must have a certain minimal complexity and symmetry
in generative syntax markedness as feature-evaluation did not receive the same attention that it did in phonology chomsky came to view unmarked properties as an innate preference structure based first in constraints and later in parameters of universal grammar in their 1977 article filters and control chomsky and howard lasnik extended this to view markedness as part of a theory of core grammar
we will assume that [universal grammar] in not an undifferentiated system but rather incorporates something analogous to a theory of markedness specifically there is a theory of core grammar with highly restricted options limited expressive power and a few parameters systems that fall within core grammar constitute the unmarked case we may think of them as optimal in terms of the evaluation metric an actual language is determined by fixing the parameters of core grammar and then adding rules or conditions using much richer resources  these added properties of grammars we may think of as the syntactic analogue of irregular verbs
a few years later chomsky describes it thus
the distinction between core and periphery leaves us with three notions of markedness core versus periphery internal to the core and internal to the periphery the second has to do with the way parameters are set in the absence of evidence as for the third there are no doubt significant regularities even in departures from the core principles (for example in irregular verb morphology in english) and it may be that peripheral constructions are related to the core in systematic ways say by relaxing certain conditions of core grammar
some generative researchers have applied markedness to second-language acquisition theory treating it as an inherent learning hierarchy which reflects the sequence in which constructions are acquired the difficulty of acquiring certain constructions and the transferability of rules across languages more recently optimality theory approaches emerging in the 1990s have incorporated markedness in the ranking of constraints
