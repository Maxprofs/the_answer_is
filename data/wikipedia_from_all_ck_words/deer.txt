deer (singular and plural) are the ruminant mammals forming the family cervidae species in the family include the white-tailed deer mule deer (such as the black-tailed deer) elk moose red deer reindeer (caribou) fallow deer roe deer pud and chital male deer of all species (except the chinese water deer) and female reindeer grow and shed new antlers each year in this they differ from permanently horned animals such as antelope which are in the same order as deer and may bear a superficial resemblance to them
the musk deer of asia and water chevrotain (or mouse deer) of tropical african and asian forests are not usually regarded as true deer and form their own families moschidae and tragulidae respectively
== terminologyedit ==
the word deer was originally broader in meaning but became more specific over time in middle english der (old english dor) meant a wild animal of any kind this was in contrast to cattle which then meant any sort of domestic livestock that was easy to collect and remove from the land from the idea of personal-property ownership (rather than real estate property) and related to modern chattel (property) and capital cognates of old english dor in other dead germanic languages have the general sense of animal such as old high german tior old norse djur or dr gothic dius old saxon dier and old frisian diar
this general sense gave way to the modern english sense by the end of the middle english period around 1500 however all modern germanic languages save english and scots retain the more general sense for example german tier alemannic diere or tiere pennsylvania dutch gedier dutch dier afrikaans dier limburgish diere norwegian dyr swedish djur danish dyr icelandic dr faroese dr west frisian dier and north frisian diarten all of which mean animal (however contrary to south european languages dama in latin and daim in french mean fallow deer only)
for most types of deer in modern english usage the male is called a buck and the female is termed a doe but the terms vary with dialect and especially according to the size of the species for many larger deer the male is termed a stag while for other larger deer the same words are used as for cattle bull and cow the male red deer is a hart especially if more than five years old and the female is a hind especially if three or more years old both terms can also be used for any species of deer and were widely so used in the past terms for young deer vary similarly with those of the smallest species being called a fawn and of the largest species calf young of the smallest kinds may be a kid a castrated male deer is a havier a group of deer of any kind is a herd the adjective of relation pertaining to deer is cervine like the family name cervidae this is from latin cervus meaning deer
== habitatedit ==
deer live in a variety of biomes ranging from tundra to the tropical rainforest while often associated with forests many deer are ecotone species that live in transitional areas between forests and thickets (for cover) and prairie and savanna (open space) the majority of large deer species inhabit temperate mixed deciduous forest mountain mixed coniferous forest tropical seasonal/dry forest and savanna habitats around the world clearing open areas within forests to some extent may actually benefit deer populations by exposing the understory and allowing the types of grasses weeds and herbs to grow that deer like to eat additionally access to adjacent croplands may also benefit deer however adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for populations to grow and thrive
deer are widely distributed with indigenous representatives in all continents except antarctica and australia though africa has only one native deer the barbary stag a subspecies of red deer that is confined to the atlas mountains in the northwest of the continent however fallow deer have been introduced to south africa small species of brocket deer and puds of central and south america and muntjacs of asia generally occupy dense forests and are less often seen in open spaces with the possible exception of the indian muntjac there are also several species of deer that are highly specialized and live almost exclusively in mountains grasslands swamps and wet savannas or riparian corridors surrounded by deserts some deer have a circumpolar distribution in both north america and eurasia examples include the caribou that live in arctic tundra and taiga (boreal forests) and moose that inhabit taiga and adjacent areas huemul deer (taruca and chilean huemul) of south america's andes fill the ecological niches of the ibex and wild goat with the fawns behaving more like goat kids
the highest concentration of large deer species in temperate north america lies in the canadian rocky mountain and columbia mountain regions between alberta and british columbia where all five north american deer species (white-tailed deer mule deer caribou elk and moose) can be found this region has several clusters of national parks including mount revelstoke national park glacier national park (canada) yoho national park and kootenay national park on the british columbia side and banff national park jasper national park and glacier national park (u.s.) on the alberta and montana sides mountain slope habitats vary from moist coniferous/mixed forested habitats to dry subalpine/pine forests with alpine meadows higher up the foothills and river valleys between the mountain ranges provide a mosaic of cropland and deciduous parklands the rare woodland caribou have the most restricted range living at higher altitudes in the subalpine meadows and alpine tundra areas of some of the mountain ranges elk and mule deer both migrate between the alpine meadows and lower coniferous forests and tend to be most common in this region elk also inhabit river valley bottomlands which they share with white-tailed deer the white-tailed deer have recently expanded their range within the foothills and river valley bottoms of the canadian rockies owing to conversion of land to cropland and the clearing of coniferous forests allowing more deciduous vegetation to grow up the mountain slopes they also live in the aspen parklands north of calgary and edmonton where they share habitat with the moose the adjacent great plains grassland habitats are left to herds of elk american bison and pronghorn antelope
the eurasian continent (including the indian subcontinent) boasts the most species of deer in the world with most species being found in asia europe in comparison has lower diversity in plant and animal species however many national parks and protected reserves in europe do have populations of red deer roe deer and fallow deer these species have long been associated with the continent of europe but also inhabit asia minor the caucasus mountains and northwestern iran european fallow deer historically lived over much of europe during the ice ages but afterwards became restricted primarily to the anatolian peninsula in present-day turkey
present-day fallow deer populations in europe are a result of historic man-made introductions of this species first to the mediterranean regions of europe then eventually to the rest of europe they were initially park animals that later escaped and reestablished themselves in the wild historically europe's deer species shared their deciduous forest habitat with other herbivores such as the extinct tarpan (forest horse) extinct aurochs (forest ox) and the endangered wisent (european bison) good places to see deer in europe include the scottish highlands the austrian alps the wetlands between austria hungary and the czech republic and some fine national parks including doana national park in spain the veluwe in the netherlands the ardennes in belgium and biaowiea national park of poland spain eastern europe and the caucasus mountains still have virgin forest areas that are not only home to sizable deer populations but also for other animals that were once abundant such as the wisent eurasian lynx iberian lynx wolves and brown bears
the highest concentration of large deer species in temperate asia occurs in the mixed deciduous forests mountain coniferous forests and taiga bordering north korea manchuria (northeastern china) and the ussuri region (russia) these are among some of the richest deciduous and coniferous forests in the world where one can find siberian roe deer sika deer elk and moose asian caribou occupy the northern fringes of this region along the sino-russian border
deer such as the sika deer thorold's deer central asian red deer and elk have historically been farmed for their antlers by han chinese turkic peoples tungusic peoples mongolians and koreans like the sami people of finland and scandinavia the tungusic peoples mongolians and turkic peoples of southern siberia northern mongolia and the ussuri region have also taken to raising semi-domesticated herds of asian caribou
the highest concentration of large deer species in the tropics occurs in southern asia in india's indo-gangetic plain region and nepal's terai region these fertile plains consist of tropical seasonal moist deciduous dry deciduous forests and both dry and wet savannas that are home to chital hog deer barasingha indian sambar and indian muntjac grazing species such as the endangered barasingha and very common chital are gregarious and live in large herds indian sambar can be gregarious but are usually solitary or live in smaller herds hog deer are solitary and have lower densities than indian muntjac deer can be seen in several national parks in india nepal and sri lanka of which kanha national park dudhwa national park and chitwan national park are most famous sri lanka's wilpattu national park and yala national park have large herds of indian sambar and chital the indian sambar are more gregarious in sri lanka than other parts of their range and tend to form larger herds than elsewhere
the chao praya river valley of thailand was once primarily tropical seasonal moist deciduous forest and wet savanna that hosted populations of hog deer the now-extinct schomburgk's deer eld's deer indian sambar and indian muntjac both the hog deer and eld's deer are rare whereas indian sambar and indian muntjac thrive in protected national parks such as khao yai many of these south asian and southeast asian deer species also share their habitat with other herbivores such as asian elephants the various asian rhinoceros species various antelope species (such as nilgai four-horned antelope blackbuck and indian gazelle in india) and wild oxen (such as wild asian water buffalo gaur banteng and kouprey) one way that different herbivores can survive together in a given area is for each species to have different food preferences although there may be some overlap
australia has six introduced species of deer that have established sustainable wild populations from acclimatisation society releases in the 19th century these are the fallow deer red deer sambar hog deer rusa and chital red deer introduced into new zealand in 1851 from english and scottish stock were domesticated in deer farms by the late 1960s and are common farm animals there now seven other species of deer were introduced into new zealand but none are as widespread as red deer
== descriptionedit ==
deer weights generally range from 30 to 300 kg (70 to 700 lb) the smallest species the northern pud averages 10 kg (20 lb) and the largest the moose averages 431 kg (1,000 lb) they generally have lithe compact bodies and long powerful legs suited for rugged woodland terrain deer are also excellent jumpers and swimmers deer are ruminants or cud-chewers and have a four-chambered stomach the teeth of deer are adapted to feeding on vegetation and like other ruminants they lack upper incisors instead having a tough pad at the front of their upper jaw some deer such as those on the island of rm do consume meat when it is available
the chinese water deer tufted deer and muntjac have enlarged upper canine teeth forming sharp tusks while other species often lack upper canines altogether the cheek teeth of deer have crescent ridges of enamel which enable them to grind a wide variety of vegetation the dental formula for deer is 0.0-1.3.33.1.3.3
nearly all deer have a facial gland in front of each eye the gland contains a strongly scented pheromone used to mark its home range bucks of a wide range of species open these glands wide when angry or excited all deer have a liver without a gallbladder deer also have a tapetum lucidum which gives them sufficiently good night vision
=== antlersedit ===
with the exception of the chinese water deer which have tusks all male deer have antlers sometimes a female has a small stub the only female deer with antlers are reindeer (caribou) antlers grow as highly vascular spongy tissue covered in a skin called velvet before the beginning of a species mating season the antlers calcify under the velvet and become hard bone the deer rubs off the velvet leaving dead bone which forms the hard antlers after the mating season the pedicle and the antler base are separated by a layer of softer tissue and the antler falls off
one way that many hunters are able to track main paths that the deer travel on is because of their rubs the deer rub trees to deposit scent from glands near the eye and forehead and physically mark territory
during the mating season bucks use their antlers to fight one another for the opportunity to attract mates in a given herd the two bucks circle each other bend back their legs lower their heads and charge the tines on the antlers create grooves that allow another male's antlers to lock into place this allows the males to wrestle without risking injury to the face
antlers can be a sign of genetic quality males with larger antlers relative to body size tend to have increased resistance to pathogens and higher reproductive capacity necropsy research on wild deer that were killed and eaten by wolves shows that deer with asymmetric antlers are weakened by genetic defects and are less likely to escape being caught by predators
each species has its own characteristic antler structure for example white-tailed deer antlers include a series of tines sprouting upward from a forward-curving main beam while fallow deer and moose antlers are palmate with a broad central portion mule deer and black-tailed deer species within the same genus as the white-tailed deer have bifurcated (or branched) antlersthat is the main beam splits into two each of which may split into two more young males of many deer and the adults of some species such as brocket deer and pudus have antlers that are single spikes

==== piebald deeredit ====
a piebald deer is a deer with a brown and white spotting pattern that is not caused by parasites or diseases they can appear to be almost entirely white in addition to the non-standard coloration other differences have been observed bowing or roman nose overly arched spine (scoliosis) long tails short legs and underbites
==== white deeredit ====
seneca county new york maintains the largest herd of white deer white pigmented white-tailed deer began populating the deer population in what is now known as the conservation area of the former seneca army depot the u.s army gave the white deer protection while managing the normal-colored deer through hunting the white deer coloration is the result of a recessive gene
a herd of white fallow deer is located near argonne national laboratories in northern illinois
white tail fawns are born a brown or tan color with a spotted white pattern sometimes these fawns can be born with a grey appearance making them seem dirty the coats become pure white in the middle of their second year and they are sometimes mistaken for albino deer
albino whitetail deer appear to have pink skin with a pure white coat and the irises of their eyes are usually pink as well there is no such thing as a partial albino true albino deer have little or no melanin in their bodies their color is mainly white because it lacks any pigments making the skin appear pink because the flowing blood can be seen through the skin their white coats make them especially vulnerable to predators
== biologyedit ==
=== dietedit ===
deer are browsers and feed primarily on leaves they have small unspecialized stomachs by ruminant standards and high nutrition requirements rather than eating and digesting vast quantities of low-grade fibrous food as for example sheep and cattle do deer select easily digestible shoots young leaves fresh grasses soft twigs fruit fungi and lichens the low-fibered food after minimal fermentation and shredding passes rapidly through the alimentary canal the deer require a large amount of minerals such as calcium and phosphate in order to support antler growth and this further necessitates a nutrient-rich diet
=== reproductionedit ===
nearly all cervids are so-called uniparental species the fawns are only cared for by the mother known as a doe a doe generally has one or two fawns at a time (triplets while not unknown are uncommon) the gestation period is anywhere up to ten months for the european roe deer most fawns are born with their fur covered with white spots though in many species they lose these spots by the end of their first winter in the first twenty minutes of a fawn's life the fawn begins to take its first steps its mother licks it clean until it is almost free of scent so predators will not find it its mother leaves often to graze and the fawn does not like to be left behind sometimes its mother must gently push it down with her foot the fawn stays hidden in the grass for one week until it is strong enough to walk with its mother the fawn and its mother stay together for about one year a male usually leaves and never sees his mother again but females sometimes come back with their own fawns and form small herds
== evolutionedit ==
the evolution of deer took about 30 million years there are not many prominent fossils to trace this evolution but only fragments of skeletons and antlers that might be easily confused with false antlers of non-cervid species biologist valerius geist suggests evolution to have taken place in stages the earliest stage featured a poorly defined omnivore of the palaeogene that gave rise to deer-like species that lacked antlers but bore horns such as protoceras towards the neogene the protoceras was 1 m (3.3 ft) tall with small horns syndyoceras also shared similar features common with the deer horse giraffe and antelope fossils dated approximately 35 million years ago which were found in north america show it had bony skull outgrowths that resembled non-deciduous antlers
by the late oligocene saber-toothed deer had evolved from gelocids (early pecoran ruminants) in the early miocene muntjacs the first antler-bearing deer made their appearance in eurasia in 1994 fossils of a large muntjac megamuntjacus vuquangensis were excavated in the annamite range(vietnam) similar evidence has also been discovered in laos and cambodia the early muntjacs varied in size - as small as hares or as large as fallow deer they had tusks for fighting and antlers for defense
later species were often larger with more impressive antlers and in many cases no upper canine teeth they rapidly spread to the other continents for a time they occupied much of northern africa but are now almost wholly absent from that continent some extinct deer had huge antlers larger than those of any living species examples include eucladoceros and the giant deer megaloceros whose antlers stretched to 3.5 m (11 ft) across another animal also thought to be related to the deer is the world's oldest known antler-shedding deer dicrocerus elegans this animal's sediment deposits are found in european soil dating back to between 1530 million years ago yet another distant ancestor is thought to be archaeomeryx
== taxonomyedit ==
till the end of the twentieth century it was assumed that the family moschidae (musk deer) was a sister group to cervidae however molecular analysis has revealed that moschidae has a closer relationship to bovidae rather than to cervidae it has been estimated that cervidae diverged from moschidae and bovidae 27 to 28 million years ago
=== extant subfamilies genera and speciesedit ===
the deer family has at least 90 species the list is based on several molecular and phylogenetic studies by elisabeth vrba colin groves and peter grubb among others note that the terms indicate the origin of the groups not their modern distribution the water deer for example is a new world species but today is found only in china and korea the family cervidae is organized as follows

=== hybrid deeredit ===
in on the origin of species (1859) charles darwin wrote although i do not know of any thoroughly well-authenticated cases of perfectly fertile hybrid animals i have some reason to believe that the hybrids from cervulus vaginalis and reevesii [...] are perfectly fertile. these two varieties of muntjac are currently considered the same species
a number of deer hybrids are bred to improve meat yield in farmed deer american elk (or wapiti) and red deer from the old world can produce fertile offspring in captivity and were once considered one species hybrid offspring however must be able to escape and defend themselves against predators and these hybrid offspring are unable to do so in the wild state recent dna animal behavior studies and morphology and antler characteristics have shown there are not one but three species of red deer european red deer central asian red deer and american elk the european elk is a different species and is known as moose in north america the hybrids are about 30% more efficient in producing antlers by comparing velvet to body weight wapiti have been introduced into some european red deer herds to improve the red deer type but not always with the intended improvement
in new zealand where deer are introduced species there are hybrid zones between red deer and north american wapiti populations and also between red deer and sika deer populations in new zealand red deer have been artificially hybridized with pre david deer in order to create a farmed deer that gives birth in spring the initial hybrids were created by artificial insemination and back-crossed to red deer however such hybrid offspring can only survive in captivity free of predators
in canada the farming of european red deer and red deer hybrids is considered a threat to native wapiti in britain the introduced sika deer is considered a threat to native red deer initial sika deer/red deer hybrids occur when young sika stags expand their range into established red deer areas and have no sika hinds to mate with they mate instead with young red hinds and produce fertile hybrids these hybrids mate with either sika or red deer (depending which species is prevalent in the area) resulting in mongrelization many of the sika deer that escaped from british parks were probably already hybrids for this reason these hybrids do not properly inherit survival strategies and can only survive in either a captive state or when there are no predators
in captivity mule deer have been mated to white-tail deer both male mule deer/female white-tailed deer and male white-tailed deer/female mule deer matings have produced hybrids less than 50% of the hybrid fawns survived their first few months hybrids have been reported in the wild but are disadvantaged because they don't properly inherit survival strategies mule deer move with bounding leaps (all four hooves hit the ground at once also called stotting") to escape predators stotting is so specialized that only 100% genetically pure mule deer seem able to do it in captive hybrids even a one-eighth white-tail/seven-eighths mule deer hybrid has an erratic escape behaviour and would be unlikely to survive to breeding age hybrids do survive on game ranches where both species are kept and where predators are controlled by man
== human interactionedit ==
=== in historyedit ===
