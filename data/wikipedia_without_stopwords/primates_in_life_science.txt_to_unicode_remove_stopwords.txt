order primates traditionally divided two main groupings prosimians anthropoids simians prosimians characteristics like earliest primates include lemurs madagascar lorisoids tarsiers simians include monkeys apes hominins recently taxonomists preferred split primates suborder strepsirrhini wetnosed primates consisting nontarsier prosimians suborder haplorhini drynosed primates consisting tarsiers simians
simians divided two groups catarrhine narrownosed monkeys apes africa southeastern asia platyrrhine flatnosed new world monkeys south central america catarrhines consist old world monkeys baboons macaques gibbons great apes new world monkeys include capuchin howler squirrel monkeys humans extant catarrhines spread successfully outside africa south asia east asia although fossil evidence shows many species formerly present europe new primate species still discovered species taxonomically described decade eleven described since

historical modern terminologyedit
relationships among different groups primates clearly understood relatively recently commonly used terms somewhat confused example ape used either alternative monkey tailless relatively humanlike primate
sir wilfrid le gros clark one primatologists developed idea trends primate evolution methodology arranging living members order ascending series leading humans commonly used names groups primates prosimians monkeys lesser apes great apes reflect methodology according current understanding evolutionary history primates several groups paraphyletic paraphyletic group one include descendants groups common ancestor
contrast clarks methodology modern classifications typically identify name groupings monophyletic named group includes descendants groups common ancestor
cladogram shows one possible classification sequence living primates groups use common traditional names shown right
groups scientific names monophyletic clades sequence scientific classification reflects evolutionary history related lineages traditionally named groups shown right form ascending series per clark see several groups paraphyletic
prosimians contain two monophyletic groups suborder strepsirrhini lemurs lorises allies well tarsiers suborder haplorhini paraphyletic grouping excludes simiiformes also descendants common ancestor primates
monkeys comprise two monophyletic groups new world monkeys old world monkeys paraphyletic excludes hominoids superfamily hominoidea also descendants common ancestor simiiformes
apes whole great apes particular paraphyletic exclude humans
thus members two sets groups hence names match causes problems relating scientific names common usually traditional names consider superfamily hominoidea terms common names right group consists apes humans single common name members group one remedy create new common name case hominoids another possibility expand use one traditional names example book vertebrate palaeontologist benton wrote apes hominoidea today include gibbons orangutan gorilla chimpanzee humans thereby benton using apes mean hominoids case group heretofore called apes must identified nonhuman apes
consensus methodology rule whether accept traditional common paraphyletic names use monophyletic names use new common names adaptations old ones competing approaches found biological sources often work sometimes author thus benton defines apes include humans repeatedly uses apelike mean like ape rather human discussing reaction others new fossil writes claims orrorin ape rather human

social systemsedit
primates among social animals forming pairs family groups unimale harems multimalemultifemale groups richard wrangham stated social systems nonhuman primates best classified amount movement females occurring groups proposed four categories
female transfer systems females move away group born females group closely related whereas males remained natal groups close association may influential social behavior groups formed generally quite small organization seen chimpanzees males typically related cooperate defense groups territory among new world monkeys spider monkeys muriquis use system
male transfer systems females remain natal groups males emigrate adolescents polygynous multimale societies classed category group sizes usually larger system common among ringtailed lemur capuchin monkeys cercopithecine monkeys
monogamous species malefemale bond sometimes accompanied juvenile offspring shared responsibility parental care territorial defense offspring leaves parents territory adolescence gibbons essentially use system although monogamy context necessarily mean absolute sexual fidelity
solitary species often males defend territories include home ranges several females type organization found prosimians slow loris orangutans defend territory effectively organization
systems known occur well example howler monkeys males females typically transfer natal group reaching sexual maturity resulting groups neither males females typically related prosimians colobine monkeys callitrichid monkeys use system
transfer females andor males native group likely adaptation avoiding inbreeding analysis breeding records captive primate colonies representing numerous different species indicates infant mortality inbred young generally higher noninbred young effect inbreeding infant mortality probably largely result increased expression deleterious recessive alleles see inbreeding depression
