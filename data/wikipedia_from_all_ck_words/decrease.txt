the word dcret literally decree is an old legal usage in france and is used to refer to orders issued by the french president or prime minister any such order must not violate the french constitution or code of law of france and a party has the right to request an order be nullified in the french council of state orders must be ratified by parliament before they can be modified into legislative acts special orders known as dcret-loi literally decree-act or decree-law usually considered an illegal practice under the 3rd and 4th republic were finally abolished and replaced by the ordinances under the 1958 constitution
except for the reserve powers of the president (as stated in art 16 of the 1958 constitution exercised only once so far) the executive can issue decrees in areas that the constitution grants as the responsibility of parliament only if a law authorizes it to do so in other cases orders are illegal and should anyone sue for the order's nullification it would be voided by the council of state there exists a procedure for the prime minister to issue ordinances in such areas but this procedure requires parliament's express consent (see art 38 of the 1958 constitution)
orders issued by the prime minister take two forms
orders (dcrets simples)
orders-in-council (dcrets en conseil d'tat) when a statute mandates the advisory consultation of the conseil d'tat
sometimes people refer to dcrets en conseil d'tat improperly as dcrets du conseil d'tat this would imply that it is the conseil d'tat that takes the decree whereas the power of decreeing is restricted to the president or prime minister the role of the administrative sections of the conseil is purely advisory
decrees may be classified into
regulations which may be
application decrees (dcrets d'application) each of which must be specifically authorized by one or more statutes to determine some implementation conditions of this or these statutes these constitute secondary legislation and are roughly equivalent to british statutory instruments
autonomous regulations (rglement autonomes) which may be taken only in areas where the constitution of france does not impose statute law (passed by the legislature) these constitute primary legislation
particular measures such as the nomination of high-level civil servants
only the prime minister may issue regulatory or application decrees presidential decrees are generally nominations or exceptional measures where law mandates a presidential decree such as the dissolution of the french national assembly and the calling of new legislative elections
decrees are published in the journal officiel de la rpublique franaise or french gazette
