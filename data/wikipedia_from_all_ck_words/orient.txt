the orient means the east it is a traditional designation for anything that belongs to the eastern world or the middle east (aka near east) or the far east in relation to europe in english it is largely a metonym for and coterminous with the continent of asia in france and other countries of western europe it also denominates the countries of north africa
== derivationedit ==
the term orient derives from the latin word oriens meaning east (lit rising < orior  rise") the use of the word for rising to refer to the east (where the sun rises) has analogs from many languages compare the terms levant (< french levant rising") vostok russian (< russian voskhod russian sunrise") anatolia (< greek anatole) mizrahi in hebrew ("zriha meaning sunrise) sharq arabic (< arabic yashriq rise shurq arabic rising") shygys kazakh (< kazakh shygu kazakh come out") turkish dou (< turkish domak to be born to rise) chinese (pinyin dng a pictograph of the sun rising behind a tree) and the land of the rising sun to refer to japan also many ancient temples including pagan temples and the jewish temple in jerusalem were built with their main entrances facing the east this tradition was carried on in christian churches to situate them in such a manner was to orient them in the proper direction when something was facing the correct direction it was said to be in the proper orientation
another explanation of the term stems from rome during the roman empire specifically the eastern roman empire or the roman orient during the byzantine empire although the original east-west (or orient-occitan) line was the italian peninsulas east coast around 600 ad the city of rome would eventually be adopted as the latitude and longitude marker for distinguishing the boundaries of what would become the occitan-christian roman empire north and west of the city (throughout europe western europe and occidental europe) from the pagan based oriental roman empire in the south and east (southern italy north africa and the medio oriente (the middle [of the] east)) any area below the city of rome was considered the orient as well as the ethnicities inhabiting the land such as dalmatian italians (modern neapolitans along with sicilians tunisians moroccans greeks etc.) as well as everything east of southern italy hence the italian name italia nord-orientale (in english northeast italy) for le tre venezie (the 3 venice's) located above the roman latitude line separating it from modern abruzzo the beginning of the orient in the east while lazio is its beginning in the west of the italian peninsula
the opposite term occident derives from the latin word occidens meaning west (lit setting < occido fall/set) this term meant the west (where the sun sets) but has fallen into disuse in english in favor of western world
== history of the termedit ==
in the later roman empire the praefectura praetorio orientis the praetorian prefecture of the east included most of the eastern roman empire from the eastern balkans eastwards its easternmost part was the diocese of the east the dioecesis orientis corresponding roughly to the region of syria over time the common understanding of the orient has continually shifted eastwards as european people traveled farther into asia it finally reached the pacific ocean in what westerners came to call the far east these shifts in time and identification sometimes confuse the scope (historical and geographic) of oriental studies yet there remain contexts where the orient and oriental have kept their older meanings (e.g. oriental spices typically are from the regions extending from the middle east to sub-continental india to indo-china) travelers may again take the orient express train from paris to its terminus in the european part of istanbul a route established in the early 20th century
in european historiography the meaning of the orient changed in scope several times originally the term referred to egypt the levant and adjoining areas later the term became synonymous with islam and judaism and its scope expanded both eastward and westward to include all non-european areas of eurasian civilization including north africa as far west as morocco during the 1800s india and to a lesser extent china began to displace the levant as the primary subject of orientalist research by the mid-20th century western scholars generally considered the orient as just east asia southeast asia and eastern central asia as recently as the early 20th century the term orient often continued to be used in ways that included north africa and even parts of southeastern europe today the term primarily evokes images of china korea japan vietnam and peninsular southeast asia throughout the history of the changing sense of the term the orient was never equivalent to asia as a whole the orient being largely a cultural term large parts of asiasiberia most notablywere excluded from the scholarly notion of the orient
equally valid terms for the orient still exist in the english language in such collocations as oriental studies (now asian studies in some countries)
the adjectival term oriental has been used by the west to mean cultures peoples countries and goods from the orient oriental means generally eastern it is a traditional designation (especially when capitalized) for anything belonging to the orient or east (for asia) and especially of its eastern culture it indicated the eastern direction in historical astronomy often abbreviated ori in contemporary american english oriental usually refers to things from the parts of east asia traditionally occupied by east asians and most central asians and southeast asians racially categorized as mongoloid this excludes jews indians arabs and most other south or west asian peoples because of historical discrimination against chinese and japanese in some parts of the united states some people consider the term derogatory for example washington state prohibits the word oriental in legislation and government documents preferring the word asian instead
in more local uses oriental is also used for eastern parts of portions of the mediterranean sea for example morocco's oriental region oriental is also used as an adjective akin to eastern especially in the spanish-speaking world for example the philippine islands of mindoro and negros are each divided into two provinces whose titles include the words oriental and occidental respectively the official name of uruguay is the repblica oriental del uruguay or oriental republic of uruguay because it is east of the uruguay river
since the 19th century orientalist has been the traditional term for a scholar of oriental studies however the use in english of orientalism to describe academic oriental studies is rare the oxford english dictionary cites only one such usage by lord byron in 1812 orientalism is more widely used to refer to the works of the many 19th-century artists who specialized in oriental subjects often drawing on their travels to north africa and western asia artists as well as scholars were already described as orientalists in the 19th century in 1978 palestinian-american scholar edward said published his influential and controversial book orientalism he used the term to describe a pervasive western tradition both academic and artistic of prejudiced outsider interpretations of the arab and muslim worlds shaped by the attitudes of european imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries
