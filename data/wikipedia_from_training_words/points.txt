a swamp is a wetland that is forested many swamps occur along large rivers where they are critically dependent upon natural water level fluctuations other swamps occur on the shores of large lakes some swamps have hammocks or dry-land protrusions covered by aquatic vegetation or vegetation that tolerates periodic inundation the two main types of swamp are true or swamp forests and transitional or shrub swamps in the boreal regions of canada the word swamp is colloquially used for what is more correctly termed a bog or muskeg the water of a swamp may be fresh water brackish water or seawater some of the world's largest swamps are found along major rivers such as the amazon the mississippi and the congo
== geomorphology and hydrology ==
swamps are characterized by slow-moving to stagnant waters they are usually associated with adjacent rivers or lakes swamps are features of areas with very low topographic relief
== draining ==
historically humans have drained swamps to provide additional land for agriculture and to reduce the threat of diseases borne by swamp insects and similar animals many swamps have also undergone intensive logging requiring the construction of drainage ditches and canals these ditches and canals contributed to drainage and along the coast allowed salt water to intrude converting swamps to marsh or even to open water large areas of swamp were therefore lost or degraded louisiana provides a classic example of wetland loss from these combined factors europe has probably lost nearly half its wetlands new zealand lost 90 percent of its wetlands over a period of 150 years ecologists recognise that swamps provide valuable ecological services including flood control fish production water purification carbon storage and wildlife habitat in many parts of the world authorities protect swamps in parts of europe and north america swamp restoration projects are becoming widespread often the simplest steps to restoring swamps involve plugging drainage ditches and removing levees
== land value productivity and conservation ==
swamps and other wetlands have traditionally held a very low property value compared to fields prairies or woodlands they have a reputation for being unproductive land that cannot easily be utilized for human activities other than perhaps hunting and trapping farmers for example typically drained swamps next to their fields so as to gain more land usable for planting crops
many societies now realize that swamps are critically important to providing fresh water and oxygen to all life and that they are often breeding grounds for a wide variety of life indeed floodplain swamps are extremely important in fish production government environmental agencies (such as the united states environmental protection agency) are taking steps to protect and preserve swamps and other wetlands in europe major effort is being invested in the restoration of swamp forests along rivers conservationists work to preserve swamps such as those in northwest indiana in the united states midwest that were preserved as part of the indiana dunes
