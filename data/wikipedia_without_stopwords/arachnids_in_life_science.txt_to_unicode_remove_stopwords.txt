arachnids class arachnida jointlegged invertebrate animals arthropods subphylum chelicerata arachnids eight legs although front pair legs species converted sensory function species different appendages grow large enough take appearance extra pairs legs term derived greek word archn meaning spider
almost extant arachnids terrestrial however inhabit freshwater environments exception pelagic zone marine environments well comprise named species including spiders scorpions harvestmen ticks mites solifuges
morphologyedit
almost adult arachnids eight legs arachnids may easily distinguished insects fact since insects six legs however arachnids also two pairs appendages become adapted feeding defense sensory perception first pair chelicerae serve feeding defense next pair appendages pedipalps adapted feeding locomotion andor reproductive functions solifugae palps quite leglike animals appear ten legs larvae mites ricinulei six legs fourth pair usually appears moult nymphs however mites variable well eight adult mites six even four legs
arachnids distinguished insects fact antennae wings body organized two tagmata called prosoma cephalothorax opisthosoma abdomen cephalothorax derived fusion cephalon head thorax usually covered single unsegmented carapace abdomen segmented primitive forms varying degrees fusion segments occur many groups typically divided preabdomen postabdomen although clearly visible scorpions orders acari abdominal sections completely fused
like arthropods arachnids exoskeleton also internal structure cartilagelike tissue called endosternite certain muscle groups attached endosternite even calcified opiliones
locomotionedit
arachnids lack extensor muscles distal joints appendages spiders whipscorpions extend limbs hydraulically using pressure hemolymph solifuges harvestmen extend knees use highly elastic thickenings joint cuticle scorpions pseudoscorpions harvestmen evolved muscles extend two leg joints femurpatella patellatibia joints equivalent joints pedipalps scorpions though extended elastic recoil
physiologyedit
characteristics particularly important terrestrial lifestyle arachnids internal respiratory surfaces form tracheae modification book gill book lung internal series vascular lamellae used gas exchange air tracheae often individual systems tubes similar insects ricnuleids pseudoscorpions spiders possess sieve tracheae several tubes arise bundle small chamber connected spiracle type tracheal system almost certainly evolved book lungs indicates tracheae arachnids homologous insects
adaptations terrestrial life appendages modified efficient locomotion land internal fertilisation special sensory organs water conservation enhanced efficient excretory structures well waxy layer covering cuticle
excretory glands arachnids include four pairs coxal glands along side prosoma one two pairs malpighian tubules emptying gut many arachnids one type excretory gland although several primary nitrogenous waste product arachnids guanine
arachnid blood variable composition depending mode respiration arachnids efficient tracheal system need transport oxygen blood may reduced circulatory system scorpions spiders however blood contains haemocyanin copperbased pigment similar function haemoglobin vertebrates heart located forward part abdomen may may segmented mites heart
diet digestive systemedit
arachnids mostly carnivorous feeding predigested bodies insects small animals harvestmen among mites house dust mite ingestion solid food particles thus exposure internal parasites although unusual spiders eat silk several groups secrete venom specialized glands kill prey enemies several mites parasites carriers disease
arachnids produce digestive juices stomachs use pedipalps chelicerae pour dead prey digestive juices rapidly turn prey broth nutrients arachnid sucks prebuccal cavity located immediately front mouth behind mouth muscular sclerotised pharynx acts pump sucking food mouth oesophagus stomach arachnids oesophagus also acts additional pump
stomach tubular shape multiple diverticula extending throughout body stomach diverticula produce digestive enzymes absorb nutrients food extends body connects short sclerotised intestine anus hind part abdomen
sensesedit
arachnids two kinds eyes lateral median ocelli lateral ocelli evolved compound eyes may tapetum enhances ability collect light exception scorpions five pairs lateral ocelli never three pairs present median ocelli develop transverse fold ectoderm ancestors modern arachnids probably types modern ones often lack one type cornea eye also acts lens continuous cuticle body beneath transparent vitreous body retina present tapetum arachnids retina probably enough light sensitive cells allow eyes form proper image
addition eyes almost arachnids two types sensory organs important arachnids fine sensory hairs cover body give animal sense touch relatively simple many arachnids also possess complex structures called trichobothria
finally slit sense organs slitlike pits covered thin membrane inside pit small hair touches underside membrane detects motion slit sense organs believed involved proprioception possibly also hearing
reproductionedit
arachnids may one two gonads located abdomen genital opening usually located underside second abdominal segment species male transfers sperm female package spermatophore complex courtship rituals evolved many arachnids ensure safe delivery sperm female
arachnids usually lay yolky eggs hatch immatures resemble adults scorpions however either ovoviviparous viviparous depending species bear live young
