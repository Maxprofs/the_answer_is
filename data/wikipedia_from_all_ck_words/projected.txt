we said we're just going to go in here and have fun with this we had a bunch of songs lying around that we wanted to take in originally it was just going to be me going in there and doing most everything the more we talked about it and the more we got together a game plan and studio time the more we kind of started talking about hey scott remember ten years ago when we first talked about doing that thing that side project well what are you doing in march? [laughs] literally it was pretty much that erock [eric friedman] was like hey man i want to get in on this. i had already talked to vinnie about doing it because we knew that [fellow sevendust members] morgan rose and clint lowery were going to be doing call me no one it literally came together for lack of a better description and explanation for how it really happened it wasn't like i sat down and said here is my top fifty drummers that i'm going to go after here's my top 25 guitar players it wasn't that at all it was just us saying hey man let's just go in and do what we always said we were going to do. i think the end result at the end of the day surprised us just as much as it surprised everyone else
