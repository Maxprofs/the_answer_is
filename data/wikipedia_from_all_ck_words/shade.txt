broadcasting is the distribution of audio and/or video content to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves) in a one-to-many model broadcasting began with am radio broadcasting which came into popular use starting with the invention of the crystal detector in 1906 before this all forms of electronic communication radio telephone and telegraph were one-to-one with the message intended for a single recipient the term broadcasting borrowed from the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about was coined by either kdka manager frank conrad or rca historian george clark around 1920 to distinguish this new activity of one-to-many communication a single radio station transmitting to multiple listeners
over the air broadcasting is usually associated with radio and television though in practice radio and television transmissions take place using both wires and radio waves the receiving parties may include the general public or a relatively small subset the point is that anyone with the appropriate receiving technology can receive the signal the field of broadcasting includes a wide range of practices from relatively private exchanges such as public radio community radio and commercial radio public television and commercial television
u.s code of federal regulations title 47 part 97 defines broadcasting as transmissions intended for reception by the general public either direct or relayed private or two-way telecommunications transmissions do not qualify under this definition for example amateur ("ham") and citizens band (cb) radio operators are not allowed to broadcast as defined transmitting and broadcasting are not the same
transmission of radio and television programs from a radio or television station to home receivers over the spectrum is referred to as ota (over the air) or terrestrial broadcasting and in most countries requires a broadcasting license transmissions using a combination of satellite and wired transmission like cable television (which also retransmits ota stations with their consent) are also considered broadcasts and do not require a license transmissions of television and radio via streaming digital technology have increasingly been referred to as broadcasting as well though strictly speaking this is incorrect
== historyedit ==
the earliest broadcasting consisted of sending telegraph signals over the airwaves using morse code this was particularly important for ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communication but it became increasingly important for business and general news reporting and as an arena for personal communication by radio amateurs (douglas op cit.) audio broadcasting began experimentally in the first decade of the 20th century by the early 1920s radio broadcasting became a household medium at first on the am band and later on fm television broadcasting started experimentally in the 1920s and became widespread after world war ii using vhf and uhf spectrum satellite broadcasting was initiated in the 1960s and moved into general industry usage in the 1970s with dbs (direct broadcast satellites) emerging in the 1980s
originally all broadcasting was composed of analog signals using analog transmission techniques but more recently broadcasters have switched to digital signals using digital transmission in general usage broadcasting most frequently refers to the transmission of information and entertainment programming from various sources to the general public
analog audio vs hd radio
analog television vs digital television
wireless
the world's technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks more than quadrupled during the two decades from 1986 to 2007 from 432 exabytes of (optimally compressed) information to 1.9 zettabytes this is the information equivalent of 55 newspapers per person per day in 1986 and 175 newspapers per person per day by 2007
== methods of broadcastingedit ==
historically there have been several methods used for broadcasting electronic media audio and/or video to the general public
telephone broadcasting (18811932) the earliest form of electronic broadcasting (not counting data services offered by stock telegraph companies from 1867 if ticker-tapes are excluded from the definition) telephone broadcasting began with the advent of thtrophone ("theatre phone") systems which were telephone-based distribution systems allowing subscribers to listen to live opera and theatre performances over telephone lines created by french inventor clment ader in 1881 telephone broadcasting also grew to include telephone newspaper services for news and entertainment programming which were introduced in the 1890s primarily located in large european cities these telephone-based subscription services were the first examples of electrical/electronic broadcasting and offered a wide variety of programming
radio broadcasting (experimentally from 1906 commercially from 1920) audio signals sent through the air as radio waves from a transmitter picked up by an antenna and sent to a receiver radio stations can be linked in radio networks to broadcast common radio programs either in broadcast syndication simulcast or subchannels
television broadcasting (telecast) experimentally from 1925 commercially from the 1930s an extension of radio to include video signals
cable radio (also called cable fm from 1928) and cable television (from 1932) both via coaxial cable originally serving principally as transmission media for programming produced at either radio or television stations but later expanding into a broad universe of cable-originated channels
direct-broadcast satellite (dbs) (from c 1974) and satellite radio (from c 1990) meant for direct-to-home broadcast programming (as opposed to studio network uplinks and downlinks) provides a mix of traditional radio or television broadcast programming or both with dedicated satellite radio programming (see also satellite television)
webcasting of video/television (from c 1993) and audio/radio (from c 1994) streams offers a mix of traditional radio and television station broadcast programming with dedicated internet radio
== economic modelsedit ==
there are several means of providing financial support for continuous broadcasting
commercial broadcasting for-profit usually privately owned stations channels networks or services providing programming to the public supported by the sale of time to advertisers for radio or television advertisements during or in breaks between programs often in combination with cable or pay cable subscription fees
public broadcasting usually non-profit publicly owned stations or networks supported by license fees government funds grants from foundations corporate underwriting and audience memberships and/or contributions or a combination of these
community broadcasting
broadcasters may rely on a combination of these business models for example in the united states national public radio (npr) and the public broadcasting service (pbs television) supplement public membership subscriptions and grants with funding from the corporation for public broadcasting (cpb) which is allocated bi-annually by congress
us public broadcasting corporate and charitable grants are generally given in consideration of underwriting spots which differ from commercial advertisements in that they are governed by specific fcc restrictions which prohibit the advocacy of a product or a call to action
== recorded broadcasts and live broadcastsedit ==
the first regular television broadcasts started in 1937 broadcasts can be classified as recorded or live the former allows correcting errors and removing superfluous or undesired material rearranging it applying slow-motion and repetitions and other techniques to enhance the program however some live events like sports television can include some of the aspects including slow-motion clips of important goals/hits etc. in between the live television telecast
american radio-network broadcasters habitually forbade prerecorded broadcasts in the 1930s and 1940s requiring radio programs played for the eastern and central time zones to be repeated three hours later for the pacific time zone (see effects of time on north american broadcasting) this restriction was dropped for special occasions as in the case of the german dirigible airship hindenburg disaster at lakehurst new jersey in 1937 during world war ii prerecorded broadcasts from war correspondents were allowed on u.s radio in addition american radio programs were recorded for playback by armed forces radio radio stations around the world
a disadvantage of recording first is that the public may know the outcome of an event from another source which may be a spoiler in addition prerecording prevents live radio announcers from deviating from an officially approved script as occurred with propaganda broadcasts from germany in the 1940s and with radio moscow in the 1980s
many events are advertised as being live although they are often recorded live (sometimes called live-to-tape") this is particularly true of performances of musical artists on radio when they visit for an in-studio concert performance similar situations have occurred in television production ("the cosby show is recorded in front of a live television studio audience") and news broadcasting
a broadcast may be distributed through several physical means if coming directly from the radio studio at a single station or television station it is simply sent through the studio/transmitter link to the transmitter and hence from the television antenna located on the radio masts and towers out to the world programming may also come through a communications satellite played either live or recorded for later transmission networks of stations may simulcast the same programming at the same time originally via microwave link now usually by satellite
distribution to stations or networks may also be through physical media such as magnetic tape compact disc (cd) dvd and sometimes other formats usually these are included in another broadcast such as when electronic news gathering (eng) returns a story to the station for inclusion on a news programme
the final leg of broadcast distribution is how the signal gets to the listener or viewer it may come over the air as with a radio station or television station to an antenna and radio receiver or may come through cable television or cable radio (or wireless cable") via the station or directly from a network the internet may also bring either internet radio or streaming media television to the recipient especially with multicasting allowing the signal and bandwidth to be shared
the term broadcast network is often used to distinguish networks that broadcast an over-the-air television signals that can be received using a tuner (television) inside a television set with a television antenna from so-called networks that are broadcast only via cable television (cablecast) or satellite television that uses a dish antenna the term broadcast television can refer to the television programs of such networks

the sequencing of content in a broadcast is called a schedule as with all technological endeavors a number of technical terms and slang have developed a list of these terms can be found at list of broadcasting terms television and radio programs are distributed through radio broadcasting or cable often both simultaneously by coding signals and having a cable converter box with decoding equipment in homes the latter also enables subscription-based channels pay-tv and pay-per-view services
in his essay john durham peters wrote that communication is a tool used for dissemination durham stated dissemination is a lenssometimes a usefully distorting onethat helps us tackle basic issues such as interaction presence and space and time...on the agenda of any future communication theory in general (durham 211) dissemination focuses on the message being relayed from one main source to one large audience without the exchange of dialogue in between there's chance for the message to be tweaked or corrupted once the main source releases it there is really no way to predetermine how the larger population or audience will absorb the message they can choose to listen analyze or simply ignore it dissemination in communication is widely used in the world of broadcasting
broadcasting focuses on getting one message out and it is up to the general public to do what they wish with it durham also states that broadcasting is used to address an open ended destination (durham 212) there are many forms of broadcast but they all aim to distribute a signal that will reach the target audience broadcasting can arrange audiences into entire assemblies (durham 213)
in terms of media broadcasting a radio show can gather a large number of followers who tune in every day to specifically listen to that specific disc jockey the disc jockey follows the script for his or her radio show and just talks into the microphone he or she does not expect immediate feedback from any listeners the message is broadcast across airwaves throughout the community but there the listeners cannot always respond immediately especially since many radio shows are recorded prior to the actual air time
