waxing is a form of semi-permanent hair removal which removes the hair from the root new hair will not grow back in the previously waxed area for four to six weeks although some people will start to see regrowth in only a week due to some of their hair being on a different growth cycle almost any area of the body can be waxed including eyebrows face pubic area (called bikini waxing) legs arms back abdomen and feet there are many types of waxing suitable for removing unwanted hair
strip waxing (soft wax) is accomplished by spreading a wax thinly over the skin a cloth or paper strip is applied and pressed firmly adhering the strip to the wax and the wax to the skin the strip is then quickly ripped against the direction of hair growth as parallel as possible to the skin to avoid trauma to the skin (i.e. bruising broken capillaries ingrown hairs caused by hair follicle trauma and lifting of skin) this removes the wax along with the hair
strip-less wax (as opposed to strip wax) also referred to as hard wax is applied somewhat thickly and with no cloth or paper strips the wax then hardens when it cools thus allowing the easy removal by a therapist without the aid of cloths this waxing method is very beneficial to people who have sensitive skin strip-less wax does not adhere to the skin as much as strip wax does thus making it a good option for sensitive skin as finer hairs are more easily removed because the hard wax encapsulates the hair as it hardens the strip-less waxing method can also be less painful
