c is the third letter in the english alphabet and a letter of the alphabets of many other writing systems which inherited it from the latin alphabet it is also the third letter of the iso basic latin alphabet it is named cee (pronounced /si/) in english
== history ==
c comes from the same letter as g the semites named it gimel the sign is possibly adapted from an egyptian hieroglyph for a staff sling which may have been the meaning of the name gimel another possibility is that it depicted a camel the semitic name for which was gamal barry b powell a specialist in the history of writing states it is hard to imagine how gimel = camel can be derived from the picture of a camel (it may show his hump or his head and neck!)
in the etruscan language plosive consonants had no contrastive voicing so the greek  (gamma) was adopted into the etruscan alphabet to represent /k/ already in the western greek alphabet gamma first took a  form in early etruscan then  in classical etruscan in latin it eventually took the c form in classical latin in the earliest latin inscriptions the letters c k q were used to represent the sounds /k/ and // (which were not differentiated in writing) of these q was used to represent /k/ or // before a rounded vowel k before a and c elsewhere during the 3rd century bc a modified character was introduced for // and c itself was retained for /k/ the use of c (and its variant g') replaced most usages of k and q hence in the classical period and after g was treated as the equivalent of greek gamma and c as the equivalent of kappa this shows in the romanization of greek words as in kamo kypo and ki came into latin as cadmvs cyrvs and phocis respectively
other alphabets have letters homoglyphic to c but not analogous in use and derivation like the cyrillic letter es ( ) which derives from the lunate sigma named due to its resemblance to the crescent moon
== later use ==
when the roman alphabet was introduced into britain c represented only /k/ and this value of the letter has been retained in loanwords to all the insular celtic languages in welsh irish gaelic c represents only /k/ the old english latin-based writing system was learned from the celts apparently of ireland hence c in old english also originally represented /k/ the modern english words kin break broken thick and seek all come from old english words written with c cyn brecan brocen icc and soc but during the course of the old english period /k/ before front vowels (/e/ and /i/) were palatalized having changed by the tenth century to [t] though c was still used as in cir(i)ce wrecc(e)a on the continent meanwhile a similar phonetic change had also been going on (for example in italian)
in vulgar latin /k/ became palatalized to [t] in italy and dalmatia in france and the iberian peninsula it became [ts] yet for these new sounds c was still used before the letters e and i the letter thus represented two distinct values subsequently the latin phoneme /k/ (spelled qv) de-labialized to /k/ meaning that the various romance languages had /k/ before front vowels in addition norman used the letter k so that the sound /k/ could be represented by either k or c the latter of which could represent either /k/ or /ts/ depending on whether it preceded a front vowel letter or not the convention of using both c and k was applied to the writing of english after the norman conquest causing a considerable re-spelling of the old english words thus while old english candel clif corn crop c remained unchanged cent c (c) cyng brece soce were now (without any change of sound) spelled kent ke kyng breke and seoke even cniht ('knight') was subsequently changed to kniht and ic ('thick') changed to thik or thikk the old english cw was also at length displaced by the french qu so that the old english cwn ('queen') and cwic ('quick') became middle english quen quik respectively the sound [t] to which old english palatalized /k/ had advanced also occurred in french chiefly from latin /k/ before a in french it was represented by the digraph ch as in champ (from latin camp-um) and this spelling was introduced into english the hatton gospels written about 1160 have in matt i-iii child chyld riche mychel for the cild rice mycel of the old english version whence they were copied in these cases the old english c gave place to k qu ch but on the other hand c in its new value of /ts/ came in largely in french words like processiun emperice grace and was also substituted for ts in a few old english words as miltse bletsien in early middle english milce blecien by the end of the thirteenth century both in france and england this sound /ts/ de-affricated to /s/ and from that time c has represented /s/ before front vowels either for etymological reasons as in lance cent or to avoid the ambiguity due to the etymological use of s for /z/ as in ace mice once pence defence
thus to show the etymology english spelling has advise devise instead of advize devize which while advice device dice ice mice twice etc. do not reflect etymology example has extended this to hence pence defence etc. where there is no etymological reason for using c former generations also wrote sence for sense hence today the romance languages and english have a common feature inherited from vulgar latin spelling conventions where c takes on either a hard or soft value depending on the following letter
== use in writing systems ==
=== english ===
in english orthography c generally represents the soft value of /s/ before the letters e (including the latin-derived digraphs ae and oe or the corresponding ligatures and ) i and y and a hard value of /k/ before any other letters or at the end of a word however there are a number of exceptions in english soccer and celt are words that have /k/ where /s/ would be expected
the soft c may represent the // sound in the digraph ci when this precedes a vowel as in the words delicious and appreciate
the digraph ch most commonly represents /t/ but can also represent /k/ (mainly in words of greek origin) or // (mainly in words of french origin) for some dialects of english it may also represent /x/ in words like loch while other speakers pronounce the final sound as /k/ the trigraph tch always represents /t/
the digraph ck is often used to represent the sound /k/ after short vowels
=== other languages ===
in the romance languages french spanish italian romanian and portuguese c generally has a hard value of /k/ and a soft value whose pronunciation varies by language in french portuguese and spanish from latin america and southern spain the soft c value is /s/ as it is in english in the spanish spoken in northern and central spain the soft c is a voiceless dental fricative // in italian and romanian the soft c is [t]
all balto-slavic languages that use the latin alphabet as well as albanian hungarian pashto several sami languages esperanto ido interlingua and americanist phonetic notation (and those aboriginal languages of north america whose practical orthography derives from it) use c to represent /ts/ the voiceless alveolar or voiceless dental sibilant affricate in romanized mandarin chinese the letter represents an aspirated version of this sound /ts/
among non-european languages that have adopted the latin alphabet c represents a variety of sounds yup'ik indonesian malay and a number of african languages such as hausa fula and manding share the soft italian value of /t/ in azeri crimean tatar kurmanji kurdish and turkish c stands for the voiced counterpart of this sound the voiced postalveolar affricate /d/ in yabem and similar languages such as bukawa c stands for a glottal stop // xhosa and zulu use this letter to represent the click // in some other african languages such as beninese yoruba c is used for // in fijian c stands for a voiced dental fricative // while in somali it has the value of //
the letter c is also used as a transliteration of the cyrillic in the latinic forms of serbian macedonian and sometimes ukrainian (along with the digraph ts)
=== other systems ===
as a phonetic symbol lowercase c is the international phonetic alphabet (ipa) and x-sampa symbol for the voiceless palatal plosive and capital c is the x-sampa symbol for the voiceless palatal fricative
=== digraphs ===
there are several common digraphs with c the most common being ch which in some languages (such as german) is far more common than c alone ch takes various values in other languages
as in english ck with the value /k/ is often used after short vowels in other germanic languages such as german and swedish (but some other germanic languages use kk instead such as dutch and norwegian) the digraph cz is found in polish and cs in hungarian both representing /t/ the digraph sc represents // in old english italian and a few languages related to italian (where this only happens before front vowels while otherwise it represents /sk/) the trigraph sch represents // in german
