== toponymyedit ==
the county in the 9th century written as wiltunscir later wiltonshire is named after the former county town of wilton
== historyedit ==
wiltshire is notable for its pre-roman archaeology the mesolithic neolithic and bronze age people that occupied southern britain built settlements on the hills and downland that cover wiltshire stonehenge and avebury are perhaps the most famous neolithic sites in the uk
in the 6th and 7th centuries wiltshire was at the western edge of saxon britain as cranborne chase and the somerset levels prevented the advance to the west the battle of bedwyn was fought in 675 between escuin a west saxon nobleman who had seized the throne of queen saxburga and king wulfhere of mercia in 878 the danes invaded the county following the norman conquest large areas of the country came into the possession of the crown and the church
at the time of the domesday survey the industry of wiltshire was largely agricultural 390 mills are mentioned and vineyards at tollard and lacock in the succeeding centuries sheep-farming was vigorously pursued and the cistercian monasteries of kingswood and stanley exported wool to the florentine and flemish markets in the 13th and 14th centuries
in the 17th century english civil war wiltshire was largely parliamentarian the battle of roundway down a decisive royalist victory was fought near devizes
in 1794 it was decided at a meeting at the bear inn in devizes to raise a body of ten independent troops of yeomanry for the county of wiltshire which formed the basis for what would become the royal wiltshire yeomanry who served with distinction both at home and abroad during the boer war world war i and world war ii the royal wiltshire yeomanry currently lives on as a (rwy) squadron of the royal yeomanry based in swindon and b (rwy) squadron of the royal wessex yeomanry based in salisbury
around 1800 the kennet and avon canal was built through wiltshire providing a route for transporting cargoes from bristol to london until the development of the great western railway

=== the moonrakersedit ===
the local nickname for wiltshire natives is moonrakers. this originated from a story of smugglers who managed to foil the local excise men by hiding their alcohol possibly french brandy in barrels or kegs in a village pond when confronted by the excise men they raked the surface to conceal the submerged contraband with ripples and claimed that they were trying to rake in a large round cheese visible in the pond really a reflection of the full moon the officials took them for simple yokels or mad and left them alone allowing them to continue with their illegal activities many villages claim the tale for their own village pond but the story is most commonly linked with the crammer in devizes
== geology landscape and ecologyedit ==
two thirds of wiltshire a mostly rural county lies on chalk a kind of soft white porous limestone that is resistant to erosion giving it a high chalk downland landscape this chalk is part of a system of chalk downlands throughout eastern and southern england formed by the rocks of the chalk group and stretching from the dorset downs in the west to dover in the east the largest area of chalk in wiltshire is salisbury plain which is used mainly for arable agriculture and by the british army as training ranges the highest point in the county is the tan hillmilk hill ridge in the pewsey vale just to the north of salisbury plain at 295 m (968 ft) above sea level
the chalk uplands run northeast into west berkshire in the marlborough downs ridge and southwest into dorset as cranborne chase cranborne chase which straddles the border has like salisbury plain yielded much stone age and bronze age archaeology the marlborough downs are part of the north wessex downs aonb (area of outstanding natural beauty) a 1,730 km2 (670-square-mile) conservation area
in the northwest of the county on the border with south gloucestershire and bath and north east somerset the underlying rock is the resistant oolite limestone of the cotswolds part of the cotswolds aonb is also in wiltshire in the county's northwestern corner
between the areas of chalk and limestone downland are clay valleys and vales the largest of these vales is the avon vale the avon cuts diagonally through the north of the county flowing through bradford on avon and into bath and bristol the vale of pewsey has been cut through the chalk into greensand and oxford clay in the centre of the county in the south west of the county is the vale of wardour the southeast of the county lies on the sandy soils of the northernmost area of the new forest
chalk is a porous rock so the chalk hills have little surface water the main settlements in the county are therefore situated at wet points notably salisbury is situated between the chalk of salisbury plain and marshy flood plains
== climateedit ==
along with the rest of south west england wiltshire has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country the annual mean temperature is approximately 10 c (50.0 f) seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the united kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures the summer months of july and august are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately 21 c (69.8 f) in winter mean minimum temperatures of 1 c (33.8 f) or 2 c (35.6 f) are common in the summer the azores high pressure affects the south-west of england however convective cloud sometimes forms inland reducing the number of hours of sunshine annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours in december 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at yeovilton most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by atlantic depressions or by convection most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the atlantic depressions which is when they are most active in summer a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms average rainfall is around 700 mm (28 in) about 815 days of snowfall is typical november to march have the highest mean wind speeds and june to august have the lightest winds the predominant wind direction is from the south-west
== economyedit ==
this is a chart of trend of regional gross value added (gva) of wiltshire at current basic prices with figures in millions of british pounds sterling
the wiltshire economy benefits from the m4 corridor effect which attracts business and the attractiveness of its countryside towns and villages the northern part of the county is richer than the southern part particularly since swindon is home to national and international corporations such as honda intel motorola alcatel-lucent patheon catalent (formerly known as cardinal health) becton-dickinson whsmith early learning centre and nationwide with dyson located in nearby malmesbury wiltshires employment structure is distinctive in having a significantly higher number of people in various forms of manufacturing (especially electrical equipment and apparatus food products and beverages furniture rubber pharmaceuticals and plastic goods) than the national average
in addition there is higher than average employment in public administration and defence due to the military establishments around the county particularly around amesbury and corsham there are sizeable british army barracks at tidworth bulford and warminster further north raf lyneham was home to the raf's hercules c130 fleet until 2011 raf operations ceased in late-2012 and a new defence technical training college is currently being developed there wiltshire is also distinctive in having a high proportion of its working age population who are economically active (86.6% in 19992000) and its low unemployment rates the gross domestic product (gdp) level in wiltshire did not reach the uk average in 1998 and was only marginally above the rate for south west england
== government and infrastructureedit ==

wiltshire has twenty-nine county secondary schools publicly funded of which the largest is warminster kingdown and another thirteen independent secondaries including marlborough college st mary's calne dauntsey's near devizes and warminster school the county schools are nearly all comprehensives with the older pattern of education surviving only in salisbury which has two grammar schools (south wilts grammar school for girls and bishop wordsworth's school) and three secondary moderns all but two of the county secondary schools in the former districts of west wiltshire and north wiltshire have sixth forms but only half of those in the rest of the county
there are three further education colleges new college swindon wiltshire college and swindon college providing some higher education
as yet there are no universities within wiltshire except that bath spa university has a centre at corsham court in corsham and oxford brookes university maintains a minor campus in swindon (almost 50 km from oxford) outline plans for a projected university of swindon or university of wiltshire were announced by the borough of swindon in november 2008 but the scheme remains uncommitted swindon therefore remains the uk's largest centre of population without its own university the closest university to wiltshire's county town of trowbridge is the university of bath wiltshire is therefore one of the few remaining english counties without a university or university college
