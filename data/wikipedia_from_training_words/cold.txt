cold refers to the condition or subjective perception of having low temperature the absence of heat
a lower bound to temperature is absolute zero defined as 0 k on the kelvin scale an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale this corresponds to 273.15 c on the celsius scale 459.67 f on the fahrenheit scale and 0 r on the rankine scale
since temperature relates to the thermal energy held by an object or a sample of matter which is the kinetic energy of the random motion of the particle constituents of matter an object will have less thermal energy when it is colder and more when it is hotter if it were possible to cool a system to absolute zero all motion of the particles in a sample of matter would cease and they would be at complete rest in this classical sense the object would be described as having zero thermal energy microscopically in the description of quantum mechanics however matter still has zero-point energy even at absolute zero because of the uncertainty principle
== coolingedit ==
cooling refers to the process of becoming cold or lowering in temperature this could be accomplished by removing heat from a system or exposing the system to an environment with a lower temperature
fluids used to cool objects are commonly called coolants
air cooling is the process of cooling an object by exposing it to air this will only work if the air is at a lower temperature than the object and the process can be enhanced by increasing the surface area or decreasing the mass of the object
another common method of cooling is exposing an object to ice dry ice or liquid nitrogen this works by convection the heat is transferred from the relatively warm object to the relatively cold coolant
laser cooling and magnetic evaporative cooling are techniques used to reach very low temperatures
== physiological effectsedit ==
cold has numerous physiological and pathological effects on the human body as well as on other organisms cold environments may promote certain psychological traits as well as having direct effects on the ability to move coordination is one of the first abilities to be affected extreme cold temperatures may lead to frostbite as well as hypothermia which in turn may result in death
== notable cold locations and objectsedit ==
the coldest known temperature ever achieved is a state of matter called the boseeinstein condensate which was first theorized to exist by satyendra nath bose in 1924 and first created by eric cornell carl wieman and co-workers at jila on june 5 1995 they did this by cooling a dilute vapor consisting of approximately two thousand rubidium-87 atoms to below 170 nk (one nk or nano k is a billionth (10-9) of a kelvin) using a combination of laser cooling (a technique that won its inventors steven chu claude cohen-tannoudji and william d phillips the 1997 nobel prize in physics) and magnetic evaporative cooling
the boomerang nebula is the coldest known natural location in the universe with a temperature that is estimated at 1 k (272.15 c/457.87 f)
the planck spacecraft's instruments are kept at 0.1 k (273.05 c/459.49 f) via passive and active cooling
absent any other source of heat the temperature of the universe is roughly 2.725 kelvin due to the cosmic microwave background radiation a remnant of the big bang
neptune's moon triton has a surface temperature of 235 c (390 f)
uranus with a black-body temperature of 58.2 k (-215.0 c -354.9 f)
saturn with a black-body temperature of 81.1 k (-192.0 c -313.7 f)
mercury despite being close to the sun is actually cold during its night with a temperature of about 170 c (275 f) mercury is cold during its night because it has no atmosphere to trap in heat from the sun
jupiter with a black-body temperature of 110.0 k (-163.2 c -261.67 f)
mars with a black-body temperature of 210.1 k (-63.05 c -81.49 f)
the coldest continent on earth is antarctica the coldest place on earth is the antarctic plateau an area of antarctica around the south pole that has an altitude of around 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) the lowest reliably measured temperature on earth of 183.9 k (-89.2 c -128.6 f) was recorded there at vostok station on 21 july 1983 (see list of weather records)
