historyedit
early part th century information types distances stars became readily available spectra stars shown distinctive features allowed categorized annie jump cannon edward c pickering harvard college observatory developed method categorization became known harvard classification scheme published harvard annals
potsdam danish astronomer ejnar hertzsprung noticed reddest starsclassified k m harvard schemecould divided two distinct groups stars either much brighter sun much fainter distinguish groups called giant dwarf stars following year began studying star clusters large groupings stars colocated approximately distance published first plots color versus luminosity stars plots showed prominent continuous sequence stars named main sequence

energy generationedit
mainsequence stars core region energy generated nuclear fusion temperature density core levels necessary sustain energy production support remainder star reduction energy production would cause overlaying mass compress core resulting increase fusion rate higher temperature pressure likewise increase energy production would cause star expand lowering pressure core thus star forms selfregulating system hydrostatic equilibrium stable course main sequence lifetime
mainsequence stars employ two types hydrogen fusion processes rate energy generation type depends temperature core region astronomers divide main sequence upper lower parts based two dominant fusion process lower main sequence energy primarily generated result protonproton chain directly fuses hydrogen together series stages produce helium stars upper main sequence sufficiently high core temperatures efficiently use cno cycle see chart process uses atoms carbon nitrogen oxygen intermediaries process fusing hydrogen helium

structureedit
temperature difference core surface photosphere energy transported outward two modes transporting energy radiation convection radiation zone energy transported radiation stable convection little mixing plasma contrast convection zone energy transported bulk movement plasma hotter material rising cooler material descending convection efficient mode carrying energy radiation occur conditions create steep temperature gradient
massive stars m rate energy generation cno cycle sensitive temperature fusion highly concentrated core consequently high temperature gradient core region results convection zone efficient energy transport mixing material around core removes helium ash hydrogenburning region allowing hydrogen star consumed mainsequence lifetime outer regions massive star transport energy radiation little convection
intermediatemass stars sirius may transport energy primarily radiation small core convection region mediumsized lowmass stars like sun core region stable convection convection zone near surface mixes outer layers results steady buildup heliumrich core surrounded hydrogenrich outer region contrast cool lowmass stars m convective throughout thus helium produced core distributed across star producing relatively uniform atmosphere proportionately longer main sequence lifespan
luminositycolor variationedit
nonfusing helium ash accumulates core mainsequence star reduction abundance hydrogen per unit mass results gradual lowering fusion rate within mass since outflow fusionsupplied energy supports higher layers star core compressed producing higher temperatures pressures factors increase rate fusion thus moving equilibrium towards smaller denser hotter core producing energy whose increased outflow pushes higher layers thus steady increase luminosity radius star time example luminosity early sun current value star ages luminosity increase changes position hr diagram effect results broadening main sequence band stars observed random stages lifetime main sequence band develops thickness hr diagram simply narrow line

lifetimeedit
total amount energy star generate nuclear fusion hydrogen limited amount hydrogen fuel consumed core star equilibrium energy generated core must least equal energy radiated surface since luminosity gives amount energy radiated per unit time total life span estimated first approximation total energy produced divided stars luminosity
star least m hydrogen supply core exhausted expands become red giant start fuse helium atoms form carbon energy output helium fusion process per unit mass tenth energy output hydrogen process luminosity star increases results much shorter length time stage compared main sequence lifetime example sun predicted spend million years burning helium compared billion years burning hydrogen thus observed stars m main sequence average mainsequence stars known follow empirical massluminosity relationship luminosity l star roughly proportional total mass m following power law
relationship applies mainsequence stars range m
amount fuel available nuclear fusion proportional mass star thus lifetime star main sequence estimated comparing solar evolutionary models sun mainsequence star billion years become red giant billion years total main sequence lifetime roughly years hence
m l mass luminosity star respectively solar mass solar luminosity stars estimated main sequence lifetime
although massive stars fuel burn might expected last longer also must radiate proportionately greater amount increased mass thus massive stars may remain main sequence million years stars less tenth solar mass may last trillion years
exact massluminosity relationship depends efficiently energy transported core surface higher opacity insulating effect retains energy core star need produce much energy remain hydrostatic equilibrium contrast lower opacity means energy escapes rapidly star must burn fuel remain equilibrium note however sufficiently high opacity result energy transport via convection changes conditions needed remain equilibrium
highmass mainsequence stars opacity dominated electron scattering nearly constant increasing temperature thus luminosity increases cube stars mass stars m opacity becomes dependent temperature resulting luminosity varying approximately fourth power stars mass lowmass stars molecules atmosphere also contribute opacity m luminosity star varies mass power producing flattening slope graph mass versus luminosity even refinements approximation however massluminosity relation vary depending stars composition
