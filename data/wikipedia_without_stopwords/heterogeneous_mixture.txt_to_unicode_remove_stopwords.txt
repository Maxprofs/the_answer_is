chemistry mixture material system made two different substances mixed combined chemically mixture refers physical combination two substances identities retained mixed form solutions suspensions colloids
mixtures one product mechanical blending mixing chemical substances like elements compounds without chemical bonding chemical change ingredient substance retains chemical properties makeup despite chemical changes constituents physical properties mixture melting point may differ components mixtures separated components physical mechanical thermal means azeotropes one kind mixture usually pose considerable difficulties regarding separation processes required obtain constituents physical chemical processes even blend
kinds mixtures
mixtures either homogeneous heterogeneous homogeneous mixture type mixture composition uniform every part solution properties heterogeneous mixture type mixture components seen two phases present one example mixture air air homogeneous mixture gaseous substances nitrogen oxygen smaller amounts substances salt sugar many substances dissolve water form homogeneous mixtures homogeneous mixture solute solvent present also solution mixtures amounts ingredients
following table shows main properties three families mixtures

making distinction homogeneous heterogeneous mixtures matter scale sampling coarse enough scale mixture said homogeneous youll allow entire article count sample fine enough scale mixture said heterogeneous sample could small single molecule practical terms property interest mixture regardless sample taken examination used mixture homogeneous
gys sampling theory quantitavely defines heterogeneity particle
respectively heterogeneity th particle population mass concentration property interest th particle population mass concentration property interest population mass th particle population average mass particle population
sampling heterogeneous mixtures particles variance sampling error generally nonzero
