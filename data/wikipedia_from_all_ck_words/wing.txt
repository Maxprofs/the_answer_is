a wing is a type of fin with a surface that produces aerodynamic force for flight or propulsion through the atmosphere or through another gaseous or liquid fluid as such wings have an airfoil shape a streamlined cross-sectional shape producing lift
the word wing from the old norse vngr for many centuries referred mainly to the foremost limbs of birds (in addition to the architectural aisle.) but in recent centuries the word's meaning has extended to include lift producing appendages of insects bats pterosaurs boomerangs some sail boats and aircraft or the inverted airfoil on a race car that generates a downward force to increase traction
various species of penguins and other flighted or flightless water birds such as auks cormorants guillemots shearwaters eider and scoter ducks and diving petrels are avid swimmers and use their wings to propel through water
a wing's aerodynamic quality is expressed as its lift-to-drag ratio the lift a wing generates at a given speed and angle of attack can be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the total drag on the wing a high lift-to-drag ratio requires a significantly smaller thrust to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift
== aerodynamics of wingsedit ==
the design and analysis of the wings of aircraft is one of the principal applications of the science of aerodynamics which is a branch of fluid mechanics the properties of the airflow around any moving object can - in principle - be found by solving the navier-stokes equations of fluid dynamics however except for simple geometries these equations are notoriously difficult to solve fortunately simpler explanations can be described
for a wing to produce lift it must be oriented at a suitable angle of attack relative to the flow of air past the wing when this occurs the wing deflects the airflow downwards turning the air as it passes the wing since the wing exerts a force on the air to change its direction the air must exert a force on the wing equal in size but opposite in direction this force manifests itself as differing air pressures at different points on the surface of the wing
a region of lower-than-normal air pressure is generated over the top surface of the wing with a higher pressure on the bottom of the wing (see airfoil) these air pressure differences can be either measured directly using instrumentation or can be calculated from the airspeed distribution using basic physical principlesincluding bernoulli's principle which relates changes in air speed to changes in air pressure
the lower air pressure on the top of the wing generates a smaller downward force on the top of the wing than the upward force generated by the higher air pressure on the bottom of the wing hence a net upward force acts on the wing this force is called the lift generated by the wing
the different velocities of the air passing by the wing the air pressure differences the change in direction of the airflow and the lift on the wing are intrinsically one phenomenon it is therefore possible to calculate lift from any of the other three for example the lift can be calculated from the pressure differences or from different velocities of the air above and below the wing or from the total momentum change of the deflected air fluid dynamics offers other approaches to solving these problemsand all produce the same answers if done correctly given a particular wing and its velocity through the air debates over which mathematical approach is the most convenient to use can be mistaken by novices as differences of opinion about the basic principles of flight

=== devices to change the shape of a wingedit ===
usually aircraft wings have various devices such as flaps or slats that the pilot uses to modify the shape and surface area of the wing to change its operating characteristics in flight in 1948 francis rogallo invented the fully limp flexible wing which ushered new possibilities for aircraft near in time domina jalbert invented flexible un-sparred ram-air airfoiled thick wings these two new branches of wings have been since extensively studied and applied in new branches of aircraft especially altering the personal recreational aviation landscape
=== a common misconceptionedit ===
a common misconception is that to generate lift a wing must have a longer air path across its topside compared with its underside wings with this shape are the norm in subsonic flight but symmetrically shaped wings (above and below) can generate lift by using a positive angle of attack to deflect air downward symmetrical airfoils have higher stalling speeds than cambered airfoils of the same wing area but are used in aerobatic aircraft as they provide practical performance whether the aircraft is upright or inverted another example comes from sailboats where the sail is a thin membrane with no path-length difference between one side and the other
for flight speeds near the speed of sound (transonic flight) airfoils with complex asymmetrical shapes are used to minimize the drastic increase in drag associated with airflow near the speed of sound such airfoils called supercritical airfoils are flat on top and curved on the bottom
=== other examplesedit ===
the science of wings applies in other areas beyond conventional fixed-wing aircraft including
hang gliders which use wings ranging from fully flexible (paragliders gliding parachutes) flexible (framed sail wings) to rigid
kites which use a vast variety of wings
flying model airplanes
helicopters which use a rotating wing with a variable pitch angle to provide directional forces
propellers whose blades generate lift for propulsion
the nasa space shuttle which uses its wings only to glide during its descent to a runway these types of aircraft are called spaceplanes
some racing cars especially formula one cars which use upside-down wings (or airfoils) to provide greater traction at high speeds
sailboats which use sails as vertical wings with variable fullness and direction to move across water
structures with the same purpose as wings but designed for use in liquid media are generally called fins or hydrofoils with hydrodynamics as the governing science rather than aerodynamics applications of these arise in craft such as hydroplanes and submarines sailboats and sailing ships use both fins and wings
== design featuresedit ==
aircraft wings may feature some of the following
a rounded leading edge cross-section
a sharp trailing edge cross-section
leading-edge devices such as slats slots or extensions
trailing-edge devices such as flaps or flaperons (combination of flaps and ailerons)
ailerons (usually near the wingtips) to roll the aircraft clockwise or counterclockwise about its long axis
spoilers on the upper surface to disrupt the lift and to provide additional traction to an aircraft that has just landed but is still moving
vortex generators to help prevent flow separation in transonic flow
wing fences to keep flow attached to the wing by stopping boundary layer separation from spreading
winglets to keep wingtip vortices from increasing drag and decreasing lift
dihedral or a positive wing angle to the horizontal this gives inherent stability in the roll direction anhedral or a negative wing angle to the horizontal has a destabilizing effect
folding wings allow more aircraft storage in the confined space of the hangar deck of an aircraft carrier
variable-sweep wing or swing wings that allow outstretched wings during low-speed flight (i.e. take-off and landing) and swept back wings for high-speed flight (including supersonic flight) such as in the f-111 aardvark the f-14 tomcat the panavia tornado the mig-23 the mig-27 the tu-160 and the b-1b lancer warplanes
