parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines the term is derived from the greek word (parallaxis) meaning alteration nearby objects have a larger parallax than more distant objects when observed from different positions so parallax can be used to determine distances
astronomers use the principle of parallax to measure distances to the closer stars here the term parallax is the semi-angle of inclination between two sight-lines to the star as observed when the earth is on opposite sides of the sun in its orbit these distances form the lowest rung of what is called the cosmic distance ladder the first in a succession of methods by which astronomers determine the distances to celestial objects serving as a basis for other distance measurements in astronomy forming the higher rungs of the ladder
parallax also affects optical instruments such as rifle scopes binoculars microscopes and twin-lens reflex cameras that view objects from slightly different angles many animals including humans have two eyes with overlapping visual fields that use parallax to gain depth perception this process is known as stereopsis in computer vision the effect is used for computer stereo vision and there is a device called a parallax rangefinder that uses it to find range and in some variations also altitude to a target
a simple everyday example of parallax can be seen in the dashboard of motor vehicles that use a needle-style speedometer gauge when viewed from directly in front the speed may show exactly 60 but when viewed from the passenger seat the needle may appear to show a slightly different speed due to the angle of viewing
== visual perceptionedit ==
as the eyes of humans and other animals are in different positions on the head they present different views simultaneously this is the basis of stereopsis the process by which the brain exploits the parallax due to the different views from the eye to gain depth perception and estimate distances to objects animals also use motion parallax in which the animals (or just the head) move to gain different viewpoints for example pigeons (whose eyes do not have overlapping fields of view and thus cannot use stereopsis) bob their heads up and down to see depth
the motion parallax is exploited also in wiggle stereoscopy computer graphics which provide depth cues through viewpoint-shifting animation rather than through binocular vision
== parallax in astronomyedit ==
parallax arises due to change in viewpoint occurring due to motion of the observer of the observed or of both what is essential is relative motion by observing parallax measuring angles and using geometry one can determine distance
=== stellar parallaxedit ===
stellar parallax created by the relative motion between the earth and a star can be seen in the copernican model as arising from the orbit of the earth around the sun the star only appears to move relative to more distant objects in the sky in a geostatic model the movement of the star would have to be taken as real with the star oscillating across the sky with respect to the background stars
stellar parallax is most often measured using annual parallax defined as the difference in position of a star as seen from the earth and sun i e the angle subtended at a star by the mean radius of the earth's orbit around the sun the parsec (3.26 light-years) is defined as the distance for which the annual parallax is 1 arcsecond annual parallax is normally measured by observing the position of a star at different times of the year as the earth moves through its orbit measurement of annual parallax was the first reliable way to determine the distances to the closest stars the first successful measurements of stellar parallax were made by friedrich bessel in 1838 for the star 61 cygni using a heliometer stellar parallax remains the standard for calibrating other measurement methods accurate calculations of distance based on stellar parallax require a measurement of the distance from the earth to the sun now based on radar reflection off the surfaces of planets
the angles involved in these calculations are very small and thus difficult to measure the nearest star to the sun (and thus the star with the largest parallax) proxima centauri has a parallax of 0.7687 0.0003 arcsec this angle is approximately that subtended by an object 2 centimeters in diameter located 5.3 kilometers away
the fact that stellar parallax was so small that it was unobservable at the time was used as the main scientific argument against heliocentrism during the early modern age it is clear from euclid's geometry that the effect would be undetectable if the stars were far enough away but for various reasons such gigantic distances involved seemed entirely implausible it was one of tycho's principal objections to copernican heliocentrism that in order for it to be compatible with the lack of observable stellar parallax there would have to be an enormous and unlikely void between the orbit of saturn (then the most distant known planet) and the eighth sphere (the fixed stars)
in 1989 the satellite hipparcos was launched primarily for obtaining improved parallaxes and proper motions for over 100,000 nearby stars increasing the reach of the method tenfold even so hipparcos is only able to measure parallax angles for stars up to about 1,600 light-years away a little more than one percent of the diameter of the milky way galaxy the european space agency's gaia mission launched in december 2013 will be able to measure parallax angles to an accuracy of 10 microarcseconds thus mapping nearby stars (and potentially planets) up to a distance of tens of thousands of light-years from earth in april 2014 nasa astronomers reported that the hubble space telescope by using spatial scanning can now precisely measure distances up to 10,000 light-years away a ten-fold improvement over earlier measurements
=== distance measurementedit ===
distance measurement by parallax is a special case of the principle of triangulation which states that one can solve for all the sides and angles in a network of triangles if in addition to all the angles in the network the length of at least one side has been measured thus the careful measurement of the length of one baseline can fix the scale of an entire triangulation network in parallax the triangle is extremely long and narrow and by measuring both its shortest side (the motion of the observer) and the small top angle (always less than 1 arcsecond leaving the other two close to 90 degrees) the length of the long sides (in practice considered to be equal) can be determined
assuming the angle is small (see derivation below) the distance to an object (measured in parsecs) is the reciprocal of the parallax (measured in arcseconds) for example the distance to proxima centauri is 1/0.7687=1.3009 parsecs (4.243 ly)
=== diurnal parallaxedit ===
diurnal parallax is a parallax that varies with rotation of the earth or with difference of location on the earth the moon and to a smaller extent the terrestrial planets or asteroids seen from different viewing positions on the earth (at one given moment) can appear differently placed against the background of fixed stars
=== lunar parallaxedit ===
lunar parallax (often short for lunar horizontal parallax or lunar equatorial horizontal parallax) is a special case of (diurnal) parallax the moon being the nearest celestial body has by far the largest maximum parallax of any celestial body it can exceed 1 degree
the diagram (above) for stellar parallax can illustrate lunar parallax as well if the diagram is taken to be scaled right down and slightly modified instead of near star read moon and instead of taking the circle at the bottom of the diagram to represent the size of the earth's orbit around the sun take it to be the size of the earth's globe and of a circle around the earth's surface then the lunar (horizontal) parallax amounts to the difference in angular position relative to the background of distant stars of the moon as seen from two different viewing positions on the earth one of the viewing positions is the place from which the moon can be seen directly overhead at a given moment (that is viewed along the vertical line in the diagram) and the other viewing position is a place from which the moon can be seen on the horizon at the same moment (that is viewed along one of the diagonal lines from an earth-surface position corresponding roughly to one of the blue dots on the modified diagram)
the lunar (horizontal) parallax can alternatively be defined as the angle subtended at the distance of the moon by the radius of the earthequal to angle p in the diagram when scaled-down and modified as mentioned above
the lunar horizontal parallax at any time depends on the linear distance of the moon from the earth the earthmoon linear distance varies continuously as the moon follows its perturbed and approximately elliptical orbit around the earth the range of the variation in linear distance is from about 56 to 63.7 earth radii corresponding to horizontal parallax of about a degree of arc but ranging from about 61.4 to about 54 the astronomical almanac and similar publications tabulate the lunar horizontal parallax and/or the linear distance of the moon from the earth on a periodical e.g daily basis for the convenience of astronomers (and formerly of navigators) and the study of the way in which this coordinate varies with time forms part of lunar theory
parallax can also be used to determine the distance to the moon
one way to determine the lunar parallax from one location is by using a lunar eclipse a full shadow of the earth on the moon has an apparent radius of curvature equal to the difference between the apparent radii of the earth and the sun as seen from the moon this radius can be seen to be equal to 0.75 degree from which (with the solar apparent radius 0.25 degree) we get an earth apparent radius of 1 degree this yields for the earthmoon distance 60.27 earth radii or 384,399 kilometres (238,854 mi) this procedure was first used by aristarchus of samos and hipparchus and later found its way into the work of ptolemy the diagram at right shows how daily lunar parallax arises on the geocentric and geostatic planetary model in which the earth is at the centre of the planetary system and does not rotate it also illustrates the important point that parallax need not be caused by any motion of the observer contrary to some definitions of parallax that say it is but may arise purely from motion of the observed
another method is to take two pictures of the moon at exactly the same time from two locations on earth and compare the positions of the moon relative to the stars using the orientation of the earth those two position measurements and the distance between the two locations on the earth the distance to the moon can be triangulated
this is the method referred to by jules verne in from the earth to the moon
until then many people had no idea how one could calculate the distance separating the moon from the earth the circumstance was exploited to teach them that this distance was obtained by measuring the parallax of the moon if the word parallax appeared to amaze them they were told that it was the angle subtended by two straight lines running from both ends of the earth's radius to the moon if they had doubts on the perfection of this method they were immediately shown that not only did this mean distance amount to a whole two hundred thirty-four thousand three hundred and forty-seven miles (94,330 leagues) but also that the astronomers were not in error by more than seventy miles ( 30 leagues)
=== solar parallaxedit ===
after copernicus proposed his heliocentric system with the earth in revolution around the sun it was possible to build a model of the whole solar system without scale to ascertain the scale it is necessary only to measure one distance within the solar system e.g. the mean distance from the earth to the sun (now called an astronomical unit or au) when found by triangulation this is referred to as the solar parallax the difference in position of the sun as seen from the earth's centre and a point one earth radius away i e. the angle subtended at the sun by the earth's mean radius knowing the solar parallax and the mean earth radius allows one to calculate the au the first small step on the long road of establishing the size and expansion age of the visible universe
a primitive way to determine the distance to the sun in terms of the distance to the moon was already proposed by aristarchus of samos in his book on the sizes and distances of the sun and moon he noted that the sun moon and earth form a right triangle (right angle at the moon) at the moment of first or last quarter moon he then estimated that the moon earth sun angle was 87 using correct geometry but inaccurate observational data aristarchus concluded that the sun was slightly less than 20 times farther away than the moon the true value of this angle is close to 89 50 and the sun is actually about 390 times farther away he pointed out that the moon and sun have nearly equal apparent angular sizes and therefore their diameters must be in proportion to their distances from earth he thus concluded that the sun was around 20 times larger than the moon this conclusion although incorrect follows logically from his incorrect data it does suggest that the sun is clearly larger than the earth which could be taken to support the heliocentric model
although aristarchus results were incorrect due to observational errors they were based on correct geometric principles of parallax and became the basis for estimates of the size of the solar system for almost 2000 years until the transit of venus was correctly observed in 1761 and 1769 this method was proposed by edmond halley in 1716 although he did not live to see the results the use of venus transits was less successful than had been hoped due to the black drop effect but the resulting estimate 153 million kilometers is just 2% above the currently accepted value 149.6 million kilometers
much later the solar system was scaled using the parallax of asteroids some of which such as eros pass much closer to earth than venus in a favourable opposition eros can approach the earth to within 22 million kilometres both the opposition of 1901 and that of 1930/1931 were used for this purpose the calculations of the latter determination being completed by astronomer royal sir harold spencer jones
also radar reflections both off venus (1958) and off asteroids like icarus have been used for solar parallax determination today use of spacecraft telemetry links has solved this old problem the currently accepted value of solar parallax is 8".794 143
=== dynamic or moving-cluster parallaxedit ===
the open stellar cluster hyades in taurus extends over such a large part of the sky 20 degrees that the proper motions as derived from astrometry appear to converge with some precision to a perspective point north of orion combining the observed apparent (angular) proper motion in seconds of arc with the also observed true (absolute) receding motion as witnessed by the doppler redshift of the stellar spectral lines allows estimation of the distance to the cluster (151 light-years) and its member stars in much the same way as using annual parallax
dynamic parallax has sometimes also been used to determine the distance to a supernova when the optical wave front of the outburst is seen to propagate through the surrounding dust clouds at an apparent angular velocity while its true propagation velocity is known to be the speed of light
=== derivationedit ===
for a right triangle
where is the parallax 1 au (149,600,000 km) is approximately the average distance from the sun to earth and is the distance to the star using small-angle approximations (valid when the angle is small compared to 1 radian)
so the parallax measured in arcseconds is
if the parallax is 1 then the distance is
this defines the parsec a convenient unit for measuring distance using parallax therefore the distance measured in parsecs is simply  when the parallax is given in arcseconds
=== parallax error in astronomyedit ===
precise parallax measurements of distance have an associated error however this error in the measured parallax angle does not translate directly into an error for the distance except for relatively small errors the reason for this is that an error toward a smaller angle results in a greater error in distance than an error toward a larger angle
however an approximation of the distance error can be computed by
where d is the distance and p is the parallax the approximation is far more accurate for parallax errors that are small relative to the parallax than for relatively large errors for meaningful results in stellar astronomy dutch astronomer floor van leeuwen recommends that the parallax error be no more than 10% of the total parallax when computing this error estimate
=== spatio-temporal parallaxedit ===
from enhanced relativistic positioning systems spatio-temporal parallax generalizing the usual notion of parallax in space only has been developed then eventfields in spacetime can be deduced directly without intermediate models of light bending by massive bodies such as the one used in the ppn formalism for instance
== parallax error in measurement instrumentsedit ==
measurements made by viewing the position of some marker relative to something to be measured are subject to parallax error if the marker is some distance away from the object of measurement and not viewed from the correct position for example if measuring the distance between two ticks on a line with a ruler marked on its top surface the thickness of the ruler will separate its markings from the ticks if viewed from a position not exactly perpendicular to the ruler the apparent position will shift and the reading will be less accurate than the ruler is capable of
a similar error occurs when reading the position of a pointer against a scale in an instrument such as an analog multimeter to help the user avoid this problem the scale is sometimes printed above a narrow strip of mirror and the user's eye is positioned so that the pointer obscures its own reflection guaranteeing that the user's line of sight is perpendicular to the mirror and therefore to the scale the same effect alters the speed read on a car's speedometer by a driver in front of it and a passenger off to the side values read from a graticule not in actual contact with the display on an oscilloscope etc
== photogrammetric parallaxedit ==
aerial picture pairs when viewed through a stereo viewer offer a pronounced stereo effect of landscape and buildings high buildings appear to keel over in the direction away from the centre of the photograph measurements of this parallax are used to deduce the height of the buildings provided that flying height and baseline distances are known this is a key component to the process of photogrammetry
== parallax error in photographyedit ==
parallax error can be seen when taking photos with many types of cameras such as twin-lens reflex cameras and those including viewfinders (such as rangefinder cameras) in such cameras the eye sees the subject through different optics (the viewfinder or a second lens) than the one through which the photo is taken as the viewfinder is often found above the lens of the camera photos with parallax error are often slightly lower than intended the classic example being the image of person with his or her head cropped off this problem is addressed in single-lens reflex cameras in which the viewfinder sees through the same lens through which the photo is taken (with the aid of a movable mirror) thus avoiding parallax error
parallax is also an issue in image stitching such as for panoramas
== parallax in sightsedit ==
parallax affects sights in many ways on sights fitted to small arms bows in archery etc the distance between the sighting mechanism and the weapon's bore or axis can introduce significant errors when firing at close range particularly when firing at small targets this difference is generally referred to as sight height and is compensated for (when needed) via calculations that also take in other variables such as bullet drop windage and the distance at which the target is expected to be sight height can be used to advantage when sighting-in rifles for field use a typical hunting rifle (.222 with telescopic sights) sighted-in at 75m will be useful from 50m to 200m without further adjustment
=== parallax in optical sightsedit ===
in optical sights parallax refers to the apparent movement of the reticle in relationship to the target when the user moves his/her head laterally behind the sight (up/down or left/right) i.e it is an error where the reticle does not stay aligned with the sight's own optical axis
in optical instruments such as telescopes microscopes or in telescopic sights used on small arms and theodolites the error occurs when the optics are not precisely focused the reticle will appear to move with respect to the object focused on if one moves one's head sideways in front of the eyepiece some firearm telescopic sights are equipped with a parallax compensation mechanism which basically consists of a movable optical element that enables the optical system to project the picture of objects at varying distances and the reticle crosshairs pictures together in exactly the same optical plane telescopic sights may have no parallax compensation because they can perform very acceptably without refinement for parallax with the sight being permanently adjusted for the distance that best suits their intended usage typical standard factory parallax adjustment distances for hunting telescopic sights are 100 yd or 100 m to make them suited for hunting shots that rarely exceed 300 yd/m some target and military style telescopic sights without parallax compensation may be adjusted to be parallax free at ranges up to 300 yd/m to make them better suited for aiming at longer ranges scopes for rimfires shotguns and muzzleloaders will have shorter parallax settings commonly 50 yd/m for rimfire scopes and 100 yd/m for shotguns and muzzleloaders scopes for airguns are very often found with adjustable parallax usually in the form of an adjustable objective or ao these may adjust down as far as 3 yards (2.74 m)
non-magnifying reflector or reflex sights have the ability to be theoretically parallax free. but since these sights use parallel collimated light this is only true when the target is at infinity at finite distances eye movement perpendicular to the device will cause parallax movement in the reticle image in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics firearm sights such as some red dot sights try to correct for this via not focusing the reticle at infinity but instead at some finite distance a designed target range where the reticle will show very little movement due to parallax some manufactures market reflector sight models they call parallax free, but this refers to an optical system that compensates for off axis spherical aberration an optical error induced by the spherical mirror used in the sight that can cause the reticle position to diverge off the sight's optical axis with change in eye position
== artillery gunfireedit ==
because of the positioning of field or naval artillery guns each one has a slightly different perspective of the target relative to the location of the fire-control system itself therefore when aiming its guns at the target the fire control system must compensate for parallax in order to assure that fire from each gun converges on the target
== parallax rangefindersedit ==
a coincidence rangefinder or parallax rangefinder can be used to find distance to a target
== as a metaphoredit ==
in a philosophic/geometric sense an apparent change in the direction of an object caused by a change in observational position that provides a new line of sight the apparent displacement or difference of position of an object as seen from two different stations or points of view in contemporary writing parallax can also be the same story or a similar story from approximately the same time line from one book told from a different perspective in another book the word and concept feature prominently in james joyce's 1922 novel ulysses orson scott card also used the term when referring to ender's shadow as compared to ender's game
the metaphor is invoked by slovenian philosopher slavoj iek in his work the parallax view iek borrowed the concept of parallax view from the japanese philosopher and literary critic kojin karatani the philosophical twist to be added (to parallax) of course is that the observed distance is not simply subjective since the same object that exists out there is seen from two different stances or points of view it is rather that as hegel would have put it subject and object are inherently mediated so that an epistemological shift in the subject's point of view always reflects an ontological shift in the object itself orto put it in lacanesethe subject's gaze is always-already inscribed into the perceived object itself in the guise of its blind spot, that which is in the object more than object itself the point from which the object itself returns the gaze sure the picture is in my eye but i am also in the picture.
