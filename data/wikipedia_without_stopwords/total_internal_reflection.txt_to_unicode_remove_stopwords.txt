total internal reflection phenomenon occurs propagating wave strikes medium boundary angle larger particular critical angle respect normal surface refractive index lower side boundary incident angle greater critical angle wave cannot pass entirely reflected critical angle angle incidence total internal reflection occurs particularly common optical phenomenon light waves involved occurs many types waves electromagnetic waves general sound waves
wave reaches boundary different materials different refractive indices wave general partially refracted boundary surface partially reflected however angle incidence greater ie direction propagation closer parallel boundary critical angle angle incidence light refracted travels along boundary wave cross boundary instead totally reflected back internally occur wave medium higher refractive index n reaches boundary medium lower refractive index n example occur light reaching air glass reaching glass air
optical descriptionedit
total internal reflection light demonstrated using semicircular block glass plastic ray box shines narrow beam light ray onto glass medium semicircular shape ensures ray pointing towards centre flat face hit curved surface right angle prevent refraction airglass boundary curved surface glassair boundary flat surface happens depend angle c critical angle measurement caused sun light source measured normal surface
c ray split ray reflect boundary refract passes total internal reflection
c entire ray reflects boundary none passes called total internal reflection
physical property makes optical fibers useful prismatic binoculars possible also gives diamonds distinctive sparkle diamond unusually high refractive index
critical angleedit
critical angle angle incidence total internal reflection occurs angle incidence measured respect normal refractive boundary see diagram illustrating snells law consider light ray passing glass air light emanating interface bent towards glass incident angle increased sufficiently transmitted angle air reaches degrees point light transmitted air critical angle given snells law
rearranging snells law get incidence
find critical angle find value thus resulting value equal critical angle
solve get equation critical angle
incident ray precisely critical angle refracted ray tangent boundary point incidence example visible light traveling acrylic glass index refraction approximately air index refraction calculation would give critical angle light acrylic air
light incident border angle less would partially transmitted light incident border larger angles respect normal would totally internally reflected
fraction greater arcsine definedmeaning total internal reflection occur even shallow grazing incident angles
critical angle defined less equal
derivation evanescent waveedit
important side effect total internal reflection appearance evanescent wave beyond boundary surface essentially even though entire incident wave reflected back originating medium penetration second medium boundary evanescent wave appears travel along boundary two materials leading gooshnchen shift
plane wave confined xz plane incident dielectric angle wavevector transmitted ray created corresponding angle transmittance shown figure transmitted wavevector given
since relation obtained snells law greater one
result becomes complex

phase shift upon total internal reflectionedit
lesserknown aspect total internal reflection reflected light angle dependent phase shift reflected incident light mathematically means fresnel reflection coefficient becomes complex rather real number phase shift polarization dependent grows incidence angle deviates critical angle toward grazing incidence
polarization dependent phase shift long known used fresnel design fresnel rhomb allows one transform circular polarization linear polarization vice versa wide range wavelengths colors contrast quarter wave plate polarization dependent phase shift also reason te tm guided modes different dispersion relations
