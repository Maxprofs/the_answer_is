a name is a word or term used for identification names can identify a class or category of things or a single thing either uniquely or within a given context a personal name identifies not necessarily uniquely a specific individual human the name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning also) and is when consisting of only one word a proper noun other nouns are sometimes called common names or (obsolete) general names a name can be given to a person place or thing for example parents can give their child a name or scientist can give an element a name
caution must be exercised when translating for there are ways that one language may prefer one type of name over another a feudal naming habit is used sometimes in other languages the french sometimes refer to aristotle as le stagirite from one spelling of his place of birth and english speakers often refer to shakespeare as the bard recognizing him as a paragon writer of the language also claims to preference or authority can be refuted the british did not refer to louis-napoleon as napoleon iii during his rule
== etymology ==
the word name comes from old english nama akin to old high german (ohg) namo sanskrit (nman) latin nomen and greek (onoma) possibly from the proto-indo-european (pie) *nomn- also note the similarity to the tamil namam
== in religious thought ==
in the ancient world particularly in the ancient near-east (israel mesopotamia egypt persia) names were thought to be extremely powerful and to act in some ways as a separate manifestation of a person or deity this viewpoint is responsible both for the reluctance to use the proper name of god in hebrew writing or speech as well as the common understanding in ancient magic that magical rituals had to be carried out in [someone's] name by invoking a god or spirit by name one was thought to be able to summon that spirit's power for some kind of miracle or magic (see luke 9:49 in which the disciples claim to have seen a man driving out demons using the name of jesus.) this understanding passed into later religious tradition for example the stipulation in catholic exorcism that the demon cannot be expelled until the exorcist has forced it to give up its name at which point the name may be used in a stern command which will drive the demon away
=== biblical names ===
in the old testament the names of individuals are meaningful and a change of name indicates a change of status for example the patriarch abram and his wife sarai are renamed abraham and sarah when they are told they will be the father and mother of many nations (genesis 17:4 17:15) simon was renamed peter when he was given the keys to heaven this is recounted in the gospel of matthew chapter 16 which according to roman catholic teaching was when jesus promised to saint peter the power to take binding actions
throughout the bible characters are given names at birth that reflect something of significance or describe the course of their lives for example solomon meant peace and the king with that name was the first whose reign was without war likewise joseph named his firstborn son manasseh (hebrew causing to forget")(genesis 41:51) when joseph also said god has made me forget all my troubles and everyone in my father's family
biblical jewish people did not have surnames which were passed from generation to generation however they were typically known as the child of their father for example (david ben yishay) meaning david son of jesse.(1 samuel 17:12,58)
=== talmudic attitudes ===
the babylonian talmud maintains that names exert a mystical influence over their bearers and a change of name is one of four actions that can avert an evil heavenly decree that would lead to punishment after one's death rabbinical commentators differ as to whether the name's influence is metaphysical connecting a person to their soul or bio-socio-psychological where the connection affects his personality appearance and social capacities the talmud also states that all those who descend to gehenna will rise in the time of messiah however there are three exceptions one of which is he who calls another by a derisive nickname

== naming convention ==
for wikipedia's own naming conventions see wikipedia:article titles
a naming convention is an attempt to systematize names in a field so they unambiguously convey similar information in a similar manner
several major naming conventions include
in astronomy planetary nomenclature
in classics roman naming conventions
in computer programming identifier naming conventions
in computer networking computer naming schemes
in the sciences systematic names for a variety of things
naming conventions are useful in many aspects of everyday life enabling the casual user to understand larger structures
street names within a city may follow a naming convention some examples include
in manhattan roads that cross the island from east to west are called streets those that run the length of the island (northsouth) are called avenues most of manhattan's streets and avenues are numbered with 1st street being near the southern end of the island and 219th street being near the northern end while 1st avenue is near the eastern edge of the island and 12th avenue near the western edge
in ontario numbered concession roads are eastwest whereas lines are northsouth routes
in san francisco at least three series of parallel streets are alphabetically named e.g irving judah kirkham lawton moraga noriega ortega pacheco quintara rivera santiago taraval ulloa vicente wawona
the same tendency is seen in the back bay neighborhood of boston massachusetts where arlington street is followed by roads to the west running parallel to it and named berkeley clarendon dartmouth exeter fairfield gloucester and hereford
in washington dc east capitol street runs eastwest through the capitol eastwest streets moving away from capitol street toward both the south (toward the potomac river) and the north are lettered a b c,... omitting j to avoid confusion on street signs and addresses but after these are exhausted to the north the streets are named with simple words in alphabetical order omitting a few letters such as x the first cycle of names consists all of one-syllable words then followed by a cycle of two-syllable words then followed by a cycle of three-syllable words and before these are exhausted maryland is reached (washington has north-south streets that are numbered increasing to either side of north capitol which likewise runs through the capitol.) suffixes (ne sw etc.) are used to distinguish between (up to four) duplicate addresses for example 140 d street sw to indicate the 140 d street location southwest of the capitol
in montgomery alabama the old major avenues are named for the presidents of the united states in their order of entering office omitting john quincy adams hence these streets are washington ave. adams ave. jefferson ave. madison ave. monroe ave. jackson ave. but not much farther than that this was just the old plan from a long time ago and it was eventually dropped for example there is not a buchanan ave. a lincoln ave. or a johnson ave
in brampton ontario different sections of town all have streets starting with the same letter and the alphabetical order reflects chronology
in phoenix arizona roads east of central avenue are termed streets while those west are avenues a similar system applies in nashville tennessee but only to the numbered avenues and streets west and east of the cumberland river respectively all of which run roughly northsouth
large corporate university or government campuses may follow a naming convention for rooms within the buildings to help orient tenants and visitors otherwise rooms may be numbered in some kind of a rational scheme
parents may follow a naming convention when selecting names for their children some have chosen alphabetical names by birth order in some east asian cultures it is common for one syllable in a two-syllable given name to be a generation name which is the same for immediate siblings in many cultures it is common for the son to be named after the father or a grandfather in certain african cultures such as in cameroon the eldest son gets the family name for his given name
in other cultures the name may include the place of residence or the place of birth the roman naming convention denotes social rank
products may follow a naming convention automobiles typically have a binomial name a make (manufacturer) and a model in addition to a model year such as a 2007 chevrolet corvette sometimes there is a name for the car's decoration level or trim line as well e.g. cadillac escalade ext platinum after the precious metal computers often have increasing numbers in their names to signify the next generation
courses at schools typically follow a naming convention an abbreviation for the subject area and then a number ordered by increasing level of difficulty
many numbers (e.g bank accounts government ids credit cards etc.) are not random but have an internal structure and convention virtually all organizations that assign names or numbers will follow some convention in generating these identifiers airline flight numbers space shuttle flight numbers even phone numbers all have an internal convention
=== brand names ===
the process of developing a name for a brand or product is heavily influenced by marketing research and strategy to be appealing and marketable the brand name is often a neologism or pseudoword such as kodak or sony
== name used by animals ==
the use of personal names is not unique to humans dolphins and green-rumped parrotlets also use symbolic names as has been shown by recent research individual dolphins have distinctive whistles to which they will respond even when there is no other information to clarify which dolphin is being referred to
