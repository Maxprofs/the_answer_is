a circle is a simple shape in euclidean geometry it is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point the centre equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves so that its distance from a given point is constant the distance between any of the points and the centre is called the radius
a circle is a simple closed curve which divides the plane into two regions an interior and an exterior in everyday use the term circle may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure or to the whole figure including its interior in strict technical usage the circle is only the boundary and the whole figure is called a disk
a circle may also be defined as a special ellipse in which the two foci are coincident and the eccentricity is 0 or the two-dimensional shape enclosing the most area per unit perimeter squared using calculus of variations

== history ==
the word circle derives from the greek / (kirkos/kuklos) itself a metathesis of the homeric greek (krikos) meaning hoop or ring the origins of the words circus and circuit are closely related
the circle has been known since before the beginning of recorded history natural circles would have been observed such as the moon sun and a short plant stalk blowing in the wind on sand which forms a circle shape in the sand the circle is the basis for the wheel which with related inventions such as gears makes much of modern machinery possible in mathematics the study of the circle has helped inspire the development of geometry astronomy and calculus
early science particularly geometry and astrology and astronomy was connected to the divine for most medieval scholars and many believed that there was something intrinsically divine or perfect that could be found in circles
some highlights in the history of the circle are
1700 bce the rhind papyrus gives a method to find the area of a circular field the result corresponds to 256/81 (3.16049...) as an approximate value of 
300 bce book 3 of euclid's elements deals with the properties of circles
in plato's seventh letter there is a detailed definition and explanation of the circle plato explains the perfect circle and how it is different from any drawing words definition or explanation
1880 ce lindemann proves that is transcendental effectively settling the millennia-old problem of squaring the circle
== analytic results ==
=== length of circumference ===
the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is (pi) an irrational constant approximately equal to 3.141592654 thus the length of the circumference c is related to the radius r and diameter d by
=== area enclosed ===
as proved by archimedes the area enclosed by a circle is equal to that of a triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius which comes to multiplied by the radius squared
equivalently denoting diameter by d
that is approximately 79 percent of the circumscribing square (whose side is of length d)
the circle is the plane curve enclosing the maximum area for a given arc length this relates the circle to a problem in the calculus of variations namely the isoperimetric inequality
=== equations ===
==== cartesian coordinates ====
in an xy cartesian coordinate system the circle with centre coordinates (a b) and radius r is the set of all points (x y) such that
this equation known as the equation of the circle follows from the pythagorean theorem applied to any point on the circle as shown in the diagram to the right the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length |x a| and |y b| if the circle is centred at the origin (0 0) then the equation simplifies to
the equation can be written in parametric form using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine as
where t is a parametric variable in the range 0 to 2 interpreted geometrically as the angle that the ray from (a b) to (x y) makes with the positive x-axis
an alternative parametrisation of the circle is
in this parametrisation the ratio of t to r can be interpreted geometrically as the stereographic projection of the line passing through the centre parallel to the x-axis (see tangent half-angle substitution) however this parametrisation works only if t is made to range not only through all reals but also to a point at infinity otherwise the bottom-most point of the circle would be omitted
in homogeneous coordinates each conic section with the equation of a circle has the form
it can be proven that a conic section is a circle exactly when it contains (when extended to the complex projective plane) the points i(1 i 0) and j(1 i 0) these points are called the circular points at infinity
==== polar coordinates ====
in polar coordinates the equation of a circle is
where a is the radius of the circle is the polar coordinate of a generic point on the circle and is the polar coordinate of the centre of the circle (i.e. r0 is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle and is the anticlockwise angle from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle) for a circle centred at the origin i.e r0 = 0 this reduces to simply r = a when r0 = a or when the origin lies on the circle the equation becomes
in the general case the equation can be solved for r giving
note that without the sign the equation would in some cases describe only half a circle
==== complex plane ====
in the complex plane a circle with a centre at c and radius (r) has the equation  in parametric form this can be written 
the slightly generalised equation for real p q and complex g is sometimes called a generalised circle this becomes the above equation for a circle with  since  not all generalised circles are actually circles a generalised circle is either a (true) circle or a line
=== tangent lines ===
the tangent line through a point p on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through p if p = (x1 y1) and the circle has centre (a b) and radius r then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (a b) to (x1 y1) so it has the form (x1 a)x + (y1 b)y = c evaluating at (x1 y1) determines the value of c and the result is that the equation of the tangent is
or
if y1 b then the slope of this line is
this can also be found using implicit differentiation
when the centre of the circle is at the origin then the equation of the tangent line becomes
and its slope is
== properties ==
the circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter (see isoperimetric inequality.)
the circle is a highly symmetric shape every line through the centre forms a line of reflection symmetry and it has rotational symmetry around the centre for every angle its symmetry group is the orthogonal group o(2,r) the group of rotations alone is the circle group t
all circles are similar
a circle's circumference and radius are proportional
the area enclosed and the square of its radius are proportional
the constants of proportionality are 2 and  respectively
the circle which is centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the unit circle
thought of as a great circle of the unit sphere it becomes the riemannian circle
through any three points not all on the same line there lies a unique circle in cartesian coordinates it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points see circumcircle
=== chord ===
chords are equidistant from the centre of a circle if and only if they are equal in length
the perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre of a circle equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector are
a perpendicular line from the centre of a circle bisects the chord
the line segment through the centre bisecting a chord is perpendicular to the chord
if a central angle and an inscribed angle of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle
if two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord then they are equal
if two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord then they are supplementary
for a cyclic quadrilateral the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle
an inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle (see thales theorem)
the diameter is the longest chord of the circle
if the intersection of any two chords divides one chord into lengths a and b and divides the other chord into lengths c and d then ab = cd
if the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths a and b and divides the other chord into lengths c and d then a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 equals the square of the diameter
the sum of the squared lengths of any two chords intersecting at right angles at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point and is given by 8r 2 4p 2 (where r is the circle's radius and p is the distance from the centre point to the point of intersection)
the distance from a point on the circle to a given chord times the diameter of the circle equals the product of the distances from the point to the ends of the chord
=== sagitta ===
the sagitta (also known as the versine) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle
given the length y of a chord and the length x of the sagitta the pythagorean theorem can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle which will fit around the two lines
another proof of this result which relies only on two chord properties given above is as follows given a chord of length y and with sagitta of length x since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord we know it is part of a diameter of the circle since the diameter is twice the radius the missing part of the diameter is (2r x) in length using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord we find that (2r x)x = (y / 2)2 solving for r we find the required result
=== tangent ===
a line drawn perpendicular to a radius through the end point of the radius lying on the circle is a tangent to the circle
a line drawn perpendicular to a tangent through the point of contact with a circle passes through the centre of the circle
two tangents can always be drawn to a circle from any point outside the circle and these tangents are equal in length
if a tangent at a and a tangent at b intersect at the exterior point p then denoting the centre as o the angles boa and bpa are supplementary
if ad is tangent to the circle at a and if aq is a chord of the circle then daq = 1/2arc(aq)
=== theorems ===
the chord theorem states that if two chords cd and eb intersect at a then ca da = ea ba
if a tangent from an external point d meets the circle at c and a secant from the external point d meets the circle at g and e respectively then dc2 = dg de (tangent-secant theorem.)
if two secants dg and de also cut the circle at h and f respectively then dh dg = df de (corollary of the tangent-secant theorem.)
the angle between a tangent and chord is equal to one half the subtended angle on the opposite side of the chord (tangent chord angle)
if the angle subtended by the chord at the centre is 90 degrees then l = r 2 where l is the length of the chord and r is the radius of the circle
if two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right then the measurement of angle a is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (de and bc) this is the secant-secant theorem
=== inscribed angles ===
an inscribed angle (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding central angle (red) hence all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary in particular every inscribed angle that subtends a diameter is a right angle (since the central angle is 180 degrees)
== circle of apollonius ==
apollonius of perga showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points in a plane having a constant ratio (other than 1) of distances to two fixed foci a and b (the set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of a and b a line.) that circle is sometimes said to be drawn about two points
the proof is in two parts first one must prove that given two foci a and b and a ratio of distances any point p satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle let c be another point also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment ab by the angle bisector theorem the line segment pc will bisect the interior angle apb since the segments are similar
analogously a line segment pd through some point d on ab extended bisects the corresponding exterior angle bpq where q is on ap extended since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees the angle cpd is exactly 90 degrees i.e. a right angle the set of points p such that angle cpd is a right angle forms a circle of which cd is a diameter
second see for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio
=== cross-ratios ===
a closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the cross-ratio of points in the complex plane if a b and c are as above then the circle of apollonius for these three points is the collection of points p for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one
stated another way p is a point on the circle of apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio [a,b;c,p] is on the unit circle in the complex plane
=== generalised circles ===
if c is the midpoint of the segment ab then the collection of points p satisfying the apollonius condition
is not a circle but rather a line
thus if a b and c are given distinct points in the plane then the locus of points p satisfying the above equation is called a generalised circle. it may either be a true circle or a line in this sense a line is a generalised circle of infinite radius
== circles inscribed in or circumscribed about other figures ==
in every triangle a unique circle called the incircle can be inscribed such that it is tangent to each of the three sides of the triangle
about every triangle a unique circle called the circumcircle can be circumscribed such that it goes through each of the triangle's three vertices
a tangential polygon such as a tangential quadrilateral is any convex polygon within which a circle can be inscribed that is tangent to each side of the polygon
a cyclic polygon is any convex polygon about which a circle can be circumscribed passing through each vertex a well-studied example is the cyclic quadrilateral
a hypocycloid is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle
== circle as limiting case of other figures ==
the circle can be viewed as a limiting case of each of various other figures
a cartesian oval is a set of points such that a weighted sum of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points (foci) is a constant an ellipse is the case in which the weights are equal a circle is an ellipse with an eccentricity of zero meaning that the two foci coincide with each other as the centre of the circle a circle is also a different special case of a cartesian oval in which one of the weights is zero
a superellipse has an equation of the form for positive a b and n a supercircle has b = a a circle is the special case of a supercircle in which n = 2
a cassini oval is a set of points such that the product of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points is a constant when the two fixed points coincide a circle results
a curve of constant width is a figure whose width defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in a single point is the same regardless of the direction of those two parallel lines the circle is the simplest example of this type of figure
== squaring the circle ==
squaring the circle is the problem proposed by ancient geometers of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge
in 1882 the task was proven to be impossible as a consequence of the lindemannweierstrass theorem which proves that pi () is a transcendental number rather than an algebraic irrational number that is it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients
