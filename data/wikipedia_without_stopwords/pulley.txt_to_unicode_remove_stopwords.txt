pulley wheel axle shaft designed support movement change direction taut cable belt along circumference pulleys used variety ways lift loads apply forces transmit power nautical contexts assembly wheel axle supporting shell referred block
pulley may also called sheave drum may groove two flanges around circumference drive element pulley system rope cable belt chain runs pulley inside groove
hero alexandria identified pulley one six simple machines used lift weights pulleys assembled form block tackle order provide mechanical advantage apply large forces pulleys also assembled part belt chain drives order transmit power one rotating shaft another
block tackleedit
set pulleys assembled rotate independently axle form block two blocks rope attached one blocks threaded two sets pulleys form block tackle
block tackle assembled one block attached fixed mounting point attached moving load ideal mechanical advantage block tackle equal number parts rope support moving block

rope pulley systemsedit
rope pulley system block tackle characterised use single continuous rope transmit tension force around one pulleys lift move loadthe rope may light line strong cable system included list simple machines identified renaissance scientists
rope pulley system dissipate store energy mechanical advantage number parts rope act load shown follows
consider set pulleys form moving block parts rope support block p parts rope supporting load w force balance moving block shows tension parts rope must wp means input force rope twp thus block tackle reduces input force factor p
worksedit
simplest theory operation pulley system assumes pulleys lines weightless energy loss due friction also assumed lines stretch
equilibrium forces moving block must sum zero addition tension rope must parts means two parts rope supporting moving block must support half load
different types pulley systems
fixed fixed pulley axle mounted bearings attached supporting structure fixed pulley changes direction force rope belt moves along circumference mechanical advantage gained combining fixed pulley movable pulley another fixed pulley different diameter
movable movable pulley axle movable block single movable pulley supported two parts rope mechanical advantage two
compound combination fixed movable pulleys forms block tackle block tackle several pulleys mounted fixed moving axles increasing mechanical advantage
mechanical advantage gun tackle increased interchanging fixed moving blocks rope attached moving block rope pulled direction lifted load case block tackle said rove advantage diagram shows three rope parts support load w means tension rope w thus mechanical advantage three
adding pulley fixed block gun tackle direction pulling force reversed though mechanical advantage remains diagram example luff tackle

ratio load input tension force mechanical advantage ma pulley system
thus mechanical advantage system equal number sections rope supporting load
belt pulley systemsedit
belt pulley system characterised two pulleys common belt allows mechanical power torque speed transmitted across axles pulleys differing diameters mechanical advantage realised
