interpretation or interpreting is the facilitating of oral or sign-language communication either simultaneously or consecutively between users of different languages translation studies is the systematic study of the theory description and application of interpretation and translation
an interpreter is a person who converts a thought or expression in a source language into an expression with a comparable meaning in a target language either simultaneously in real time or consecutively when the speaker pauses after completing one or two sentences
the interpreter's function is to convey every semantic element as well as tone and register and every intention and feeling of the message that the source-language speaker is directing to target-language recipients (except in summary interpretation used sometimes in conferences)
for written speeches and lectures sometimes the reading of pre-translated texts is used
== comparison to translation ==
despite being used in a non-technical sense as interchangeable interpreting and translation are not synonymous interpreting takes a message from a source language and renders that message into a different target language (ex english into french) in interpreting the interpreter will take in a complex concept from one language choose the most appropriate vocabulary in the target language to faithfully render the message in a linguistically emotionally tonally and culturally equivalent message translation is the transference of meaning from text to text (written or recorded) with the translator having time and access to resources (dictionaries glossaries etc.) to produce an accurate document or verbal artifact lesser known is transliteration, used within sign language interpreting takes one form of a language and transfer those same words into another form (ex spoken english into a signed form of english signed exact english not asl)
in court interpreting it is not acceptable to omit anything from the source no matter how quickly the source speaks since not only is accuracy a principal canon for interpreters but mandatory the inaccurate interpretation of even a single word in a material can totally mislead the triers of fact the most important factor for this level of accuracy is the use of a team of two or more interpreters during a lengthy process with one actively interpreting and the second monitoring for greater accuracy although there are many different opinions in the industry on to how to deliver the most accuracy in stressful situations
translators have time to consider and revise each word and sentence before delivering their product to the client while live interpretation's goal is to achieve total accuracy at all times details of the original (source) speech can be missed and interpreters can ask for clarification from the speaker in any language including sign languages when a word is used for which there is no exact match expansion may be necessary in order to fully interpret the intended meaning of the word (ex the english word hospitable may require several words or phrases to encompass its complex meaning) another unique situation is when an interpreted message appears much shorter or longer than the original message the message may appear shorter at times because of unique efficiencies within a certain language
english to spanish is a prime example spanish uses gender specific nouns not used in english which convey information in a more condensed package thus requiring more words and time in an english interpretation to provide the same plethora of information because of situations like these interpreting often requires a lag or processing time this time allows the interpreter to take in subjects and verbs in order to rearrange grammar appropriately while picking accurate vocabulary before starting the message while working with interpreters it is important to remember lag time in order to avoid accidentally interrupting one another and to receive the entire message
== modes ==
=== simultaneous ===
in simultaneous interpretation (si) the interpreter renders the message in the target-language as quickly as he or she can formulate it from the source language while the source-language speaker continuously speaks the most common form is extempore si where the interpreter does not know the message until he or she hears it si is the common mode used by sign language interpreters
in the ideal setting for oral language the interpreter sits in a sound-proof booth and speaks into a microphone while clearly seeing and hearing the source-language speaker via earphones the simultaneous interpretation is rendered to the target-language listeners via their earphones
the first introduction and employment of extempore simultaneous interpretation using electronic equipment that can facilitate large numbers of listeners was the nuremberg trials with four official working languages
=== consecutive ===
in consecutive interpreting (ci) the interpreter speaks after the source-language speaker completes one or two complete sentences the speech is divided into segments and the interpreter sits or stands beside the source-language speaker listening and taking notes as the speaker progresses through the message when the speaker pauses or finishes speaking the interpreter then renders a portion of the message or the entire message in the target language
consecutive interpretation is rendered as short ci or long ci in short ci the interpreter relies on memory each message segment being brief enough to memorize in long ci the interpreter takes notes of the message to aid rendering long passages these informal divisions are established with the client before the interpretation is effected depending upon the subject its complexity and the purpose of the interpretation
on occasion document sight translation is required of the interpreter during consecutive interpretation work sight translation combines interpretation and translation the interpreter must render the source-language document to the target-language as if it was written in the target language sight translation occurs usually but not exclusively in judicial and medical work
consecutively interpreted speeches or segments of them tend to be short fifty years ago the ci interpreter would render speeches of 20 or 30 minutes today 10 or 15 minutes is considered too long particularly since audiences usually prefer not to sit through 20 minutes of speech they cannot understand
often if not previously advised the source-language speaker is unaware that they may speak more than a single sentence before the ci interpretation is rendered and might stop after each sentence to await its target-language rendering sometimes however depending upon the setting or subject matter and upon the interpreter's capacity to memorize the interpreter may ask the speaker to pause after each sentence or after each clause sentence-by-sentence interpreting requires less memorization and therefore lower likelihood for omissions yet its disadvantage is in the interpreter's not having heard the entire speech or its gist and the overall message is sometimes harder to render both because of lack of context and because of interrupted delivery (for example imagine a joke told in bits and pieces with breaks for translation in between) this method is often used in rendering speeches depositions recorded statements court witness testimony and medical and job interviews but it is usually best to complete a whole idea before it is interpreted
full (i.e. unbroken) consecutive interpreting of whole thoughts allows for the full meaning of the source-language message to be understood before the interpreter renders it in the target language this affords a truer more accurate and more accessible interpretation than does simultaneous interpretation
the only case in which the technique of consecutive interpretation cannot be applied is when a written speech is being read out written speeches are best dealt with by the reading of pre-translated texts
=== whispered ===
in whispered interpreting (chuchotage in french) sometimes called whispering simultaneous the interpreter sits or stands next to the person or people requiring interpretation (a maximum of two people can be accommodated unless a microphone and headphones are used) the interpreter does not whisper as this would after a time be taxing on the voice making further speech impossible due to the hoarseness whispering for long periods induces instead the interpreter speaks softly using normal (voiced) speech kept at a low volume the interpreter's mouth and the ear of the person listening must be in close proximity so as not to disturb the others in the room without electronic equipment chucotage is tiring as the interpreter's posture is affected
simultaneous interpreting is used when people need to follow what is said in the room without themselves making a contribution whereas consecutive interpretation is used when there is a dialogue and perhaps people wish to hear what the original speaker said in the source language because some of the listeners speak that language or in a court setting to preserve for the record the original words of the speaker when a witness or other party is questioned
consecutive interpretation will double the time taken as everything said in source language is repeated once again in the target language
because of the intense concentration needed by interpreters to hear every word spoken and provide an accurate rendition in the target language professional interpreters work in pairs or in teams of three so that the interpreters can switch and rest after interpreting for about ten to twenty minutes (depending on the difficulty of the content)
=== relay ===
relay interpreting is usually used when there are several target languages a source-language interpreter interprets the text to a language common to every interpreter who then render the message to their respective target languages for example a japanese source message first is rendered to english to a group of interpreters who listen to the english and render the message into arabic french and russian the other target languages in heavily multilingual meetings there may be more than one intermediate language i.e a greek source language could be interpreted into english and then from english to other languages and at the same time it may also be directly interpreted into french and from french into yet more languages this solution is most often used in the multilingual meetings of the eu institutions
=== liaison ===
liaison interpreting involves relaying what is spoken to one between two or among many people this can be done after a short speech or consecutively sentence-by-sentence or as chuchotage (whispering) aside from notes taken at the time no equipment is used
== types ==
=== conference ===
conference interpreting refers to interpretation at a conference or large meeting either simultaneously or consecutively the advent of multi-lingual meetings has reduced the amount of consecutive interpretation in the last 20 years
conference interpretation is divided between two markets institutional and private international institutions (eu un epo et cetera) which hold multilingual meetings often favor interpreting several foreign languages into the interpreters mother tongues local private markets tend to have bilingual meetings (the local language plus another) and the interpreters work both into and out of their mother tongues these markets are not mutually exclusive the international association of conference interpreters (aiic) is the only worldwide association of conference interpreters founded in 1953 its membership includes more than 2,800 professional conference interpreters in more than 90 countries
=== judicial ===
judicial legal or court interpreting occurs in courts of justice administrative tribunals and wherever a legal proceeding is held (i e. a police station for an interrogation a conference room for a deposition or the locale for taking a sworn statement) legal interpreting can be the consecutive interpretation of witnesses testimony for example or the simultaneous interpretation of entire proceedings by electronic means for one person or all of the people attending
the right to a competent interpreter for anyone who does not understand the language of the court (especially for the accused in a criminal trial) is usually considered a fundamental rule of justice therefore this right is often guaranteed in national constitutions declarations of rights fundamental laws establishing the justice system or by precedents set by the highest courts however it is not a constitutionally required procedure (in the united states) that a certified interpreter be present at police interrogation
in the us depending upon the regulations and standards adhered to per state and venue court interpreters usually work alone when interpreting consecutively or as a team when interpreting simultaneously in addition to practical mastery of the source and target languages thorough knowledge of law and legal and court procedures is required of court interpreters they are often required to have formal authorization from the state to work in the courts and then are called certified court interpreters in many jurisdictions the interpretation is considered an essential part of the evidence incompetent interpretation or simply failure to swear in the interpreter can lead to a mistrial
=== escort ===
in escort interpreting an interpreter accompanies a person or a delegation on a tour on a visit or to a meeting or interview an interpreter in this role is called an escort interpreter or an escorting interpreter this is liaison interpreting
=== public sector ===
also known as community interpreting is the type of interpreting occurring in fields such as legal health and local government social housing environmental health education and welfare services in community interpreting factors exist which determine and affect language and communication production such as speech's emotional content hostile or polarized social surroundings its created stress the power relationships among participants and the interpreter's degree of responsibility in many cases more than extreme in some cases even the life of the other person depends upon the interpreter's work
=== medical ===
medical interpreting is a subset of public service interpreting consisting of communication among healthcare personnel and the patient and their family or among healthcare personnel speaking different languages facilitated by an interpreter usually formally educated and qualified to provide such interpretation services in some situations medical employees who are multilingual may participate part-time as members of internal language banks depending on country/state specific requirements the interpreter is often required to have some knowledge of medical terminology common procedures the patient interview and exam process medical interpreters are often cultural liaisons for people (regardless of language) who are unfamiliar with or uncomfortable in hospital clinical or medical settings
for example in china there is no mandatory certificate for medical interpreters as of 2012 most interpretation in hospitals in china is done by doctors who are proficient in both chinese and english (mostly) in his/her specialty they interpret more in academic settings than for communications between doctors and patients when a patient needs english language service in a chinese hospital more often than not the patient will be directed to a staff member in the hospital who is recognized by his/her colleagues as proficient in english the actual quality of such service for patients or medical translation for communications between doctors speaking different languages is unknown by the interpreting community as interpreters who lack healthcare background rarely receive accreditation for medical translation in the medical community interpreters working in the healthcare setting may be considered allied health professionals
=== sign language ===
a sign language interpreter must accurately convey messages between two different languages an interpreter is there for both deaf and hearing individuals the act of interpreting occurs when a hearing person speaks and an interpreter renders the speaker's meaning into sign language or other forms used by the deaf party(ies) the interpreting also happens in reverse when a deaf person signs an interpreter renders the meaning expressed in the signs into the oral language for the hearing party which is sometimes referred to as voice interpreting or voicing this may be performed either as simultaneous or consecutive interpreting skilled sign language interpreters will position themselves in a room or space that allows them to be seen by the deaf participants and heard clearly by hearing participants as well as be in a position to hear and/or see the speaker or speakers clearly in some circumstances an interpreter may interpret from one language to another whether that is english to british sign language english to american sign language spanish to english to american sign language and so on
deaf individuals also have the opportunity to work as interpreters the deaf individual will team with a hearing counterpart to provide interpretation for deaf individuals who may not know the same sign language used in that country who have minimal language skills are developmentally delayed or have other mental and/or physical disabilities which make communication a unique challenge in other cases the hearing interpreter may interpret in the sign language whichever kind of sign language the team knows and the deaf team will then interpret into the language in which the individual can understand they also interpret information from one medium of language into another for example when a person is signing visually the deaf interpreter could be hired to copy those signs into a deaf-blind person's hand and add visual information
most interpreters have been formally trained in an interpreter training program (itp) itp lengths vary and are usually two or four years to obtain a degree or certificate graduate programs are also available
in the united states sign language interpreters have national and state level certifications the registry of interpreters for the deaf (rid) a non-profit organization is known for its national recognition and certification process in addition to training requirements and stringent certification testing the rid members must abide by a code of professional conduct grievance process and continuing education requirement there are many interpreter-training programs in the u.s the collegiate commission on interpreter education is the body that accredits interpreter preparation programs a list of accredited programs can be found on the ccie web site
european countries and countries elsewhere have their own national association of sign language interpreters some countries have more than one national association due to regional or language differences the european forum of sign language interpreters (efsli) is the umbrella organization of sign language interpreters in europe
=== media ===
by its very nature media interpreting has to be conducted in the simultaneous mode it is provided particularly for live television coverages such as press conferences live or taped interviews with political figures musicians artists sportsmen or people from the business circle in this type of interpreting the interpreter has to sit in a sound-proof booth where ideally he/she can see the speakers on a monitor and the set all equipment should be checked before recording begins in particular satellite connections have to be double-checked to ensure that the interpreter's voice is not sent back and the interpreter gets to hear only one channel at a time in the case of interviews recorded outside the studio and some current affairs program the interpreter interprets what he or she hears on a tv monitor background noise can be a serious problem the interpreter working for the media has to sound as slick and confident as a television presenter
media interpreting has gained more visibility and presence especially after the gulf war television channels have begun to hire staff simultaneous interpreters the interpreter renders the press conferences telephone beepers interviews and similar live coverage for the viewers it is more stressful than other types of interpreting as the interpreter has to deal with a wide range of technical problems coupled with the control room's hassle and wrangling during live coverage
== modalities ==
interpreting services can be delivered in multiple modalities the most common modality through which interpreting services are provided is on-site interpreting
=== on-site ===
also called in-person interpreting or sometimes colloquialized as face-to-face this delivery method requires the interpreter to be physically present in order for the interpretation to take place in on-site interpreting settings all of the parties who wish to speak to one another are usually located in the same place this is by far the most common modality used for most public and social service settings
=== telephone ===
also referred to as over-the-phone interpreting, telephonic interpreting, and tele-interpreting, telephone interpreting enables interpretation via telephone the interpreter is added to a conference call telephone interpreting may be used in place of on-site interpreting when no on-site interpreter is readily available at the location where services are needed however it is more commonly used for situations in which all parties who wish to communicate are already speaking to one another via telephone (e.g telephone applications for insurance or credit cards or telephone inquiries from consumers to businesses)
=== video ===
interpretation services via video remote interpreting (vri) or a video relay service (vrs) are useful for spoken language barriers where visual-cultural recognition is relevant and even more applicable where one of the parties is deaf hard-of-hearing or speech-impaired (mute) in such cases the interpretation flow is normally within the same principal language such as french sign language (fsl) to spoken french spanish sign language (ssl) to spoken spanish british sign language (bsl) to spoken english and american sign language (asl) also to spoken english (since bsl and asl are completely distinct) etc multilingual sign language interpreters who can also translate as well across principal languages (such as to and from ssl to and from spoken english) are also available albeit less frequently such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the translator since sign languages are distinct natural languages with their own construction and syntax different from the aural version of the same principal language
with video interpreting sign language interpreters work remotely with live video and audio feeds so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party converse with the hearing party and vice versa much like telephone interpreting video interpreting can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available however video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone vri and vrs interpretation requires all parties to have the necessary equipment some advanced equipment enables interpreters to control the video camera in order to zoom in and out and to point the camera toward the party that is signing
== venues ==
the majority of professional full-time conference interpreters work for phone interpreting agencies health care institutions courts school systems and international organizations like the united nations the european union or the african union
the world's largest employer of interpreters is currently the european commission which employs hundreds of staff and freelance interpreters working into the official languages of the european union the european union's other institutions (the european parliament and the european court of justice) have smaller interpreting services
the united nations employs interpreters at almost all its sites throughout the world because it has only six official languages however it is a smaller employer than the european union
interpreters may also work as freelance operators in their local regional and national communities or may take on contract work under an interpreting business or service they would typically take on work as described above
the u.s military in iraq and afghanistan employ hundreds of interpreters to assist with its communications with the local population
== certifications ==
no worldwide testing or certification agency exists for all types of interpreters for conference interpretation there is the international association of conference interpreters or aiic
specific regions countries or even cities will have their own certification standards in many cases graduates of a certain caliber university program acts as a de facto certification for conference interpretation
