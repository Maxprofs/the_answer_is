inhibitors poisons promotersedit
substances reduce action catalysts called catalyst inhibitors reversible catalyst poisons irreversible promoters substances increase catalytic activity even though catalysts
inhibitors sometimes referred negative catalysts since decrease reaction rate however term inhibitor preferred since work introducing reaction path higher activation energy would reduce rate since reaction would continue occur noncatalyzed path instead act either deactivating catalysts removing reaction intermediates free radicals
inhibitor may modify selectivity addition rate instance reduction acetylene ethylene palladium pd catalyst partly poisoned leadii acetate pbchcoo used without deactivation catalyst ethene produced reduced ethane
inhibitor produce effect eg selectively poisoning certain types active sites another mechanism modification surface geometry instance hydrogenation operations large planes metal surface function sites hydrogenolysis catalysis sites catalyzing hydrogenation unsaturates smaller thus poison covers surface randomly tend reduce number uncontaminated large planes leave proportionally smaller sites free thus changing hydrogenation vs hydrogenolysis selectivity many mechanisms also possible
promoters cover surface prevent production mat coke even actively remove material eg rhenium platinum platforming aid dispersion catalytic material bind reagents
