a shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot while doing various activities shoes are also used as an item of decoration the design of shoes has varied enormously through time and from culture to culture with appearance originally being tied to function additionally fashion has often dictated many design elements such as whether shoes have very high heels or flat ones contemporary footwear varies widely in style complexity and cost basic sandals may consist of only a thin sole and simple strap high fashion shoes may be made of very expensive materials in complex construction and sell for thousands of dollars a pair other shoes are for very specific purposes such as boots designed specifically for mountaineering or skiing
traditionally shoes have been made from leather wood or canvas but are increasingly made from rubber plastics and other petrochemical-derived materials
the foot contains more bones than any other single part of the body though it has evolved over hundreds of thousands of years in relation to vastly varied terrain and climate conditions the foot is still vulnerable to environmental hazards such as sharp rocks and hot ground against which shoes can protect
== history ==
=== antiquity ===
the earliest known shoes are sandals dating from approximately 7,000 or 8,000 bce found in the fort rock cave in the us state of oregon in 1938 the world's oldest leather shoe made from a single piece of cowhide laced with a leather cord along seams at the front and back was found in the areni-1 cave complex in armenia in 2008 and is believed to date to 3,500 b.c tzi the iceman's shoes dating to 3,300 bc featured brown bearskin bases deerskin side panels and a bark-string net which pulled tight around the foot the jotunheimen shoe was discovered in august 2006 archaeologists estimate that the leather shoe was made between 1800 and 1100 bce making it the oldest article of clothing discovered in scandinavia
however it is estimated that shoes may have been used long before this but it is difficult to find evidence of the earliest footwear due to the highly perishable nature of early shoes by studying the bones of the smaller toes (as opposed to the big toe) it was observed that their thickness decreased approximately 40,000 to 26,000 years ago this led archaeologists to deduce that wearing shoes resulted in less bone growth resulting in shorter thinner toes these earliest designs were very simple in design often mere foot bags of leather to protect the feet from rocks debris and cold they were more commonly found in colder climates
many early natives in north america wore a similar type of footwear known as the moccasin these are tight-fitting soft-soled shoes typically made out of leather or bison hides many moccasins were also decorated with various beads and other adornments moccasins were not designed to be waterproof and in wet weather and warm summer months most native americans went barefoot
as civilizations began to develop thong sandals (the precursors of the modern flip-flop) were worn this practice dates back to pictures of them in ancient egyptian murals from 4,000 b.c one pair found in europe was made of papyrus leaves and dated to be approximately 1,500 years old they were also worn in jerusalem during the time of jesus christ thong sandals were worn by many civilizations and made from a wide variety of materials ancient egyptian sandals were made from papyrus and palm leaves the masai of africa made them out of rawhide in india they were made from wood in china and japan rice straw was used the leaves of the sisal plant were used to make twine for sandals in south america while the natives of mexico used the yucca plant
while thong sandals were commonly worn many people in ancient times such as the egyptians hindus and greeks saw little need for footwear and most of the time preferred being barefoot the egyptians and hindus made some use of ornamental footwear such as a soleless sandal known as a cleopatra which did not provide any practical protection for the foot the ancient greeks largely viewed footwear as self-indulgent unaesthetic and unnecessary shoes were primarily worn in the theater as a means of increasing stature and many preferred to go barefoot athletes in the ancient olympic games participated barefoot and naked even the gods and heroes were primarily depicted barefoot and the hoplite warriors fought battles in bare feet and alexander the great conquered his vast empire with barefoot armies the runners of ancient greece are also believed to have run barefoot pheidippides the first marathoner ran from athens to sparta in less than 36 hours after the battle of marathon he ran straight from the battlefield to athens to inform the athenians of the news
the romans who eventually conquered the greeks and adopted many aspects of their culture did not adopt the greek perception of footwear and clothing roman clothing was seen as a sign of power and footwear was seen as a necessity of living in a civilized world although the slaves and paupers usually went barefoot roman soldiers were issued with chiral footwear there are many references to shoes being worn in the bible during weddings of this period a father would give his son-in-law a pair of shoes to symbolize the transfer of authority slaves were also commonly barefoot and shoes were considered badges of freedom since biblical times
=== middle ages and early modern period ===
a common casual shoe in the pyrenees during the middle ages were espadrilles these are sandals with braided jute soles and a fabric upper portion and often includes fabric laces that tie around the ankle the term is french and comes from the esparto grass the shoes originate in the catalonian region of spain as early as the 13th century and were commonly worn by peasants in the farming communities in the area
many medieval shoes were made using the turnshoe method of construction in which the upper was turned flesh side out and was lasted onto the sole and joined to the edge by a seam the shoe was then turned inside-out so that the grain was outside some shoes were developed with toggled flaps or drawstrings to tighten the leather around the foot for a better fit surviving medieval turnshoes often fit the foot closely with the right and left shoe being mirror images the turnshoe method was replaced by the welted method around 1500
by the 15th century pattens became popular by both men and women in europe these are commonly seen as the predecessor of the modern high-heeled shoe while the poor and lower classes in europe as well as slaves in the new world were barefoot in the 15th century the crakow was fashionable in europe this style of shoe is named because it is thought to have originated in krakw the capitol of poland the style is characterized by the point of the shoe known as the polaine which often was supported by a whalebone tied to the knee to prevent the point getting in the way while walking also during the 15th century chopines were created in turkey and were usually 7-8 inches (17.7-20.3 cm) high these shoes became popular in venice and throughout europe as a status symbol revealing wealth and social standing during the 16th century royalty started wearing high-heeled shoes to make them look taller or larger than life such as catherine de medici or mary i of england by 1580 even men wore them and a person with authority or wealth was often referred to as well-heeled
eventually the modern shoe with a sewn-on sole was devised since the 17th century most leather shoes have used a sewn-on sole this remains the standard for finer-quality dress shoes today until around 1800 welted rand shoes were commonly made without differentiation for the left or right foot such shoes are now referred to as straights only gradually did the modern foot-specific shoe become standard
=== industrial era ===
shoemaking became more commercialized in the mid-18th century as it expanded as a cottage industry large warehouses began to stock footwear in warehouses made by many small manufacturers from the area
until the 19th century shoemaking was a traditional handicraft but by the century's end the process had been almost completely mechanized with production occurring in large factories despite the obvious economic gains of mass-production the factory system produced shoes without the individual differentiation that the traditional shoemaker was able to provide
the first steps towards mechanisation were taken during the napoleonic wars by the engineer marc brunel he developed machinery for the mass-production of boots for the soldiers of the british army in 1812 he devised a scheme for making nailed-boot-making machinery that automatically fastened soles to uppers by means of metallic pins or nails with the support of the duke of york the shoes were manufactured and due to their strength cheapness and durability were introduced for the use of the army in the same year the use of screws and staples was patented by richard woodman brunel's system was described by sir richard phillips as a visitor to his factory in battersea as follows
in another building i was shown his manufactory of shoes which like the other is full of ingenuity and in regard to subdivision of labour brings this fabric on a level with the oft-admired manufactory of pins every step in it is effected by the most elegant and precise machinery while as each operation is performed by one hand so each shoe passes through twenty-five hands who complete from the hide as supplied by the currier a hundred pairs of strong and well-finished shoes per day all the details are performed by the ingenious application of the mechanic powers and all the parts are characterised by precision uniformity and accuracy as each man performs but one step in the process which implies no knowledge of what is done by those who go before or follow him so the persons employed are not shoemakers but wounded soldiers who are able to learn their respective duties in a few hours the contract at which these shoes are delivered to government is 6s 6d per pair being at least 2s less than what was paid previously for an unequal and cobbled article.
however when the war ended in 1815 manual labour became much cheaper and the demand for military equipment subsided as a consequence brunel's system was no longer profitable and it soon ceased business
similar exigencies at the time of the crimean war stimulated a renewed interest in methods of mechanization and mass-production which proved longer lasting a shoemaker in leicester tomas crick patented the design for a riveting machine in 1853 his machine used an iron plate to push iron rivets into the sole the process greatly increased the speed and efficiency of production he also introduced the use of steam-powered rolling-machines for hardening leather and cutting-machines in the mid-1850s
the sewing machine was introduced in 1846 and provided an alternative method for the mechanization of shoemaking by the late 1850s the industry was beginning to shift towards the modern factory mainly in the us and areas of england a shoe stitching machine was invented by the american lyman blake in 1856 and perfected by 1864 entering in to partnership with mckay his device became known as the mckay stitching machine and was quickly adopted by manufacturers throughout new england as bottlenecks opened up in the production line due to these innovations more and more of the manufacturing stages such as pegging and finishing became automated by the 1890s the process of mechanisation was largely complete
since the mid-20th century advances in rubber plastics synthetic cloth and industrial adhesives have allowed manufacturers to create shoes that stray considerably from traditional crafting techniques leather which had been the primary material in earlier styles has remained standard in expensive dress shoes but athletic shoes often have little or no real leather soles which were once laboriously hand-stitched on are now more often machine stitched or simply glued on many of these newer materials such as rubber and plastics have made shoes less biodegradable it is estimated that most mass-produced shoes require 1000 years to degrade in a landfill in the late 2000s some shoemakers picked up on the issue and began to produce shoes made entirely from degradable materials such as the nike considered
in 2007 the global shoe industry had an overall market of $107.4 billion in terms of revenue and is expected to grow to $122.9 billion by the end of 2012 shoe manufacturers in the people's republic of china account for 63% of production 40.5% of global exports and 55% of industry revenue however many manufacturers in europe dominate the higher-priced higher value-added end of the market
=== culture and folklore ===
as an integral part of human culture and civilization shoes have found their way into our culture folklore and art a popular 18th century nursery rhyme is there was an old woman who lived in a shoe this story tells about an old woman living in a shoe with a lot of children in 1948 mahlon haines a shoe salesman in hallam pennsylvania built an actual house shaped like a work boot as a form of advertisement the haines shoe house was rented to newlyweds and the elderly until his death in 1962 since then it has served as an ice cream parlor a bed and breakfast and a museum it still stands today and is a popular roadside attraction
shoes also play an important role in the fairy tales cinderella and the red shoes in the movie adaption of the children's book the wonderful wizard of oz a pair of red ruby slippers play a key role in the plot the 1985 comedy the man with one red shoe features an eccentric man wearing one normal business shoe and one red shoe that becomes central to the plot
athletic sneaker collection has also existed as a part of urban subculture in the united states for several decades recent decades have seen this trend spread to european nations such as the czech republic a sneakerhead is a person who owns multiple pairs of shoes as a form of collection and fashion a contributor to the growth of sneaker collecting is the continued worldwide popularity of the air jordan line of sneakers designed by nike for basketball star michael jordan
in the holy bible's old testament the shoe is used to symbolize something that is worthless or of little value in the new testament the act of removing one's shoes symbolizes servitude the semites regarded the act of removing their shoes as a mark of reverence when approaching a sacred person or place in the book of exodus moses was instructed to remove his shoes before approaching the burning bush
the removal of the shoe also symbolizes the act of giving up a legal right in hebrew custom the widow removed the shoe of her late husband's brother to symbolize that he had abandoned his duty in arab custom the removal of one's shoe also symbolized the dissolution of marriage
in arab culture showing the sole of one's shoe is considered an insult and to throw a shoe and hit someone with it is considered an even greater insult shoes are considered to be dirty as they frequently touch the ground and are associated with the lowest part of the body the foot as such shoes are forbidden in mosques and it is also considered unmannerly to cross the legs and display the soles of one's shoes to someone when talking to them this insult was demonstrated in iraq first when saddam hussein's statue was toppled in 2003 iraqis gathered around it and struck the statue with their shoes secondly in 2008 united states president george w bush had a shoe thrown at him by a journalist as a statement against the war that was brought to iraq and the lives that it has cost
empty shoes may also symbolize death in greek culture empty shoes are the equivalent of the american funeral wreath for example empty shoes placed outside of a greek home would tell others that the family's son has died in battle at an observation memorializing the 10th anniversary of the september 11 attacks 3,000 pairs of empty shoes were used to recognize those killed
== shoe construction ==
the basic anatomy of a shoe is recognizable regardless of the specific style of footwear
all shoes have a sole which is the bottom of a shoe in contact with the ground soles can be made from a variety of materials although most modern shoes have soles made from natural rubber polyurethane or polyvinyl chloride (pvc) compounds soles can be simple a single material in a single layer or they can be complex with multiple structures or layers and materials when various layers are used soles may consist of an insole midsole and an outsole
the insole is the interior bottom of a shoe which sits directly beneath the foot under the footbed (also known as sock liner) the purpose of insole is to attach to the lasting margin of the upper which is wrapped around the last during the closing of the shoe during the lasting operation insoles are usually made of cellulosic paper board or synthetic non woven insole board many shoes have removable and replaceable footbeds extra cushioning is often added for comfort (to control the shape moisture or smell of the shoe) or health reasons (to help deal with differences in the natural shape of the foot or positioning of the foot during standing or walking)
the outsole is the layer in direct contact with the ground dress shoes often have leather or resin rubber outsoles casual or work-oriented shoes have outsoles made of natural rubber or a synthetic material like polyurethane the outsole may comprise a single piece or may be an assembly of separate pieces often of different materials on some shoes the heel of the sole has a rubber plate for durability and traction while the front is leather for style specialized shoes will often have modifications on this design athletic or so called cleated shoes like soccer rugby baseball and golf shoes have spikes embedded in the outsole to improve traction
the midsole is the layer in between the outsole and the insole typically there for shock absorption some types of shoes like running shoes have additional material for shock absorption usually beneath the heel of the foot where one puts the most pressure down some shoes may not have a midsole at all
the heel is the bottom rear part of a shoe its function is to support the heel of the foot they are often made of the same material as the sole of the shoe this part can be high for fashion or to make the person look taller or flat for a more practical and comfortable use on some shoes the inner forward point of the heel is chiselled off a feature known as a gentleman's corner this piece of design is intended to alleviate the problem of the points catching the bottom of trousers and was first observed in the 1930s
the upper helps hold the shoe onto the foot in the simplest cases such as sandals or flip-flops this may be nothing more than a few straps for holding the sole in place closed footwear such as boots trainers and most men's shoes will have a more complex upper this part is often decorated or is made in a certain style to look attractive the upper is connected to the sole by a strip of leather rubber or plastic that is stitched between it and the sole known as a welt
most uppers have a mechanism such as laces straps with buckles zippers elastic velcro straps buttons or snaps for tightening the upper on the foot uppers with laces usually have a tongue that helps seal the laced opening and protect the foot from abrasion by the laces uppers with laces also have eyelets or hooks to make it easier to tighten and loosen the laces and to prevent the lace from tearing through the upper material an aglet is the protective wrapping on the end of the lace
the vamp is the front part of the shoe starting behind the toe extending around the eyelets and tongue and towards back part of the shoe
the medial is the part of the shoe closest to a person's center of symmetry and the lateral is on the opposite side away from their center of symmetry this can be in reference to either the outsole or the vamp most shoes have shoelaces on the upper connecting the medial and lateral parts after one puts their shoes on and aiding in keeping their shoes on their feet in 1968 puma se introduced the first pair of sneakers with velcro straps in lieu of shoelaces and these became popular by the 1980s especially among children and the elderly
the toe box is the part that covers and protects the toes people with toe deformities or individuals who experience toe swelling (such as long distance runners) usually require a larger toe box
== types ==
there are a wide variety of different types of shoes most types of shoes are designed for specific activities for example boots are typically designed for work or heavy outdoor use athletic shoes are designed for particular sports such as running walking or other sports some shoes are designed to be worn at more formal occasions and others are designed for casual wear there are also a wide variety of shoes designed for different types of dancing orthopedic shoes are special types of footwear designed for individuals with particular foot problems or special needs other animals such as dogs and horses may also wear special shoes to protect their feet as well
depending on the activity for which they are designed some types of footwear may fit into multiple categories for example cowboy boots are considered boots but may also be worn in more formal occasions and used as dress shoes hiking boots incorporate many of the protective features of boots but also provide the extra flexibility and comfort of many athletic shoes flip-flops are considered casual footwear but have also been worn in formal occasions such as visits to the white house
=== athletic ===
athletic shoes are specifically designed to be worn for participating in various sports since friction between the foot and the ground is an important force in most sports modern athletic shoes are designed to maximize this force and materials such as rubber are used although for some activities such as dancing or bowling sliding is desirable so shoes designed for these activities often have lower coefficients of friction the earliest athletic shoes date back to the mid 19th century were track spikes leather shoes with metal cleats on the soles to provide increased friction during running they were developed by j.w foster & sons which later become known as reebok by the end of the 19th century spalding also manufactured these shoes as well adidas started selling shoes with track spikes in them for running and soccer in 1925 spikes were eventually added to shoes for baseball and american football in the 20th century golfers also use shoes with small metal spikes on their soles to prevent slipping during their swing
the earliest rubber-soled athletic shoes date back to 1876 in the united kingdom when the new liverpool rubber company made plimsolls or sandshoes designed for the sport of croquet similar rubber-soled shoes were made in 1892 in the united states by humphrey o'sullivan based on charles goodyear's technology the united states rubber company was founded the same year and produced rubber-soled and heeled shoes under a variety of brand names which were later consolidated in 1916 under the name keds these shoes became known as sneakers because the rubber sole allowed the wearer to sneak up on another person in 1964 the founding of nike by phil knight and bill bowerman of the university of oregon introduced many new improvements common in modern running shoes such as rubber waffle soles breathable nylon uppers and cushioning in the mid-sole and heel during the 1970s the expertise of podiatrists also became important in athletic shoe design to implement new design features based on how feet reacted to specific actions such as running jumping or side-to-side movement athletic shoes for women were also designed for their specific physiological differences
shoes specific to the sport of basketball were developed by chuck taylor and are popularly known as chuck taylor all-stars these shoes first sold in 1917 are double-layer canvas shoes with rubber soles and toe caps and a high heel (known as a high top") for added support in 1969 taylor was inducted into the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame in recognition of this development and in the 1970s other shoe manufacturers such as nike adidas reebok and others began imitating this style of athletic shoe in april 1985 nike introduced its own brand of basketball shoe which would become popular in its own right the air jordan named after the then-rookie chicago bulls basketball player michael jordan the air jordan line of shoes sold $100 million in their first year
as barefoot running became popular by the late 20th and early 21st century many modern shoe manufacturers have recently designed footwear that mimic this experience maintaining optimum flexibility and natural walking while also providing some degree of protection termed as minimalist shoes their purpose is to allow one's feet and legs to feel more subtly the impacts and forces involved in running allowing finer adjustments in running style some of these shoes include the vibram fivefingers nike free and saucony's kinvara and hattori mexican huaraches are also very simple running shoes similar to the shoes worn by the tarahumara people of northern mexico who are known for their distance running abilities wrestling shoes are also very light and flexible shoes that are designed to mimic bare feet while providing additional traction and protection
many athletic shoes are designed with specific features for specific activities one of these includes roller skates which have metal or plastic wheels on the bottom specific for the sport of roller skating similarly ice skates have a metal blade attached to the bottom for locomotion across ice skate shoes have also been designed to provide a comfortable flexible and durable shoe for the sport of skateboarding climbing shoes are rubber-soled tight-fitting shoes designed to fit in the small cracks and crevices for rock climbing cycling shoes are similarly designed with rubber soles and a tight fit but also are equipped with a metal or plastic cleat to interface with clipless pedals as well as a stiff sole to maximize power transfer and support the foot
=== boot ===
a boot is a special type of shoe which covers the foot and the ankle and extends up the leg sometimes as far as the knee or even the hip most boots have a heel that is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the sole even if the two are made of one piece they are typically made of leather or rubber although they may be made from a variety of different materials boots are worn both for their functionality protecting the foot and leg from water snow mud or hazards or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities as well as for reasons of style and fashion
cowboy boots are a specific style of riding boot which combines function with fashion they became popular among cowboys in the western united states during the 19th century traditional cowboy boots have a cuban heel rounded to pointed toe high shaft and traditionally no lacing they are normally made from cowhide leather but may be made from more exotic skins such as ostrich anaconda or elephant skins
hiking boots are designed to provide extra ankle and arch support as well as extra padding for comfort during hiking they are constructed to provide comfort for miles of walking over rough terrains and protect the hiker's feet against water mud rocks and other wilderness obstacles these boots support the ankle to avoid twisting but do not restrict the ankle's movement too much they are fairly stiff to support the foot a properly fitted boot and/or friction-reducing patches applied to troublesome areas ensures protection against blisters and other discomforts associated with long hikes on rugged terrain
during wet or snowy weather snow boots are worn to keep the foot warm and dry they are typically made of rubber or other water-resistant material have multiple layers of insulation and a high heel to keep snow out boots may also be attached to snowshoes to increase the distribution of weight over a larger surface area for walking in snow ski boots are a specialized snow boot which are used in alpine or cross-country skiing and designed to provide a way to attach the skier to his/her skis using ski bindings the ski/boot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow ice skates are another specialized boot with a metal blade attached to the bottom which is used to propel the wearer across a sheet of ice inline skates are similar to ice skates but with a set of three to four wheels in lieu of the blade which are designed to mimic ice skating on solid surfaces such as wood or concrete
boots are designed to withstand heavy wear to protect the wearer and provide good traction they are generally made from sturdy leather uppers and non-leather outsoles they may be used for uniforms of the police or military as well as for protection in industrial settings such as mining and construction protective features may include steel-tipped toes and soles or ankle guards
=== dress and casual ===
dress shoes are characterized by smooth and supple leather uppers leather soles and narrow sleek figure casual shoes are characterized by sturdy leather uppers non-leather outsoles and wide profile
some designs of dress shoes can be worn by either gender the majority of dress shoes have an upper covering commonly made of leather enclosing most of the lower foot but not covering the ankles this upper part of the shoe is often made without apertures or openings but may also be made with openings or even itself consist of a series of straps e.g an open toe featured in women's shoes shoes with uppers made high to cover the ankles are also available a shoe with the upper rising above the ankle is usually considered a boot but certain styles may be referred to as high-topped shoes or high-tops usually a high-topped shoe is secured by laces or zippers although some styles have elastic inserts to ease slipping the shoe on
==== men's ====
men's shoes can be categorized by how they are closed
oxfords (also referred as balmorals") the vamp has a v-shaped slit to which the laces are attached also known as closed lacing the word oxford is sometimes used by american clothing companies to market shoes that are not balmorals such as blchers
derby shoe the laces are tied to two pieces of leather independently attached to the vamp also known as open lacing and is a step down in dressiness if the laces are not independently attached to the vamp the shoe is known as a blucher shoe this name is in american english often used about derbys
monk-straps a buckle and strap instead of lacing
slip-ons there are no lacings or fastenings the popular loafers are part of this category as well as less popular styles such as elastic-sided shoes
men's shoes can also be decorated in various ways
plain-toes have a sleek appearance and no extra decorations on the vamp
cap-toes has an extra layer of leather that caps the toe
brogues (american wing-tips) the toe of the shoe is covered with a perforated panel the wing-tip which extends down either side of the shoe brogues can be found in both balmoral and blucher styles but are considered slightly less formal
formal high-end men's shoes are manufactured by several companies around the world most notably in england france italy and america notable british brands include church's english shoes (est 1873) john lobb bootmaker (est 1849) edward green shoes (est 1890) and crockett & jones (est 1879) both john lobb and edward green offer bespoke products in between the world wars men's footwear received significant innovation and design led by cobblers and cordwainers in london's west end the most notable french product is made by j.m weston armani of italy was a major influence on men's shoe design in the 1960s1980s until they returned to the larger proportions of its forebears the welt-constructed anglo-american dress shoe originally created in edwardian england another well-known italian company is salvatore ferragamo italia s.p.a the remaining elite american companies are allen edmonds and alden shoe company alden located in new england specializes in genuine shell cordovan leather from the only remaining horse tannery in america (chicago) and is completely manufactured in america whereas allen edmonds of wisconsin is a larger company that outsources some of its production
==== women's ====
there is a large variety of shoes available for women in addition to most of the men's styles being more accepted as unisex some broad categories are
high-heeled footwear is footwear that raises the heels typically 2 inches (5 cm) or more above the toes commonly worn by women for formal occasions or social outings variants include kitten heels (typically 1-2 inches high) and stilletto heels (with a very narrow heel post) and wedge heels (with a wedge-shaped sole rather than a heel post)
mules are shoes or slippers with no fitting around the heel (i.e they are backless)
slingbacks are shoes which are secured by a strap behind the heel rather than over the top of the foot
ballet flats known in the uk as ballerinas ballet pumps or skimmers are shoes with a very low heel and a relatively short vamp exposing much of the instep they are popular for warm-weather wear and may be seen as more comfortable than shoes with a higher heel
court shoes known in the united states as pumps are typically high-heeled slip-on dress shoes
=== unisex ===
clog
platform shoe shoe with very thick soles and heels
sandals open shoes consisting of a sole and various straps leaving much of the foot exposed to air they are thus popular for warm-weather wear because they let the foot be cooler than a closed-toed shoe would
saddle shoe leather shoe with a contrasting saddle-shaped band over the instep typically white uppers with black saddle
slip-on shoe a dress or casual shoe without shoelaces or fasteners often with tassels buckles or coin-holders (penny loafers)
boat shoes also known as deck shoes similar to a loafer but more casual laces are usually simple leather with no frills typically made of leather and featuring a soft white sole to avoid marring or scratching a boat deck the first boat shoe was invented in 1935 by paul a sperry
slippers for indoor use commonly worn with pajamas
=== dance ===
a wide variety of footwear is used by dancers the choice of dance shoe type depends on the style of dance that is to be performed and in many cases the characteristics of the surface that will be danced on
pointe shoes are designed for ballet dancing these have a toe box that is stiffened with glue and a hardened sole so the dancer can stand on the tips of their toes they are secured by elastic straps and ribbons that are tied to the dancer's ankles
ballet shoes are soft pliable shoes made of canvas or leather with either continuous or two-part sole (also called split-sole) used for ballet dancing the sole is typically made of leather with thicker material under the ball and heel of the foot and thinner and thus more flexible material under the arch so that the foot can be easily pointed they are typically secured by elastics across the top of the foot
ghillies are soft shoes that are used in irish dance scottish country dance and highland dance
jazz shoes typically have a two-part rubberized sole (also called split-sole) to provide both flexibility and traction and a short heel they are secured to the foot by laces or elastic inserts
tango and flamenco shoes are used for tango or flamenco dancing
ballroom shoes fall into two categories ballroom and latin american both are characterised by suede soles men's ballroom shoes are typically lace-ups with one-inch heels and patent leather uppers ladies ballroom shoes are typically court shoes with two-inch heels made of fabric that can be colored to match the dancer's dress in contrast to the low ballroom heel which evenly distributes weight across the foot latin american shoes have higher heels designed to shift weight onto the toes latin shoes are also more flexible than ballroom shoes men's latin shoes typically have 1.5- to 2-inch high shaped heels while ladies latin shoes have 2,5-inch to 3-inch heels ladies shoes are typically open-toed and strapped
dance sneakers are lightweight sneakers with reinforced rubber toes that allows dancers to briefly stand on their toes these are known by various trademarked names such as dansneakers
foot thongs are slip-on partial foot covers that cover the ball of the dancer's foot so as to reduce friction while executing turns thus making it easier to perform turns and also protecting the foot from skin abrasions from a distance flesh colored foot thongs give a dancer the appearance of having bare feet they are known by various names depending on the manufacturer including dance paws foot undies and foot paws
tap shoes have metal plates mounted to the bottoms of the toe and heel the metal plates which are known as taps make a loud sound when struck against a hard performance surface tap shoes which are used in tap dancing may be made from any style of shoe to which taps can be attached
character shoes are leather shoes with one- to three-inch heels usually with one or more straps across the instep to secure it to the foot they may be soft-soled (suede) or hard-soled they may be converted to tap shoes by attaching taps
=== orthopedic ===
orthopedic shoes are specially-designed footwear to relieve discomfort associated with many foot and ankle disorders such as blisters bunions calluses and corns hammer toes plantar fasciitis or heel spurs they may also be worn by individuals with diabetes or people with unequal leg length these shoes typically have a low heel tend to be wide with a particularly wide toe box and have a firm heel to provide extra support some may also have a removable insole or orthotic to provide extra arch support
=== non-human ===
while most shoes have historically been worn by humans there are simple shoes that are designed to be worn by domesticated animals such as dogs and horses a horseshoe is a man-made product normally made of metal or other modern synthetic materials designed to protect a horse's hoof from wear and tear horseshoes are attached on the palmar surface of the hooves usually nailed through the insensitive hoof wall that is anatomically akin to the human toenail though much larger and thicker they may also be glued
