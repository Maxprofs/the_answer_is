classificationedit
stis commonly known venereal diseases word venereal derived latin word venereus meaning relating sexual intercourse desire ultimately derived venus roman goddess love social disease phrase used euphemism
world health organization recommended sexually transmitted infection preferred term since sexually transmitted infection broader term sexually transmitted disease infection colonization parasitic species may cause adverse effects disease infection leads impaired abnormal function either case condition may exhibit signs symptoms increased understanding infections like hpv infects significant portion sexually active individuals cause disease led increased use term sti public health officials originally introduced term sexually transmitted infection clinicians increasingly using alongside term sexually transmitted disease order distinguish former
std may refer infections causing diseases may used loosely synonym sti time people know infected sti tested start showing symptoms disease moreover term sexually transmissible disease sometimes used since less restrictive consideration factors means transmission instance meningitis transmissible means sexual contact labeled sti sexual contact primary vector pathogens cause meningitis discrepancy addressed probability infection means sexual contact general sti infection negligible probability transmission means sexual contact realistic means transmission sexual contact sophisticated meansblood transfusion sharing hypodermic needlesare taken account thus one may presume person infected sti eg chlamydia gonorrhea genital herpes hpv transmitted himher means sexual contact

sexually transmitted infections include
chlamydia sexually transmitted infection caused bacterium chlamydia trachomatis women symptoms may include abnormal vaginal discharge burning urination bleeding periods although women experience symptoms symptoms men include pain urinating abnormal discharge penis left untreated men women chlamydia infect urinary tract potentially lead pelvic inflammatory disease pid pid cause serious problems pregnancy even potential cause infertility cause woman potentially deadly ectopic pregnancy child born outside uterus however chlamydia cured antibiotics
two common forms herpes caused infection herpes simplex virus hsv hsv typically acquired orally causes cold sores hsv usually acquired sexual contact affects genitals however either strain may affect either site people asymptomatic mild symptoms experience symptoms usually notice days exposure last weeks symptoms include small fluidfilled blisters headaches backaches itching tingling sensations genital anal area pain urination flu like symptoms swollen glands fever herpes spread skin contact person infected virus virus affects areas entered body occur kissing vaginal intercourse oral sex anal sex virus infectious times visible symptoms however asymptomatic still spread virus skin contact primary attack severe body antibodies built primary attack one might recurring attacks milder might even future attacks cure disease antiviral medications treat symptoms lower risk transmission valtrex although hsv typically oral version virus hsv typically genital version virus person hsv orally transmit virus partner genitally virus either type settle nerve bundle either top spine producing oral outbreak second nerve bundle base spine producing genital outbreak
human papillomavirus hpv common sti united states different strands hpv many cause health problems cases bodys immune system clears infection naturally within years cases may cleared lead genital warts bumps around genitals small large raised flat shaped like cauliflower cervical cancer hpv related cancers symptoms might show advanced stages important women get pap smears order check treat cancers also two vaccines available women cervarix gardasil protect types hpv cause cervical cancer hpv passed genitaltogenital contact well oral sex important remember infected partner might symptoms
gonorrhea caused bacterium lives moist mucous membranes urethra vagina rectum mouth throat eyes infection spread contact penis vagina mouth anus symptoms gonorrhea usually appear days contact infected partner however men might notice symptoms month symptoms men include burning pain urinating increased urinary frequency discharge penis white green yellow color red swollen urethra swollen tender testicles sore throat symptoms women may include vaginal discharge burning itching urinating painful sexual intercourse severe pain lower abdomen infection spreads fallopian tubes fever infection spreads fallopian tubes however many women show symptoms antibiotic resistant strains gonorrhea cases cured antibiotics
syphilis sti caused bacterium untreated lead complications death clinical manifestations syphilis include ulceration urogenital tract mouth rectum left untreated symptoms worsen recent years prevalence syphilis declined western europe increased eastern europe former soviet states high incidence syphilis found places cameroon cambodia papua new guinea syphilis infections increasing united states
trichomoniasis common sti caused infection protozoan parasite called trichomonas vaginalis trichomoniasis affects women men symptoms common women patients treated antibiotic called metronidazole effective
hiv human immunodeficiency virus damages bodys immune system interferes ability fight diseasecausing agents virus kills cd cells white blood cells help fight various infections hiv carried body fluids spread sexual activity also spread contact infected blood breast feeding childbirth mother child pregnancy hiv advanced stage individual said aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome different stages progression hiv infection stages include primary infection asymptomatic infection symptomatic infection aids primary infection stage individual flu like symptoms headache fatigue fever muscle aches weeks asymptomatic stage symptoms usually disappear patient remain asymptomatic years hiv progresses symptomatic stage immune system weakened low cell count cd cells hiv infection becomes lifethreatening called aids people aids fall prey opportunistic infections die result disease first discovered aids likely live longer years antiretroviral drugs arvs available treat hiv infections known cure hiv aids drugs help suppress virus suppressing amount virus body people lead longer healthier lives even though virus levels may low still spread virus others

pathophysiologyedit
many stis easily transmitted mucous membranes penis vulva rectum urinary tract less oftendepending type infection mouth throat respiratory tract eyes visible membrane covering head penis mucous membrane though produces mucus similar lips mouth mucous membranes differ skin allow certain pathogens body amount contact infective sources causes infection varies pathogen cases disease may result even light contact fluid carriers like venereal fluids onto mucous membrane
one reason probability transmitting many infections far higher sex casual means transmission nonsexual contacttouching hugging shaking handsbut reason although mucous membranes exist mouth genitals many stis seem easier transmit oral sex deep kissing according safe sex chart many infections easily transmitted mouth genitals genitals mouth much harder transmit one mouth another hiv genital fluids happen contain much pathogen saliva infections labeled stis transmitted direct skin contact herpes simplex hpv examples kshv hand may transmitted deepkissing also saliva used sexual lubricant
depending sti person may still able spread infection signs disease present example person much likely spread herpes infection blisters present absent however person spread hiv infection time even heshe developed symptoms aids
sexual behaviors involve contact bodily fluids another person considered contain risk transmission sexually transmitted diseases attention focused controlling hiv causes aids sti presents different situation
may noted name sexually transmitted diseases transmitted one person another certain sexual activities rather actually caused sexual activities bacteria fungi protozoa viruses still causative agents possible catch sexually transmitted disease sexual activity person carrying disease conversely person sti got contact sexual otherwise someone hisher bodily fluids stis hiv transmitted mother child either pregnancy breastfeeding
although likelihood transmitting various diseases various sexual activities varies great deal general sexual activities two people considered twoway route transmission stis ie giving receiving risky although receiving carries higher risk
healthcare professionals suggest safer sex use condoms reliable way decreasing risk contracting sexually transmitted diseases sexual activity safer sex means considered absolute safeguard transfer exposure bodily fluids blood transfusions blood products sharing injection needles needlestick injuries medical staff inadvertently jabbed pricked needles medical procedures sharing tattoo needles childbirth avenues transmission different means put certain groups medical workers haemophiliacs drug users particularly risk
recent epidemiological studies investigated networks defined sexual relationships individuals discovered properties sexual networks crucial spread sexually transmitted diseases particular assortative mixing people large numbers sexual partners seems important factor
possible asymptomatic carrier sexually transmitted diseases particular sexually transmitted diseases women often cause serious condition pelvic inflammatory disease
preventionedit
prevention key addressing incurable stis hiv herpes sexual health clinics promote use condoms provide outreach atrisk communities
effective way prevent sexual transmission stis avoid contact body parts fluids lead transfer infected partner sexual activities involve contact cybersex phonesex masturbation distance methods avoiding contact proper use condoms reduces contact risk although condom effective limiting exposure disease transmission may occur even condom
partners get tested stis initiating sexual contact resuming contact partner engaged contact someone else many infections detectable immediately exposure enough time must allowed possible exposures testing tests accurate certain stis particularly certain persistent viruses like hpv may impossible detect current medical procedures
many diseases establish permanent infections occupy immune system diseases become easily transmitted innate immune system led defensins hiv prevent transmission hiv viral counts low busy viruses overwhelmed hiv establish certain viral stis also greatly increase risk death hiv infected patients
strategies increase testing hiv stis proved successful treatment facilities utilize inhome test kits person return test followup facilities strongly encourage previously infected return ensure infection eliminated novel strategies foster retesting use text messaging email reminders types reminders used addition phone calls letters
vaccinesedit
vaccines available protect viral stis hepatitis hepatitis b types hpv vaccination initiation sexual contact advised assure maximal protection
condomsedit
condoms female condoms provide protection used properly barrier area covers uncovered areas still susceptible many stis
case hiv sexual transmission routes almost always involve penis hiv cannot spread unbroken skin therefore properly shielding penis properly worn condom vagina anus effectively stops hiv transmission infected fluid broken skin borne direct transmission hiv would considered sexually transmitted still theoretically occur sexual contact avoided simply engaging sexual contact presenting open bleeding wounds
stis even viral infections prevented use latex polyurethane polyisoprene condoms barrier microorganisms viruses small enough pass pores natural skin condoms still large pass latex synthetic condoms
proper male condom usage entails
putting condom tight end leaving cm inch room tip ejaculation putting condom snug often lead failure
wearing condom loose defeat barrier
avoiding inverting spilling condom worn whether ejaculate
user attempts unroll condom realizes wrong side condom discarded
careful condom handling long nails
avoiding use oilbased lubricants anything oil latex condoms oil eat holes
using flavored condoms oral sex sugar flavoring lead yeast infections used penetrate
order best protect oneself partner stis old condom contents assumed infectious therefore old condom must properly disposed new condom used act intercourse multiple usage increases chance breakage defeating effectiveness barrier
nonoxynoledit
researchers hoped nonoxynol vaginal microbicide would help decrease sti risk trials however found ineffective may put women higher risk hiv infection
screeningedit
sexually active women age risk screened chlamydia gonorrhea yearly treated gonorrhea people re tested disease three months
nucleic acid amplification tests recommended method diagnosis gonorrhea chlamydia done either urine men women vaginal cervical swabs women urethral swabs men
diagnosisedit
testing may single infection consist number tests range stis including tests syphilis trichomonas gonorrhea chlamydia herpes hepatitis hiv procedure tests infectious agents
sti tests may used number reasons
diagnostic test determine cause symptoms illness
screening test detect asymptomatic presymptomatic infections
check prospective sexual partners free disease engage sex without safer sex precautions example starting long term mutually monogamous sexual relationship fluid bonding procreation
check prior pregnancy prevent harm baby
check birth check baby caught sti mother
prevent use infected donated blood organs
part process contact tracing known infected individual
part mass epidemiological surveillance
early identification treatment results less chance spread disease conditions may improve outcomes treatment often window period initial infection sti test negative period infection may transmissible duration period varies depending infection test diagnosis may also delayed reluctance infected person seek medical professional one report indicated people turn internet rather medical professional information stis higher degree sexual problems
managementedit
highrisk exposure occurs rape cases may treated preventatively using antibiotic combinations azithromycin cefixime metronidazole
option treating partners patients index cases diagnosed chlamydia gonorrhea patientdelivered partner therapy clinical practice treating sex partners index cases providing prescriptions medications patient take hisher partner without health care provider first examining partner
