isomer asmr greek isomers isos equal mros part molecule chemical formula another molecule different chemical structure isomers contain number atoms element different arrangements atoms isomers necessarily share similar properties unless also functional groups many different classes isomers like positional isomers cistrans isomers enantiomers etc see chart two main forms isomerism structural isomerism stereoisomerism spatial isomerism
structural isomers
structural isomers sometimes referred constitutional isomers atoms functional groups joined together different ways structural isomers different iupac names may may belong functional group group includes chain isomerism whereby hydrocarbon chains variable amounts branching position isomerism deals position functional group chain functional group isomerism one functional group split different ones
example two position isomers would fluoropropane fluoropropane illustrated left side diagram
skeletal isomers main carbon chain different two isomers type isomerism identifiable secondary tertiary alcohol isomers
tautomers structural isomers chemical substance spontaneously interconvert even pure different chemical properties consequence distinct reactions characteristic form observed interconversion reaction fast enough tautomers cannot isolated example differ position proton ketoenol tautomerism proton alternately carbon oxygen
example propanols methoxyethane
simple example isomerism given propanol formula cho choh occurs two isomers propanol npropyl alcohol propanol isopropyl alcohol ii
note position oxygen atom differs two attached end carbon first isomer center carbon second
however another isomer cho significantly different properties methoxyethane methylethylether iii unlike isomers propanol methoxyethane oxygen connected two carbons rather one carbon one hydrogen makes ether alcohol lacks hydroxyl group chemical properties similar ethers either alcohol isomers
example allene propyne
allene propyne examples isomers containing different bond types allene contains two double bonds whereas propyne contains one triple bond
stereoisomers
stereoisomers bond structure geometrical positioning atoms functional groups space differs class includes enantiomers nonsuperimposable mirrorimages diastereomers enantiomers always contain chiral centres diastereomers often diastereomers neither chiral contain chiral centers another type isomer conformational isomers conformers may rotamers diastereomers enantiomers depending exact compound example ortho positionlocked biphenyl systems enantiomers
ez isomers restricted rotation within molecule specific isomers containing double bond configurational isomers classified diastereomers whether contain chiral centres ez notation depicts absolute stereochemistry unambiguous descriptor based cip priorities
cistrans isomers used describe molecules restricted rotation molecule molecules cc double bonds descriptors describe relative stereochemistry based group bulkiness principal carbon chain ambiguous especially problematic double bonds two substituents obsolete term cistrans isomerism geometric isomerism alkenes two substituents ez notation used instead cis trans possible e z written italic type also preferred compounds two substituents
cis trans isomers also occur inorganic coordination compounds square planar mxy complexes octahedral mxy complexes related type geometric isomerism facialmeridional facmer isomerism octahedral mxy complexes set three identical ligands either occupies one face octahedron situated one meridian octahedron
note although conformers referred stereoisomers stable isomers since bonds conformers easily rotate thus converting one conformer another either diastereomeric enantiomeric original one
structural isomers typically different chemical properties stereoisomers behave identically chemical reactions except reaction stereoisomers enzymes however distinguish different enantiomers compound organisms often prefer one isomer stereoisomers also differ way rotate polarized light
isomerization
isomerization process one molecule transformed another molecule exactly atoms atoms rearranged molecules conditions isomerization occurs spontaneously many isomers equal roughly equal bond energy exist roughly equal amounts provided interconvert relatively freely energy barrier two isomers high isomerization occurs intramolecularly considered rearrangement reaction
example organometallic isomerization production decaphenylferrocene cphfe linkage isomer
synthesis fumaric acid
industrial synthesis fumaric acid proceeds via cistrans isomerization maleic acid
medicinal chemistry
examples isomers different medical properties easily found example placement methyl groups substituted xanthines theobromine found chocolate vasodilator effects common caffeine one two methyl groups moved different position tworing core isomer theophylline variety effects including bronchodilation antiinflammatory action another example occurs phenethylaminebased stimulant drugs phentermine nonchiral compound weaker effect amphetamine used appetitereducing medication mild stimulant properties however different atomic arrangement gives dextromethamphetamine stronger stimulant amphetamine
medicinal chemistry biochemistry enantiomers special concern may possess quite different biological activity many preparative procedures afford mixture equal amounts enantiomeric forms cases enantiomers separated chromatography using chiral stationary phases may also separated formation diastereomeric salts cases enantioselective synthesis developed
