plane mirror mirror flat planar reflective surface light rays striking plane mirror angle reflection equals angle incidence angle incidence angle incident ray surface normal imaginary line perpendicular surface therefore angle reflection angle reflected ray normal collimated beam light spread reflection plane mirror except diffraction effectsthe normal always perpendicular plane mirror
plane mirror makes image objects front images appear behind plane mirror lies straight line drawn part object corresponding part image makes right angle bisected surface plane mirror image formed plane mirror always virtual meaning light rays actually come image upright shape size object reflecting virtual image copy object formed location light rays appear come however image laterallyinverted mirror image object person reflected plane mirror image right hand appears left hand image
plane mirrors type mirror real object always produces image virtual erect size object virtual objects produce real images however focal length plane mirror infinity optical power zero
preparation
made using highly reflecting polished surface silver aluminum surface process called silvering silvering thin layer red lead oxide applied back mirror reflecting surface reflects light striking long surface remains uncontaminated tarnishing oxidation modern plane mirrors arte designed thin piece plate glass protects strengthens mirror surface helps prevent tarnishing historically mirrors simply flat pieces polished copper obsidian brass precious metal mirrors made liquid also exist elements gallium mercury highly reflective liquid state
relation curved mirrors
mathematically plane mirror considered limit either concave convex spherical curved mirror radius therefore focal length becomes infinite
