methods extraction
economical method coal extraction coal seams depends depth quality seams geology environmental factors coal mining processes differentiated whether operate surface underground many coals extracted surface underground mines require washing coal preparation plant technical economic feasibility evaluated based following regional geological conditions overburden characteristics coal seam continuity thickness structure quality depth strength materials seam roof floor conditions topography especially altitude slope climate land ownership affects availability land mining access surface drainage patterns ground water conditions availability labor materials coal purchaser requirements terms tonnage quality destination capital investment requirements
surface mining deep underground mining two basic methods mining choice mining method depends primarily depth burial density overburden thickness coal seam seams relatively close surface depths less approximately ft m usually surface mined
coal occurs depths ft m usually deep mined cases surface mining techniques used example western us coal occur depths excess ft m mined open pit methods due thickness seam feet m coals occurring ft m usually deep mined however open pit mining operations working coal seams feet m ground level instance tagebau hambach germany
modern surface mining
coal seams near surface may economical extract coal using open cut also referred open cast open pit strip mining methods open cast coal mining recovers greater proportion coal deposit underground methods coal seams strata may exploited large open cast mines cover area many square kilometers use large pieces equipment equipment include following draglines operate removing overburden power shovels large trucks transport overburden coal bucket wheel excavators conveyors mining method explosives first used order break surface overburden mining area overburden removed draglines shovel truck coal seam exposed drilled fractured thoroughly mined strips coal loaded large trucks conveyors transport either coal preparation plant directly used
open cast mines united states extract bituminous coal canada bc australia south africa open cast mining used thermal metallurgical coals new south wales open casting steam coal anthracite practised surface mining accounts around percent production australia us used percent production globally percent coal production involves surface mining
strip mining
strip mining exposes coal removing earth coal seam earth referred overburden removed long strips overburden first strip deposited area outside planned mining area referred outofpit dumping overburden subsequent strips deposited void left mining coal overburden previous strip referred inpit dumping
often necessary fragment overburden use explosives accomplished drilling holes overburden filling holes explosives detonating explosive overburden removed using large earthmoving equipment draglines shovel trucks excavator trucks bucketwheels conveyors overburden put previously mined empty strip overburden removed underlying coal seam exposed block coal block coal may drilled blasted hard otherwise loaded onto trucks conveyors transport coal preparation wash plant strip empty coal process repeated new strip created next method suitable areas flat terrain
equipment used depends geological conditions example remove overburden loose unconsolidated bucket wheel excavator might productive life area mines may years
contour mining
contour mining method consists removing overburden seam pattern following contours along ridge around hillside method commonly used areas rolling steep terrain common deposit spoil downslope side bench thus created method spoil disposal consumed much additional land created severe landslide erosion problems alleviate problems variety methods devised use freshly cut overburden refill minedout areas haulback lateral movement methods generally consist initial cut spoil deposited downslope site spoil second cut refilling first ridge undisturbed natural material ft m wide often intentionally left outer edge mined area barrier adds stability reclaimed slope preventing spoil slumping sliding downhill
limitations contour strip mining economic technical operation reaches predetermined stripping ratio tons overburdentons coal profitable continue depending equipment available may technically feasible exceed certain height highwall point possible produce coal augering method spiral drills bore tunnels highwall laterally bench extract coal without removing overburden
mountaintop removal mining
mountaintop coal mining surface mining practice involving removal mountaintops expose coal seams disposing associated mining overburden adjacent valley fills valley fills occur steep terrain limited disposal alternatives
mountaintop removal combines area contour strip mining methods areas rolling steep terrain coal seam occurring near top ridge hill entire top removed series parallel cuts overburden deposited nearby valleys hollows method usually leaves ridge hill tops flattened plateaus process highly controversial drastic changes topography practice creating headofhollowfills filling valleys mining debris covering streams disrupting ecosystems
spoil placed head narrow steepsided valley hollow preparation filling area vegetation soil removed rock drain constructed middle area filled natural drainage course previously existed fill completed underdrain form continuous water runoff system upper end valley lower end fill typical headofhollow fills graded terraced create permanently stable slopes
underground mining
coal seams deep underground opencast mining require underground mining method currently accounts percent world coal production deep mining room pillar bord pillar method progresses along seam pillars timber left standing support mine roof room pillar mines developed stopping point limited geology ventilation economics supplementary version room pillar mining termed second mining retreat mining commonly started miners remove coal pillars thereby recovering much coal coal seam possible work area involved pillar extraction called pillar section
modern pillar sections use remotecontrolled equipment including large hydraulic mobile roofsupports prevent caveins miners equipment left work area mobile roof supports similar large diningroom table hydraulic jacks legs large pillars coal mined away mobile roof supports legs shorten withdrawn safe area mine roof typically collapses mobile roof supports leave area
six principal methods underground mining
