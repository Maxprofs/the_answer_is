mass-analyzed ion-kinetic-energy spectrometry (mikes) is a mass spectrometry technique by which mass spectra are obtained from a sector instrument that incorporates at least one magnetic sector plus one electric sector in reverse geometry (the beam first enters the magnetic sector) the accelerating voltage v and the magnetic field b are set to select the precursor ions of a particular m/z the precursor ions then dissociate or react in an electric field-free region between the two sectors the ratio of the kinetic energy to charge of the product ions are analyzed by scanning the electric sector field e the width of the product ion spectrum peaks is related to the kinetic energy release distribution for the dissociation process
