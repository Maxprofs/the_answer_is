the poodle is a group of formal dog breeds the standard poodle miniature poodle and toy poodle (one registry organisation also recognizes a medium poodle variety between standard and miniature) with many coat colors originally bred in germany as a type of water dog the breed was standardized in france the poodle is skillful in many dog sports including agility obedience tracking and even herding poodles have taken top honors in many conformation shows including best in show at the westminster kennel club dog show in 1991 and 2002 and at the world dog show in 2007 and 2010
toy poodles won best in show at crufts in 1966 and 1982 standard poodles achieved the award in 1955 1985 2002 and 2014 the 2002 winner came from norway and was the first overseas exhibit to win the crufts best in show award
== historyedit ==
the poodle is believed to have originated in germany where it was known as the pudelhund pudel (cognate with the english word puddle") is derived from the low german verb meaning to splash about and the word hund in german means dog (cognate with hound") the breed was standardized in france where it was commonly used as a water retriever due to the breed's popularity in france it became established as its national breed
the european mainland had known the poodle long before it was brought to england drawings by german artist albrecht drer established the popular image of the breed in the 15th and 16th centuries it was the principal pet dog of the late 18th century in spain as shown by the paintings of the spanish artist francisco goya france had toy poodles as pampered favorites during the reign of louis xvi at about the same period
the poodle has been bred in at least three sizes including standard miniature and toy according to the american kennel club the standard poodle is the oldest of the three varieties and was later bred down to the miniature and toy sizes despite the standard poodle's claim to greater age than the other varieties some evidence shows the smaller types developed only a short time after the breed assumed the general type by which it is recognized today the smallest or toy variety was developed in england in the 18th century
=== standard poodleedit ===
traditionally the standard poodle the largest of the subtypes was a retriever or gun dog used in particular for duck hunting and sometimes upland bird hunting the breed has been used for fowl hunting in usa and canada since the early 1990s in and out of hunting tests the modern standard retains many of the traits prized by their original owners a keen working intelligence that makes the dog easy to command webbed feet that make it an agile swimmer (all of the poodle's ancestors and descendants had or share the love of water) athletic stamina and a moisture-resistant curly coat that acts like a wool jumper in damp conditions towards the second half of the nineteenth century their use in hunting declined in favour of their use in circuses and status symbols of the wealthy so that by the 20th century they were only found as companions or circus dogs however in the past 20 years some breeders in the united states and canada have been selecting for dogs with drive for birds in order to revive the breed for hunting with some success the canadian kennel club admitted the standard poodle for hunting trials in 1996 and the american kennel club in 1998 respectively as of july 2014 the end results of 20 years of breeding to reawaken the hunting instinct have been dogs that are very eager to please their masters it has resulted in a gun dog with extreme intelligence that requires special training their aptitude is second only to the british border collie and thus the hunting standard poodle requires the gunman to be quite specific as to what he wants and how he wants it done unlike other spaniels and retrievers standard poodles will attempt to solve a problem independently and need to be told specifically what is wanted when tracking and retrieving a bird hunting poodles typically are dogs with lightning quick reflexes sprinting hard on command after the downed bird and having a prodigious ability to remember where the bird fell and (though not as good as the english pointer) a decent nose to sniff and track a bird hiding in tall grass
standard poodles have been winning titles against the more widely used native breeds like the chesapeake bay retriever nova scotia duck tolling retriever american water spaniel and labrador retriever thus far 13 standard poodles have won master hunt titles (12 in the united states 1 in canada) and several more have won senior and junior titles on both sides of the border currently only the united kennel club in the us recognizes the standard poodle as a sporting dog thus in spite of this subtype of poodle being ineligible for field competitions more and more are appearing in the field as waterfowl dogs and hunters of pheasant the latter especially in the midwest
=== miniature poodleedit ===
members of the second variety the miniature poodle had ancestors that were originally never said to go anywhere near the water truffle hunting was widely practiced in england and later in spain france and germany where the edible fungus has always been considered a delicacy for scenting and digging up the fungus the smaller dogs were favoured since they did less damage to the truffles with their feet than the larger kinds so it is rumored that a terrier was crossed with the poodle to produce the ideal truffle hunter an 1837 account describes the narrator meeting up with a frenchman upon a truffle hunt with a pig with the frenchman lamenting that he did it for want of a poodle and earlier pages describe exactly how the dog was trained from the age of four months old to fetch and dig for truffles and carefully carry them back to his master often the prey drive of his larger cousin was left out of the breeding otherwise the miniature and toy varieties remained largely the lap dogs of middle and upperclass ladies especially in france and the uk the trade in dyeing and affixing their fur to unusual proportions began with the need to compliment the victorian and georgian sensibilities of these women to the point that their status as a dog of the middle and upper classes was quite solid by the time of the founding of the kennel club in the 1870s as they were one of the first dog breeds registered
=== world war ii working dogsedit ===
poodles have been used as working dogs in the military since at least the 17th century during wwii roland kilbon of the new york sun reported that other countries had used dogs in their armies for many years in his column he quoted mrs milton s (arlene) erlanger owner of pillicoc kennels a premier breeder of poodles the dog must play a game in this thing. eventually with the blessing of the american kennel club the professional handlers association obedience training clubs across the country and seeing eye inc. a nationwide program known as dogs for defense inc was initiated and became the official procurement agency for all war dogs used in the army navy and coast guard. dogs for defense procured the dogs who were then trained by the army in 1942 the poodle was one of 32 breeds officially classified as war dogs by the army
== descriptionedit ==
=== appearanceedit ===
the poodle is an active intelligent and elegant dog squarely built and well proportioned to ensure the desirable squarely built appearance the length of body measured from the breastbone to the point of the rump approximates the height from the highest point of the shoulders to the ground the eyes should be very dark oval in shape and have an alert and intelligent expression the ears should fold over close to the head set at or slightly below eye level the coat should be of naturally curly texture dense throughout although most akc-registered show dogs have a lion-cut or other similarly shaven look the sizes of the official akc-recognized poodle breeds are determined by height not by weight
==== poodle sizesedit ====
poodles are bred in a variety of sizes distinguished by adult shoulder (withers) height the exact height cutoffs among the varieties vary slightly from country to country the fdration cynologique internationale (fci) recognizes four sizes of one breed standard medium miniature and toy non-fci kennel clubs generally recognize three sizes standard miniature and toy sometimes as sizes of the same breed and sometimes as separate breeds only the fci describes a maximum size for standard poodles france is the country responsible for the breed in the fci and in this country the puppies of all sizes are listed together the terms royal standard teacup and tiny teacup are marketing names and are not recognized by any major kennel club
all the fdration cynologique internationale poodles are in group 9 companion and toy section 2 poodle all the kennel club poodles are in the utility group all three sizes of poodles for the australian national kennel council and the new zealand kennel club are in the non-sporting group the canadian kennel club and the american kennel club place standard and miniature sizes in the non-sporting group and the toy size in the toy group the united kennel club places the miniature and toy in the companion group and the standard poodle in the gundog group
==== coatedit ====
unlike most dogs which have double coats poodles have a single layer coat (no undercoat is present) composed of dense curly fur that sheds minimally they could be considered hypoallergenic (though not completely allergen free) the poodle does shed but instead of the fur coming off the dog it becomes tangled in the surrounding hair this can lead to matting without proper care texture ranges from coarse and woolly to soft and wavy poodle show clips require many hours of brushing and care per week about 10 hours/week for a standard poodle poodles are usually clipped down into lower-maintenance cuts as soon as their show careers are over pet clips are much less elaborate than show and require much less maintenance a pet owner can anticipate grooming a poodle every six to eight weeks although professional grooming is often costly poodles are easy to groom at home with the proper equipment
===== corded coatedit =====
in most cases whether a poodle is in a pet or show clip the hair is completely brushed out poodle hair can also be corded with rope-like mats similar to those of a komondor or human dreadlocks though once as common as the curly poodle corded poodles are now rare corded coats are difficult to keep clean and take a long time to dry after washing any poodle with a normal coat can be corded when its adult coat is in corded poodles may be shown in all major kennel club shows
==== different show clipsedit ====
generally the owners clip their dogs as they want however if they want their dogs in conformation shows a show clip is a requirement many breed registries allow only certain clips for poodles shown in conformation in american kennel club (akc) shows adults must be shown in the continental or english saddle clips dogs under 12 months old may be shown with a puppy clip the akc allows the sporting clip in stud dog and brood bitch classes as well
some sources believe the show clips evolved from working clips which originally provided warmth to major joints when the dogs were immersed in cold water the rest of the body is shaved for less drag in the water others express skepticism at this theory instead citing the french circus as the origin of the entertaining and unique clips
===== second puppyedit =====
the second puppy clip is also called the scandinavian clip or puppy clip it was invented by swedish and norwegian show groomers in the 1970s it is the most common one in all sizes for shows in europe and is allowed for adult poodles to be shown in the fci countries the face throat belly feet and the base of the tail are shaved five to seven days before the show to get a nice smooth appearance of the shaved areas the hair on the head is left to form a topknot fixed in place using latex bands because in most european countries hair spray is banned the rest of the dog is shaped with scissors
===== continental clipedit =====
in the continental clip the face throat feet and part of the tail are shaved the upper half of the front legs is shaved leaving fluffy pompons around the ankles the hindquarters are shaved except for pompons on the lower leg (from the hock to the base of the foot) and optional round areas (sometimes called rosettes") over the hips the continental clip is the most popular show clip today
===== english saddle clipedit =====
the english saddle clip is similar to the continental except for the hindquarters which are not shaved except for a small curved area on each flank (just behind the body) the feet and bands just below the stifle (knee) and above the hock leaving four (4) pompons this clip is now rarely seen in standard poodles
==== pet clipsedit ====
pet clips can be as simple or as elaborate as owners wish the hair under the tail should always be kept short to keep feces from matting in the dog's curls most owners also keep the feet and face clipped short to prevent dirt from matting between toes tear stains on lighter-coated poodles and food from matting around the dog's muzzle beyond these sanitary requirements desired clips depend on owners preferences some owners maintain a longer clip in winter than summer the coat is groomed often with a wire slicker brush to remove tangles and prevent matting
==== huntingedit ====
in the past 20 years in north america as has been intimated earlier in this article standard poodles have begun to be put back to their original purpose as duck and game bird hunters the more commonly acceptable clips seen in the show ring and the local groomer's have proven extremely impractical in action in the us and canada most hunters are male lower to upper middle class and strongly dislike being seen with a dog that has had an effete reputation dyeing a white standard poodle's hair flamboyant colours and putting bows in their hair has been a habit since the days well-to-do french ladies got their hands on them and circus acts made huge profits on them but is unnecessary in the field for hiding in blinds
the clips otherwise do not guard against the pitfalls of chasing after ducks geese turkey and pheasant continental clips for example shave the rump of the dog too close to the skin to provide enough warmth in water below 10 c in a quebec or new england winter and the fancier cuts that require the hair to be blown straight can easily get the dog stuck in bramble like a fly in a spiderweb the lion cut popular in the uk is a disaster an exposed flank makes the dog an easy mark for mosquitoes black flies and cuts and because poodles have lost much bodyfat over the past 150 years exposed skin in cold weather can make them very sick conditions are often muddy often snowy and often rugged-the water can get very icy either can cause longer hair to become a matted mess or cause ice and slush to become impacted into the fur not to mention the upkeep of repairing the damage at the groomer's shop becomes prohibitively expensive and time consuming
most hunters have their dogs sport a low maintenance modification of the puppy sporting or continental clip the cut typically shears the dog all over evenly a quarter inch to an inch and a half off the skin depending on the time of year and usually leaves the face shaven so the dog can see well some hair on the ankles and on top of the head may be left longer for warmth in the water and all that is required thereafter is a scrubbing in warm water with a mild soap after a day on the hunt and a little patience to remove the burrs the dog's hair collects in the bushes an insulated orange jacket in cold weather is preferred and recommended as the very bright colour makes the dog easily seen from a distance and the insulation compensates for colder temperatures inspecting the dog for fleas and ticks is paramount and a shampoo that washes them out and kills them is highly recommended
different clips
==== coloursedit ====
the poodle has a wide variety of coloring including white black brown parti silver gray silver beige apricot red cream sable and patterns such as phantom and brindle the ack recognises poodles in either solid-colored or parti-colored coats recognition of particolor (spotted) poodles varies by registry phantom brindle and sable are considered out of standard by all major registries recognised fci colourations are black white brown gray apricot and red
for solid-colored poodles the coat is an even and solid color at the skin in blues grays silvers browns cafe-au-laits apricots and creams the coat may show varying shades of the same color this is frequently present in the somewhat darker feathering of the ears and in the tipping of the ruff while clear colors are preferred by registries such natural variation in the shading of the coat is not to be considered a fault brown and cafe-au-lait poodles have liver-colored noses eye rims and lips dark toenails and dark amber eyes black blue gray silver cream and white poodles have black noses eye rims and lips black or self-colored toenails and very dark eyes in the apricots while the foregoing coloring is preferred liver-colored noses eye rims and lips and amber eyes are permitted but are not desirable incomplete color of nose lips and eye rims or a mismatched color are considered faults by registries
parti-colored poodles are recognized in poodle history as the original coloring of the poodle a parti poodle has solid-colored patches over a white coat the coat will usually be white and colored in equal amounts though it can vary with a larger percent of white registries prefer that parti poodles have the same points as its correlating solid-colored descendants brown and white parti poodles have liver-colored noses eye rims and lips dark or self-colored toenails and amber eyes this is also permitted but not preferred in apricot and white parti poodles black/white blue/white and silver/white poodles have black noses eye rims and lips black or self-colored toenails and very dark eyes when the dog has markings that resemble those of a tuxedo it is called a tuxedo poodle the upper coat is solid head back tail and the lower coat is white neck chest abdomen and legs making up usually 40% or more of the coat
phantom poodles have the coloring of a doberman pinscher with a lighter color appearing on their eyebrows muzzle and throat legs and feet and below their tail like dobermans phantom poodles have either a black or brown main coat with a tan (usually apricot or red) lighter colorings around the eyebrows muzzle throat legs feet and below their tail
=== temperamentedit ===
poodles are known as a highly intelligent energetic and sociable breed they require both physical and intellectual activities of note is this breed's keen sense for instinctive behavior in particular marking and hunting drives are more readily observable in poodles than in most other breeds a typical poodle should be reserved with strangers upon first introduction but after a while should slowly reveal a warm and personable disposition snappy vicious behavior is considered a serious fault in the breed
poodles are highly trainable dogs that typically excel in obedience training a poodle will do well at many dog sports including dog agility flyball dock diving field tracking and even schutzhund and can follow owners on hiking trips or any trip involving swimming as long as the dog is accustomed to water and swimming
of the size varieties standard poodles are the most highly recommended for families with children they have a kindly demeanor and a love of playing games as with all dogs and babies introductions should be gradual though most standards will tolerate a baby and learn to be gentle and will respect toddlers so long as the child is supervised a standard poodle will be fine in a family with many children provided the environment is a stable orderly and relaxed with enough room for the dog to go out and retire to if needed miniature and toy varieties tend to have less patience with young children and might find certain children's antics too much to handle they are likely to bite out of fear and thus are better suited to homes with teenagers or older children poodles dislike being left alone or left out of the family fun and some get anxious at being left in the house alone but sign of nervousness or neurosis is atypical and not how a poodle of any size is meant to behave
== healthedit ==
the most common serious health issues of standard poodles (listed in order of the number of reported cases in the poodle health registry (as of 20 august 2007) are addison's disease gastric dilatation volvulus (gdv = bloat/torsion) thyroid issues (hyperthyroid and hypothyroid) tracheal collapse epilepsy sebaceous adenitis juvenile renal disease hip dysplasia and cancer standard poodles are also susceptible to some health issues usually too minor to report to the health registry the most common of these minor issues is probably ear infection ear infections are a problem in all poodle varieties because their nonshedding coat grows into the ear canal where it traps wax and dirt ear problems can be minimized by proper ear care including regular cleaning and plucking of hair within the ear canal a veterinarian should be consulted if the dog shows signs of an ear infection
=== addison's diseaseedit ===
addison's disease is (as of 20 august 2007) the illness most commonly reported to the poodle health registry the number of reported cases is nearly twice as high as the next most common problem (gdv) addison's disease is characterized by insufficient production of glucocorticoid and/or mineralocortoid in the adrenal cortex (near the kidneys) addison's is often undiagnosed because early symptoms are vague and easily mistaken for other conditions standard poodles with unexplained lethargy frequent gastric disturbances or an inability to tolerate stress should be tested for it addison's can cause fatal sodium/potassium imbalances but if caught early and treated with lifelong medication most dogs can live a relatively normal life
=== gastric dilatation volvulusedit ===
standard poodle owners should take special note of the high incidence of gdv in this breed excess gas trapped in the dog's stomach causes bloat twisting of the stomach (volvulus or torsion") causes or is caused by excess gas symptoms include restlessness inability to get comfortable pacing or retching without being able to bring up anything the dog's abdomen may be visibly swollen but bloat or torsion can occur without visible swelling a dog with gdv requires immediate veterinary care the dog's survival usually depends on whether the owner can get to a veterinarian in time gdv risk is increased with faster eating and a raised feeding bowl
=== longevityedit ===
standard poodles in uk denmark and usa/canada surveys had a median lifespan of 11.5 to 12 years in a uk survey the most common causes of death were cancer (30%) old age (18%) gdv (6%) and cardiac disease (5%)
miniature and toy poodles in uk surveys had median lifespans of 14 to 14.5 years in miniatures the leading cause of death was old age (39%) in toys the leading causes of death were old age (25%) and kidney failure (20%)
some toy poodles can live up to 20 years if they have healthy lives and are not overweight the oldest poodle that ever lived was lady who lived to be 28 years and 218 days old she was born in 1908 and died on 6 august 1937
=== common illnessesedit ===
=== reproductionedit ===
breed size is correlated with litter size and standard poodles have the highest litter size followed by medium miniature and toy toy poodles have one of the smallest litter size of all breeds the stillborn rate and early neonatal mortality (death within 1 week from birth) in poodles are lower than the average across all breeds
== poodle mixesedit ==
poodles are crossed with other breeds for various reasons and the resulting puppies (called designer dogs) are described by whimsical portmanteau words such as cockapoo or spoodle (cocker spaniel) maltipoo (maltese) goldendoodle labradoodle (labrador) schnoodle (schnauzer) pekapoos (pekingese) cavapoo (cavalier king charles) bernedoodle (bernese mountain dog) and many others
a cross between a shedding breed and a poodle (which does not shed much) does not reliably produce a nonshedding dog traits of puppies from crossbreedings are not as predictable as those from purebred poodle breedings and the crosses may shed or have unexpected or undesirable qualities from the parent breeds
poodle crossbreds (also called hybrids) are not recognized by any major breed registry as crossbreds are not one breed of dog but two if both parents are registered purebreds but of different breeds it is still not possible to register a puppy as two different breeds some minor registries and internet registry businesses will register dogs as any breed the owner chooses with minimal or no documentation some even allow the breeder or owner to make up a new breed name
== hypoallergenic qualitiesedit ==
poodles are often cited as a hypoallergenic dog breed their individual hair follicles have an active growth period that is longer than that of many other breeds of dogs combined with the tightly curled coat which slows the loss of dander and dead hair by trapping it in the curls an individual poodle may release less dander and hair into the environment in addition most poodles are frequently brushed and bathed to keep them looking their best this not only removes hair and dander but also controls the other potent allergen saliva
although hair dander and saliva can be minimized they are still present and can stick to clothes and the carpets and furnishings in your home inhaling them or being licked by the dog can trigger a reaction in a sensitive person an air cleaner air duct outlet and vacuuming with a vacuum cleaner with a hepa filter can help clear dander floating in the air
the word hypoallergenic when referring to a dog is also a misconception all dogs shed poodles shed hair in minimal amounts and also release dander but are not as likely to trigger allergies as much as many other breeds additionally poodle maintenance must include some amount of regular shaving which releases hair dust in the air
== cultural visibilityedit ==
poodles are commonly known as extensively groomed show dogs and companions with a distinctive clip to such a degree that poodles in short pet clips often go unrecognised or mistaken as poodle crosses ("doodles") this association of the breed's appearance and the resulting preconceptions is strong and reflects in popular culture where poodles most often are depicted as spoiled and perhaps obnoxious pets or if anthropomorphic snobby selfish and vain poodle owners are stereotypically fussy frivolous and impractical
