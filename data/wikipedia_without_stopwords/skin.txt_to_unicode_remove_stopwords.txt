structure humans mammals
mammalian skin composed two primary layers
epidermis provides waterproofing serves barrier infection
dermis serves location appendages skin
epidermis
epidermis composed outermost layers skin forms protective barrier bodys surface responsible keeping water body preventing pathogens entering stratified squamous epithelium composed proliferating basal differentiated suprabasal keratinocytes epidermis also helps skin regulate body temperature
keratinocytes major cells constituting epidermis merkel cells melanocytes langerhans cells also present epidermis subdivided following strata layers beginning outermost layer
stratum corneum
stratum lucidum palms soles
stratum granulosum
stratum spinosum
stratum germinativum also called stratum basale
keratinocytes stratum basale proliferate mitosis daughter cells move strata changing shape composition undergo multiple stages cell differentiation eventually become anucleated process keratinocytes become highly organized forming cellular junctions desmosomes secreting keratin proteins lipids contribute formation extracellular matrix provide mechanical strength skin keratinocytes stratum corneum eventually shed surface desquamation
epidermis contains blood vessels cells deepest layers nourished diffusion blood capillaries extending upper layers dermis
basement membrane
epidermis dermis separated thin sheet fibers called basement membrane made action tissues basement membrane controls traffic cells molecules dermis epidermis also serves binding variety cytokines growth factors reservoir controlled release physiological remodeling repair processes
dermis
dermis layer skin beneath epidermis consists connective tissue cushions body stress strain dermis provides tensile strength elasticity skin extracellular matrix composed collagen fibrils microfibrils elastic fibers embedded hyaluronan proteoglycans skin proteoglycans varied specific locations example hyaluronan versican decorin present throughout dermis epidermis extracellular matrix whereas biglycan perlecan found epidermis
harbors many mechanoreceptors nerve endings provide sense touch heat also contains hair follicles sweat glands sebaceous glands apocrine glands lymphatic vessels blood vessels blood vessels dermis provide nourishment waste removal cells well epidermis
dermis tightly connected epidermis basement membrane structurally divided two areas superficial area adjacent epidermis called papillary region deep thicker area known reticular region
papillary region
papillary region composed loose areolar connective tissuethis named fingerlike projections called papillae extend toward epidermis papillae provide dermis bumpy surface interdigitates epidermis strengthening connection two layers skin
reticular region
reticular region lies deep papillary region usually much thicker composed dense irregular connective tissue receives name dense concentration collagenous elastic reticular fibers weave throughout protein fibers give dermis properties strength extensibility elasticity also located within reticular region roots hair sebaceous glands sweat glands receptors nails blood vessels
hypodermis
hypodermis part skin lies dermis purpose attach skin underlying bone muscle well supplying blood vessels nerves consists loose connective tissue elastin main cell types fibroblasts macrophages adipocytes hypodermis contains body fat fat serves padding insulation body another name hypodermis subcutaneous tissue
microorganisms like staphylococcus epidermidis colonize skin surface density skin flora depends region skin disinfected skin surface gets recolonized bacteria residing deeper areas hair follicle gut urogenital openings

fish amphibians
epidermis fish amphibians consists entirely live cells minimal quantities keratin cells superficial layer generally permeable case many amphibians may actually major respiratory organ dermis bony fish typically contains relatively little connective tissue found tetrapods instead species largely replaced solid protective bony scales apart particularly large dermal bones form parts skull scales lost tetrapods although many reptiles scales different kind pangolins cartilaginous fish numerous toothlike denticles embedded skin place true scales
sweat glands sebaceous glands unique mammals types skin gland found vertebrates fish typically numerous individual mucussecreting skin cells aid insulation protection may also poison glands photophores cells produce watery serous fluid amphibians mucus cells gathered together form saclike glands living amphibians also possess granular glands skin secrete irritating toxic compounds
although melanin found skin many species reptiles amphibians fish epidermis often relatively colourless instead colour skin largely due chromatophores dermis addition melanin may contain guanine carotenoid pigments many species chameleons flounders may able change colour skin adjusting relative size chromatophores
birds reptiles
epidermis birds reptiles closer mammals layer dead keratinfilled cells surface help reduce water loss similar pattern also seen terrestrial amphibians toads however animals clear differentiation epidermis distinct layers occurs humans change cell type relatively gradual mammalian epidermis always possesses least stratum germinativum stratum corneum intermediate layers found humans always distinguishable hair distinctive feature mammalian skin feathers least among living species similarly unique birds
birds reptiles relatively skin glands although may structures specific purposes pheromonesecreting cells reptiles uropygial gland birds
functions
skin performs following functions
protection anatomical barrier pathogens damage internal external environment bodily defense langerhans cells skin part adaptive immune system
sensation contains variety nerve endings jump heat cold touch pressure vibration tissue injury see somatosensory system haptic perception
thermoregulation eccrine sweat glands dilated blood vessels increased superficial perfusion aid heat loss constricted vessels greatly reduce cutaneous blood flow conserve heat erector pili muscles mammals adjust angle hair shafts change degree insulation provided hair fur
control evaporation skin provides relatively dry semiimpermeable barrier reduce fluid loss
storage synthesis acts storage center lipids water
absorption oxygen nitrogen carbon dioxide diffuse epidermis small amounts animals use skin sole respiration organ humans cells comprising outermost mm skin almost exclusively supplied external oxygen although contribution total respiration negligible
water resistance skin acts water resistant barrier essential nutrients arent washed body nutrients oils help hydrate skin covered outer skin layer epidermis helped part sebaceous glands release sebum oily liquid water cause elimination oils skin oils residing dermis flow would affected water without epidermis
mechanics
skin soft tissue mechanical behavior stretched intact skin prestreched like wetsuits around divers body deep cuts made skin retracts widening slice hole
society culture
term skin may also refer covering small animal sheep goat goatskin pig snake snakeskin etc young large animal
term hides rawhide refers covering large adult animal cow buffalo horse etc
skins hides different animals used clothing bags consumer products usually form leather also furs
skin sheep goat cattle used make parchment manuscripts
skin also cooked make pork rind crackling
