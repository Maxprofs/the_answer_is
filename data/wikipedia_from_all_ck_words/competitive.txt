empirical observation confirms that resources (capital labor technology) and talent tend to concentrate geographically (easterly and levine 2002) this result reflects the fact that firms are embedded in inter-firm relationships with networks of suppliers buyers and even competitors that help them to gain competitive advantages in the sale of its products and services while arms-length market relationships do provide these benefits at times there are externalities that arise from linkages among firms in a geographic area or in a specific industry (textiles leather goods silicon chips) that cannot be captured or fostered by markets alone the process of clusterization the creation of value chains or industrial districts are models that highlight the advantages of networks
within capitalist economic systems the drive of enterprises is to maintain and improve their own competitiveness this practically pertains to business sectors

some development economists believe that a sizeable part of western europe has now fallen behind the most dynamic amongst asias emerging nations notably because the latter adopted policies more propitious to long-term investments successful countries such as singapore indonesia and south korea still remember the harsh adjustment mechanisms imposed abruptly upon them by the imf and world bank during the 19971998 asian crisis [] what they have achieved in the past 10 years is all the more remarkable they have quietly abandoned the washington consensus [the dominant neoclassical perspective] by investing massively in infrastructure projects [] this pragmatic approach proved to be very successful

while competitiveness is understood at a macro-scale as a measure of a country's advantage or disadvantage in selling its products in international markets trade competitiveness can be defined as the ability of a firm industry city state or country to export more in value added terms than it imports
using a simple concept to measure heights that firms can climb may help improve execution of strategies international competitiveness can be measured on several criteria but few are as flexible and versatile to be applied across levels as trade competitiveness index (tci)
=== trade competitiveness index (tci)edit ===
tci can be formulated as ratio of forex (fx) balance to total forex as given in equation below it can be used as a proxy to determine health of foreign trade the ratio from -1 to 1 higher ratio being indicative of higher international trade competitiveness
in order to identify exceptional firms trends in tci can be assessed longitudinally for each company and country the simple concept of trade competitiveness index (tci) can be a powerful tool for setting targets detecting patterns and can also help with diagnosing causes across levels used judiciously in conjunction with volume of exports tci can give quick views of trends benchmarks and potential though there is found to be positive correlation between the profits and forex earnings we cannot blindly conclude the increase in the profits is due to the increase in the forex earnings the tci is an effective criteria but need to be complemented with other criteria to have better inferences

krugman (1994) points to the ways in which calls for greater national competitiveness frequently mask intellectual confusion arguing that in the context of countries productivity is what matters and the world's leading nations are not to any important degree in economic competition with each other. krugman warns that thinking in terms of competitiveness could lead to wasteful spending protectionism trade wars and bad policy as krugman puts it in his crisp aggressive style so if you hear someone say something along the lines of america needs higher productivity so that it can compete in todays global economy never mind who he is or how plausible he sounds he might as well be wearing a flashing neon sign that reads i dont know what im talking about.
if the concept of national competitiveness has any substantive meaning it must reside in the factors about a nation that facilitate productivity and alongside criticism of nebulous and erroneous conceptions of national competitiveness systematic and rigorous attempts like thompsons need to be elaborated
