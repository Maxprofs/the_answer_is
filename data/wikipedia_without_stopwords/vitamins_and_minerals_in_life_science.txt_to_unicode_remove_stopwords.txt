list vitamins
vitamin typically used multiple reactions therefore multiple functions
health effects
vitamins essential normal growth development multicellular organism using genetic blueprint inherited parents fetus begins develop moment conception nutrients absorbs requires certain vitamins minerals present certain times nutrients facilitate chemical reactions produce among things skin bone muscle serious deficiency one nutrients child may develop deficiency disease even minor deficiencies may cause permanent damage
part vitamins obtained food obtained means example microorganisms intestine commonly known gut flora produce vitamin k biotin one form vitamin d synthesized skin help natural ultraviolet wavelength sunlight humans produce vitamins precursors consume examples include vitamin produced beta carotene niacin amino acid tryptophan
growth development completed vitamins remain essential nutrients healthy maintenance cells tissues organs make multicellular organism also enable multicellular life form efficiently use chemical energy provided food eats help process proteins carbohydrates fats required respiration
supplements
otherwise healthy little evidence supplements benefits respect cancer heart disease vitamin e supplements provide health benefits generally healthy individuals may increase mortality though two large studies support conclusion included smokers already known betacarotene supplements harmful findings suggest vitamin e toxicity limited specific form taken excess
european union countries europe regulations define limits vitamin mineral dosages safe use food supplements vitamins sold food supplements cannot exceed maximum daily dosage vitamin products legal limits considered food supplements must registered prescription nonprescription overthecounter drugs due potential side effects result fatsoluble vitamins vitamins d e k contain amounts daily allowance drug products daily dosage vitamin supplement example cannot exceed recommended daily allowance vitamin limit even lower regulations applicable european countries
dietary supplements often contain vitamins may also include ingredients minerals herbs botanicals scientific evidence supports benefits dietary supplements persons certain health conditions cases vitamin supplements may unwanted effects especially taken surgery dietary supplements medicines person taking certain health conditions may also contain levels vitamins many times higher different forms one may ingest food

deficiencies
humans must consume vitamins periodically differing schedules avoid deficiency human bodys stores different vitamins vary widely vitamins d b stored significant amounts human body mainly liver adult humans diet may deficient vitamins d many months b cases years developing deficiency condition however vitamin b niacin niacinamide stored human body significant amounts stores may last couple weeks vitamin c first symptoms scurvy experimental studies complete vitamin c deprivation humans varied widely month six months depending previous dietary history determined body stores
deficiencies vitamins classified either primary secondary primary deficiency occurs organism get enough vitamin food secondary deficiency may due underlying disorder prevents limits absorption use vitamin due lifestyle factor smoking excessive alcohol consumption use medications interfere absorption use vitamin people eat varied diet unlikely develop severe primary vitamin deficiency contrast restrictive diets potential cause prolonged vitamin deficits may result often painful potentially deadly diseases
wellknown human vitamin deficiencies involve thiamine beriberi niacin pellagra vitamin c scurvy vitamin d rickets much developed world deficiencies rare due adequate supply food addition vitamins minerals common foods often called fortification addition classical vitamin deficiency diseases evidence also suggested links vitamin deficiency number different disorders
sideeffects
large doses vitamins documented sideeffects tend severe larger dosage likelihood consuming much vitamin food remote overdosing vitamin poisoning vitamin supplementation occur high enough dosages vitamins cause sideeffects nausea diarrhea vomiting sideeffects emerge recovery often accomplished reducing dosage doses vitamins differ individual tolerances vary widely appear related age state health
overdose exposure formulations vitamins multivitaminmineral formulations reported individuals american association poison control centers nearly exposures children age leading major lifethreatening outcomes deaths
pharmacology

naming
reason set vitamins skips directly e k vitamins corresponding letters fj either reclassified time discarded false leads renamed relationship vitamin b became complex vitamins
germanspeaking scientists isolated described vitamin k addition naming vitamin intimately involved coagulation blood following wounding german word koagulation time letters f j already designated use letter k considered quite reasonable table nomenclature reclassified vitamins lists chemicals previously classified vitamins well earlier names vitamins later became part bcomplex
missing b vitamins reclassified determined vitamins example b folic acid five folates range b b forms vitamins already discovered required nutrient entire population like b paba internal use biologically inactive toxic unclassifiable effects humans generally recognised vitamins science highestnumbered naturopath practitioners call b b also nine lettered b complex vitamins eg bm d vitamins recognised substances sources type number d controversial cancer treatment laetrile one point numbered vitamin b appears consensus vitamins q r v w x y z substances officially designated vitamins n although latter may another form one vitamins known named nutrient another type
antivitamins
