== historyedit ==
=== toponymyedit ===
the etymology of london is uncertain it is an ancient name found in sources from the 2nd century it is recorded c 121 as londinium which points to romano-british origin the earliest attempted explanation now disregarded is attributed to geoffrey of monmouth in historia regum britanniae this had it that the name originated from a supposed king lud who had allegedly taken over the city and named it kaerlud
from 1898 it was commonly accepted that the name was of celtic origin and meant place belonging to a man called *londinos this explanation has since been rejected richard coates put forward an explanation in 1998 that it is derived from the pre-celtic old european *(p)lowonida meaning river too wide to ford and suggested that this was a name given to the part of the river thames which flows through london from this the settlement gained the celtic form of its name *lowonidonjon this requires quite a serious amendment however the ultimate difficulty lies in reconciling the latin form londinium with the modern welsh llundain which should demand a form *(h)lndinion (as opposed to *londnion) from earlier *loundiniom the possibility cannot be ruled out that the welsh name was borrowed back in from english at a later date and thus cannot be used as a basis from which to reconstruct the original name
until 1889 the name london officially applied only to the city of london but since then it has also referred to the county of london and now greater london
=== prehistoryedit ===
two recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near the thames in the london area in 1999 the remains of a bronze age bridge were found on the foreshore north of vauxhall bridge this bridge either crossed the thames or went to a now lost island in the river dendrology dated the timbers to 1500 bc in 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure dated to 4500 bc were found on the thames foreshore south of vauxhall bridge the function of the mesolithic structure is not known both structures are on south bank at a natural crossing point where the river effra flows into the river thames
=== roman londonedit ===
although there is evidence of scattered brythonic settlements in the area the first major settlement was founded by the romans after the invasion of 43 ad this lasted only until around 61 when the iceni tribe led by queen boudica stormed it burning it to the ground the next heavily planned incarnation of londinium prospered and it superseded colchester as the capital of the roman province of britannia in 100 at its height in the 2nd century roman london had a population of around 60,000
=== anglo-saxon london (and viking period)edit ===
with the collapse of roman rule in the early 5th century london ceased to be a capital and the walled city of londinium was effectively abandoned although roman civilisation continued in the st martin-in-the-fields area until around 450 from around 500 an anglo-saxon settlement known as lundenwic developed in the same area slightly to the west of the old roman city by about 680 it had revived sufficiently to become a major port although there is little evidence of large-scale production of goods from the 820s the town declined because of repeated viking invasions there are three recorded viking assaults on london two of which were successful in 851 and 886 ad although they were defeated during the attack of 994 ad
the vikings established danelaw over much of the eastern and northern part of england with its boundary roughly stretching from london to chester it was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the viking incursions which was formally agreed to by the danish warlord guthrum and west-saxon king alfred the great in 886 ad danelaw lasted in many parts of england for centuries to come the anglo-saxon chronicle recorded that london was refounded by alfred the great in 886 archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old roman walls london then grew slowly until about 950 after which activity increased dramatically
by the 11th century london was beyond all comparison the largest town in england westminster abbey rebuilt in the romanesque style by king edward the confessor was one of the grandest churches in europe winchester had previously been the capital of anglo-saxon england but from this time on london became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war in the view of frank stenton it had the resources and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital.
=== middle agesedit ===
following his victory in the battle of hastings william duke of normandy was crowned king of england in the newly finished westminster abbey on christmas day 1066 william constructed the tower of london the first of the many norman castles in england to be rebuilt in stone in the southeastern corner of the city to intimidate the native inhabitants in 1097 william ii began the building of westminster hall close by the abbey of the same name the hall became the basis of a new palace of westminster
during the 12th century the institutions of central government which had hitherto accompanied the royal english court as it moved around the country grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place in most cases this was westminster although the royal treasury having been moved from winchester came to rest in the tower while the city of westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms its distinct neighbour the city of london remained england's largest city and principal commercial centre and it flourished under its own unique administration the corporation of london in 1100 its population was around 18,000 by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000
disaster struck during the black death in the mid-14th century when london lost nearly a third of its population london was the focus of the peasants revolt in 1381
=== early modernedit ===
during the tudor period the reformation produced a gradual shift to protestantism much of london passing from church to private ownership the traffic in woollen cloths shipped undyed and undressed from london to the nearby shores of the low countries where it was considered indispensable but the tentacles of english maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west europe the commercial route to italy and the mediterranean sea normally lay through antwerp and over the alps any ships passing through the strait of gibraltar to or from england were likely to be italian or ragusan upon the re-opening of the netherlands to english shipping in january 1565 there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity the royal exchange was founded mercantilism grew and monopoly trading companies such as the east india company were established with trade expanding to the new world london became the principal north sea port with migrants arriving from england and abroad the population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605
in the 16th century william shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in london at a time of hostility to the development of the theatre by the end of the tudor period in 1603 london was still very compact there was an assassination attempt on james i in westminster through the gunpowder plot on 5 november 1605 london was plagued by disease in the early 17th century culminating in the great plague of 16651666 which killed up to 100,000 people or a fifth of the population
the great fire of london broke out in 1666 in pudding lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by robert hooke as surveyor of london in 1708 christopher wren's masterpiece st paul's cathedral was completed during the georgian era new districts such as mayfair were formed in the west new bridges over the thames encouraged development in south london in the east the port of london expanded downstream
in 1762 george iii acquired buckingham house and it was enlarged over the next 75 years during the 18th century london was dogged by crime and the bow street runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force in total more than 200 offences were punishable by death including petty theft most children born in the city died before reaching their third birthday the coffeehouse became a popular place to debate ideas with growing literacy and the development of the printing press making news widely available and fleet street became the centre of the british press
according to samuel johnson
you find no man at all intellectual who is willing to leave london no sir when a man is tired of london he is tired of life for there is in london all that life can afford
=== late modern and contemporaryedit ===
london was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925 london's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics claiming 14,000 lives in 1848 and 6,000 in 1866 rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network the metropolitan board of works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties it was abolished in 1889 when the london county council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital london was bombed by the germans during the first world war while during the second world war the blitz and other bombings by the german luftwaffe killed over 30,000 londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city immediately after the war the 1948 summer olympics were held at the original wembley stadium at a time when london had barely recovered from the war
in 1951 the festival of britain was held on the south bank the great smog of 1952 led to the clean air act 1956 which ended the pea soup fogs for which london had been notorious from the 1940s onwards london became home to a large number of immigrants largely from commonwealth countries such as jamaica india bangladesh and pakistan making london one of the most diverse cities in europe
primarily starting in the mid-1960s london became a centre for the worldwide youth culture exemplified by the swinging london subculture associated with the king's road chelsea and carnaby street the role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era in 1965 london's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new greater london council was created during the troubles in northern ireland london was subjected to bombing attacks by the provisional ira racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 brixton riot
greater london's population declined steadily in the decades after the second world war from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s the principal ports for london moved downstream to felixstowe and tilbury with the london docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration including the canary wharf development this was borne out of london's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s the thames barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect london against tidal surges from the north sea
the greater london council was abolished in 1986 which left london as the only large metropolis in the world without a central administration in 2000 london-wide government was restored with the creation of the greater london authority to celebrate the start of the 21st century the millennium dome london eye and millennium bridge were constructed on 6 july 2005 london was awarded the 2012 summer olympics making london the first city to stage the olympic games three times in january 2015 greater london's population was estimated to be 8.63 million the highest level since 1939

=== national governmentedit ===
london is the seat of the government of the united kingdom many government departments are based close to the palace of westminster particularly along whitehall including the prime minister's residence at 10 downing street the british parliament is often referred to as the mother of parliaments (although this sobriquet was first applied to england itself by john bright) because it has been the model for most other parliamentary systems there are 73 members of parliament (mps) from london who correspond to local parliamentary constituencies in the national parliament as of may 2015 45 are from the labour party 27 are conservatives and one is a liberal democrat
=== policing and crimeedit ===
policing in greater london with the exception of the city of london is provided by the metropolitan police force overseen by the mayor through the mayor's office for policing and crime (mopac) the city of london has its own police force the city of london police the british transport police are responsible for police services on national rail and london underground services a fourth police force in london the ministry of defence police do not generally become involved with policing the general public
crime rates vary widely by area ranging from parts with serious issues to parts considered very safe today crime figures are made available nationally at local authority and ward level the metropolitan police have made detailed crime figures broken down by category at borough and ward level available on their website since 2000 many websites and applications took advantage of this data to build crime maps of london's neighbourhoods
== geographyedit ==
=== scopeedit ===
london also referred to as greater london is one of 9 regions of england and the top-level subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis the small ancient city of london at its core once comprised the whole settlement but as its urban area grew the corporation of london resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs causing london to be defined in a number ways for different purposes
forty per cent of greater london is covered by the london post town within which london forms part of postal addresses the london telephone area code (020) covers a larger area similar in size to greater london although some outer districts are omitted and some places just outside are included the greater london boundary has been aligned to the m25 motorway in places
outward urban expansion is now prevented by the metropolitan green belt although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places resulting in a separately defined greater london urban area beyond this is the vast london commuter belt greater london is split for some purposes into inner london and outer london the city is split by the river thames into north and south with an informal central london area in its interior the coordinates of the nominal centre of london traditionally considered to be the original eleanor cross at charing cross near the junction of trafalgar square and whitehall are approximately 513026n 000739w
=== statusedit ===
within london both the city of london and the city of westminster have city status and both the city of london and the remainder of greater london are counties for the purposes of lieutenancies the area of greater london has incorporated areas that were once part of the historic counties of middlesex kent surrey essex and hertfordshire london's status as the capital of england and later the united kingdom has never been granted or confirmed officiallyby statute or in written form
its position was formed through constitutional convention making its status as de facto capital a part of the uk's unwritten constitution the capital of england was moved to london from winchester as the palace of westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court and thus the political capital of the nation more recently greater london has been defined as a region of england and in this context is known as london
=== topographyedit ===
greater london encompasses a total area of 1,583 square kilometres (611 sq mi) an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 4,542 inhabitants per square kilometre (11,760/sq mi) the extended area known as the london metropolitan region or the london metropolitan agglomeration comprises a total area of 8,382 square kilometres (3,236 sq mi) has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of 1,510 inhabitants per square kilometre (3,900/sq mi) modern london stands on the thames its primary geographical feature a navigable river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east the thames valley is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills including parliament hill addington hills and primrose hill the thames was once a much broader shallower river with extensive marshlands at high tide its shores reached five times their present width
since the victorian era the thames has been extensively embanked and many of its london tributaries now flow underground the thames is a tidal river and london is vulnerable to flooding the threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow tilting of britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-glacial rebound
in 1974 a decade of work began on the construction of the thames barrier across the thames at woolwich to deal with this threat while the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070 concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed
=== climateedit ===
london has a temperate oceanic climate (kppen cfb) similar to all of southern britain despite its reputation as being a rainy city london receives less precipitation (601 mm (24 in) in a year) than rome bordeaux toulouse naples and even sydney in australia but those are spread over more days temperature extremes for all sites in the london area range from 38.1 c (100.6 f) at kew during august 2003 down to 16.1 c (3.0 f) at northolt during january 1962
summers are generally warm and sometimes hot london's average july high is 24 c (75.2 f) on average london will see 31 days above 25 c (77.0 f) each year and 4.2 days above 30.0 c (86.0 f) every year during the 2003 european heat wave there were 14 consecutive days above 30 c (86.0 f) and 2 consecutive days where temperatures reached 38 c (100.4 f) leading to hundreds of heat related deaths winters are generally cool and damp with little temperature variation snowfall does occur from time to time and can cause travel disruption when this happens spring and autumn are mixed seasons and can be pleasant as a large city london has a considerable urban heat island effect making the centre of london at times 5 c (9 f) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts the effect of this can be seen below when comparing london heathrow 15 miles west of london with the london weather centre in the city centre
=== districtsedit ===
london's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names such as bloomsbury mayfair wembley and whitechapel these are either informal designations reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs
such names have remained in use through tradition each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character but without official boundaries since 1965 greater london has been divided into 32 london boroughs in addition to the ancient city of london the city of london is the main financial district and canary wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the docklands to the east
the west end is london's main entertainment and shopping district attracting tourists west london includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds the average price for properties in kensington and chelsea is over 2 million with a similarly high outlay in most of central london
the east end is the area closest to the original port of london known for its high immigrant population as well as for being one of the poorest areas in london the surrounding east london area saw much of london's early industrial development now brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the thames gateway including the london riverside and lower lea valley which was developed into the olympic park for the 2012 olympics and paralympics
=== architectureedit ===
london's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style partly because of their varying ages many grand houses and public buildings such as the national gallery are constructed from portland stone some areas of the city particularly those just west of the centre are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings few structures in central london pre-date the great fire of 1666 these being a few trace roman remains the tower of london and a few scattered tudor survivors in the city further out is for example the tudor period hampton court palace england's oldest surviving tudor palace built by cardinal thomas wolsey c 1515 wren's late 17th-century churches and the financial institutions of the 18th and 19th centuries such as the royal exchange and the bank of england to the early 20th century old bailey and the 1960s barbican estate form part of the varied architectural heritage
the disused but soon to be rejuvenated 1939 battersea power station by the river in the south-west is a local landmark while some railway termini are excellent examples of victorian architecture most notably st pancras and paddington the density of london varies with high employment density in the central area high residential densities in inner london and lower densities in outer london
the monument in the city of london provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the great fire of london which originated nearby marble arch and wellington arch at the north and south ends of park lane respectively have royal connections as do the albert memorial and royal albert hall in kensington nelson's column is a nationally recognised monument in trafalgar square one of the focal points of central london older buildings are mainly brick built most commonly the yellow london stock brick or a warm orange-red variety often decorated with carvings and white plaster mouldings
in the dense areas most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings london's skyscrapers such as 30 st mary axe tower 42 the broadgate tower and one canada square are mostly in the two financial districts the city of london and canary wharf high-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of st paul's cathedral and other historic buildings nevertheless there are a number of very tall skyscrapers in central london (see tall buildings in london) including the 95-storey shard london bridge the tallest building in the european union
other notable modern buildings include city hall in southwark with its distinctive oval shape and the british library in somers town/kings cross what was formerly the millennium dome by the thames to the east of canary wharf is now an entertainment venue called the o2 arena
=== natural historyedit ===
the london natural history society suggest that london is one of the world's greenest cities with more than 40 percent green space or open water they indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal thames supports 120 species of fish they also state that over 60 species of bird nest in central london and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around london london's wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds london has 38 sites of special scientific interest (sssis) two national nature reserves and 76 local nature reserves
amphibians are common in the capital including smooth newts living by the tate modern and common frogs common toads palmate newts and great crested newts on the other hand native reptiles such as slow-worms common lizards grass snakes and adders are mostly only seen in outer london
among other inhabitants of london are 10,000 foxes so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of london these urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins sharing the pavement (sidewalk) with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards foxes have even sneaked into the houses of parliament where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet another broke into the grounds of buckingham palace reportedly killing some of queen elizabeth ii's prized pink flamingos generally however foxes and city folk appear to get along a survey in 2001 by the london-based mammal society found that 80 percent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around this sample cannot be taken to represent londoners as a whole
other mammals found in greater london are hedgehogs rats mice rabbit shrew vole and squirrels in wilder areas of outer london such as epping forest a wide variety of mammals are found including hare badger field bank and water vole wood mouse yellow-necked mouse mole shrew and weasel in addition to fox squirrel and hedgehog a dead otter was found at the highway in wapping about a mile from the tower bridge which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city ten of england's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in epping forest soprano nathusius and common pipistrelles noctule serotine barbastelle daubenton's brown long-eared natterer's and leisler's
among the strange sights seen in london have been a whale in the thames while the bbc two programme natural world unnatural history of london shows pigeons using the london underground to get around the city a seal that takes fish from fishmongers outside billingsgate fish market and foxes that will sit if given sausages
herds of red and fallow deer also roam freely within much of richmond and bushy park a cull takes place each november and february to ensure numbers can be sustained epping forest is also known for its fallow deer which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the forest a rare population of melanistic black fallow deer is also maintained at the deer sanctuary near theydon bois muntjac deer which escaped from deer parks at the turn of the twentieth century are also found in the forest while londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature and whole herds of fallow and white-tailed deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of the london's green spaces
== demographyedit ==
