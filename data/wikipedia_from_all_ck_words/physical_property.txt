a physical property is any property that is measurable whose value describes a state of a physical system the changes in the physical properties of a system can be used to describe its transformations or evolutions between its momentary states physical properties are often referred to as observables they are not modal properties
physical properties are often characterized as intensive and extensive properties an intensive property does not depend on the size or extent of the system nor on the amount of matter in the object while an extensive property shows an additive relationship these classifications are in general only valid in cases when smaller subdivisions of the sample do not interact in some physical or chemical process when combined
properties may also be classified with respect to the directionality of their nature for example isotropic properties do not change with the direction of observation and anisotropic properties do have spatial variance
it may be difficult to determine whether a given property is a material property or not color for example can be seen and measured however what one perceives as color is really an interpretation of the reflective properties of a surface and the light used to illuminate it in this sense many ostensibly physical properties are called supervenient a supervenient property is one which is actual but is secondary to some underlying reality this is similar to the way in which objects are supervenient on atomic structure a cup might have the physical properties of mass shape color temperature etc. but these properties are supervenient on the underlying atomic structure which may in turn be supervenient on an underlying quantum structure
physical properties are contrasted with chemical properties which determine the way a material behaves in a chemical reaction
