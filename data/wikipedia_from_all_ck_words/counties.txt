a county abbreviated cnty (us) or co (uk and ireland) is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes in certain modern nations the term is derived from the old french cont or cunt denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount the modern french is comt and its equivalents in other languages are contea contado comtat condado grafschaft gau etc (cf conte comte conde graf)
when the normans conquered england they brought the term with them the saxons had already established the districts that became the historic counties of england calling them shires (many county names derive from the name of the county town with the word shire added on for example gloucestershire and worcestershire) the vikings introduced the term earl (from old norse jarl) to the british isles thus earl and earldom were taken as equivalent to the continental use of count and county so the later-imported term became a synonym for the native english word scir ([ir]) or in modern english shire since a shire was an administrative division of the kingdom the term county evolved to designate an administrative division of national government in most modern uses

during the second half of the 20th century many counties received overflow population from nearby cities the result was often a merger of the two into a district (e.g rotorua) or a change of name to district (e.g waimairi) or city (e.g manukau city)
the local government act 1974 began the process of bringing urban mixed and rural councils into the same legislative framework substantial reorganisations under that act resulted in the 1989 shake-up which covered the country in (non-overlapping) cities and districts and abolished all the counties except for the chatham islands county which survived under that name for a further 6 years but then became a territory under the chatham islands council

the united kingdom is divided into a number of metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties there are also ceremonial counties which group small non-metropolitan counties into geographical areas broadly based on the historic counties of england in 1974 the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties replaced the system of administrative counties and county boroughs which was introduced in 1889
most non-metropolitan counties in england are run by county councils and are divided into non-metropolitan districts each with its own council local authorities in the uk are usually responsible for education emergency services planning transport social services and a number of other functions
in england in the anglo-saxon period shires were established as areas used for the raising of taxes and usually had a fortified town at their centre this became known as the shire town or later the county town in many cases the shires were named after their shire town (for example bedfordshire) but there are several exceptions such as cumberland norfolk and suffolk in several other cases such as buckinghamshire the modern county town is different from the town for which the shire is named (see toponymical list of counties of the united kingdom)
the name county was introduced by the normans and was derived from a norman term for an area administered by a count (lord) these norman counties were simply the saxon shires and kept their saxon names several traditional counties including essex sussex and kent predate the unification of england by alfred the great and were originally more or less independent kingdoms
in northern ireland the six county councils if not their counties were abolished in 1973 and replaced by 26 local government districts the traditional six counties remain in common everyday use for many cultural and other purposes
the thirteen historic counties of wales were fixed by statute in 1539 (although counties such as pembrokeshire date from 1138) and most of the shires of scotland are of at least this age in the gaelic form scottish traditional county names are generally distinguished by the designation siorramachd- literally sherrifdom e.g siorramachd earra-ghaidheal (argyllshire) this term corresponds to the jurisdiction of the sheriff in the scottish legal system
until 1974 the county boundaries of england changed little over time in the medival period a number of important cities were granted the status of counties in their own right such as london bristol and coventry and numerous small exclaves such as islandshire were created in 1844 most of these exclaves were transferred to their surrounding counties
in 1965 and 19741975 major reorganisations of local government in england and wales created several new administrative counties such as hereford and worcester and also created several new metropolitan counties based on large urban areas as a single administrative unit in scotland county-level local government was replaced by larger regions which lasted until 1996 modern local government in scotland wales northern ireland and a large part of england is trending towards smaller unitary authorities a system similar to that proposed in the 1960s by the redcliffe-maud report for most of britain
== united states ==
counties in u.s states are administrative divisions of the state in which their boundaries are drawn 3,144 counties and county equivalents carve up the united states ranging in quantity from 3 for delaware to 254 for texas where they exist they are the intermediate tier of state government between the statewide tier and the immediately local government tier (typically a city town or village) counties have functional purposes in 48 of the 50 states the other two states (connecticut and rhode island) have abolished their counties as functional entities and massachusetts is in the process of doing so of these remaining 48 states 46 use the term county while alaska and louisiana use the terms borough and parish respectively for analogous jurisdictions while the parochial system in louisiana is analogous parishes are by no means counties under another name
depending on the individual state counties or their equivalents may be administratively subdivided into townships or towns in the new england states new york and wisconsin except in new england where strong government at the town level has historically existed since the area was settled the township is generally subordinate to the county which is generally subordinate to the state michigan since 1947 has distinguished between townships (not self-governing) and charter townships (self-governing) in most states municipal corporations (i.e cities villages or towns) file their reports to the state through the county in virginia however all cities are independent and report directly to the commonwealth government but notwithstanding they are not part of the county they might operate as a county seat (e.g the independent city of fairfax is the seat of fairfax county though it is not legally within fairfax county) california has abolished its townships though many general law cities continue to use the word town as part of their name (e.g town of atherton when it is legally the city of atherton)
louisiana has entities roughly equivalent to counties called parishes alaska is divided into boroughs which typically provide fewer local services than do most u.s counties as the state government furnishes many services directly some of alaska's boroughs have merged geographical boundaries and administrative functions with their principal (and sometimes only) cities these are known as unified city-boroughs and result in some of alaska's cities ranking among the geographically largest cities in the world nevertheless alaska considers such entities to be boroughs not cities alaska is also unique in that more than half the geographic area of the state is in the unorganized borough a legal entity in which the state also functions as the local government
new york has a unique system where 57 of its 62 counties are independently-operated administrative divisions of the state with normal county executive powers while the remaining five are administrative divisions of the city of new york these five are each called borough in context of city government manhattan the bronx queens brooklyn and staten island (formerly richmond) but are still called county where state function is involved e.g. new york county courthouse not manhattan the county names correlate to the borough names as follows new york county = manhattan bronx county = the bronx queens county = queens kings county = brooklyn and richmond county = staten island
in two states and parts of a third county government as such does not exist and county refers to geographic regions or districts in connecticut rhode island and parts of massachusetts counties exist only to designate boundaries for such state-level functions as park districts (connecticut) or judicial offices (connecticut and massachusetts) in states where county government is nonexistent or weak (e.g. new hampshire vermont) town government may provide some or all of the local government services
most counties have a county seat a city town or other named place where its administrative functions are centered some counties have no incorporated municipalities such as arlington county virginia in several instances throughout the nation a municipality has merged with a county into one jurisdiction so the county seat is coextensive with the county forming a consolidated city-county some new england states use the term shire town to mean county seat
