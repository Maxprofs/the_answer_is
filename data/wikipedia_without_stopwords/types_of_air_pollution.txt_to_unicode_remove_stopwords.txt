air pollution emission plumes
air pollution emission plume flow pollutant form vapor smoke released air plumes considerable importance atmospheric dispersion modelling air pollution three primary types air pollution emission plumes
buoyant plumes plumes lighter air higher temperature lower density ambient air surrounds temperature ambient air lower molecular weight hence lower density ambient air example emissions flue gas stacks industrial furnaces buoyant considerably warmer less dense ambient air another example emission plume methane gas ambient air temperatures buoyant methane lower molecular weight ambient air
dense gas plumes plumes heavier air higher density surrounding ambient air plume may higher density air higher molecular weight air example plume carbon dioxide plume may also higher density air plume much lower temperature air example plume evaporated gaseous methane accidental release liquefied natural gas lng may cold c
passive neutral plumes plumes neither lighter heavier air
air pollution dispersion models
five types air pollution dispersion models well hybrids five types
box model box model simplest model types assumes airshed ie given volume atmospheric air geographical region shape box also assumes air pollutants inside box homogeneously distributed uses assumption estimate average pollutant concentrations anywhere within airshed although useful model limited ability accurately predict dispersion air pollutants airshed assumption homogeneous pollutant distribution much simple
gaussian model gaussian model perhaps oldest circa perhaps commonly used model type assumes air pollutant dispersion gaussian distribution meaning pollutant distribution normal probability distribution gaussian models often used predicting dispersion continuous buoyant air pollution plumes originating groundlevel elevated sources gaussian models may also used predicting dispersion noncontinuous air pollution plumes called puff models primary algorithm used gaussian modeling generalized dispersion equation continuous pointsource plume
lagrangian model lagrangian dispersion model mathematically follows pollution plume parcels also called particles parcels move atmosphere model motion parcels random walk process lagrangian model calculates air pollution dispersion computing statistics trajectories large number pollution plume parcels lagrangian model uses moving frame reference parcels move initial location said observer lagrangian model follows along plume
eulerian model eulerian dispersions model similar lagrangian model also tracks movement large number pollution plume parcels move initial location important difference two models eulerian model uses fixed threedimensional cartesian grid frame reference rather moving frame reference said observer eulerian model watches plume go
dense gas model dense gas models models simulate dispersion dense gas pollution plumes ie pollution plumes heavier air three commonly used dense gas models

building effects downwash air pollution plume flows nearby buildings structures turbulent eddies formed downwind side building eddies cause plume stack source located within five times height nearby building structure forced ground much sooner would building structure present effect greatly increase resulting nearby groundlevel pollutant concentrations downstream building structure pollutants plume subject depletion contact ground particulates example concentration increase downstream building structure decrease concentrations downstream
deposition pollution plume components underlying surface defined either dry wet deposition
dry deposition removal gaseous particulate material pollution plume contact ground surface vegetation even water surfaces transfer processes absorption gravitational sedimentation may calculated means deposition velocity related resistance underlying surface transfer
wet deposition removal pollution plume components action rain wet deposition radionuclides pollution plume burst rain often forms called hot spots radioactivity underlying surface
inversion layers normally air near earths surface warmer air atmosphere heated solar radiation warms earths surface turn warms layer atmosphere directly thus atmospheric temperature normally decreases increasing altitude however certain meteorological conditions atmospheric layers may form temperature increases increasing altitude layers called inversion layers layer forms earths surface called surface inversion inversion layer forms distance earth called inversion aloft sometimes referred capping inversion air within inversion aloft stable little vertical motion rising parcel air within inversion soon expands thereby adiabatically cooling lower temperature surrounding air parcel stops rising sinking parcel soon compresses adiabatically higher temperature surrounding air parcel stops sinking thus air pollution plume enters inversion aloft undergo little vertical mixing unless sufficient momentum completely pass inversion aloft one reason inversion aloft sometimes called capping inversion
mixing height inversion aloft formed atmospheric layer earths surface bottom inversion aloft known mixing layer distance earths surface bottom inversion aloft known mixing height air pollution plume dispersing beneath inversion aloft limited vertical mixing occurs beneath bottom inversion aloft sometimes called lid even pollution plume penetrates inversion undergo significant vertical mixing pollution plume passing completely inversion layer aloft rarely occurs unless pollution plumes source stack tall inversion lid fairly low
