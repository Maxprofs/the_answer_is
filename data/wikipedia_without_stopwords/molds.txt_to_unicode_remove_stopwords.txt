mold us ca mould uk nz au za ca fungus grows form multicellular filaments called hyphae contrast fungi adopt singlecelled growth habit called yeasts
molds large taxonomically diverse number fungal species growth hyphae results discoloration fuzzy appearance especially food network tubular branching hyphae called mycelium considered single organism hyphae generally transparent mycelium appears like fine fluffy white threads surface crosswalls septa may delimit connected compartments along hyphae containing one multiple genetically identical nuclei dusty texture many molds caused profuse production asexual spores conidia formed differentiation ends hyphae mode formation shape spores traditionally used classify molds many spores colored making fungus much obvious human eye stage lifecycle
molds considered microbes form specific taxonomic phylogenetic grouping found divisions zygomycota ascomycota past molds classified within deuteromycota
molds cause biodegradation natural materials unwanted becomes food spoilage damage property also play important roles biotechnology food science production various foods beverages antibiotics pharmaceuticals enzymes diseases animals humans caused certain molds disease may result allergic sensitivity mold spores growth pathogenic molds within body effects ingested inhaled toxic compounds mycotoxins produced molds

thousands known species molds diverse lifestyles including saprotrophs mesophiles psychrophiles thermophiles opportunistic pathogens humans require moisture growth live aquatic environments like fungi molds derive energy photosynthesis organic matter live utilising heterotrophy typically molds secrete hydrolytic enzymes mainly hyphal tips enzymes degrade complex biopolymers starch cellulose lignin simpler substances absorbed hyphae way molds play major role causing decomposition organic material enabling recycling nutrients throughout ecosystems many molds also synthesise mycotoxins siderophores together lytic enzymes inhibit growth competing microorganisms molds also grow stored food animals humans making food unpalatable toxic thus major source food losses illness many strategies food preservation salting pickling jams bottling freezing drying prevent slow mold growth well growth microbes
molds reproduce producing large numbers small spores may contain single nucleus multinucleate mold spores asexual products mitosis sexual products meiosis many species produce types molds produce small hydrophobic spores adapted wind dispersal may remain airborne long periods cell walls darkly pigmented providing resistance damage ultraviolet radiation mold spores slimy sheaths suited water dispersal mold spores often spherical ovoid single cells multicellular variously shaped spores may cling clothing fur able survive extremes temperature pressure
although molds grow dead organic matter everywhere nature presence visible unaided eye form large colonies mold colony consist discrete organisms interconnected network hyphae called mycelium growth occurs hyphal tips cytoplasm organelles flowing forwards hyphae advance new food sources nutrients absorbed hyphal tip artificial environments buildings humidity temperature often stable enough foster growth mold colonies commonly seen downy furry coating growing food surfaces
molds begin growing temperatures c f food typically refrigerated temperature conditions enable growth take place molds may remain alive dormant state depending species within large range temperatures many different mold species vary enormously tolerance temperature humidity extremes certain molds survive harsh conditions snowcovered soils antarctica refrigeration highly acidic solvents antibacterial soap even petroleum products jet fuel
xerophilic molds able grow relatively dry salty sugary environments water activity aw less molds need moisture

molds ubiquitous mold spores common component household workplace dust however mold spores present large quantities present health hazard humans potentially causing allergic reactions respiratory problems
molds also produce mycotoxins pose serious health risks humans animals studies claim exposure high levels mycotoxins lead neurological problems cases death prolonged exposure eg daily home exposure may particularly harmful research health impacts mold conclusive term toxic mold refers molds produce mycotoxins stachybotrys chartarum molds general
mold home usually found damp dark steamy areas eg bathroom kitchen cluttered storage areas recently flooded areas basement areas plumbing spaces areas poor ventilation outdoors humid environments symptoms caused mold allergy watery itchy eyes chronic cough headaches migraines difficulty breathing rashes tiredness sinus problems nasal blockage frequent sneezing
molds also pose hazard human animal health consumed following growth certain mold species stored food species produce toxic secondary metabolites collectively termed mycotoxins including aflatoxins ochratoxins fumonisins trichothecenes citrinin patulin toxic properties may used benefit humans toxicity directed organisms example penicillin adversely affects growth grampositive bacteria eg clostridium species certain spirochetes certain fungi
