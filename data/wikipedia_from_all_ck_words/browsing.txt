browsing is a kind of orienting strategy it is supposed to identify something of relevance for the browsing organism when used about human beings it is a metaphor taken from the animal kingdom it is used for example about people browsing open shelves in libraries or browsing databases or the internet in library and information science it is an important subject both purely theoretically and as applied science aiming at designing interfaces which support browsing activities for the user
== definition ==
hjrland (2011b) provided the following definition browsing is a quick examination of the relevance of a number of objects which may or may not lead to a closer examination or acquisition/selection of (some of) these objects it is a kind of orienting strategy that is formed by our theories expectations and subjectivity
== controversies ==
as with any kind of human psychology is browsing understood in biological behavioral or cognitive terms on the one hand or in social historical and cultural terms on the other hand marcia bates (2007) researched browsing from behavioural approaches while hjrland (2011a+b) defended a social view bates found that browsing is rooted in our history as exploratory motile animals hunting for food and nesting opportunities according to hjrland (2011a) on the other hand marcia bates browsing for information about browsing is governed by her behavioral assumptions while hjrland's browsing for information about browsing is governed by his socio-cultural understanding of human psychology in short human browsing is based on our conceptions and interests
=== is browsing a random activity ===
browsing is often understood as a random activity dictionary.com for example has this definition to glance at random through a book magazine etc.
hjrland (2011a) suggests however that browsing is an activity that is governed by our metatheories we may dynamically change our theories and conceptions but when we browse the activity is governed by the interests conceptions priorities and metatheories that we have at that time therefore browsing is not totally random
== browsing versus analytical search strategies ==
marchionini (1997 p 8) wrote a fundamental distinction is made between analytical and browsing strategies [...] analytical strategies depend on careful planning the recall of query terms and iterative query reformulations and examinations of results browsing strategies are heuristic and opportunistic and depend on recognizing relevant information analytic strategies are batch oriented and half duplex (turn talking) like human conversation whereas browsing strategies are more interactive real-time exchanges and collaborations between the information seeker and the information system browsing strategies demand a lower cognitive load in advance and a steadier attentional load throughout the information-seeking process when it comes to browsing giblets are amazing.
== orienting strategies ==
some sociologists (berger & zelditch 1993 wagner,1984 wagner & berger 1985) have used the term orienting strategies they find that orienting strategies should be understood as metatheories consider the very large proportion of sociological theory that is in the form of metatheory it is discussion about theory about what concepts it should include about how those concepts should be linked and about how theory should be studied similar to kuhns paradigms theories of this sort provide guidelines or strategies for understanding social phenomena and suggest the proper orientation of the theorist to these phenomena they are orienting strategies textbooks in theory frequently focus on orienting strategies such as functionalism exchange or ethnomethodology (wagner & berger 1985 p 700)
sociologists thus use metatheories as orienting strategies we may generalize and say that all people use metatheories as orienting strategies and that this is what direct our attention and also our browsing - also when we are not conscious about it
