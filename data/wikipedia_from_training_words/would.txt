== etymology and usageedit ==
the english word world comes from the old english weorold (-uld) weorld worold (-uld -eld) a compound of wer man and eld age, which thus means roughly age of man. the old english is a reflex of the common germanic *wira-aliz also reflected in old saxon werold old high german weralt old frisian warld and old norse verld (whence the icelandic verld)
the corresponding word in latin is mundus literally clean elegant itself a loan translation of greek cosmos orderly arrangement. while the germanic word thus reflects a mythological notion of a domain of man (compare midgard) presumably as opposed to the divine sphere on the one hand and the chthonic sphere of the underworld on the other the greco-latin term expresses a notion of creation as an act of establishing order out of chaos
world distinguishes the entire planet or population from any particular country or region world affairs pertain not just to one place but to the whole world and world history is a field of history that examines events from a global (rather than a national or a regional) perspective earth on the other hand refers to the planet as a physical entity and distinguishes it from other planets and physical objects

world can also be used attributively to mean global relating to the whole world forming usages such as world community or world canonical texts
by extension a world may refer to any planet or heavenly body especially when it is thought of as inhabited especially in the context of science fiction or futurology

schopenhauer
the world as will and representation is the central work of arthur schopenhauer schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation the kantian thing-in-itself he believed therefore that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself something kant said was impossible since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body
wittgenstein
two definitions that were both put forward in the 1920s however suggest the range of available opinion the world is everything that is the case, wrote ludwig wittgenstein in his influential tractatus logico-philosophicus first published in 1922 this definition would serve as the basis of logical positivism with its assumption that there is exactly one world consisting of the totality of facts regardless of the interpretations that individual people may make of them
heidegger
martin heidegger meanwhile argued that the surrounding world is different for each of us and notwithstanding that we move about in a common world the world for heidegger was that into which we are always already thrown and with which we as beings-in-the-world must come to terms his conception of world disclosure was most notably elaborated in his 1927 work being and time

this view is clearly expressed by king alfred the great of england (d 899) in his famous preface to the cura pastoralis
therefore i command you to do as i believe you are willing to do that you free yourself from worldly affairs (old english woruldinga) as often as you can so that wherever you can establish that wisdom that god gave you you establish it consider what punishments befell us in this world when we neither loved wisdom at all ourselves nor transmitted it to other men we had the name alone that we were christians and very few had the practices.

contemptus mundi is the name given to the recognition that the world in all its vanity is nothing more than a futile attempt to hide from god by stifling our desire for the good and the holy this view has been criticized as a pastoral of fear by modern historian jean delumeau
