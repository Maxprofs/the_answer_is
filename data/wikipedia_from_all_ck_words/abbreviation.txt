an abbreviation (from latin brevis meaning short) is a shortened form of a word or phrase it consists of a group of letters taken from the word or phrase for example the word abbreviation can itself be represented by the abbreviation abbr. abbrv or abbrev
in strict analysis abbreviations should not be confused with contractions acronyms or initialisms with which they share some semantic and phonetic functions though all four are connoted by the term abbreviation in loose parlance.an abbreviation is a shortening by any method a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the parts a contraction of a word is made by omitting certain letters or syllables and bringing together the first and last letters or elements an abbreviation may be made by omitting certain portions from the interior or by cutting off a part a contraction is an abbreviation but an abbreviation is not necessarily a contraction acronyms and initialisms are regarded as subsets of abbreviations (e.g by the council of science editors) they are abbreviations that consist of the initial letters or parts of words
== historyedit ==
abbreviations have a long history used so that spelling out a whole word could be avoided this might be done to save time and space and also to provide secrecy shortened words were used and initial letters were commonly used to represent words in specific applications in classical greece and rome the reduction of words to single letters was common in roman inscriptions words were commonly abbreviated by using the initial letter or letters of words and most inscriptions have at least one abbreviation. however some could have more than one meaning depending on their context (for example a can be an abbreviation for many words such as ager amicus annus as aulus aurelius aurum and avus.)
abbreviations in english were frequently used from its earliest days manuscripts of copies of the old english poem beowulf used many abbreviations for example 7 or & for and and y for since so that not much space is wasted the standardisation of english in the 15th through 17th centuries included such a growth in the use of abbreviations at first abbreviations were sometimes represented with various suspension signs not only periods for example sequences like er were replaced with  as in mast for master and exacbate for exacerbate while this may seem trivial it was symptomatic of an attempt by people manually reproducing academic texts to reduce the copy time an example from the oxford university register 1503
mast subwarden y mde me to you and wher y wrot to you the last wyke that y trouyde itt good to differr thelection ov to qudena tinitatis y have be thougt me syn that itt woll be then a bowte mydsom
the early modern english period between the 15th and 17th centuries had abbreviations like ye for e used for the word the hence by later misunderstanding ye olde tea shoppe.
during the growth of philological linguistic theory in academic britain abbreviating became very fashionable the use of abbreviation for the names of j r r tolkien and his friend c s lewis and other members of the oxford literary group known as the inklings are sometimes cited as symptomatic of this likewise a century earlier in boston a fad of abbreviation started that swept the united states with the globally popular term ok generally credited as a remnant of its influence
after world war ii the british greatly reduced the use of the full stop and other punctuation points after abbreviations in at least semi-formal writing while the americans more readily kept such use until more recently and still maintain it more than britons the classic example considered by their american counterparts quite curious was the maintenance of the internal comma in a british organisation of secret agents called the special operations executive""s.o.,e"which is not found in histories written after about 1960
but before that many britons were more scrupulous at maintaining the french form in french the period only follows an abbreviation if the last letter in the abbreviation is not the last letter of its antecedent m. is the abbreviation for monsieur while mme is that for madame like many other cross-channel linguistic acquisitions many britons readily took this up and followed this rule themselves while the americans took a simpler rule and applied it rigorously
over the years however the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two-word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not the u.s media tend to use periods in two-word abbreviations like united states (u.s.) but not personal computer (pc) or television (tv) many british publications have gradually done away with the use of periods in abbreviations
minimization of punctuation in typewritten material became economically desirable in the 1960s and 1970s for the many users of carbon-film ribbons since a period or comma consumed the same length of non-reusable expensive ribbon as did a capital letter
widespread use of electronic communication through mobile phones and the internet during the 1990s allowed for a marked rise in colloquial abbreviation this was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as instant- and text messaging sms for instance supports message lengths of 160 characters at most (using the gsm 03.38 character set) this brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called textese with which 10% or more of the words in a typical sms message are abbreviated more recently twitter a popular social networking service began driving abbreviation use with 140 character message limits
== style conventions in englishedit ==
in modern english there are several conventions for abbreviations and the choice may be confusing the only rule universally accepted is that one should be consistent and to make this easier publishers express their preferences in a style guide questions which arise include those in the following subsections
=== lowercase lettersedit ===
if the original word was capitalized then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital for example lev for leviticus when a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for capitalization however when abbreviating a phrase where only the first letter of each word is taken then all letters should be capitalized as in ytd for year-to-date pcb for printed circuit board and fyi for for your information however see the following section regarding abbreviations that have become common vocabulary these are no longer written with capital letters
=== periods (full stops) and spacesedit ===
a period (full stop) is often used to signify an abbreviation but opinion is divided as to when and if this should happen
according to hart's rules the traditional rule is that abbreviations (in the narrow sense that includes only words with the ending and not the middle dropped) terminate with a full stop whereas contractions (in the sense of words missing a middle part) do not but there are exceptions fowler's modern english usage says full stops are used to mark both abbreviations and contractions but recommends against this practice advising them only for abbreviations and lower-case initialisms and not for upper-case initialisms and contractions
in american english the period is usually included in some cases periods are optional as in either us or u.s for united states eu or e.u for european union and un or u.n for united nations there are some house styles howeveramerican ones includedthat remove the periods from almost all abbreviations for example
the u.s manual on uniform traffic control devices advises that periods should not be used with abbreviations on road signs except for cardinal directions as part of a destination name (for example northwest blvd w jefferson and ped xing all follow this recommendation.)
ama style used in many medical journals uses no periods in abbreviations or acronyms with almost no exceptions thus eg ie vs et al dr mr mri icu and hundreds of others contain no periods the only exceptions are no. (to avoid the appearance of no") initials within persons names (such as george r smith") and st. within persons names when the person prefers it (such as emily r st clair") (but not in city names such as st louis or st paul) (ama style also forgoes italic on terms long since naturalized into english from latin new latin other languages or isv thus no italic for eg ie vs et al in vivo in vitro or in situ.)
acronyms that were originally capitalized (with or without periods) but have since entered the vocabulary as generic words are no longer written with capital letters nor with any periods examples are sonar radar lidar laser snafu and scuba
today spaces are generally not used between single-letter abbreviations of words in the same phrase so one almost never encounters u s.
when an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence only one period is used the capital of the united states is washington d.c
=== plural formsedit ===
there is a question about how to pluralize abbreviations particularly acronyms often a writer will add an s following an apostrophe as in pc's however this style is not preferred by many style guides for instance kate turabian writing about style in academic writings allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters turabian would therefore prefer dvds and urls and ph.d.'s while the modern language association explicitly says do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of an abbreviation also the american psychological association specifically says without an apostrophe
however the 1999 style guide for the new york times states that the addition of an apostrophe is necessary when pluralizing all abbreviations preferring pc's tv's and vcr's
following those who would generally omit the apostrophe to form the plural of runs batted in simply add an s to the end of rbi
rbis
for all other rules see below
to form the plural of an abbreviation a number or a capital letter used as a noun simply add a lowercase s to the end apostrophes following decades and single letters are also common
a group of mps
the roaring 20s
mind your ps and qs
to indicate the plural of the abbreviation or symbol of a unit of measure the same form is used as in the singular
1 lb or 20 lb
1 ft or 16 ft
1 min or 45 min
when an abbreviation contains more than one full point hart's rules recommends putting the s after the final one
ph.d.s
m.phil.s
the d.t.s
however subject to any house style or consistency requirement the same plurals may be rendered less formally as
phds
mphils
the dts (this is the recommended form in the new oxford dictionary for writers and editors.)
according to hart's rules an apostrophe may be used in rare cases where clarity calls for it for example when letters or symbols are referred to as objects
the x's of the equation
dot the i's and cross the t's
however the apostrophe can be dispensed with if the items are set in italics or quotes
the xs of the equation
dot the i's and cross the t's
in latin and continuing to the derivative forms in european languages as well as english single-letter abbreviations had the plural being a doubling of the letter for note-taking most of these deal with writing and publishing a few longer abbreviations use this as well
=== conventions followed by publications and newspapersedit ===
==== united statesedit ====
publications based in the u.s tend to follow the style guides of the chicago manual of style and the associated press the u.s government follows a style guide published by the u.s government printing office the national institute of standards and technology sets the style for abbreviations of units
==== united kingdomedit ====
many british publications follow some of these guidelines in abbreviation
for the sake of convenience many british publications including the bbc and the guardian have completely done away with the use of full stops or periods in all abbreviations these include
social titles like ms or mr (though these would usually not have had full stopssee above) capt prof etc.
two-letter abbreviations for countries ("us not u.s.")
abbreviations beyond three letters (full caps for all except initialisms)
words seldom abbreviated with lower case letters ("pr instead of p.r. or pr")
names ("fw de klerk gb whiteley park js") a notable exception is the economist which writes mr f w de klerk
scientific units (see measurement below)
acronyms are often referred to with only the first letter of the abbreviation capitalized for instance the north atlantic treaty organisation can be abbreviated as nato or nato and severe acute respiratory syndrome as sars or sars (compare with laser which has made the full transition to an english word and is rarely capitalised at all)
initialisms are always written in capitals for example the british broadcasting corporation is abbreviated to bbc never bbc an initialism is similar to acronym but is not pronounced as a word
when abbreviating scientific units no space is added between the number and unit (100mph 100m 10cm 10c) (this is contrary to the si standard see below.)
==== miscellaneous and general rulesedit ====
a doubled letter appears in abbreviations of some welsh names as in welsh the double l is a separate sound ll george for (british prime minister) david lloyd george
some titles such as reverend and honourable are spelt out when preceded by the rather than as rev. or hon. respectively this is true for most british publications and some in the united states
a repeatedly used abbreviation should be spelt out for identification on its first occurrence in a written or spoken passage abbreviations likely to be unfamiliar to many readers should be avoided
== measurement shorthandsymbol or abbreviationedit ==
writers often use shorthand to denote units of measure such shorthand can be an abbreviation such as in for inch or can be a symbol such as km for kilometre
the shorthand in applies to english onlyin afrikaans for example the shorthand dm is used for the equivalent afrikaans word duim since both in and dm are contractions of the same word but in different languages they are abbreviations a symbol on the other hand defined as mark or character taken as the conventional sign of some object or idea or process applies the appropriate shorthand by substitution rather than by contraction since the shorthand for kilometre (quilmetro in portuguese or in greek) is km in both languages and the letter k does not appear in the expansion of either translation km is a symbol as it is a substitution rather than a contraction
in the international system of units (si) manual the word symbol is used consistently to define the shorthand used to represent the various si units of measure the manual also defines the way in which units should be written the principal rules being
the conventions for upper and lower case letters must be observedfor example 1 mw (megawatts) is equal to 1,000,000,000 mw (milliwatts)
no periods should be inserted between lettersfor example m.s (which is an approximation of ms which correctly uses middle dot) is the symbol for metres multiplied by seconds but ms is the symbol for milliseconds
no periods should follow the symbol unless the syntax of the sentence demands otherwise (for example a full stop at the end of a sentence)
the singular and plural versions of the symbol are identicalnot all languages use the letter s to denote a plural
== syllabic abbreviationedit ==
a syllabic abbreviation is an abbreviation formed from (usually) initial syllables of several words such as interpol = international + police it is a variant of the acronym syllabic abbreviations are usually written using lower case sometimes starting with a capital letter and are always pronounced as words rather than letter by letter syllabic abbreviations should be distinguished from portmanteaus which combine two words without necessarily taking whole syllables from each
=== usageedit ===
==== different languagesedit ====
syllabic abbreviations are not widely used in english or french the united states navy however often uses syllabic abbreviations as described below
on the other hand they prevailed in germany under the nazis and in the soviet union for naming the plethora of new bureaucratic organisations for example gestapo stands for geheime staats-polizei or secret state police similarly leninist organisations such as the comintern (communist international) and komsomol (kommunisticheskii soyuz molodyozhi or communist youth union") used russian language syllabic abbreviations this has caused syllabic abbreviations to have negative connotations (as in orwell's newspeak) notwithstanding that such abbreviations were used in germany even before the nazis came to power e.g. schupo for schutzpolizei
syllabic abbreviations were also typical for the german language used in the german democratic republic e.g stasi for staatssicherheit ("state security the secret police) or vopo for volkspolizist ("people's policeman") other uses are in company or product names such as agfa hanuta or haribo
east asian languages whose writing systems use chinese characters form abbreviations similarly by using key chinese characters from a term or phrase for example in japanese the term for the united nations kokusai reng () is often abbreviated to kokuren () (such abbreviations are called ryakugo () in japanese see also japanese abbreviated and contracted words) the syllabic abbreviation is frequently used for universities for instance bid () for bijng dxu ( peking university) and tdai () for tky daigaku ( university of tokyo) the english phrase gung ho originated as a chinese abbreviation
==== organizationsedit ====
partially syllabic abbreviations are preferred by the us navy as it increases readability amidst the large number of initialisms that would otherwise have to fit into the same acronyms hence desron 6 is used (in the full capital form) to mean destroyer squadron 6 while comnavairlant would be commander naval air force (in the) atlantic.
