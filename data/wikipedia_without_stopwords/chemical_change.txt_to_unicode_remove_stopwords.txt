chemical changes occur substance combines another form new substance called synthesis alternatively decomposes two different substances processes called chemical reactions general reversible except chemical reactions reactions produce heat called exothermic reactions others may require heat enable reaction occur called endothermic reactions understanding chemical changes major part science chemistry
chemical reactions occur atoms rearranged reaction accompanied energy change new products generated example chemical change reaction sodium water produce sodium hydroxide hydrogen much energy released hydrogen gas released spontaneously burns air example chemical change end products chemically different substances reaction
typesedit
chemists categorize chemical changes three main classes inorganic chemical changes organic chemical changes biochemical changes
inorganic changesedit
inorganic chemistry describes reactions elements compounds general involve carbon changes typically take place laboratories larger scale heavy industries
typical types change include neutralization mixing acid base resulting water salt oxidization including combustion redox reactions etc
organic changesedit
organic chemistry concerned chemistry carbon elements compound reacts compounds include mineral oil products much output industries manufacturing pharmaceuticals paints detergents cosmetics fuels etc typical examples organic chemical changes include cracking heavy hydrocarbons oil refinery create gasoline crude oil gasoline higher demand heavier hydrocarbons residual fuel oils reactions include methylation condensation reactions polymerisation halogenation etc
biochemical changeedit
biochemistry deals chemistry growth activity living organisms chemistry reactions controlled complex proteins called enzymes moderated limited hormones chemistry always highly complex still fully understood decomposition organic material also within scope biochemistry although case growth activity fungi bacteria microorganisms involved typical types change include process involved photosynthesis process carbon dioxide water changed sugars oxygen plants digestion energy rich materials used organisms grow move krebs cycle liberates energy stored reserves protein synthesis enable organisms grow using processes controlled rna etc
evidence chemical changeedit
following indicate chemical change taken place although evidence conclusive
change odor
change color example silver reddishbrown iron rusts
change temperature energy production exothermic loss endothermic heat
change composition paper turning ash burned
light andor heat given
formation gases often appearing bubbles liquids
formation precipitate insoluble particles
decomposition organic matter example rotting food
change difficult impossible reverse
