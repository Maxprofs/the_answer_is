electric charges attract repel one another force inversely proportional square distance unlike charges attract like ones repel
magnetic poles states polarization individual points attract repel one another similar way always come pairs every north pole yoked south pole
electric current inside wire creates corresponding circular magnetic field outside wire direction clockwise counterclockwise depends direction current wire
current induced loop wire moved towards away magnetic field magnet moved towards away direction current depending movement
