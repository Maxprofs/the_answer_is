real greenhouses
greenhouse effect atmosphere named analogy greenhouses get warmer sunlight explanation given sources warmer temperature actual greenhouse incident solar radiation visible longwavelength ultraviolet shortwavelength infrared range spectrum passes glass roof walls absorbed floor earth contents become warmer reemit energy longerwavelength infrared radiation glass materials used greenhouse walls transmit infrared radiation infrared cannot escape via radiative transfer structure open atmosphere heat also cannot escape via convection temperature inside greenhouse rises greenhouse effect due infraredopaque greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide methane instead glass also affects earth whole convective cooling air escape earth
however significant experiment suggests mechanism atmosphere retains heatthe greenhouse effectis different greenhouse primarily warmed greenhouse effect greenhouse works primarily allowing sunlight warm surfaces inside structure preventing absorbed heat leaving structure convection greenhouse effect heats earth greenhouse gases absorb outgoing radiative energy heating atmosphere emits radiative energy going back towards earth
greenhouse built material passes sunlight usually glass plastic mainly warms sun warms ground contents inside warms air greenhouse air continues heat confined within greenhouse unlike environment outside greenhouse warm air near surface rises mixes cooler air aloft demonstrated opening small window near roof greenhouse temperature drop considerably demonstrated experimentally r w wood greenhouse cover rock salt transparent infra red heats enclosure similarly one glass cover thus greenhouses work primarily preventing convective cooling
