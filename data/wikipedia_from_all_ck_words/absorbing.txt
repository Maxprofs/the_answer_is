in functional analysis and related areas of mathematics an absorbing set in a vector space is a set s which can be inflated to include any element of the vector space alternative terms are radial or absorbent set
== definition ==
given a vector space x over the field f of real or complex numbers a set s is called absorbing if for all there exists a real number r such that
with
== examples ==
in a semi normed vector space the unit ball is absorbing
== properties ==
the finite intersection of absorbing sets is absorbing
