mammalia class animal within phylum chordata mammal classification several iterations since carolus linnaeus initially defined class many earlier ideas completely abandoned linnaeus modern taxonomists among idea bats related birds humans represent group outside living things competing ideas relationships mammal orders persist currently development significantly recent years cladistic thinking led effort ensure taxonomic designations represent monophyletic groups field also seen recent surge interest modification due results molecular phylogenetics
george gaylord simpsons classic principles classification classification mammals simpson original source taxonomy listed simpson laid systematics mammal origins relationships universally taught end th century
since simpsons classification paleontological record recalibrated intervening years seen much debate progress concerning theoretical underpinnings systematization partly new concept cladistics though field work gradually made simpsons classification outdated remained closest thing official classification mammals see list placental mammals list monotremes marsupials detailed information mammal genera species
molecular classification placentals
molecular studies molecular systematists based dna analysis early st century revealed new relationships among mammal families classification systems based molecular studies reveal three major groups lineages placental mammals afrotheria xenarthra boreotheria diverged early common ancestors cretaceous
relationships three lineages contentious three proposed basal different hypotheses
first divergence afrotheria million years ago mya afrotheria proceeded evolve diversify isolation africanarabian continent xenarthra isolated south america diverged boreoeutheria approximately mya boreoeutheria split laurasiatheria euarchontoglires mya groups evolved northern continent laurasia
tens millions years relative isolation africaarabia collided eurasia formation isthmus panama linked south america north america facilitating distribution mammals seen today exception bats murine rodents placental land mammals reached australasia first human settlers arrived approximately years ago
however noted molecular results still controversial mainly reflected morphological data thus accepted many systematists also important note fossil taxa cases cannot included although instances dna recovered prehistoric mammals ground sloth mylodon neanderthal humans homo neanderthalensis fossils generally incorporated morphological analyses
