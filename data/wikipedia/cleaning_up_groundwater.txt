the oxnard plain is a large alluvial coastal plain in southwest ventura county california united states that that covers over 200 square miles (520 km2) and is bounded by the santa monica mountains the santa susana mountains and oak ridge (beyond which lies the conejo valley) to the east the topatopa mountains to the north the santa clara river valley to the northeast and the pacific ocean to the south and west the oxnard plain is home to the cities of oxnard camarillo port hueneme and much of ventura as well as the unincorporated communities of channel islands el rio saticoy and somis which comprise a majority of the western half of the oxnard-thousand oaks-ventura metro area
this alluvial plain has been formed chiefly by the deposition of sediments from calleguas creek and santa clara river before they flow into the pacific ocean the santa clara river is one of the largest river systems along the coast of southern california and only one of two remaining river systems in the region that remain in their natural states and not channelized by concrete the alluvial deposits from these rivers are generally a few hundred feet (30 metres) thick and lie over pleistocene and pliocene sedimentary rocks
the 16.5-mile-long coastline (26.6 km) is among the longest stretches of continuous linear beaches in the state the oxnard plain section of the southern california bight extends from the abrupt transition of the steep rocky shore along the santa monica mountains on the south to the ventura river on the north this coastal area contained a series of marshes salt flats sloughs and lagoons prior to the expansion of agricultural the coastal geography of the beaches and sand dunes has been impacted as the area became the most engineered coastline in the state with three harbors and various rock structures
ventura county is one of the principal agricultural counties in the state and it is a significant component of the economy with a total annual crop value in the county of over $1.8 billion in 2014 the high quality soils adequate water supply favorable climate long growing season and level topography are characteristic of the oxnard plain where the top cash crops are strawberries raspberries nursery stock celery tomatoes lima beans peppers and cut flowers there is strong public sentiment for retaining agricultural production as reflected in the soar (save open space and agricultural resources) initiatives that have been approved by voters
the oxnard plain contains a considerable petroleum reserve with several active oil fields the oxnard oil field east of oxnard the west montalvo oil field along the coast south of the outlet of the santa clara river and the santa clara avenue oil field north of u.s highway 101 near el rio there are also several smaller abandoned oil fields oil facilities are interspersed with agricultural land uses both east and west of oxnard
== history ==
=== prehistory and indigenous peoples ===
human settlement at over 5000 b.c.e has been documented in nearby coastal sites calleguas creek and the santa clara river were populated with many native american villages as evidenced by archeological sites such as the calleguas creek site that was listed on the national register of historic places in 1976 several sites have also been documented at point mugu archeological sites on the plain found mainly along the water courses and shoreline have been disturbed by erosion farming gophers bulldozers and other cultural and natural sources of disturbance
=== mission period ===
after its founding in 1782 chumash people were recruited to move to the mission san buenaventura although the mission was next to the ventura river 10 miles (16 km) upcoast from the santa clara river thousands of acres were needed for grazing herds of livestock the introduction of these animals contributed to the traditional way of life becoming increasingly unstable and unsustainable on the oxnard plain south of the river they also experienced further disruptive contacts through the increasing number of europeans and americans that visited the california coast looking for pelts from fur-bearing animals such as sea otters and trade in hides and tallow beginning in the 1790s the destruction wrought by the livestock and shortages of wild plants that they used for food may have made the missions appear to be the only viable alternative to a disintegrating way of life at its peak in 1816 the mission had over 41,000 animals including 23,400 cattle 12,144 sheep the 4,493 horses constituted one of the largest stables of horses of the california mission sites the chumash culture including political and social relationships between communities trade and inter-village marriage patterns could not be sustained as more and more chumash people abandoned their traditional way of life and entered the mission the severe decrease in the chumash population was in response to a complex set of social economic and demographic factors
=== rancho period ===
the secularization of the mission by the mexican government in june 1836 opened the oxnard plain up to further settlement by europeans most of the arable land was divided up into large ranchos by 1846 many of the spanish and mexican rancho families benefited when the cattle market peaked between 1848 and 1855 due to the california gold rush cattle ranching declined drastically when a drought hit the area in 1863
=== california state period ===
james saviers bought property in rancho colonia in 1862 he was a blacksmith and farmer who grew and sold eucalyptus trees used to protect crops from the seasonal santa ana winds that originated inland and brought strong hot extremely dry winds to the treeless plain settlers gottfried maulhardt and christian borchard along with christian's son john edward and nephew caspar began farming with 30 acres (12 ha) of wheat and barley in 1867 new markets for the grain opened up when a shipping wharf was first constructed in 1871 at hueneme irish immigrant dominick mcgrath arrived in 1874 with his wife and children to begin farming on the plain johnnas diedrich with his bride matilda began a new life of farming in 1882 having come from hanover germany lima beans eventually became the dominant crop but farmers were actively growing trial fields of sugar beets in 1897 new jerusalem was founded in 1875 along the south bank of the santa clara river the community eventually renamed el rio was along the route between ventura and hueneme
=== railroad and sugarbeet factory ===
in 1887 the railroad from los angeles established the montalvo station nearby on the north side of the river in 1898 the montalvo cutoff brought the railroad across the santa clara river at el rio and then due south to where the town of oxnard was being established the oxnard brothers built the american beet sugar company factory on land in the middle portion of the plain that they bought from james saviers he became a judge and an honorary justice of the peace: saviers road was named after him in the new city of oxnard that arose around the factory the railroad continued with tracks heading east out of oxnard and eventually being extended to santa susana in simi valley traffic on the coast railroad line was rerouted through oxnard in 1904 with the completion of the santa susana tunnel as this became the most direct route between los angeles and san francisco
agriculture as an industry as differentiated from family farming began with the access to the railroad network in 1903 this transition in agriculture labor practices found japanese and mexican sugar beet workers and labor contractors united in protest as the growers backed by financiers slashed the wage rate by 50 percent and sought to eliminate independent labor agents the workers formed the japanese mexican labor association to press their concerns while one ethnic group can often be pitted against another to undermine labor solidarity the oxnard strike of 1903 unified them their efforts has brought the industry to a standstill until their demands were met
in 1911 j smeaton chase noted the "prosperous fields of beans and beets" as he descended from the santa monica mountains onto the oxnard plain during his 2,000-mile (3,200 km) horseback journey from mexico to oregon in his book about the journey he describes the "sleepy little coast village of hueneme" as a "ghost of a once flourishing town" due to the establishment of a beet sugar factory the once busy port had drastically declined as passenger and freight traffic shifted to the railroad
=== postwar prosperity ===
although agriculture has long been important to the economy on the oxnard plain the booming growth in the 1960s of the cities located on the plain expanding by building housing and infrastructure over the rich agricultural land several methods were tried to encourage the building in compact connected ways and reduce urban sprawl into the agricultural lands "guidelines for orderly development" were developed by the county of ventura to meet this need this was followed by the establishment of greenbelt agreements between cities a growth control ordinance was adopted by the city of ventura in 1995 "save open-space and agricultural resources" (soar) was the name given to these plans that would limit housing and commercial development on farmland surrounding the cities jean harris and other activists pressured the oxnard city council to present a measure to the voters oxnard camarillo and ventura county soar initiatives were overwhelmingly approved by voters in 1998 under soar the farmland and open space outside each city's urban growth boundary could not be rezoned without voter approval through 2020 the city of ventura soar regulations expire at the end of 2030
ballot initiatives for 2016 have been proposed to extend the growth control ordinance for another 30 years as of 2014 farmland values in california were at historic highs and the agricultural industry was optimistic and even confident about the future pesticide use is an issue in the interface between agriculture and residential areas along with public uses such as schools
while the vast fields of fertile soil were appreciated for the agricultural bounty that could be produced the sand dunes and wetlands along the coast line were considered useless except as places to dispose of solid and liquid waste this at least dates back to 1898 when the beet sugar factory sent the wastewater discharge through a pipe to ormond beach various other areas near the coast were used for dumping trash and oil-waste much of the time with local government encouragement and supervision the halaco engineering co. a metal recycling facility at the ormond beach wetlands deposited process wastes and wastewater from the smelter from 1965 until 2004 on what was allegedly a former open dump operated by the city of oxnard until 1962 the waste pile contains an estimated 112,900 cubic yards (86,300 m3) and the facility has been designated a superfund site other large polluting industries were cited at ormond beach wetlands before environmental concerns highlighted the importance of restoring the area to serve as a dynamic habitat for a wide array of native plants and animals
over the years many communities have attempted to control the santa clara river by establishing dumps along the banks to create levees that would keep the river from flooding adjacent lands during occasional years with heavy winter rains three dump sites about 2 miles (3.2 km) upstream from the mouth of the river came under the control of the ventura regional sanitation district by 1988 they continued to use the sites until they were closed in 1996
water quality at the numerous beaches has been very good with a few exceptions municipal wastewater treatment facilities industrial dischargers and power generating stations are point source dischargers along the coast of the oxnard plain two power generating stations were built in the 1960s to take advantage of the ocean for cooling the oxnard city council tried to prevent a third plant from being built in 2012 after years of legal tussles the 45 megawatts (60,000 hp) mcgrath peaker plant was built by edison next to the existing power plant at mandalay
== geography ==
the coastal geography of the beaches and sand dunes is complicated as this is one of the most engineered coastlines in the state with the port of hueneme channel islands harbor and ventura harbor along with a number of breakwaters jetties and groins prior to the agricultural expansion installation of drainage systems and other disturbances this broad flat coastal area contained a series of marshes salt flats sloughs and lagoons historically calleguas creek flood flows spread across the floodplain and the deposited sediment created the rich agricultural lands of the oxnard plain with year-round agriculture in the floodplain concrete channels and dirt levees have been built to contain the flow this has delivered increased sediment to mugu lagoon
=== groundwater ===
the sustainable groundwater management act signed into california law in 2014 created a framework for sustainable local groundwater management for the first time in california history in response the ventura county board of supervisors passed an emergency ordinance that halted well-drilling in the oxnard plain groundwater levels had been decreasing for three years during the drought
saltwater intrusion from the ocean has occurred in the southern oxnard plain due to the overdraft of groundwater the santa clara irrigating company was formed in 1870 and drew water from the santa clara river using a ditch system to irrigate the grain crops early settlers began pumping soon afterwards to support farming activities with what at first was a more reliable source in the modern era much of the groundwater has been rendered useless for agricultural or potable uses by salt-water intrusion unlike coastal los angeles and orange county ventura county has no barrier in place to prevent the ocean water from intruding into the inland aquifers
calleguas municipal water district
calleguas municipal water district a water wholesaler serves about 75 percent of ventura county's population calleguas ships state water from the delta to oxnard port hueneme and camarillo on the oxnard plain and moorpark thousand oaks simi valley and unincorporated areas in the east county these areas also use groundwater and surface water supplies but these sources have increased in salinity the source of the salts is a combination of agricultural industrial and residential activities in conjunction with salts in the imported water the united water conservation district funded a detailed feasibility study in 2014 and found that the impaired groundwater in the south oxnard plain is suitable for treatment by reverse osmosis at an acceptable recovery range of 72 to 80 percent many local agencies particularly those in the calleguas creek watershed have built or are putting in desalters to treat salty groundwater the treated water can be used for drinking supplies which will make the region less dependent on imported state water the remaining salt concentrate will be sent out to sea through the calleguas regional salinity management project this $220 million pipeline project started in 2003 and will stretch from the ocean the brine line through camarillo and moorpark and possibly into simi valley
united water conservation district
formed in 1950 the united water conservation district battles groundwater overdraft through a combination of aquifer recharge and providing alternative surface water supplies the district owns lake piru and key facilities along the santa clara river that are used to manage groundwater supplies the united water conservation district provides wholesale water delivery through three pipelines to various portions of the oxnard plain one is the oxnard/hueneme system which serves the city of oxnard the port hueneme water agency (city of port hueneme channel islands beach csd) and the naval base ventura county (point mugu and the construction battalion center) a second pipeline serves agricultural uses in the oxnard plain the third system supplies water to the pleasant valley area located between oxnard and camarillo united rates for non-agricultural uses are at least three times more than agricultural users are charged as required by the state water code
the vern freeman diversion dam built by united water in 1991 channels river water to basins designed to replenish the aquifer in the decades before the structure was built earthen dams in the santa clara river were constructed to divert water to farmers and replenished the aquifer the berms would have to be rebuilt whenever winter rains created a flow that breached the berms southern california steelhead were declared endangered in 1997 and the fish ladder on the structure was deemed insufficient the national marine fisheries service rates fixing this a high priority since it is the first structure the steelhead encounter when attempting to migrate from the ocean
oxnard
in 2008 the city started up a desalination plant near the oxnard transit center that treats the brackish groundwater from nearby wells the water supply in the oxnard plain has been expanded by a $71 million advanced water purification facility (awpf) built by the city of oxnard the plant scrubs treated sewage water to super-clean levels that can be used on crops by industrial customers to water landscaping the water can also be injected into the ground from where it can be pumped out months later for use in the drinking supply when the final permits were in place the awpf began providing water to a lake at the river ridge golf course in 2015 water from the lake is used to irrigate the golf course pipelines in place were also ready to begin serving city parks street landscaping and all the landscaping in a large development of 1,800 homes along the santa clara river the water is also provided to industrial customers and farmers near the plant but pipelines needed to reach additional farmers served by the pleasant valley county water district with 15,200-acre-foot a year (18,700,000 m3) will not be finished until 2016 the district is working to be able to temporarily use the brine line to get the water to the farmers as the drought continues
camarillo and santa rosa valley
the city of camarillo imports about 60 percent of its water from the state water project through the calleguas municipal water district and 40 percent is pumped from three wells the camrosa water district serves nearly 30,000 people in camarillo and the santa rosa valley along with agricultural customers the district which covers 31 square miles (80 km2) is headquartered in camarillo
camrosa dedicated round mountain water treatment plant a desalting facility in 2015 it cleans up brackish groundwater and produces 1,000 acre feet (1,200,000 m3) of drinking water a year the facility was the first paying customer for the calleguas regional salinity management project
