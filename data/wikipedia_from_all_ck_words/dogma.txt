dogma is a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true it serves as part of the primary basis of an ideology or belief system and it cannot be changed or discarded without affecting the very system's paradigm or the ideology itself the term can refer to acceptable opinions of philosophers or philosophical schools public decrees religion or issued decisions of political authorities
the term derives from greek that which seems to one opinion or belief and that from (dokeo) to think to suppose to imagine in the first century ce dogma came to signify laws or ordinances adjudged and imposed upon others the plural is either dogmas or dogmata from greek  the term dogmatics is used as a synonym for systematic theology as in karl barth's defining textbook of neo-orthodoxy the 14-volume church dogmatics
== in religionedit ==
dogmata are found in religions such as christianity judaism and islam where they are considered core principles that must be upheld by all believers of that religion as a fundamental element of religion the term dogma is assigned to those theological tenets which are considered to be unanimously agreed upon such that their proposed disputation or revision effectively means that a person no longer accepts the given religion as his or her own or has entered into a period of personal doubt dogma is distinguished from theological opinion regarding those things considered less well-known dogmata may be clarified and elaborated upon but not contradicted in novel teachings (e.g. galatians 1:6-9) rejection of dogma may lead to expulsion from a religious group
=== christianityedit ===
in christianity religious beliefs are defined by the church it is usually based upon scripture or communicated by church authority it is believed that these dogmas will lead human beings towards redemption and thus the path which leads to god
protestants to differing degrees affirm portions of these dogmata and often rely on denomination-specific statements of faith which summarize their chosen dogmata (see e.g. eucharist)
=== catholicismedit ===
for catholicism and eastern and oriental orthodox christianity the dogmata are contained in the nicene creed and the canon laws of two three seven or twenty ecumenical councils (depending on whether one is nestorian oriental orthodox eastern orthodox or roman catholic) these tenets are summarized by st john of damascus in his exact exposition of the orthodox faith which is the third book of his main work titled the fount of knowledge in this book he takes a dual approach in explaining each article of the faith one for christians where he uses quotes from the bible and occasionally from works of other fathers of the church and the second directed both at non-christians (but who nevertheless hold some sort of religious belief) and at atheists for whom he employs aristotelian logic and dialectics
the decisions of fourteen later councils that catholics hold as dogmatic and numerous decrees promulgated by popes exercising papal infallibility (for examples see immaculate conception and assumption of mary) are considered as being a part of the church's sacred body of doctrine
=== islamedit ===
in islam the dogmatic principles are contained in the aqidah
== reversalismedit ==
religious organizations have begun defending their religions stating that since one can not prove a negative then atheists who point out the scientific inadequacies within religions must necessarily be dogmatic the arguments often depend on the presuppositionalist's view that since they believe their idea of god created humans then anything that humans do to counter their religion is dogmatic
== other usageedit ==
as a possible reaction to skepticism dogmatism is a set of beliefs or doctrines that are established as undoubtedly in truth they are regarded as (religious) truths relating closely to the nature of faith
the term dogmatic can be used disparagingly to refer to any belief that is held stubbornly including political and scientific beliefs
a notable use of the term can be found in the central dogma of molecular biology in his autobiography what mad pursuit francis crick wrote about his choice of the word dogma and some of the problems it caused him
i called this idea the central dogma for two reasons i suspect i had already used the obvious word hypothesis in the sequence hypothesis and in addition i wanted to suggest that this new assumption was more central and more powerful  as it turned out the use of the word dogma caused almost more trouble than it was worth many years later jacques monod pointed out to me that i did not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma which is a belief that cannot be doubted i used the word the way i myself thought about it not as most of the world does and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that however plausible had little direct experimental support
similarly horace freeland judson records in the eighth day of creation
my mind was that a dogma was an idea for which there was no reasonable evidence you see?! and crick gave a roar of delight i just didn't know what dogma meant and i could just as well have called it the central hypothesis, or you know which is what i meant to say dogma was just a catch phrase.
