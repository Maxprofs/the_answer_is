anti-fatigue mats are designed to help a person who is working in a standing position for prolonged periods of time most anti-fatigue matting is a combination of an ergonomic pattern and a cushioning underlay the cushioning causes constant subconscious balance checks and micro movements that stimulate blood flow through the legs and lower extremities this results in better circulation and less fatigue the cushioning underlay insulates the feet from the hard surface cold floors vibrations moisture and sound their unique design encourages the user to make continual micro-movements which provides a wealth of health benefits such as minimizing back pain foot pain weariness stress etc anti-fatigue mats are one of the approaches to prevent injuries caused by working in a standing position this type of mat is recommended by occupational safety and health administration the range of common materials for manufacturing anti-fatigue mats includes vinyl wood pvc tubing rubber pvc closed cell foam polypropylene nitrile rubber anti-fatigue mats were initially used in factories and production lines where staff has to stand for the majority of their working shifts
anti-fatigue mats come in various types and materials for industrial or commercial applications for a variety of workplace conditions that exist as well as the variety of workplace designs from individual work benches to large assembly lines or complex manufacturing work stations work place environments can vary from dry areas to wet or extremely oily areas plus specialized industries may need additional properties such as fire retardant matting for welding static dissipative matting for electrostatic discharge (esd) protection anti-microbial for food industry applications
today this type of ergonomic mat is commonly used during trade shows for floor covering in hospitals and clinics during surgeries to cover the floor near surgical tables to minimize surgeons fatigue resulted from continuous standing also these mats are used in housekeeping especially for kitchen floors to alleviate fatigue during cooking

an alternative clean room mat is one made from polymeric material polymeric products are made from a blend of pure polymeric compounds and have a three- to five-year life cycle when a polymeric surface becomes dirty operators can clean it with a sponge and a mop with detergent finally operators can dry the surface with a squeegee this quick cleaning process can be incorporated into the facilitys regular wet-clean cycle
the mats differ by composition
one-piece mats are usually used on the permanent basis one-piece mats can be handcrafted or factory-made the standard shapes of one-piece mat are rectangular square round and elliptic one-piece mats are produced in the huge variety of sizes and colors real and synthetic materials are used for one-piece mats production
linear length mats are manufactured as rolls that can extend 20 meters up to 40 meters for long production lines assembly lines and packing lines mats are manufactured in standard lengths or factory-made to custom sizes
modular mats also well known as interlocking tiles or interlocking floor mats are manufactured using the jigsaw puzzle structure unlike one-piece mat modular mat consists of numerous elements that are easily and seamlessly assembled compared to other types of mats interlocking mat has several sizes depending on the amount of pieces in one kit modular mat is a good solution for non-rectangular areas where standard shape mat is helpless interlocking mat is commonly used on a one-time or temporary basis fitness centres and sport competitions trade shows and conferences a modular mat requires less place for storage and can be easily transported
other uses of the term mats include
a mouse mat is a small flat mat used to provide a flat surface on which a computer mouse can be operated (a mouse employing a ball which is driven by friction and which drives a x and y movement sensors requires a regular flat surface with high enough friction to drive the ball the older optical micetypically those from sun microsystemsrequired a mouse mat with a differentially reflecting grid.)
an anti-vibration mat is a mat which performs the function of isolating vibration between that which is above the mat and that which is below such a mat might typically be used when mounting a heavy machine which vibrates onto a concrete floor in the absence of the anti-vibration mat the machine tend to erode the floor through abrasion contrawise some machines such as the lithography machines used in chip fabs need to be isolated from vibrations in their locale and so are mounted on anti-vibration mats

quality floor mats improve indoor air quality (iaq) and safety in commercial and residential applications studies have shown that most toxic chemicals that end up inside a home are tracked in on people's shoes a well-used door mat can trap and hold dirt and allergens preventing their spread into the rest of the building significantly improving iaq and reducing the need for extensive cleaning additionally many floor mats are resistant to welding sparks and can keep employees from slipping on industrial lubricants or water
floor mats also provide safe surfaces on which to walk preventing slips and falls that cause injury and liability damages anti-slip mats are now required in many areas to ensure maximum protection for both employees and customers specialized anti-slip mats are now available that provide extra resistance to the chemicals and grease that are sometimes found in industrial and food service settings
custom made anti-fatigue mats are also used in work areas where employees are required to stand for long periods of time employers have found that much muscle strain and injury endured by workers is caused by improper flooring conditions non-supportive surfaces cause fatigue and foot back and neck pain due to impaired circulation anti-fatigue mats were shown to improve worker productivity by reducing the nuumber of sick-days and injuries sustained by workers whose mobility would otherwise be restricted
