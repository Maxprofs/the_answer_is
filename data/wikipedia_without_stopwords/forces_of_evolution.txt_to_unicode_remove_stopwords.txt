molecular evolution change sequence composition cellular molecules dna rna proteins across generations field molecular evolution uses principles evolutionary biology population genetics explain patterns changes major topics molecular evolution concern rates impacts single nucleotide changes neutral evolution vs natural selection origins new genes genetic nature complex traits genetic basis speciation evolution development ways evolutionary forces influence genomic phenotypic changes
forces molecular evolution
content structure genome product molecular population genetic forces act upon genome novel genetic variants arise mutation spread maintained populations due genetic drift natural selection
mutation
mutations permanent transmissible changes genetic material dna rna cell virus mutations result errors dna replication cell division exposure radiation chemicals environmental stressors viruses transposable elements mutations occur single nucleotide polymorphisms modify single bases dna sequence types mutations modify larger segments dna cause duplications insertions deletions inversions translocations
organisms display strong bias types mutations occur strong influence gccontent transitions g c common transversions purine pyrimidine less likely alter amino acid sequences proteins
mutations stochastic typically occur randomly across genes mutation rates single nucleotide sites organisms low roughly per site per generation though viruses higher mutation rates order per site per generation among mutations neutral beneficial remain genome unless lost via genetic drift others detrimental eliminated genome natural selection
mutations extremely rare accumulate slowly across generations number mutations appears single generation may vary long time periods appear accumulate regular pace using mutation rate per generation number nucleotide differences two sequences divergence times estimated effectively via molecular clock
recombination
recombination process results genetic exchange chromosomes chromosomal regions recombination counteracts physical linkage adjacent genes thereby reducing genetic hitchhiking resulting independent inheritance genes results efficient selection meaning regions higher recombination harbor fewer detrimental mutations selectively favored variants fewer errors replication repair recombination also generate particular types mutations chromosomes misaligned
gene conversion
gene conversion type recombination product dna repair nucleotide damage corrected using orthologous genomic regions template damaged bases first excised damaged strand aligned undamaged homolog dna synthesis repairs excised region using undamaged strand guide gene conversion often responsible homogenizing sequence duplicate genes long time periods reducing nucleotide divergence
genetic drift
genetic drift change allele frequencies one generation next due stochastic effects random sampling finite populations existing variants effect fitness may increase decrease frequency simply due chance nearly neutral variants whose selection coefficient close threshold value effective population size also affected chance well selection mutation many genomic features ascribed accumulation nearly neutral detrimental mutations result small effective population sizes smaller effective population size larger variety mutations behave neutral due inefficiency selection
selection
selection occurs organisms greater fitness ie greater ability survive reproduce favored subsequent generations thereby increasing instance underlying genetic variants population selection product natural selection artificial selection sexual selection natural selection selective process occurs due fitness organism environment contrast sexual selection product mate choice favor spread genetic variants act counter natural selection increase desirability opposite sex increase mating success artificial selection also known selective breeding imposed outside entity typically humans order increase frequency desired traits
principles population genetics apply similarly types selection though fact may produce distinct effects due clustering genes different functions different parts genome due different properties genes particular functional classes instance sexual selection could likely affect molecular evolution sex chromosomes due clustering sex specific genes xyz w
selection operate gene level expense organismal fitness resulting selective advantage selfish genetic elements spite host cost examples selfish elements include transposable elements meiotic drivers killer x chromosomes selfish mitochondria selfpropagating introns see intragenomic conflict
genome architecture
genome size
genome size influenced amount repetitive dna well number genes organism cvalue paradox refers lack correlation organism complexity genome size explanations socalled paradox twofold first repetitive genetic elements comprise large portions genome many organisms thereby inflating dna content haploid genome secondly number genes necessarily indicative number developmental stages tissue types organism organism developmental stages tissue types may large numbers genes influence nondevelopmental phenotypes inflating gene content relative developmental gene families
neutral explanations genome size suggest population sizes small many mutations become nearly neutral hence small populations repetitive content junk dna accumulate without placing organism competitive disadvantage little evidence suggest genome size strong widespread selection multicellular eukaryotes genome size independent gene content correlates poorly physiological traits many eukaryotes including mammals harbor large amounts repetitive dna
however birds likely experienced strong selection reduced genome size response changing energetic needs flight birds unlike humans produce nucleated red blood cells larger nuclei lead lower levels oxygen transport bird metabolism far higher mammals due largely flight oxygen needs high hence birds small compact genomes repetitive elements indirect evidence suggests nonavian theropod dinosaur ancestors modern birds also reduced genome sizes consistent endothermy high energetic needs running speed many bacteria also experienced selection small genome size time replication energy consumption tightly correlated fitness
repetitive elements
transposable elements selfreplicating selfish genetic elements capable proliferating within host genomes many transposable elements related viruses share several proteins common
dna transposons cut paste transposable elements excise dna move alternate sections genome
nonltr retrotransposons
ltr retrotransposons
helitrons
alu elements comprise xx human genome short nonautonomous repeat sequences
chromosome number organization
number chromosomes organisms genome also necessarily correlate amount dna genome ant myrmecia pilosula single pair chromosomes whereas adderstongue fern ophioglossum reticulatum chromosomes cilliate genomes house gene individual chromosomes resulting genome physically linked reduced linkage creation additional chromosomes effectively increase efficiency selection
changes chromosome number play key role speciation differing chromosome numbers serve barrier reproduction hybrids human chromosome created fusion two chimpanzee chromosomes still contains central telomeres well vestigial second centromere polyploidy especially allopolyploidy occurs often plants also result reproductive incompatibilities parental species agrodiatus blue butterflies diverse chromosome numbers ranging n n additionally one highest rates speciation identified date
gene content distribution
different organisms house different numbers genes within genomes well different patterns distribution genes throughout genome organisms bacteria drosophila arabidopsis particularly compact genomes little repetitive content noncoding dna organisms like mammals maize large amounts repetitive dna long introns substantial spacing different genes content distribution genes within genome influence rate certain types mutations occur influence subsequent evolution different species genes longer introns likely recombine due increased physical distance coding sequence long introns may facilitate ectopic recombination result higher rates new gene formation
organelles
addition nuclear genome endosymbiont organelles contain genetic material typically circular plasmids mitochondrial chloroplast dna varies across taxa membranebound proteins especially electron transport chain constituents often encoded organelle chloroplasts mitochondria maternally inherited species organelles must pass egg rare departure species mussels known inherit mitochondria father son
origins new genes
new genes arise several different genetic mechanisms including gene duplication de novo origination retrotransposition chimeric gene formation recruitment noncoding sequence gene truncation
gene duplication gene sequence copied create redundancy duplicated gene sequences mutate develop new functions specialize new gene performs subset original ancestral functions addition duplicating whole genes sometimes domain part protein duplicated resulting gene elongated version parental gene
retrotransposition creates new genes copying mrna dna inserting genome retrogenes often insert new genomic locations often develop new expression patterns functions
chimeric genes form duplication deletion incomplete retrotransposition combine portions two different coding sequences produce novel gene sequence chimeras often cause regulatory changes shuffle protein domains produce novel adaptive functions
novel genes also arise previously noncoding dna instance levine colleagues reported origin five new genes d melanogaster genome noncoding dna similar de novo origin genes also shown organisms yeast rice humans de novo genes may evolve transcripts already expressed low levels mutation stop codon regular codon frameshift may cause extended protein includes previously noncoding sequence
molecular phylogenetics
molecular systematics product traditional field systematics molecular genetics uses dna rna protein sequences resolve questions systematics ie correct scientific classification taxonomy point view evolutionary biology
molecular systematics made possible availability techniques dna sequencing allow determination exact sequence nucleotides bases either dna rna present still long expensive process sequence entire genome organism done species however quite feasible determine sequence defined area particular chromosome typical molecular systematic analyses require sequencing around base pairs
