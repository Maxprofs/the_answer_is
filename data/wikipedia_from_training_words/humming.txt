joseph jordania suggested that humming could have played an important role in the early human (hominid) evolution as contact calls many social animals produce seemingly haphazard and indistinct sounds (like chicken cluck) when they are going about their everyday business (foraging feeding) these sounds have two functions (1) to let group members know that they are among kin and there is no danger and (2) in case of the appearance of any signs of danger (suspicious sounds movements in a forest) the animal that notices danger first stops moving stops producing sounds remains silent and looks in the direction of the danger sign other animals quickly follow suit and very soon all the group is silent and is scanning the environment for the possible danger charles darwin was the first to notice this phenomenon on the example of the wild horses and the cattle (darwin descent of men 2004:123) joseph jordania suggested that for humans as for many social animals silence can be a sign of danger and that's why gentle humming and musical sounds relax humans (see the use of gentle music in music therapy lullabies)
