asthenia redirects here the tortrix moth genus is considered a junior synonym of epinotia
weakness or asthenia is a symptom of a number of different conditions the causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have true or perceived muscle weakness true muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy it occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders such as myasthenia gravis
== differential diagnosisedit ==
=== true vs perceived weaknessedit ===
true weakness (or neuromuscular) describes a condition where the force exerted by the muscles is less than would be expected for example muscular dystrophy
perceived weakness (or non-neuromuscular) describes a condition where a person feels more effort than normal is required to exert a given amount of force but actual muscle strength is normal for example chronic fatigue syndrome
in some conditions such as myasthenia gravis muscle strength is normal when resting but true weakness occurs after the muscle has been subjected to exercise this is also true for some cases of chronic fatigue syndrome where objective post-exertion muscle weakness with delayed recovery time has been measured and is a feature of some of the published definitions
=== asthenia vs myastheniaedit ===
asthenia (greek  lit lack of strength but also disease) is a medical term referring to a condition in which the body lacks or has lost strength either as a whole or in any of its parts it denotes symptoms of physical weakness and loss of strength general asthenia occurs in many chronic wasting diseases (such as tuberculosis and cancer) sleep disorders or chronic disorders of the heart lungs or kidneys and is probably most marked in diseases of the adrenal gland asthenia may be limited to certain organs or systems of organs as in asthenopia characterized by ready fatiguability asthenia is also a side effect of some medications and treatments such as ritonavir (a protease inhibitor used in hiv treatment) vaccines such as the hpv vaccine gardasil and fentanyl patches (an opioid used to treat pain)
differentiating psychogenic (perceived) asthenia and true asthenia from myasthenia is often difficult and in time apparent psychogenic asthenia accompanying many chronic disorders is seen to progress into a primary weakness
myasthenia (my- from greek meaning muscle + -asthenia meaning weakness") or simply muscle weakness is a lack of muscle strength the causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have either true or perceived muscle weakness true muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy it occurs in neuromuscular diseases such as myasthenia gravis
=== typesedit ===
muscle fatigue can be central neuromuscular or peripheral muscular central muscle fatigue manifests as an overall sense of energy deprivation and peripheral muscle weakness manifests as a local muscle-specific inability to do work neuromuscular fatigue can be either central or peripheral
==== central fatigueedit ====
the central fatigue is generally described in terms of a reduction in the neural drive or nerve-based motor command to working muscles that results in a decline in the force output it has been suggested that the reduced neural drive during exercise may be a protective mechanism to prevent organ failure if the work was continued at the same intensity the exact mechanisms of central fatigue are unknown though there has been a great deal of interest in the role of serotonergic pathways
==== neuromuscular fatigueedit ====
nerves control the contraction of muscles by determining the number sequence and force of muscular contraction when a nerve experiences synaptic fatigue it becomes unable to stimulate the muscle that it innervates most movements require a force far below what a muscle could potentially generate and barring pathology neuromuscular fatigue is seldom an issue
for extremely powerful contractions that are close to the upper limit of a muscle's ability to generate force neuromuscular fatigue can become a limiting factor in untrained individuals in novice strength trainers the muscle's ability to generate force is most strongly limited by nerves ability to sustain a high-frequency signal after an extended period of maximum contraction the nerves signal reduces in frequency and the force generated by the contraction diminishes there is no sensation of pain or discomfort the muscle appears to simply stop listening and gradually cease to move often lengthening as there is insufficient stress on the muscles and tendons there will often be no delayed onset muscle soreness following the workout part of the process of strength training is increasing the nerve's ability to generate sustained high frequency signals which allow a muscle to contract with their greatest force it is this neural training that causes several weeks worth of rapid gains in strength which level off once the nerve is generating maximum contractions and the muscle reaches its physiological limit past this point training effects increase muscular strength through myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic hypertrophy and metabolic fatigue becomes the factor limiting contractile force
==== peripheral muscle fatigueedit ====
peripheral muscle fatigue during physical work is considered an inability for the body to supply sufficient energy or other metabolites to the contracting muscles to meet the increased energy demand this is the most common case of physical fatigueaffecting a national average of 72% of adults in the work force in 2002 this causes contractile dysfunction that manifests in the eventual reduction or lack of ability of a single muscle or local group of muscles to do work the insufficiency of energy i.e sub-optimal aerobic metabolism generally results in the accumulation of lactic acid and other acidic anaerobic metabolic by-products in the muscle causing the stereotypical burning sensation of local muscle fatigue though recent studies have indicated otherwise actually finding that lactic acid is a source of energy
the fundamental difference between the peripheral and central theories of muscle fatigue is that the peripheral model of muscle fatigue assumes failure at one or more sites in the chain that initiates muscle contraction peripheral regulation therefore depends on the localized metabolic chemical conditions of the local muscle affected whereas the central model of muscle fatigue is an integrated mechanism that works to preserve the integrity of the system by initiating muscle fatigue through muscle derecruitment based on collective feedback from the periphery before cellular or organ failure occurs therefore the feedback that is read by this central regulator could include chemical and mechanical as well as cognitive cues the significance of each of these factors will depend on the nature of the fatigue-inducing work that is being performed
though not universally used metabolic fatigue is a common alternative term for peripheral muscle weakness because of the reduction in contractile force due to the direct or indirect effects of the reduction of substrates or accumulation of metabolites within the myocytes this can occur through a simple lack of energy to fuel contraction or through interference with the ability of ca2+ to stimulate actin and myosin to contract
==== lactic acid hypothesisedit ====
it was once believed that lactic acid build-up was the cause of muscle fatigue the assumption was lactic acid had a pickling effect on muscles inhibiting their ability to contract the impact of lactic acid on performance is now uncertain it may assist or hinder muscle fatigue
produced as a by-product of fermentation lactic acid can increase intracellular acidity of muscles this can lower the sensitivity of contractile apparatus to calcium ions (ca2+) but also has the effect of increasing cytoplasmic ca2+ concentration through an inhibition of the chemical pump that actively transports calcium out of the cell this counters inhibiting effects of potassium ions (k+) on muscular action potentials lactic acid also has a negating effect on the chloride ions in the muscles reducing their inhibition of contraction and leaving k+ as the only restricting influence on muscle contractions though the effects of potassium are much less than if there were no lactic acid to remove the chloride ions ultimately it is uncertain if lactic acid reduces fatigue through increased intracellular calcium or increases fatigue through reduced sensitivity of contractile proteins to ca2+
== pathophysiologyedit ==
muscle cells work by detecting a flow of electrical impulses from the brain which signals them to contract through the release of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum fatigue (reduced ability to generate force) may occur due to the nerve or within the muscle cells themselves new research from scientists at columbia university suggests that muscle fatigue is caused by calcium leaking out of the muscle cell this makes less calcium available for the muscle cell in addition the columbia researchers propose that an enzyme activated by this released calcium eats away at muscle fibers
substrates within the muscle generally serve to power muscular contractions they include molecules such as adenosine triphosphate (atp) glycogen and creatine phosphate atp binds to the myosin head and causes the ratchetting that results in contraction according to the sliding filament model creatine phosphate stores energy so atp can be rapidly regenerated within the muscle cells from adenosine diphosphate (adp) and inorganic phosphate ions allowing for sustained powerful contractions that last between 57 seconds glycogen is the intramuscular storage form of glucose used to generate energy quickly once intramuscular creatine stores are exhausted producing lactic acid as a metabolic byproduct contrary to common belief lactic acid accumulation doesn't actually cause the burning sensation we feel when we exhaust our oxygen and oxidative metabolism but in actuality lactic acid in presence of oxygen recycles to produce pyruvate in the liver which is known as the cori cycle
substrates produce metabolic fatigue by being depleted during exercise resulting in a lack of intracellular energy sources to fuel contractions in essence the muscle stops contracting because it lacks the energy to do so
