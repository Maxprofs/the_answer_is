the solar mass (m) is a standard unit of mass in astronomy that is used to indicate the masses of other stars as well as clusters nebulae and galaxies it is equal to the mass of the sun about two nonillion kilograms
m = 7030198855000000000(1.988550.00025)1030 kg
the above mass is about 7005332946000000000332946 times the mass of the earth (m) or 70031048000000000001048 times the mass of jupiter (mj)
because the earth follows an elliptical orbit around the sun its solar mass can be computed from the equation for the orbital period of a small body orbiting a central mass based upon the length of the year the distance from the earth to the sun (an astronomical unit or au) and the gravitational constant (g) the mass of the sun is given by
the value of the gravitational constant was first derived from measurements that were made by henry cavendish in 1798 with a torsion balance the value he obtained differs by only 1% from the modern value the diurnal parallax of the sun was accurately measured during the transits of venus in 1761 and 1769 yielding a value of 69954363323129985839 (9 arcseconds compared to the present 1976 value of 69954263523264102078.794148) if we know the value of the diurnal parallax we can determine the distance to the sun from the geometry of the earth
the first person to estimate the mass of the sun was isaac newton in his work principia he estimated that the ratio of the mass of the earth to the sun was about 1/28 700 later he determined that his value was based upon a faulty value for the solar parallax which he had used to estimate the distance to the sun (1 au) he corrected his estimated ratio to 1/169 282 in the third edition of the principia the current value for the solar parallax is smaller still yielding an estimated mass ratio of 1/332 946
as a unit of measurement the solar mass came into use before the au and the gravitational constant were precisely measured this is because the relative mass of another planet in the solar system or the combined mass of two binary stars can be calculated in units of solar mass directly from the orbital radius and orbital period of the planet or stars using kepler's third law provided that orbital radius is measured in astronomical units and orbital period is measured in years
the mass of the sun has decreased since the time it formed this has occurred through two processes in nearly equal amounts first in the sun's core hydrogen is converted into helium by nuclear fusion in particular the pp chain and this reaction converts some mass into energy in the form of gamma ray photons most of this energy eventually radiates away from the sun second high-energy protons and electrons in the atmosphere of the sun are ejected directly into outer space as a solar wind
the original mass of the sun at the time it reached the main sequence remains uncertain the early sun had much higher mass-loss rates than at present so it may have lost anywhere from 17% of its natal mass over the course of its main-sequence lifetime the sun gains a very small mass through the impact of asteroids and comets however the sun already holds 99.86% of the solar system's total mass so these impacts cannot offset the mass lost by radiation and ejection

it is also frequently useful in general relativity to express mass in units of length or time
m g / c2 1.48 km (half the schwarzschild radius of the sun)
m g / c3 4.93 s
