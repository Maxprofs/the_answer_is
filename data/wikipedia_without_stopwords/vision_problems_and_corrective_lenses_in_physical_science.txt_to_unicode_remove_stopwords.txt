distribution
hawksbill sea turtles wide range found predominantly tropical reefs indian pacific atlantic oceans sea turtle species e imbricata one associated warm tropical waters two major subpopulations acknowledged exist atlantic indopacific subpopulations
atlantic subpopulation
atlantic hawksbill populations range far west gulf mexico far southeast cape good hope south africa live brazilian coast specifically bahia southern florida waters virginia species range extends far north long island sound massachusetts west atlantic frigid waters english channel east species northernmost sighting date
caribbean main nesting beaches lesser antilles barbados guadeloupe tortuguero costa rica yucatan feed waters cuba around mona island near puerto rico among places
indopacific subpopulation
indian ocean hawksbills common sight along east coast africa including seas surrounding madagascar nearby island groups along southern asian coast including persian gulf red sea coasts indian subcontinent southeast asia present across malay archipelago northern australia pacific range limited oceans tropical subtropical regions west extends southwestern tips korean peninsula japanese archipelago northern new zealand
philippines hosts several nesting sites including island boracay punta dumalag davao city small group islands southwest archipelago named turtle islands two species sea turtles nest hawksbill green sea turtle hawaii hawksbills mostly nest main islands oahu maui molokai hawaii australia hawksbills known nest milman island great barrier reef hawksbill sea turtles nest far west cousine island seychelles species legally protected since population showing recovery seychelles inner islands islets aldabra popular feeding grounds immature hawksbills
eastern pacific subpopulation
eastern pacific hawksbills known occur baja peninsula mexico south along coast southern peru nonetheless recently species considered largely extirpated region important remnant nesting foraging sites since discovered mexico el salvador nicaragua ecuador providing new opportunities research conservation contrast traditional roles parts world hawksbills primarily inhabit coral reefs rocky substrate areas eastern pacific hawksbills tend forage nest principally mangrove estuaries present bahia de jiquilisco el salvador gulf fonseca nicaragua el salvador honduras estero padre ramos nicaragua gulf guayaquil ecuador multinational initiatives eastern pacific hawksbill initiative currently pushing efforts research conserve population remains poorly understood
ecology
habitat
adult hawksbill sea turtles primarily found tropical coral reefs usually seen resting caves ledges around reefs throughout day highly migratory species inhabit wide range habitats open ocean lagoons even mangrove swamps estuaries little known habitat preferences early lifestage e imbricata like young sea turtles assumed completely pelagic remaining sea mature
feeding
hawksbill sea turtles mainly feed sponges found coral reefs also feed crustaceans algae fish prey large fish sharks humans hawksbill sea turtles unfortunately endangered mainly due human impact sea turtles mainly stay close shorelines sponge bearing coral reefs found well beaches provide nesting sights
omnivorous sea sponges principal food hawksbill sea turtles sponges constitute diets caribbean however like many spongivores feed select species ignoring many others caribbean populations feed primarily orders astrophorida spirophorida hadromerida class demospongiae aside sponges hawksbills feed algae cnidarians comb jellies jellyfish sea anemones also feed dangerous jellyfishlike hydrozoan portuguese man o war physalia physalis hawksbills close unprotected eyes feed cnidarians man o wars stinging cells cannot penetrate turtles armored heads
hawksbills highly resilient resistant prey sponges eat aaptos aaptos chondrilla nucula tethya actinia spheciospongia vesparium suberites domuncula highly often lethally toxic organisms addition hawksbills choose sponge species significant numbers siliceous spicules ancorina geodia g gibberosa ecionemia placospongia
life history
much known life history hawksbills life history divided three phases namely pelagic phase hatching cm benthic phase immature turtles recruit foraging areas reproductive phase reach sexual maturity pelagic phase possibly lasts yr hawksbills show degree fidelity recruiting benthic phase however movement similar habitats possible
breeding
hawksbills mate biannually secluded lagoons nesting beaches remote islands throughout range mating season atlantic hawksbills usually spans april november indian ocean populations seychelles hawksbill population mate september february mating females drag heavy bodies high onto beach night clear area debris dig nesting hole using rear flippers lay clutches eggs cover sand caribbean florida nests e imbricata normally contain around eggs hourslong process female returns sea
baby turtles usually weighing less g oz hatch night around two months newly emergent hatchlings darkcolored heartshaped carapaces measuring around cm long instinctively crawl sea attracted reflection moon water possibly disrupted light sources street lamps lights emerge cover darkness baby turtles reach water daybreak preyed upon shorebirds shore crabs predators
maturity
hawksbills evidently reach maturity years lifespan unknown like sea turtles hawksbills solitary lives meet mate highly migratory tough carapaces adults predators sharks estuarine crocodiles octopuses species pelagic fish
series biotic abiotic cues individual genetics foraging quantity quality population density may trigger maturation reproductive organs production gametes thus determine sexual maturity like many reptiles marine turtles aggregation highly unlikely reach sexual maturity size thus age age maturity estimated occur years age caribbean hawksbills turtles nesting indopacific region may reach maturity minimum years
evolutionary history
within sea turtles e imbricata several unique anatomical ecological traits primarily spongivorous reptile evolutionary position somewhat unclear molecular analyses support placement eretmochelys within taxonomic tribe carettini includes carnivorous loggerhead ridley sea turtles rather tribe chelonini includes herbivorous green turtle hawksbill probably evolved carnivorous ancestors
etymology taxonomic history
linnaeus originally described hawksbill sea turtle testudo imbricata th edition systema naturae austrian zoologist leopold fitzinger moved genus eretmochelys species temporarily misdescribed eretmochelys imbricata squamata
two subspecies accepted e imbricatas taxon e bissa rppell refers populations reside pacific ocean atlantic population separate subspecies e imbricata linnaeus nominate subspecies atlantic taxon linnaeus type specimen atlantic
fitzinger derived genus name eretmochelys greek roots eretmo chelys corresponding oar turtle respectively name refers turtles oarlike front flippers species name imbricata latin corresponding english term imbricate appropriately describes turtles overlapping posterior scutes pacific hawksbills subspecies name bissa latin double subspecies originally described caretta bissa term referred thenspecies second species genus caretta genus hawksbills much larger relative loggerhead turtle
exploitation humans

conservation
consensus determined sea turtles including e imbricata least threatened species slow growth maturity slow reproductive rates many adult turtles killed humans accidentally deliberately instance due loss nesting pollution coastal development addition human animal encroachment threatens nesting sites small mammals dig eggs us virgin islands mongooses raid hawksbill nests along sea turtles dermochelys coriacea right laid
iucn red list threatened species first listed e imbricata endangered endangered status continued several reassessments upgraded status critically endangered two petitions challenged status endangered species prior claiming turtle along three species several significant stable populations worldwide petitions rejected based analysis data submitted marine turtle specialist group mtsg data given mtsg showed worldwide hawksbill sea turtle population declined three recent generations significant population increase occurred cr status denied however iucn find sufficient data show population likely decrease future
species along entire family cheloniidae listed appendix convention international trade endangered species illegal import export turtle products kill capture harass hawksbill sea turtles
local involvement conservation efforts also increased past years
united states fish wildlife service national marine fisheries service classified hawksbills endangered endangered species act since us government established several recovery plans protecting e imbricata
