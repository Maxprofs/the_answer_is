vascular tissue complex conducting tissue formed one cell type found vascular plants primary components vascular tissue xylem phloem two tissues transport fluid nutrients internally also two meristems associated vascular tissue vascular cambium cork cambium vascular tissues within particular plant together constitute vascular tissue system plant
cells vascular tissue typically long slender since xylem phloem function conduction water minerals nutrients throughout plant surprising form similar pipes individual cells phloem connected endtoend sections pipe might plant grows new vascular tissue differentiates growing tips plant new tissue aligned existing vascular tissue maintaining connection throughout plant vascular tissue plants arranged long discrete strands called vascular bundles bundles include xylem phloem well supporting protective cells stems roots xylem typically lies closer interior stem phloem towards exterior stem stems asteriidae dicots may phloem located inwardly xylem well
xylem phloem meristem called vascular cambium tissue divides cells become additional xylem phloem growth increases girth plant rather length long vascular cambium continues produce new cells plant continue grow stout trees plants develop wood vascular cambium allows expansion vascular tissue produces woody growth growth ruptures epidermis stem woody plants also cork cambium develops among phloem cork cambium gives rise thickened cork cells protect surface plant reduce water loss production wood production cork forms secondary growth
leaves vascular bundles located among spongy mesophyll xylem oriented toward adaxial surface leaf usually upper side phloem oriented toward abaxial surface leaf aphids typically found underside leaves rather top since phloem transports sugars manufactured plant closer lower surface
