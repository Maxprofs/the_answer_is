generally is a freeware racing game originally developed by brothers hannu and jukka rbin from finland although it features a 3d graphics engine generally has a top-down perspective where you can see all the cars (which is perfect for multiplayer races) its art design calls to mind older arcade racing games such as super sprint and slicks n slide pcgamer in an issue about free pc games described it as a minimalist micro machines
== the game and its system ==
up to six cars (either human or computer-controlled by ai) can race at the same time on a track the game is quite easy to learn because the game physics are quite forgiving if you happen to lose control of the car the game offers three game modes - time trial mode (player attacks best lap of a track option of ghost car is available) race mode (against next 1-5 human or artificial opponents) and championship mode (season of several races) no matter on simple appearance the game offers a basic damage model and even tire wear and fuel consumption causing necessity of pit-stops during the race - rare options in genre of arcade racing games including commercial titles all settings of game are fully customizable (including details like separate adjustable ai level of every single ai opponent or pointing system of held championship)

== elements of the game ==
most of generally is customizable it is not possible to change only the models of in-game objects and the layout of the user interface which causes that the generally is deeply customizable by 3rd-party content this possibility allows to the player to set the game precisely to his needs and interests
=== the cars ===
generally cars are made up of a maximum of 40 polygons therefore it is quite a skill to build them which is done using community built tools most of the cars that you can choose to drive are fully color-customizable which adds a personal touch to the game
=== the tracks ===
the tracks that come with generally are small and simple unlike most current third-party tracks an official track editor lets the user put different objects (e.g trees walls bridges and buildings) around the track and make elevation changes draw the areas with surfaces (asphalt grass mud gravel snow or water) and export and edit land's map into various advanced external graphic editors like photoshop or gimp every month since july 2003 the community sets up track of month where the members of the community vote for the best tracks published over each month the default game itself comes with two basic folders of tracks an [old tracks] set with a variety of creative courses and a [world tour tracks] set with courses based on several countries they are all fictional but some hint at or resemble real-life locations in the recent version of 1.10 an additional track set was released by tuomoh and included in generally
=== other customizable elements ===
==== drivers ====
drivers can be created easily within generally and each can be assigned to be either a computer-controlled driver or a human-controlled driver if human-controlled the commands for accelerate brake left and right can be assigned if computer-controlled a skill level from 0-200 can be chosen with 200 being the most-skilled also each driver can choose primary and secondary colors for themselves both of which are selected using a color mixer of primary and secondary colors (both in rgb scales)
==== fonts ====
various third party fonts for generally are downloadable rather than a ttf file
==== palettes ====
a palette is a file (with the extension .pal") that allows you to change the in-game colors in order to create a specific atmosphere (fog rain autumn night,etc.) or just small changes to the environment (blue kerbs grey wooden planks darker grass,etc.)
== competitions ==
the community of generally has created several types of competitions to solve lack of competing to each other online for all of them is common that racer who is taking a part runs his event alone and not affected by other humans then he submits before set deadline predefined types of files of event to organizer (obviously savegame with full replay of his ride then file of track which he used and finally screenshot of game menu with after-race summary) the organizer then analyzes the files to verify their values (to prevent frauds) creates summary classification of all human drivers merges the submitted replays and release results to public
=== types of events ===
three types of events exist race where a human racer runs together with ai racers - human racer with fastest race time wins in a hotlap event the human racer has to race alone without ai racers and attempts to set the fastest single lap - the racer with fastest lap time wins it's very similar system to game's mod time trial however the term time trial has another sense in competition's terminology it represents a combined version of race and hotlap - a racer runs a ride without ai racers like in hotlap but on distance of several laps trying to set as short summary time as possible like in race
=== classical event ===
the classical generally event allows unlimited tries - racer can choose which of his several tries will be submitted by him then and counted by organizer into the results it eliminates natural accidents failures mistakes and influence of vis maior on racing
=== generally world ranking ===
generally world ranking is classification and statistic of each one driver team or nation who joined one of supported competitions it aims to compare the performances of generally racers according to their performances in various competitions and to the difficulty of these sometimes it's compared with various real ranks like tennis atp since march 2003 every event which fulfills gwr's rules is classified and racers teams and nations taking a part are awarded by number of points according defined scales
