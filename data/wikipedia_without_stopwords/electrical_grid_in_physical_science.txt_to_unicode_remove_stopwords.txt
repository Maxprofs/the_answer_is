many equivalent series resistance esr meters essentially ac milliohmmeters normally used measure esr capacitors used estimate battery internal resistance particularly check state discharge battery rather obtain accurate dc value chargers rechargeable batteries indicate esr
use voltage across terminals disposable battery driving load decreases drops low useful largely due increase internal resistance rather drop voltage equivalent source
rechargeable lithium polymer batteries internal resistance largely independent state charge increases battery ages thus good indicator expected life
