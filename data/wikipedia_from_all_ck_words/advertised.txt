advertising research is key to determining the success of an ad in any country or region the ability to identify which elements and/or moments of an ad contribute to its success is how economies of scale are maximised once one knows what works in an ad that idea or ideas can be imported by any other market market research measures such as flow of attention flow of emotion and branding moments provide insight into what is working in an ad in any country or region because the measures are based on the visual not verbal elements of the ad
=== foreign public messagingedit ===
foreign governments particularly those that own marketable commercial products or services often promote their interests and positions through the advertising of those goods because the target audience is not only largely unaware of the forum as a vehicle for foreign messaging but also willing to receive the message while in a mental state of absorbing information from advertisements during television commercial breaks while reading a periodical or while passing by billboards in public spaces a prime example of this messaging technique is advertising campaigns to promote international travel while advertising foreign destinations and services may stem from the typical goal of increasing revenue by drawing more tourism some travel campaigns carry the additional or alternative intended purpose of promoting good sentiments or improving existing ones among the target audience towards a given nation or region it is common for advertising promoting foreign countries to be produced and distributed by the tourism ministries of those countries so these ads often carry political statements and/or depictions of the foreign government's desired international public perception additionally a wide range of foreign airlines and travel-related services which advertise separately from the destinations themselves are owned by their respective governments examples include though are not limited to the emirates airline (dubai) singapore airlines (singapore) qatar airways (qatar) china airlines (taiwan/republic of china) and air china (people's republic of china) by depicting their destinations airlines and other services in a favorable and pleasant light countries market themselves to populations abroad in a manner that could mitigate prior public impressions
=== diversificationedit ===

=== new technologyedit ===
the ability to record shows on digital video recorders (such as tivo) allow watchers to record the programs for later viewing enabling them to fast forward through commercials additionally as more seasons of pre-recorded box sets are offered for sale of television programs fewer people watch the shows on tv however the fact that these sets are sold means the company will receive additional profits from the these sets

== criticismsedit ==
while advertising can be seen as necessary for economic growth it is not without social costs unsolicited commercial e-mail and other forms of spam have become so prevalent as to have become a major nuisance to users of these services as well as being a financial burden on internet service providers advertising is increasingly invading public spaces such as schools which some critics argue is a form of child exploitation
one of the most controversial criticisms of advertisement in the present day is that of the predominance of advertising of foods high in sugar fat and salt specifically to children critics claim that food advertisements targeting children are exploitive and are not sufficiently balanced with proper nutritional education to help children understand the consequences of their food choices additionally children may not understand that they are being sold something and are therefore more impressionable michelle obama has criticized large food companies for advertising unhealthy foods largely towards children and has requested that food companies either limit their advertising to children or advertise foods that are more in line with dietary guidelines
== regulationedit ==
there have been increasing efforts to protect the public interest by regulating the content and the influence of advertising some examples are the ban on television tobacco advertising imposed in many countries and the total ban of advertising to children under 12 imposed by the swedish government in 1991 though that regulation continues in effect for broadcasts originating within the country the european court of justice ruled that sweden was obliged to accept foreign programming including those from neighboring countries or via satellite greece's regulations are of a similar nature banning advertisements for children's toys between 7 am and 10 pm and a total ban on advertisement for war toys
in europe and elsewhere there is a vigorous debate on whether (or how much) advertising to children should be regulated this debate was exacerbated by a report released by the kaiser family foundation in february 2004 which suggested fast food advertising that targets children was an important factor in the epidemic of childhood obesity in the united states
in new zealand south africa pakistan afghanistan canada and many european countries the advertising industry operates a system of self-regulation advertisers advertising agencies and the media agree on a code of advertising standards that they attempt to uphold the general aim of such codes is to ensure that any advertising is legal decent honest and truthful some self-regulatory organizations are funded by the industry but remain independent with the intent of upholding the standards or codes like the advertising standards authority in the uk
in the uk most forms of outdoor advertising such as the display of billboards is regulated by the uk town and county planning system currently the display of an advertisement without consent from the planning authority is a criminal offense liable to a fine of 2,500 per offence all of the major outdoor billboard companies in the uk have convictions of this nature
in the us many communities believe that many forms of outdoor advertising blight the public realm as long ago as the 1960s in the us there were attempts to ban billboard advertising in the open countryside cities such as so paulo have introduced an outright ban with london also having specific legislation to control unlawful displays
many advertisers employ a wide-variety of linguistic devices to bypass regulatory laws (e.g in france printing english words in bold and french translations in fine print to deal with the article 120 of the 1994 toubon law limiting the use of english) the advertisement of controversial products such as cigarettes and condoms are subject to government regulation in many countries for instance the tobacco industry is required by law in most countries to display warnings cautioning consumers about the health hazards of their products linguistic variation is often used by advertisers as a creative device to reduce the impact of such requirements
== advertising researchedit ==

meanings between consumers and marketers depict signs and symbols that are encoded in everyday objects semiotics is the study of signs and how they are interpreted advertising has many hidden signs and meanings within brand names logos package designs print advertisements and television advertisements semiotics aims to study and interpret the message being conveyed in (for example) advertisements logos and advertisements can be interpreted at two levels - known as the surface level and the underlying level the surface level uses signs creatively to create an image or personality for a product these signs can be images words fonts colors or slogans the underlying level is made up of hidden meanings the combination of images words colors and slogans must be interpreted by the audience or consumer the key to advertising analysis is the signifier and the signified the signifier is the object and the signified is the mental concept a product has a signifier and a signified the signifier is the color brand name logo design and technology the signified has two meanings known as denotative and connotative the denotative meaning is the meaning of the product a television's denotative meaning might be that it is high definition the connotative meaning is the product's deep and hidden meaning a connotative meaning of a television would be that it is top-of-the-line
apple's commercials used a black silhouette of a person that was the age of apple's target market they placed the silhouette in front of a blue screen so that the picture behind the silhouette could be constantly changing however the one thing that stays the same in these ads is that there is music in the background and the silhouette is listening to that music on a white ipod through white headphones through advertising the white color on a set of earphones now signifies that the music device is an ipod the white color signifies almost all of apple's products
the semiotics of gender plays a key influence on the way in which signs are interpreted when considering gender roles in advertising individuals are influenced by three categories certain characteristics of stimuli may enhance or decrease the elaboration of the message (if the product is perceived as feminine or masculine) second the characteristics of individuals can affect attention and elaboration of the message (traditional or non-traditional gender role orientation) lastly situational factors may be important to influence the elaboration of the message
there are two types of marketing communication claims-objective and subjective objective claims stem from the extent to which the claim associates the brand with a tangible product or service feature for instance a camera may have auto-focus features subjective claims convey emotional subjective impressions of intangible aspects of a product or service they are non-physical features of a product or service that cannot be directly perceived as they have no physical reality for instance the brochure has a beautiful design males tend to respond better to objective marketing-communications claims while females tend to respond better to subjective marketing communications claims
voiceovers are commonly used in advertising most voiceovers are done by men with figures of up to 94% having been reported there have been more female voiceovers in recent years but mainly for food household products and feminine-care products
== gender effects in the processing of advertisingedit ==
according to a 1977 study by david statt females process information comprehensively while males process information through heuristic devices such as procedures methods or strategies for solving problems which could have an effect on how they interpret advertising according to this study men prefer to have available and apparent cues to interpret the message where females engage in more creative associative imagery-laced interpretation later research by a danish team found that advertising attempts to persuade men to improve their appearance or performance whereas its approach to women is aimed at transformation toward an impossible ideal of female presentation advertising's manipulation of women's aspiration to these ideal types as they are portrayed in film in erotic art in advertising on stage music video and other media exposures requires at least a conditioned rejection of female reality and thereby takes on a highly ideological cast not everyone agrees one critic viewed this monologic gender-specific interpretation of advertising as excessively skewed and politicized
more recently research by martin (2003) reveals that males and females differ in how they react to advertising depending on their mood at the time of exposure to the ads and the affective tone of the advertising when feeling sad males prefer happy ads to boost their mood in contrast females prefer happy ads when they are feeling happy the television programs in which the ads are embedded are shown to influence a viewer's mood state
