density precisely volumetric mass density substance mass per unit volume symbol often used density lower case greek letter rho although latin letter d also used mathematically density defined mass divided volume
density m mass v volume cases instance united states oil gas industry density loosely defined weight per unit volume although scientifically inaccurate quantity specifically called specific weight
pure substance density numerical value mass concentration different materials usually different densities density may relevant buoyancy purity packaging osmium iridium densest known elements standard conditions temperature pressure certain chemical compounds may denser
simplify comparisons density across different systems units sometimes replaced dimensionless quantity relative density specific gravity ie ratio density material standard material usually water thus relative density less one means substance floats water
density material varies temperature pressure variation typically small solids liquids much greater gases increasing pressure object decreases volume object thus increases density increasing temperature substance exceptions decreases density increasing volume materials heating bottom fluid results convection heat bottom top due decrease density heated fluid causes rise relative dense unheated material
reciprocal density substance occasionally called specific volume term sometimes used thermodynamics density intensive property increasing amount substance increase density rather increases mass
historyedit
wellknown probably apocryphal tale archimedes given task determining whether king hieros goldsmith embezzling gold manufacture golden wreath dedicated gods replacing another cheaper alloy archimedes knew irregularly shaped wreath could crushed cube whose volume could calculated easily compared mass king approve baffled archimedes said taken immersion bath observed rise water upon entering could calculate volume gold wreath displacement water upon discovery leapt bath ran naked streets shouting eureka eureka greek found result term eureka entered common parlance used today indicate moment enlightenment
story first appeared written form vitruvius books architecture two centuries supposedly took place scholars doubted accuracy tale saying among things method would required precise measurements would difficult make time
equation density m v mass density units mass divided volume many units mass volume covering many different magnitudes large number units mass density use si unit kilogram per cubic metre kgm cgs unit gram per cubic centimetre gcm probably commonly used units density kgm equals gcm cubic centimeter alternately called millilitre cc industry larger smaller units mass volume often practical us customary units may used see list common units density
measurement densityedit
homogeneous materialsedit
density points homogeneous object equals total mass divided total volume mass normally measured scale balance volume may measured directly geometry object displacement fluid determine density liquid gas hydrometer dasymeter coriolis flow meter may used respectively similarly hydrostatic weighing uses displacement water due submerged object determine density object
heterogeneous materialsedit
body homogeneous density varies different regions object case density around given location determined calculating density small volume around location limit infinitesimal volume density inhomogeneous object point becomes dmdv dv elementary volume position r mass body expressed
noncompact materialsedit
practice bulk materials sugar sand snow contain voids many materials exist nature flakes pellets granules
voids regions contain something considered material commonly void air could also vacuum liquid solid different gas gaseous mixture
bulk volume materialinclusive void fractionis often obtained simple measurement eg calibrated measuring cup geometrically known dimensions
mass divided bulk volume determines bulk density thing volumetric mass density
determine volumetric mass density one must first discount volume void fraction sometimes determined geometrical reasoning closepacking equal spheres nonvoid fraction also determined empirically bulk materials however sand variable void fraction depends material agitated poured might loose compact less air space depending handling
practice void fraction necessarily air even gaseous case sand could water advantageous measurement void fraction sand saturated wateronce air bubbles thoroughly driven outis potentially consistent dry sand measured air void
case noncompact materials one must also take care determining mass material sample material pressure commonly ambient air pressure earths surface determination mass measured sample weight might need account buoyancy effects due density void constituent depending measurement conducted case dry sand sand much denser air buoyancy effect commonly neglected less one part one thousand
mass change upon displacing one void material another maintaining constant volume used estimate void fraction difference density two voids materials reliably known
changes densityedit
general density changed changing either pressure temperature increasing pressure always increases density material increasing temperature generally decreases density notable exceptions generalization example density water increases melting point c c similar behavior observed silicon low temperatures
effect pressure temperature densities liquids solids small compressibility typical liquid solid bar bar mpa typical thermal expansivity k roughly translates needing around ten thousand times atmospheric pressure reduce volume substance one percent although pressures needed may around thousand times smaller sandy soil clays one percent expansion volume typically requires temperature increase order thousands degrees celsius
contrast density gases strongly affected pressure density ideal gas
m molar mass p pressure r universal gas constant absolute temperature means density ideal gas doubled doubling pressure halving absolute temperature
case volumic thermal expansion constant pressure small intervals temperature temperature dependence density
density reference temperature thermal expansion coefficient material temperatures close
density solutionsedit
