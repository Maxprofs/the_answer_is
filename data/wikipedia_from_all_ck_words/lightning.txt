lightning is a sudden electrostatic discharge during an electrical storm between electrically charged regions of a cloud (called intra-cloud lightning or ic) between that cloud and another cloud (cc lightning) or between a cloud and the ground (cg lightning) the charged regions in the atmosphere temporarily equalize themselves through this discharge referred to as a strike if it hits an object on the ground although lightning is always accompanied by the sound of thunder distant lightning may be seen but be too far away for the thunder to be heard a lightning strike forms a visible plasma
== general considerations ==
on earth the lightning frequency is approximately 4050 times a second or nearly 1.4 billion flashes per year and the average duration is 0.2 seconds made up from a number of much shorter flashes (strokes) of around 30 microseconds
many factors affect the frequency distribution strength and physical properties of a typical lightning flash in a particular region of the world these factors include ground elevation latitude prevailing wind currents relative humidity proximity to warm and cold bodies of water etc to a certain degree the ratio between ic cc and cg lightning may also vary by season in middle latitudes because human beings are terrestrial and most of their possessions are on the earth where lightning can damage or destroy them cg lightning is the most studied and best understood of the three types even though ic and cc are more common types of lightning lightning's relative unpredictability limits a complete explanation of how or why it occurs even after hundreds of years of scientific investigation
a typical cloud to ground lightning flash culminates in the formation of an electrically conducting plasma channel through the air in excess of 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) tall from within the cloud to the ground's surface the actual discharge is the final stage of a very complex process at its peak a typical thunderstorm produces three or more strikes to the earth per minute lightning primarily occurs when warm air is mixed with colder air masses resulting in atmospheric disturbances necessary for polarizing the atmosphere however it can also occur during dust storms forest fires tornadoes volcanic eruptions and even in the cold of winter where the lightning is known as thundersnow hurricanes typically generate some lightning mainly in the rainbands as much as 160 kilometres (99 mi) from the center
the science of lightning is called fulminology and the fear of lightning is called astraphobia
== frequency of lightning ==
lightning is not distributed evenly around the planet as shown in the map
about 70% of lightning occurs over land in the tropics where atmospheric convection is the greatest this occurs from both the mixture of warmer and colder air masses as well as differences in moisture concentrations and it generally happens at the boundaries between them the flow of warm ocean currents past drier land masses such as the gulf stream partially explains the elevated frequency of lightning in the southeast united states because the influence of small or absent land masses in the vast stretches of the world's oceans limits the differences between these variants in the atmosphere lightning is notably less frequent there than over larger landforms the north and south poles are limited in their coverage of thunderstorms and therefore result in areas with the least amount of lightning
in general cloud-to-ground (cg) lightning flashes account for only 25% of all total lightning flashes worldwide since the base of a thunderstorm is usually negatively charged this is where most cg lightning originates this region is typically at the elevation where freezing occurs within the cloud freezing combined with collisions between ice and water appears to be a critical part of the initial charge development and separation process during wind-driven collisions ice crystals tend to develop a positive charge while a heavier slushy mixture of ice and water (called graupel) develops a negative charge updrafts within a storm cloud separate the lighter ice crystals from the heavier graupel causing the top region of the cloud to accumulate a positive space charge while the lower level accumulates a negative space charge
because the concentrated charge within the cloud must exceed the insulating properties of air and this increases proportionally to the distance between the cloud and the ground the proportion of cg strikes (versus cloud-to-cloud (cc) or in-cloud (ic) discharges) becomes greater when the cloud is closer to the ground in the tropics where the freezing level is generally higher in the atmosphere only 10% of lightning flashes are cg at the latitude of norway (around 60 north latitude) where the freezing elevation is lower 50% of lightning is cg
lightning is usually produced by cumulonimbus clouds which have bases that are typically 12 km (0.6-1.25 miles) above the ground and tops up to 15 km (9.3 mi) in height
on earth the place where lightning occurs most often is near the small village of kifuka in the mountains of the eastern democratic republic of the congo where the elevation is around 975 m (3,200 ft) on average this region receives 158 lightning strikes per 1 square kilometer (0.39 sq mi) per year other lightning hotspots include catatumbo in venezuela singapore teresina in northern brazil and lightning alley in central florida
== establishing conditions necessary for lightning ==
in order for an electrostatic discharge to occur two preconditions are necessary (1) a sufficiently high electric potential between two regions of space must exist and (2) a high-resistance medium must obstruct the free unimpeded equalization of the opposite charges
it is well understood that during a thunderstorm there is charge separation and aggregation in certain regions of the cloud however the exact processes by which this occurs are not fully understood
the atmosphere provides the electrical insulation or barrier that prevents free equalization between charged regions of opposite polarity this is overcome by lightning a complex process referred to as the lightning flash
=== establishing the electric field in cg lightning ===
as a thundercloud moves over the surface of the earth an equal electric charge but of opposite polarity is induced on the earth's surface underneath the cloud the induced positive surface charge when measured against a fixed point will be small as the thundercloud approaches increasing as the center of the storm arrives and dropping as the thundercloud passes the referential value of the induced surface charge could be roughly represented as a bell curve
the oppositely charged regions create an electric field within the air between them this electric field varies in relation to the strength of the surface charge on the base of the thundercloud the greater the accumulated charge the higher the electrical field
== lightning flashes and strikes ==
the best studied and understood form of lightning is cloud to ground (cg) although more common intracloud (ic) and cloud to cloud (cc) flashes are very difficult to study given there are no physical points to monitor inside the clouds also given the very low probability lightning will strike the same point repeatedly and consistently scientific inquiry is difficult at best even in the areas of high cg frequency as such knowing flash propagation is similar amongst all forms of lightning the best means to describe the process is through an examination of the most studied form cloud to ground
=== downward leader formation for negative cg lightning ===
in a process not well understood a channel of ionized air called a leader is initiated from a charged region in the thundercloud leaders are electrically conductive channels of partially ionized gas that travel away from a region of dense charge negative leaders propagate away from densely charged regions of negative charge and positive leaders propagate from positively charged regions
the positively and negatively charged leaders proceed in opposite directions positive upwards within the cloud and negative towards the earth both ionic channels proceed in their respective directions in a number of successive spurts each leader pools ions at the leading tips shooting out one or more new leaders momentarily pooling again to concentrate charged ions then shooting out another leader
leaders often split forming branches in a tree-like pattern in addition negative leaders travel in a discontinuous fashion the resulting jerky movement of these stepped leader(s) can be readily observed in slow-motion videos of negative leaders as they head toward ground prior to a negative cg lightning strike the negative leaders continue to propagate and split as they head downward often speeding up as they get closer to the earth's surface
about 90% of ionic channel lengths between pools are approximately 45 m (148 ft) in length the establishment of the ionic channel takes a comparatively long amount of time (hundreds of milliseconds) in comparison to resulting discharge which occurs within a few microseconds the electric current needed to establish the channel measured in the tens or hundreds of amperes is dwarfed by subsequent currents during the actual discharge
initiation of the outward leaders is not well understood the electric field strength within the thundercloud is not typically large enough to initiate this process by itself many hypotheses have been proposed one theory postulates that showers of relativistic electrons are created by cosmic rays and are then accelerated to higher velocities via a process called runaway breakdown as these relativistic electrons collide and ionize neutral air molecules they initiate leader formation another theory invokes locally enhanced electric fields being formed near elongated water droplets or ice crystals percolation theory especially for the case of biased percolation describes random connectivity phenomena which produce an evolution of connected structures similar to that of lightning strikes
=== upward streamers ===
when a stepped leader approaches the ground the presence of opposite charges on the ground enhances the strength of the electric field the electric field is strongest on grounded objects whose tops are closest to the base of the thundercloud such as trees and tall buildings if the electric field is strong enough a positively charged ionic channel called a positive or upward streamer can develop from these points this was first theorized by heinz kasemir
as negatively charged leaders approach increasing the localized electric field strength grounded objects already experiencing corona discharge exceed a threshold and form upward streamers
=== attachment ===
once a downward leader connects to an available upward leader a process referred to as attachment a low-resistance path is formed and discharge may occur photographs have been taken on which unattached streamers are clearly visible the unattached downward leaders are also visible in branched lightning none of which are connected to the earth although it may appear they are
=== discharge ===
==== return stroke ====
once a conductive channel bridges the air gap between the negative charge excess in the cloud and the positive surface charge excess below a massive electrical discharge follows this is the return stroke and it is the most luminous and noticeable part of the lightning discharge
a large electron current flows along the plasma channel from the cloud to the ground neutralising the positive ground charge as electrons flow away from the strike point to the surrounding area this huge surge of current creates large radial voltage differences along the surface of the ground called step potentials they are responsible for more injuries and deaths than the strike itself electricity follows the path of least resistance a portion of the return stroke current will often preferentially flow through one leg and out another electrocuting an unlucky human or animal standing near the point where the lightning strikes
the electric current of the return stroke averages 30 kiloamperes for a typical negative cg flash often referred to as negative cg lightning in some cases a positive ground to cloud (gc) lightning flash may originate from a positively charged region on the ground below a storm these discharges normally originate from the tops of very tall structures such as communications antennas the rate at which the return stroke current travels has been found to be around 1108 m/s
the massive flow of electric current occurring during the return stroke combined with the rate at which it occurs (measured in microseconds) rapidly superheats the completed leader channel forming a highly electrically conductive plasma channel the core temperature of the plasma during the return stroke may exceed 50,000 k causing it to brilliantly radiate with a blue-white color once the electric current stops flowing the channel cools and dissipates over tens or hundreds of milliseconds often disappearing as fragmented patches of glowing gas the nearly instantaneous heating during the return stroke causes the air to explosively expand producing a powerful shock wave that is heard as thunder
==== re-strike ====
high-speed videos (examined frame-by-frame) show that most negative cg lightning flashes are made up of 3 or 4 individual strokes though there may be as many as 30
each re-strike is separated by a relatively large amount of time typically 40 to 50 milliseconds as other charged regions in the cloud are discharged in subsequent strokes re-strikes often cause a noticeable strobe light effect
each successive stroke is preceded by intermediate dart leader strokes that have a faster rise time but lower amplitude than the initial return stroke each subsequent stroke usually re-uses the discharge channel taken by the previous one but the channel may be offset from its previous position as wind displaces the hot channel
==== transient currents during the flash ====
the electric current within a typical negative cg lightning discharge rises very quickly to its peak value in 110 microseconds then decays more slowly over 50200 microseconds the transient nature of the current within a lightning flash results in several phenomena that need to be addressed in the effective protection of ground-based structures rapidly changing currents tend to travel on the surface of a conductor this is called skin effect unlike direct currents flowing through the entire conductor like water through a hose hence conductors used in the protection of facilities tend to be multi-stranded small wires woven together that increases the surface area inversely in proportion to cross-sectional area
the rapidly changing currents also create electromagnetic pulses (emps) that radiate outward from the ionic channel this is a characteristic of all electrical sparks the radiated pulses rapidly weaken as their distance from the origin increases however if they pass over conductive elements for instance electrical wires communication lines or metallic pipes they may induce a current which travels outward to its termination this is the surge that more often than not results in the destruction of delicate electronics electrical appliances or electric motors devices known as surge protectors (spd) or transient voltage surge suppressors (tvss) attached in series with these conductors can detect the lightning flash's transient [irregular] current and through an alteration of its physical properties route the spike to an attached earthing ground thereby protecting the equipment from damage
== types ==
there are three primary types of lightning defined by what is at the ends of a flash channel they are intracloud (ic) which occurs within a single thundercloud unit cloud to cloud (cc) which starts and ends between two different functional thundercloud units and cloud to ground (cg) that primarily originates in the thundercloud and terminates on an earth surface but may also occur in the reverse direction that is ground to cloud there are variations of each type such as positive versus negative cg flashes that have different physical characteristics common to each which can be measured different common names used to describe a particular lightning event may be attributed to the same or different events
=== cloud to ground (cg) ===
cloud-to-ground is the best known and third most common type of lightning it is the best understood of all forms because it allows for scientific study given it terminates on a physical object namely the earth and lends itself to being measured by instruments of the three primary types of lightning it poses the greatest threat to life and property since it terminates or strikes the earth cloud-to-ground (cg) lightning is a lightning discharge between a thundercloud and the ground it is usually negative in polarity and is usually initiated by a stepped leader moving down from the cloud
==== positive and negative lightning ====
cg lightning can occur with both positive and negative polarity the polarity is that of the charge in the region that originated the lightning leaders an average bolt of negative lightning carries an electric current of 30,000 amperes (30 ka) and transfers 15 coulombs of electric charge and 500 megajoules of energy large bolts of lightning can carry up to 120 ka and 350 coulombs
unlike the far more common negative lightning positive lightning originates from the positively charged top of the clouds (generally anvil clouds) rather than the lower portion of the storm leaders form in the anvil of the cumulonimbus and may travel horizontally for several miles before veering towards the ground a positive lightning bolt can strike anywhere within several miles of the anvil of the thunderstorm often in areas experiencing clear or only slightly cloudy skies they are also known as bolts from the blue for this reason positive lightning typically makes up less than 5% of all lightning strikes
because of the much greater distance to ground the positively charged region can develop considerably larger levels of charge and voltages than the negative charge regions in the lower part of the cloud positive lightning bolts are considerably hotter and longer than negative lightning they can develop six to ten times the amount of charge and voltage of a negative bolt and the discharge current may last ten times longer a bolt of positive lightning may carry an electric current of 300 ka and the potential at the top of the cloud may exceed a billion volts about 10 times that of negative lightning during a positive lightning strike huge quantities of extremely low frequency (elf) and very low frequency (vlf) radio waves are generated
as a result of their greater power as well as lack of warning positive lightning strikes are considerably more dangerous at the present time aircraft are not designed to withstand such strikes since their existence was unknown at the time standards were set and the dangers unappreciated until the destruction of a glider in 1999 the standard in force at the time of the crash advisory circular ac 20-53a was replaced by advisory circular ac 20-53b in 2006 however it is unclear whether adequate protection against positive lightning was incorporated
aircraft operating in u.s airspace have been required to be equipped with static discharge wicks although their primary function is to mitigate radio interference due to static buildup through friction with the air in the event of a lightning strike a plane is designed to conduct the excess electricity through its skin and structure to the wicks to be safely discharged back into the atmosphere these measures however may be insufficient for positive lightning
positive lightning has also been shown to trigger the occurrence of upper-atmospheric lightning between the tops of clouds and the ionosphere positive lightning tends to occur more frequently in winter storms as with thundersnow and in the dissipation stage of a thunderstorm
=== cloud to cloud (cc) and intra-cloud (ic) ===
lightning discharges may occur between areas of cloud without contacting the ground when it occurs between two separate clouds it is known as inter-cloud lightning and when it occurs between areas of differing electric potential within a single cloud it is known as intra-cloud lightning intra-cloud lightning is the most frequently occurring type
intra-cloud lightning most commonly occurs between the upper anvil portion and lower reaches of a given thunderstorm this lightning can sometimes be observed at great distances at night as so-called heat lightning in such instances the observer may see only a flash of light without hearing any thunder the heat portion of the term is a folk association between locally experienced warmth and the distant lightning flashes
another term used for cloudcloud or cloudcloudground lightning is anvil crawler due to the habit of charge typically originating beneath or within the anvil and scrambling through the upper cloud layers of a thunderstorm often generating dramatic multiple branch strokes these are usually seen as a thunderstorm passes over the observer or begins to decay the most vivid crawler behavior occurs in well developed thunderstorms that feature extensive rear anvil shearing
=== observational variations ===
ball lightning may be an atmospheric electrical phenomenon the physical nature of which is still controversial the term refers to reports of luminous usually spherical objects which vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter it is sometimes associated with thunderstorms but unlike lightning flashes which last only a fraction of a second ball lightning reportedly lasts many seconds ball lightning has been described by eyewitnesses but rarely recorded by meteorologists scientific data on natural ball lightning is scarce owing to its infrequency and unpredictability the presumption of its existence is based on reported public sightings and has therefore produced somewhat inconsistent findings
bead lightning is the decaying stage of a lightning channel in which the luminosity of the channel breaks up into segments nearly every lightning discharge will exhibit beading as the channel cools immediately after a return stroke sometimes referred to as the lightning's bead-out stage bead lightning is more properly a stage of a normal lightning discharge rather than a type of lightning in itself beading of a lightning channel is usually a small-scale feature and therefore is often only apparent when the observer/camera is close to the lightning
dry lightning is used in australia canada and the united states for lightning that occurs with no precipitation at the surface this type of lightning is the most common natural cause of wildfires pyrocumulus clouds produce lightning for the same reason that it is produced by cumulonimbus clouds
forked lightning is cloud-to-ground lightning that exhibits branching of its path
heat lightning is a lightning flash that appears to produce no discernible thunder because it occurs too far away for the thunder to be heard the sound waves dissipate before they reach the observer
ribbon lightning occurs in thunderstorms with high cross winds and multiple return strokes the wind will blow each successive return stroke slightly to one side of the previous return stroke causing a ribbon effect
rocket lightning is a form of cloud discharge generally horizontal and at cloud base with a luminous channel appearing to advance through the air with visually resolvable speed often intermittently
sheet lightning is cloud-to-cloud lightning that exhibits a diffuse brightening of the surface of a cloud caused by the actual discharge path being hidden or too far away the lightning itself cannot be seen by the spectator so it appears as only a flash or a sheet of light the lightning may be too far away to discern individual flashes
smooth channel lightning are positive cloud to ground lightning strikes where the forward stroke originates from the ground upwards to the cloud the smooth channel is in the lower section of the lightning channel but should branch higher up (not visible as the branching is inside the cloud) large supercells generate tremendous areas of positively charged cloud material (thick anvil) and wind shear prevents excessive negative strokes as with normal thunderstorms downdrafts such as the forward flank downdraft (ffd) bring the positively charged cloud material closer to the ground where such lightning occurs
staccato lightning is a cloud-to-ground lightning (cg) strike which is a short-duration stroke that (often but not always) appears as a single very bright flash and often has considerable branching these are often found in the visual vault area near the mesocyclone of rotating thunderstorms and coincides with intensification of thunderstorm updrafts a similar cloud-to-cloud strike consisting of a brief flash over a small area appearing like a blip also occurs in a similar area of rotating updrafts
superbolts are bolts of lightning around a hundred times brighter than normal on earth one in a million lightning strikes is a superbolt
sympathetic lightning is the tendency of lightning to be loosely coordinated across long distances discharges can appear in clusters when viewed from space
clear-air lightning describes lightning that occurs with no apparent cloud close enough to have produced it in the u.s and canadian rockies a thunderstorm can be in an adjacent valley and not observable from the valley where the lightning bolt strikes either visually or audibly european and asian mountainous areas experience similar events also in areas such as sounds large lakes or open plains when the storm cell is on the near horizon (within 26 kilometres (16 mi)) there may be some distant activity a strike can occur and as the storm is so far away the strike is referred to as a bolt from the blue
== effects ==
=== lightning strike ===
objects struck by lightning experience heat and magnetic forces of great magnitude the heat created by lightning currents traveling through a tree may vaporize its sap causing a steam explosion that bursts the trunk as lightning travels through sandy soil the soil surrounding the plasma channel may melt forming tubular structures called fulgurites even though roughly 90 percent of people struck by lightning survive humans or animals struck by lightning may suffer severe injury due to internal organ and nervous system damage buildings or tall structures hit by lightning may be damaged as the lightning seeks unintended paths to ground by safely conducting a lightning strike to ground a lightning protection system can greatly reduce the probability of severe property damage lightning also oxidizes nitrogen in the air into nitrates which are deposited by rain and can fertilize plant growth
=== thunder ===
because the electrostatic discharge of terrestrial lightning superheats the air to plasma temperatures along the length of the discharge channel in a short duration kinetic theory dictates gaseous molecules undergo a rapid increase in pressure and thus expand outward from the lightning creating a shock wave audible as thunder since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but along the length of the lightning's path the sound origin's varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry of the lightning channel by acoustic echoing from terrain and by the typically multiple-stroke characteristic of the lightning strike
light travels at about 300,000,000 m/s and sound travels through air at about 340 m/s an observer can approximate the distance to the strike by timing the interval between the visible lightning and the audible thunder it generates a lightning flash preceding its thunder by one second would be approximately 350 metres (0.22 mi) in distance a delay of three seconds would indicate a distance of about one kilometer (0.62 mi) (3340 m) a flash preceding thunder by five seconds would indicate a distance of approximately one mile (1.6 km) (5340 m) consequently a lightning strike observed at a very close distance will be accompanied by a sudden clap of thunder with almost no perceptible time lapse possibly accompanied by the smell of ozone (o3)
=== high-energy radiation ===
the production of x-rays by a bolt of lightning was theoretically predicted as early as 1925 but no evidence was found until 2001/2002 when researchers at the new mexico institute of mining and technology detected x-ray emissions from an induced lightning strike along a grounded wire trailed behind a rocket shot into a storm cloud in the same year university of florida and florida tech researchers used an array of electric field and x-ray detectors at a lightning research facility in north florida to confirm that natural lightning makes x-rays in large quantities during the propagation of stepped leaders the cause of the x-ray emissions is still a matter for research as the temperature of lightning is too low to account for the x-rays observed
a number of observations by space-based telescopes have revealed even higher energy gamma ray emissions the so-called terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (tgfs) these observations pose a challenge to current theories of lightning especially with the recent discovery of the clear signatures of antimatter produced in lightning
== volcanic ==
volcanic activity produces lightning-friendly conditions in multiple ways the enormous quantity of pulverized material and gases ejected into the atmosphere with explosive power creates a dense plume of highly charged particles which establishes the perfect conditions for lightning the ash density and constant motion within the volcanic plume continually produces electrostatic ionization resulting in very powerful and very frequent flashes attempting to neutralize itself due to the extensive solid material (ash) content unlike the water rich charge generating zones of a normal thundercloud it is often called a dirty thunderstorm
powerful and frequent flashes have been witnessed in the volcanic plume as far back as the 79 ad eruption of vesuvius by pliny the younger
likewise vapors and ash originating from vents on the volcano's flanks may produce more localized and smaller flashes upwards of 2.9 km long
small short duration sparks recently documented near newly extruded magma attest to the material being highly charged prior to even entering the atmosphere
== extraterrestrial lightning ==
lightning has been observed within the atmospheres of other planets such as venus jupiter and saturn although in the minority on earth superbolts appear to be common on jupiter
lightning on venus has been a controversial subject after decades of study during the soviet venera and u.s pioneer missions of the 1970s and 1980s signals suggesting lightning may be present in the upper atmosphere were detected although the cassinihuygens mission fly-by of venus in 1999 detected no signs of lightning the observation window lasted mere hours radio pulses recorded by the spacecraft venus express (which began orbiting venus in april 2006) have been confirmed as originating from lightning on venus
== human-related phenomena ==
airplane contrails have also been observed to influence lightning to a small degree the water vapor-dense contrails of airplanes may provide a lower resistance pathway through the atmosphere having some influence upon the establishment of an ionic pathway for a lightning flash to follow
rocket exhaust plumes provided a pathway for lightning when it was witnessed striking the apollo 12 rocket shortly after takeoff
thermonuclear explosions by providing extra material for electrical conduction and a very turbulent localized atmosphere have been seen triggering lightning flashes within the mushroom cloud in addition intense gamma radiation from large nuclear explosions may develop intensely charged regions in the surrounding air through compton scattering the intensely charged space charge regions create multiple clear-air lightning discharges shortly after the device detonates
== scientific study ==
=== properties ===
thunder is heard as a rolling gradually dissipating rumble because the sound from different portions of a long stroke arrives at slightly different times
when the local electric field exceeds the dielectric strength of damp air (about 3 million volts per meter) electrical discharge results in a strike often followed by commensurate discharges branching from the same path (see image right.) mechanisms that cause the charges to build up to lightning are still a matter of scientific investigation lightning may be caused by the circulation of warm moisture-filled air through electric fields ice or water particles then accumulate charge as in a van de graaff generator
researchers at the university of florida found that the final one-dimensional speeds of 10 flashes observed were between 1.0105 and 1.4106 m/s with an average of 4.4105 m/s
=== detection and monitoring ===
the earliest detector invented to warn of the approach of a thunder storm was the lightning bell benjamin franklin installed one such device in his house the detector was based on an electrostatic device called the electric chimes invented by andrew gordon in 1742
lightning discharges generate a wide range of electromagnetic radiations including radio-frequency pulses the times at which a pulse from a given lightning discharge arrives at several receivers can be used to locate the source of the discharge the united states federal government has constructed a nationwide grid of such lightning detectors allowing lightning discharges to be tracked in real time throughout the continental u.s
the earth-ionosphere waveguide traps electromagnetic vlf- and elf waves electromagnetic pulses transmitted by lightning strikes propagate within that waveguide the waveguide is dispersive which means that their group velocity depends on frequency the difference of the group time delay of a lightning pulse at adjacent frequencies is proportional to the distance between transmitter and receiver together with direction finding methods this allows to locate lightning strikes up to distances of 10000 km from their origin moreover the eigenfrequencies of the earth-ionospheric waveguide the schumann resonances at about 7.5 hz are used to determine the global thunderstorm activity
in addition to ground-based lightning detection several instruments aboard satellites have been constructed to observe lightning distribution these include the optical transient detector (otd) aboard the orbview-1 satellite launched on april 3 1995 and the subsequent lightning imaging sensor (lis) aboard trmm launched on november 28 1997
=== artificially triggered ===
rocket-triggered lightning can be triggered by launching specially designed rockets trailing spools of wire into thunderstorms the wire unwinds as the rocket ascends creating an elevated ground that can attract descending leaders if a leader attaches the wire provides a low-resistance pathway for a lightning flash to occur the wire is vaporized by the return current flow creating a straight lightning plasma channel in its place this method allows for scientific research of lightning to occur under a more controlled and predictable manner.the international center for lightning research and testing (iclrt) at camp blanding florida typically uses rocket triggered lightning in their research studies
laser-triggered
since the 1970s researchers have attempted to trigger lightning strikes by means of infrared or ultraviolet lasers which create a channel of ionized gas through which the lightning would be conducted to ground such triggering of lightning is intended to protect rocket launching pads electric power facilities and other sensitive targets
in new mexico u.s. scientists tested a new terawatt laser which provoked lightning scientists fired ultra-fast pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to call down electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region the laser beams sent from the laser make channels of ionized molecules known as filaments before the lightning strikes earth the filaments lead electricity through the clouds playing the role of lightning rods researchers generated filaments that lived a period too short to trigger a real lightning strike nevertheless a boost in electrical activity within the clouds was registered according to the french and german scientists who ran the experiment the fast pulses sent from the laser will be able to provoke lightning strikes on demand statistical analysis showed that their laser pulses indeed enhanced the electrical activity in the thundercloud where it was aimedin effect they generated small local discharges located at the position of the plasma channels
=== physical manifestations ===
==== lightning-induced magnetism ====
the movement of electrical charges produces a magnetic field (see electromagnetism) the intense currents of a lightning discharge create a fleeting but very strong magnetic field where the lightning current path passes through rock soil or metal these materials can become permanently magnetized this effect is known as lightning-induced remanent magnetism or lirm these currents follow the least resistive path often horizontally near the surface but sometimes vertically where faults ore bodies or ground water offers a less resistive path one theory suggests that lodestones natural magnets encountered in ancient times were created in this manner
lightning-induced magnetic anomalies can be mapped in the ground and analysis of magnetized materials can confirm lightning was the source of the magnetization and provide an estimate of the peak current of the lightning discharge
=== solar wind and cosmic rays ===
some high energy cosmic rays produced by supernovas as well as solar particles from the solar wind enter the atmosphere and electrify the air creating pathways for lightning bolts
== in culture ==
in many cultures lightning has been viewed as part of a deity or a deity in and of itself these include the greek god zeus the aztec god tlaloc the mayan god k slavic mythology's perun the baltic prkons/perknas thor in norse mythology ukko in finnish mythology the hindu god indra and the shinto god raijin in the traditional religion of the african bantu tribes lightning is a sign of the ire of the gods verses in the jewish religion and in islam also ascribe supernatural importance to lightning in christianity the second coming of jesus is compared to lightning.[matthew 24:27][luke 17:24]
the expression lightning never strikes twice (in the same place) is similar to opportunity never knocks twice in the vein of a once in a lifetime opportunity i.e. something that is generally considered improbable lightning occurs frequently and more so in specific areas since various factors alter the probability of strikes at any given location repeat lightning strikes have a very low probability (but are not impossible) similarly a bolt from the blue refers to something totally unexpected
some political parties use lightning flashes as a symbol of power such as the people's action party in singapore the british union of fascists during the 1930s and the national states rights party in the united states during the 1950s the schutzstaffel the paramilitary wing of the nazi party used the sig rune in their logo which symbolizes lightning the german word blitzkrieg which means lightning war was a major offensive strategy of the german army during world war ii
in french and italian the expression for love at first sight is coup de foudre and colpo di fulmine respectively which literally translated means lightning strike some european languages have a separate word for lightning which strikes the ground (as opposed to lightning in general) often it is a cognate of the english word rays the name of new zealand's most celebrated thoroughbred horse phar lap derives from the shared zhuang and thai word for lightning
the bolt of lightning in heraldry is called a thunderbolt and is shown as a zigzag with non-pointed ends this symbol usually represents power and speed
the lightning bolt is used to represent the instantaneous communication capabilities of electrically powered telegraphs and radios it was a commonly used motif in art deco design especially the zig-zag art deco design of the late 1920s the lightning bolt is a common insignia for military communications units throughout the world a lightning bolt is also the nato symbol for a signal asset
the unicode symbol for lightning is u+2607
