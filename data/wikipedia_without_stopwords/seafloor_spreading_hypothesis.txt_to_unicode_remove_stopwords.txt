seafloor spreading process occurs midocean ridges new oceanic crust formed volcanic activity gradually moves away ridge seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift theory plate tectonics oceanic plates diverge tensional stress causes fractures occur lithosphere basaltic magma rises fractures cools ocean floor form new sea floor older rocks found farther away spreading zone younger rocks found nearer spreading zone
earlier theories eg alfred wegener alexander du toit continental drift continents ploughed sea idea seafloor moves carries continents expands central axis proposed harry hess princeton university theory well accepted phenomenon known caused convection currents plastic weak upper mantle asthenosphere
incipient spreading
general case sea floor spreading starts rift continental land mass similar red seaeast africa rift system today process starts heating base continental crust causes become plastic less dense less dense objects rise relation denser objects area heated becomes broad dome see isostasy crust bows upward fractures occur gradually grow rifts typical rift system consists three rift arms approximately degree angles areas named triple junctions found several places across world today separated margins continents evolve form passive margins hess theory new seafloor formed magma forced upward toward surface midocean ridge
spreading continues past incipient stage described two rift arms open third arm stops opening becomes failed rift two active rifts continue open eventually continental crust attenuated far stretch point basaltic oceanic crust begins form separating continental fragments one rifts opens existing ocean rift system flooded seawater becomes new sea red sea example new arm sea east african rift thought failed arm opening somewhat slowly two arms ethiopian afar geophysical lithospheric experiment reported afar region last september km fissure opened wide eight meters period initial flooding new sea sensitive changes climate eustasy result new sea evaporate partially completely several times elevation rift valley lowered point sea becomes stable period evaporation large evaporite deposits made rift valley later deposits potential become hydrocarbon seals particular interest petroleum geologists
sea floor spreading stop process continues point continent completely severed new ocean basin created red sea yet completely split arabia africa similar feature found side africa broken completely free south america fit area niger delta niger river formed failed rift arm triple junction
continued spreading subduction
new oceanic crust quite hot relative old oceanic crust new oceanic basin shallower older oceanic basins diameter earth remains relatively constant despite production new crust mechanism must exist crust also destroyed destruction oceanic crust occurs subduction zones oceanic crust forced either continental crust oceanic crust today atlantic basin actively spreading midatlantic ridge small portion oceanic crust produced atlantic subducted however plates making pacific ocean experiencing subduction along many boundaries causes volcanic activity termed ring fire pacific ocean pacific also home one worlds active spreading centres east pacific rise epr spreading rates cmyr midatlantic ridge textbook slowspreading centre epr used example fast spreading differences spreading rates affect geometries ridges also geochemistry basalts produced
since new oceanic basins shallower old oceanic basins total capacity worlds ocean basins decreases times active sea floor spreading opening atlantic ocean sea level high western interior seaway formed across north america gulf mexico arctic ocean
