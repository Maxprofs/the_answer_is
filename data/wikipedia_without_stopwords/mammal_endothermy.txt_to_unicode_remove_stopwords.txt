evolution amniotes paleozoic
first fully terrestrial vertebrates amniotes like amphibious tetrapod predecessors lungs limbs amniotes eggs however internal membranes allow developing embryo breathe keep water hence amniotes lay eggs dry land amphibians generally need lay eggs water
first amniotes apparently arose late carboniferous descended earlier reptiliomorph amphibious tetrapods lived land already inhabited insects invertebrates well ferns mosses plants within million years two important amniote lineages became distinct synapsids would later include common ancestor mammals sauropsids would eventually come include turtles lizards snakes crocodilians dinosaurs birds synapsids single hole temporal fenestra low side skull
one synapsid group pelycosaurs included largest fiercest animals early permian
therapsids descended pelycosaurs middle permian million years ago became dominant land vertebrates differ basal eupelycosaurs several features skull jaws including larger temporal fenestrae incisors equal size therapsid lineage leading mammals went series stages beginning animals like pelycosaur ancestors ending probainognathian cynodonts could easily mistaken mammals stages characterized
gradual development bony secondary palate
progress towards erect limb posture would increase animals stamina avoiding carriers constraint process slow erratic example herbivorous nonmammaliaform therapsids retained sprawling limbs late forms may semierect hind limbs permian carnivorous therapsids sprawling forelimbs late permian ones also semisprawling hindlimbs fact modern monotremes still semisprawling limbs
dentary gradually became main bone lower jaw time triassic progressed towards fully mammalian jaw lower consisting dentary middle ear constructed bones previously used construct jaws reptiles
nonmammalian synapsids sometimes called mammallike reptiles
mammals appear
permiantriassic extinction event prolonged event due accumulation several extinction pulses ended dominance carnivores among therapsids early triassic medium large land carnivore niches taken archosaurs extended period time million years came include crocodylomorphs pterosaurs dinosaurs jurassic dinosaurs come dominate large terrestrial herbivore niches well
first mammals kemps sense appeared late triassic epoch million years ago million years first therapsids expanded nocturnal insectivore niche midjurassic onwards castorocauda example adaptations swimming digging catching fish thought remained nocturnal nocturnal bottleneck accounting much typical mammalian traits
majority mammal species existed mesozoic era multituberculates eutriconodonts spalacotheriids
earliest known monotreme teinolophos lived million years ago australia monotremes features may inherited original amniotes
use orifice urinate defecate reproduce monotreme means one hole lizards birds also
lay eggs leathery uncalcified like lizards turtles crocodilians
unlike mammals female monotremes nipples feed young sweating milk patches bellies
earliest known metatherian sinodelphys found millionyearold early cretaceous shale chinas northeastern liaoning province fossil nearly complete includes tufts fur imprints soft tissues
oldest known fossil among eutheria true beasts small shrewlike juramaia sinensis jurassic mother china dated million years ago late jurassic later eutherian eomaia dated million years ago early cretaceous possessed features common marsupials placentals evidence features present last common ancestor two groups later lost placental lineage particular
epipubic bones extend forwards pelvis found modern placental found marsupials monotremes nontherian mammals like multituberculates well ukhaatherium early cretaceous animal eutherian order asioryctitheria apparently ancestral feature subsequently disappeared placental lineage epipubic bones seem function stiffening muscles animals locomotion reducing amount space presented placentals require contain fetus gestation periods
narrow pelvic outlet indicates young small birth therefore pregnancy short modern marsupials suggests placenta later development
rise dominance cenozoic
mammals took medium largesized ecological niches cenozoic cretaceouspaleogene extinction event emptied ecological space filled nonavian dinosaurs groups reptiles absent mammals diversified quickly birds mammals show exponential rise diversity example earliest known bat dates million years ago million years extinction dinosaurs
recent molecular phylogenetic studies suggest placental orders diverged million years ago modern families appeared period late eocene miocene paleontologists object placental fossils found end cretaceous earliest undisputed fossils placentals come early paleocene extinction dinosaurs particular scientists recently identified early paleocene animal named protungulatum donnae one first placental mammals earliest known ancestor primates archicebus achilles around million years ago tiny primate weighed grams ounce could fit within human palm
cenozoic several groups mammals appeared much larger nearest modern equivalents none even close size largest dinosaurs similar feeding habits
earliest appearances features
hadrocodium whose fossils date approximately million years ago early jurassic provides first clear evidence jaw joint formed solely squamosal dentary bones space jaw articular bone involved jaws early synapsids
suggested original function lactation milk production keep eggs moist much argument based monotremes egglaying mammals
earliest clear evidence hair fur fossils castorocauda million years ago middle jurassic suggested foramina passages maxillae premaxillae bones front upper jaw cynodonts channels supplied blood vessels nerves vibrissae whiskers evidence hair fur soon pointed however foramina necessarily show animal vibrissae modern lizard tupinambis foramina almost identical found nonmammalian cynodont thrinaxodon popular sources nevertheless continue attribute whiskers thrinaxodon
evolution erect limbs mammals incomplete living fossil monotremes sprawling limbs parasagittal nonsprawling limb posture appeared sometime early cretaceous latest jurassic found eutherian eomaia metatherian sinodelphys dated million years ago
endothermy first appeared evolution mammals uncertain modern monotremes lower body temperatures variable metabolic rates marsupials placentals evidence ancestors perhaps including ancestors therians may body temperatures like modern therians evidence found far suggests triassic cynodonts fairly high metabolic rates conclusive small animals insulative covering like fur necessary maintenance high stable body temperature
epipubic bones feature strongly influenced reproduction mammal clades first found tritylodontidae suggesting synapomorphy mammaliformes omnipresent nonplacental mammaliformes though megazostrodon erythrotherium appear lacked

reproductive system
mammals viviparous giving birth live young however five species monotreme platypuses echidnas lay eggs monotremes sex determination system different mammals particular sex chromosomes platypus like chicken therian mammal like marsupials mammals monotreme young larval fetuslike presence epipubic bones prevents expansion torso forcing produce small young
mammary glands mammals specialized produce milk liquid used newborns primary source nutrition monotremes branched early mammals nipples seen mammals mammary glands young lick milk mammary patch mothers belly
viviparous mammals subclass theria living today marsupial placental infraclasses marsupial short gestation period typically shorter estrous cycle gives birth undeveloped newborn undergoes development many species takes place within pouchlike sac marsupium located front mothers abdomen plesyomorphic condition among viviparous mammals presence epipubic bones nonplacental mammals prevents expansion torso needed full pregnancy even nonplacental eutherians probably reproduced way
placentals unusual among mammals giving birth complete fully developed young usually long gestation periods
