a cross is a geometrical figure consisting of two lines or bars perpendicular to each other dividing one or two of the lines in half the lines usually run vertically and horizontally if they run obliquely the design is technically termed a saltire although the arms of a saltire need not meet at right angles
the cross is one of the most ancient human symbols and has been used by many religions most notably christianity it may be seen as a division of the world into four elements (chevalier 1997) or cardinal points or alternately as the union of the concepts of divinity the vertical line and the world the horizontal line (koch 1955)
