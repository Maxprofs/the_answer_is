sandpaper or glasspaper are generic names used for a type of coated abrasive that consists of sheets of paper or cloth with abrasive material glued to one face despite the use of the names neither sand nor glass are now used in the manufacture of these products as they have been replaced by other abrasives sandpaper is produced in different grit sizes and is used to remove small amounts of material from surfaces either to make them smoother (for example in painting and wood finishing) to remove a layer of material (such as old paint) or sometimes to make the surface rougher (for example as a preparation for gluing) for the sake of clarity it is common to use the name of the abrasive when describing the paper e.g aluminium oxide paper or in the case of 3m's dark-grey wetordry it is called silicon carbide paper
== historyedit ==
the first recorded use of sandpaper was in 13th-century china when crushed shells seeds and sand were bonded to parchment using natural gum sandpaper was originally known as glass paper as it was coated with particles of glass rather than sand glass frit has sharp-edged particles and cuts well whereas sand grains are smoothed down and do not work well as an abrasive cheap counterfeit sandpaper was often passed off as true glass paper stalker and parker cautioned against it in a treatise of japaning and varnishing published in 1688 glass paper was manufactured in london by 1833 by john oakey whose company had developed new adhesive techniques and processes enabling mass production a process for making sandpaper was patented in the united states on june 14 1834 by isaac fischer jr. of springfield vermont in 1921 3m invented a sandpaper with a waterproof backing known as wet and dry this allowed use with water which would serve as a lubricant to carry away particles that would otherwise clog the grit its first application was automotive paint refinishing
shark skin has also been used as an abrasive and the rough scales of the living fossil coelacanth are used for the same purpose by the natives of comoros boiled and dried the rough horsetail is used in japan as a traditional polishing material finer than sandpaper
== typesedit ==
there are many varieties of sandpaper with variations in the paper or backing the material used for the grit grit size and the bond
=== backingedit ===
in addition to paper backing for sandpaper includes cloth (cotton polyester rayon) pet film and fibre or rubber cloth backing is used for sandpaper discs and belts while mylar is used as backing for extremely fine grits fibre or vulcanized fibre is a strong backing material consisting of many layers of polymer impregnated paper the weight of the backing is usually designated by a letter for paper backings the weight ratings range from a to f, with a designating the lightest and f the heaviest letter nomenclature follows a different system for cloth backings with the weight of the backing rated j x y t and m from lightest to heaviest a flexible backing allows sandpaper to follow irregular contours of a workpiece relatively inflexible backing is optimal for regular rounded or flat surfaces sandpaper backings may be glued to the paper or form a separate support structure for moving sandpaper such as used in sanding belts and discs stronger paper or backing increases the ease of sanding wood the harder the backing material the faster the sanding the faster the wear of the paper and the rougher the sanded surface
=== materialedit ===
materials used for the abrading particles are
flint no longer commonly used
garnet commonly used in woodworking
emery commonly used to abrade or polish metal
aluminium oxide the most common in widest variety of grits lowest unit cost can be used on metal (i.e body shops) or wood
silicon carbide available in very coarse grits all the way through to microgrits common in wet applications
alumina-zirconia (an aluminium oxidezirconium oxide alloy) used for machine grinding applications
chromium(iii) oxide used in extremely fine micron grit (micrometre level) papers
ceramic aluminum oxide used in high pressure applications used in both coated abrasives as well as in bonded abrasives
sandpaper may be stearated where a dry lubricant is loaded to the abrasive stearated papers are useful in sanding coats of finish and paint as the stearate soap prevents clogging and increases the useful life of the sandpaper
the harder the grit material the easier the sanding of surfaces like wood the grit material for polishing granite slab must be harder than granite
=== bondsedit ===
different adhesives are used to bond the abrasive to the paper hide glue is still used but this glue often cannot withstand the heat generated during machine sanding and is not waterproof waterproof or wet/dry sandpapers use a resin bond and a waterproof backing
sandpapers can also be open coat where the particles are separated from each other and the sandpaper is more flexible this helps prevent clogging of the sandpaper wet and dry sandpaper is more effective used wet because clogging is reduced by particles washing away from the grinding surface arguably there are also benefits due to lubrication and cooling
=== shapesedit ===
sandpaper comes in a number of different shapes and sizes
sheet usually 9 by 11 inches but other sizes may be available
belt usually cloth backed comes in different sizes to fit different belt sanders
disk made to fit different models of disc and random orbit sanders may be perforated for some models of sanders attachment includes pressure-sensitive adhesive (psa) and hook-and-loop (similar to velcro)
rolls known as shag rolls by many contractors
sponge for tight places
== grit sizesedit ==
grit size refers to the size of the particles of abrading materials embedded in the sandpaper several different standards have been established for grit size these standards establish not only the average grit size but also the allowable variation from the average the two most common are the united states cami (coated abrasive manufacturers institute now part of the unified abrasives manufacturers association) and the european fepa (federation of european producers of abrasives) p grade the fepa system is the same as the iso 6344 standard other systems used in sandpaper include the japanese industrial standards committee (jis) the micron grade (generally used for very fine grits) the ought system ({0 00 000 } aka {1/0 2/0 3/0 }) was used in the past in the us cheaper sandpapers sometimes use nomenclature such as coarse medium and fine but it is unclear to what standards these names refer
