impurities are substances inside a confined amount of liquid gas or solid which differ from the chemical composition of the material or compound
impurities are either naturally occurring or added during synthesis of a chemical or commercial product during production impurities may be purposely accidentally inevitably or incidentally added into the substance
the level of impurities in a material are generally defined in relative terms standards have been established by various organizations that attempt to define the permitted levels of various impurities in a manufactured product strictly speaking then a material's level of purity can only be stated as being more or less pure than some other material
== destructive impuritiesedit ==
impurities can be destructive when they obstruct the working nature of the material examples include ash and debris in metals and leaf pieces in blank white papers the removal of impurities is usually done chemically for example in the manufacturing of iron calcium carbonate is added to the blast furnace to remove silicon dioxide from the iron ore zone refining is an economically important method for the purification of semiconductors
however some kinds of impurities can be removed by physical means a mixture of water and salt can be separated by distillation with water as the distillate and salt as the solid residue impurities are usually physically removed from liquids and gases removal of sand particles from metal ore is one example with solids
no matter what method is used it is usually impossible to separate an impurity completely from a material the reason that it is impossible to remove impurities completely is of thermodynamic nature and is predicted by the second law of thermodynamics removing impurities completely means reducing the entropy of the system to zero this would require an infinite amount of work and energy as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics what technicians can do is to increase the purity of a material to as near 100% as possible or economically feasible
== impurities and nucleationedit ==
when an impure liquid is cooled to its melting point the liquid undergoing a phase transition crystallizes around the impurities and becomes a crystalline solid if there are no impurities then the liquid is said to be pure and can be supercooled below its melting point without becoming a solid this occurs because the liquid has nothing to condense around so the solid cannot form a natural crystalline solid the solid is eventually formed when dynamic arrest or glass transition occurs but it forms into an amorphous solid a glass instead as there is no long-range order in the structure
impurities play an important role in the nucleation of other phase transitions for example the presence of foreign elements may have important effects on the mechanical and magnetic properties of metal alloys iron atoms in copper cause the renowned kondo effect where the conduction electron spins form a magnetic bound state with the impurity atom magnetic impurities in superconductors can serve as generation sites for vortex defects point defects can nucleate reversed domains in ferromagnets and dramatically affect their coercivity in general impurities are able to serve as initiation points for phase transitions because the energetic cost of creating a finite-size domain of a new phase is lower at a point defect in order for the nucleus of a new phase to be stable it must reach a critical size this threshold size is often lower at an impurity site
