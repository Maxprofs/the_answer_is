the novel is narrated in first person by 44-year-old writer and translator reta winters the book proceeds as a linear series of reflections by reta elliptically coming to the thematic center of the story the seemingly arbitrary decision of reta's college-aged daughter norah to drop out of university and live on the street with a cardboard sign affixed to her chest that reads goodness although the novel does not in any way proceed like a mystery the reasons for norah's departure from the normal world are reta's primary motivation in writing in parallel her relationship with her french mentor (a holocaust survivor and poet) drives much of her narration and view of herself
the novel deals extensively with the role of women and in particular women's literature late in the novel reta starts to break from herself and write in character as a disenfranchised female writer the underlying theme is that the lives of women are underwritten ignored and dealt with as trivial by the literary establishment the novel also functions largely as an investigation into the role of writing in general (independent of gender) reta's grief over her daughter's state makes her very inwardly focussed on the process of writing a reflection of this is shown in the title of the book and the chapter titles unless and the chapter titles ("therefore else instead") are all words that are used to couch the fragmented manner in which life fits together as shields writes a life is full of isolated events but these events if they are to form a coherent narrative require odd pieces of language to link them together little chips of grammar (mostly adverbs or prepositions) that are hard to define [...] words like therefore else other also thereof therefore instead otherwise despite already and not yet.
