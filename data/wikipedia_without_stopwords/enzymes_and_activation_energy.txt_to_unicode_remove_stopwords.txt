abzyme antibody enzyme also called catmab catalytic monoclonal antibody often called catalytic antibody monoclonal antibody catalytic activity abzymes usually raised lab animals immunized synthetic haptans natural abzymes found normal humans antivasoactive intestinal peptide autoantibodies patients autoimmune diseases systemic lupus erythematosus bind hydrolyze dna date abzymes display weak modest catalytic activity proved practical use however subjects considerable academic interest studying yielded important insights reaction mechanisms enzyme structure function catalysis immune system
enzymes function lowering activation energy transition state chemical reaction thereby enabling formation otherwise lessfavorable molecular intermediate reactants products antibody developed bind molecule thats structurally electronically similar transition state given chemical reaction developed antibody bind stabilize transition state like natural enzyme lowering activation energy reaction thus catalyzing reaction raising antibody bind stable transitionstate analog new unique type enzyme produced
far catalytic antibodies produced displayed modest weak catalytic activity reasons low catalytic activity molecules widely discussed possibilities indicate factors beyond binding site may play important particular protein dynamics abzymes engineered use metal ions cofactors improve catalytic activity
history
