a personal or cultural value is an individual's assumptions of ethical value that can form basis for action a value system is a set of consistent values and measures a principle value is a foundation upon which other values and measures of integrity are based
some values are physiologically determined and are normally considered objective such as a desire to avoid physical pain or to seek pleasure other values are considered subjective vary across individuals and cultures and are in many ways aligned with belief and belief systems types of values include ethical/moral values doctrinal/ideological (religious political) values social values and aesthetic values it is debated whether some values that are not clearly physiologically determined such as altruism are intrinsic and whether some such as acquisitiveness should be classified as vices or virtues values have been studied in various disciplines anthropology behavioral economics business ethics corporate governance moral philosophy political sciences social psychology sociology and theology
values can be defined as broad preferences concerning appropriate courses of action or outcomes as such values reflect a person's sense of right and wrong or what ought to be equal rights for all excellence deserves admiration and people should be treated with respect and dignity are representative of values values tend to influence attitudes and behavior
== personal valuesedit ==
personal values provide an internal reference for what is good beneficial important useful beautiful desirable and constructive values generate behaviour and help solve common human problems for survival by comparative rankings of value the results of which provide answers to questions of why people do what they do and in what order they choose to do them
over time the public expression of personal values that groups of people find important in their day-to-day lives lay the foundations of law custom and tradition recent research has thereby stressed the implicit nature of value communication
personal values exist in relation to cultural values either in agreement with or divergence from prevailing norms a culture is a social system that shares a set of common values in which such values permit social expectations and collective understandings of the good beautiful and constructive without normative personal values there would be no cultural reference against which to measure the virtue of individual values and so cultural identity would disintegrate
== cultural valuesedit ==
individual cultures emphasize values which their members broadly share one can often identify the values of a society by noting which people receive honor or respect in the united states of america for example professional athletes at the top levels in some sports receive more honor (measured in terms of monetary payment) than university professors surveys show that voters in the united states would not willingly elect an atheist as president suggesting belief in a god as a generally shared value
values clarification differs from cognitive moral education
value clarification consists of helping people clarify what their lives are for and what is worth working for it encourages students to define their own values and to understand others values.
cognitive moral education builds on the belief that students should learn to value things like democracy and justice as their moral reasoning develops
values relate to the norms of a culture but they are more global and abstract than norms norms provide rules for behavior in specific situations while values identify what should be judged as good or evil while norms are standards patterns rules and guides of expected behavior values are abstract concepts of what is important and worthwhile flying the national flag on a holiday is a norm but it reflects the value of patriotism wearing dark clothing and appearing solemn are normative behaviors to manifest respect at a funeral different cultures reflect values differently and to different levels of emphasis over the last three decades traditional-age college students have shown an increased interest in personal well-being and a decreased interest in the welfare of others. values seemed to have changed affecting the beliefs and attitudes of the students
members take part in a culture even if each member's personal values do not entirely agree with some of the normative values sanctioned in that culture this reflects an individual's ability to synthesize and extract aspects valuable to them from the multiple subcultures they belong to
if a group member expresses a value that seriously conflicts with the group's norms the group's authority may carry out various ways of encouraging conformity or stigmatizing the non-conforming behavior of that member for example imprisonment can result from conflict with social norms that the state has established as law
furthermore institutions in the global economy can genuinely respect values which are of three kinds based on a triangle of coherence in the first instance a value may come to expression within the world trade organization (wto) as well as (in the second instance) within the united nations - particularly in the educational scientific and cultural organization (unesco) - providing a framework for global legitimacy through accountability in the third instance the expertise of member-driven international organizations and civil society depends on the incorporation of flexibility in the rules to preserve the expression of identity in a globalized world
nonetheless in warlike economic competition differing views may contradict each other particularly in the field of culture thus audiences in europe may regard a movie as an artistic creation and grant it benefits from special treatment while audiences in the united states may see it as mere entertainment whatever its artistic merits eu policies based on the notion of cultural exception can become juxtaposed with the policy of cultural specificity on the liberal anglo-saxon side indeed international law traditionally treats films as property and the content of television programs as a service consequently cultural interventionist policies can find themselves opposed to the anglo-saxon liberal position causing failures in international negotiations
== transmissionedit ==
values are generally received through cultural means especially transmission from parents to children parents in different cultures have different values for example parents in a huntergatherer society or surviving through subsistence agriculture value practical survival skills from a young age many such cultures begin teaching babies to use sharp tools including knives before their first birthdays italian parents value social and emotional abilities and having an even temperament spanish parents want their children to be sociable swedish parents value security and happiness dutch parents value independence long attention spans and predictable schedules american parents are unusual for strongly valuing intellectual ability especially in a narrow book learning sense the kipsigis people of kenya value children who are not only smart but who employ that intelligence in a responsible and helpful way which they call ng'om luos of kenya value education and pride which they call nyadhi
