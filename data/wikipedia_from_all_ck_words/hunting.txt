hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal or pursuing it with the intent of doing so hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food recreation or trade in present-day use lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching which is the illegal killing trapping or capture of the hunted species the species that are hunted are referred to as game and are usually mammals and birds
hunting can also be a means of pest control hunting advocates state that hunting can be a necessary component of modern wildlife management for example to help maintain a population of healthy animals within an environment's ecological carrying capacity when natural checks such as predators are absent however hunting has also heavily contributed to the endangerment extirpation and extinction of many animals
the pursuit capture and release or capture for food of fish is called fishing which is not commonly categorised as a form of hunting it is also not considered hunting to pursue animals without intent to kill them as in wildlife photography or birdwatching the practice of foraging or gathering materials from plants and mushrooms is also considered separate
skillful tracking and acquisition of an elusive target has caused the word hunt to be used in the vernacular as a metaphor as in treasure hunting bargain hunting and even hunting down corruption and waste
== history ==
=== paleolithic ===
hunting has a long history and may well pre-date the rise of the species homo sapiens while our earliest hominid ancestors were probably frugivores or omnivores there is evidence that earlier homo species and possibly also australopithecine species utilised larger animals for subsistence evidence from western kenya suggests that hunting has been occurring for more than two million years
furthermore evidence exists that hunting may have been one of the multiple environmental factors leading to extinctions of the holocene megafauna and their replacement by smaller herbivores north american megafauna extinction was coincidental with the younger dryas impact event possibly making hunting a less critical factor in prehistoric species loss than had been previously thought however in other locations such as australia humans are thought to have played a very significant role in the extinction of the australian megafauna that was widespread prior to human occupation
the closest surviving relatives of the human species are the two species of pan the common chimpanzee (pan troglodytes) and bonobos (pan paniscus) common chimpanzees have an omnivorous diet that includes troop hunting behaviour based on beta males being led by an alpha male bonobos have also been observed to occasionally engage in group hunting but eat a mostly frugivorous diet
while it is undisputed that early humans were hunters the importance of this for the emergence of the homo genus from the earlier australopithecines including the production of stone tools and eventually the control of fire are emphasised in the hunting hypothesis and de-emphasised in scenarios that stress omnivory and social interaction including mating behaviour as essential in the emergence of human behavioural modernity with the establishment of language culture and religion hunting became a theme of stories and myths as well as rituals such as dance and animal sacrifice
hunting was a crucial component of hunter-gatherer societies before the domestication of livestock and the dawn of agriculture beginning about 11,000 years ago by the mesolithic hunting strategies had diversified with the development of the bow 18,000 years ago and the domestication of the dog about 15,000 years ago there is fossil evidence for spear use in asian hunting dating from approximately 16,200 years ago
many species of animals have been hunted throughout history it has been suggested that in north america and eurasia caribou and wild reindeer may well be the species of single greatest importance in the entire anthropological literature on hunting (see also reindeer age) although the varying importance of different species would depend on the geographic location
hunter-gathering lifestyles remained prevalent in some parts of the new world sub-saharan africa and siberia as well as all of australia until the european age of discovery they still persist in some tribal societies albeit in rapid decline peoples that preserved paleolithic hunting-gathering until the recent past include some indigenous peoples of the amazonas (ach) some central and southern african (san people) some peoples of new guinea (fayu) the mlabri of thailand and laos the vedda people of sri lanka and a handful of uncontacted peoples in africa the only remaining full-time hunter-gatherers are the hadza of tanzania
==== criticism ====
archaeologist louis binford criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters on the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly scavengers not hunters and this idea is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists robert blumenschine proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging which involves challenging and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early humans
=== antiquity ===
even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply the supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein bone for implements sinew for cordage fur feathers rawhide and leather used in clothing man's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks spears the atlatl and bows and arrows hunting is still vital in marginal climates especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture for example inuit people in the arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks clothing and footwear
on ancient reliefs especially from mesopotamia kings are often depicted as hunters of big game such as lions and are often portrayed hunting from a war chariot the cultural and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as the horned god cernunnos and lunar goddesses of classical antiquity the greek artemis or roman diana taboos are often related to hunting and mythological association of prey species with a divinity could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a reserve surrounding a temple euripides tale of artemis and actaeon for example may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting
with the domestication of the dog birds of prey and the ferret various forms of animal-aided hunting developed including venery (scent hound hunting such as fox hunting) coursing (sight hound hunting) falconry and ferreting while these are all associated with medieval hunting over time various dog breeds were selected for very precise tasks during the hunt reflected in such names as pointer and setter
=== pastoral and agricultural societies ===
even as agriculture and animal husbandry became more prevalent hunting often remained as a part of human culture where the environment and social conditions allowed hunter-gatherer societies persisted even when increasingly confined to marginal areas and within agricultural systems hunting served to kill animals that prey upon domestic and wild animals or to attempt to extirpate animals seen by humans as competition for resources such as water or forage
when hunting moved from a subsistence activity to a social one two trends emerged
the development of the role of the specialist hunter with special training and equipment
the co-option of hunting as a sport for those of an upper social class
the meaning of the word game in middle english evolved to include an animal which is hunted as game became more of a luxury than a necessity the stylised pursuit of it also became a luxury dangerous hunting such as for lions or wild boars often done on horseback or from a chariot had a function similar to tournaments and manly sports hunting ranked as an honourable somewhat competitive pastime to help the aristocracy practice skills of war in times of peace
in most parts of medieval europe the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs often provided via professional huntsmen but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy the importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the robin hood legends in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they hunt the king's deer in contrast settlers in anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all
in medieval europe hunting was considered by johannes scotus eriugena to be part of the set of seven mechanical arts
=== use of dogs ===
although various animals have been used to aid the hunter such as ferrets none has been as important as the dog the domestication of the dog has led to a symbiotic relationship in which the dog's independence from man is deferred though dogs can survive independently of man and in many cases do where hunger is not a primary factor the species tends to defer to human control in exchange for habitation food and support
dogs today are used to find chase retrieve and sometimes to kill the game hunting dogs allow humans to pursue and kill prey that would otherwise be very difficult or dangerous to hunt different breeds of dogs are used for different types of hunting waterfowl are commonly hunted using retrieving dogs such as the labrador retriever the golden retriever the chesapeake bay retriever the brittany spaniel and other similar breeds
the hunting of wild mammals in england and wales with dogs was banned under the hunting act 2004 the wild mammals include fox hare deer and mink hunting with dogs is permissible however where it has been carried out in accordance with one of the exceptions in the act
== religion ==
many prehistoric deities are depicted as predators or prey of humans often in a zoomorphic form perhaps alluding to the importance of hunting for most palaeolithic cultures
in many pagan religions specific rituals are conducted before or after a hunt the rituals done may vary according to the species hunted or the season the hunt is taking place often a hunting ground or the hunt for one or more species was reserved or prohibited in the context of a temple cult
=== indian and eastern religions ===
hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation as well as a sport of the kingly even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting one of the names of the god shiva is mrigavyadha which translates as the deer hunter (mriga means deer vyadha means hunter) the word mriga in many indian languages including malayalam not only stands for deer but for all animals and animal instincts (mriga thrishna) shiva as mrigavyadha is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings in the epic ramayana dasharatha the father of rama is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark during one of his hunting expeditions he accidentally killed shravana mistaking him for game during rama's exile in the forest ravana kidnapped his wife sita from their hut while rama was asked by sita to capture a golden deer and his brother lakshman went after him according to the mahabharat pandu the father of the pandavas accidentally killed the sage kindama and his wife with an arrow mistaking them for a deer krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter
jainism teaches followers to have tremendous respect for all of life prohibitions for hunting and meat eating are the fundamental conditions for being a jain
buddhism's first precept is the respect for all sentient life the general approach by all buddhists is to avoid killing any living animals buddha explained the issue by saying all fear death comparing others with oneself one should neither kill nor cause to kill.
=== christianity judaism and islam ===
from early christian times hunting has been forbidden to roman catholic church clerics thus the corpus juris canonici (c ii x de cleric venat.) says we forbid to all servants of god hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons. the fourth council of the lateran held under pope innocent iii decreed (canon xv) we interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics. the decree of the council of trent is worded more mildly let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking (sess xxiv de reform. c xii) which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy (clamorosa) hunting unlawful but not quiet (quieta) hunting
ferraris (s.v clericus art 6) gives it as the general sense of canonists that hunting is allowed to clerics if it be indulged in rarely and for sufficient cause as necessity utility or honest recreation and with that moderation which is becoming to the ecclesiastical state ziegler however (de episc. l iv c xix) thinks that the interpretation of the canonists is not in accordance with the letter or spirit of the laws of the church
nevertheless although a distinction between lawful and unlawful hunting is undoubtedly permissible it is certain that a bishop can absolutely prohibit all hunting to the clerics of his diocese as was done by synods at milan avignon lige cologne and elsewhere benedict xiv (de synodo dices. l ii c x) declared that such synodal decrees are not too severe as an absolute prohibition of hunting is more conformable to the ecclesiastical law in practice therefore the synodal statutes of various localities must be consulted to discover whether they allow quiet hunting or prohibit it altogether
it is important to note that the bible places no such restrictions on any christian as most do not observe kosher dietary laws hence protestant clerics catholic lay parishioners and protestants have no religious restrictions on hunting this is in accord with what is found in the acts of the apostles 15:2829 and 1 timothy 4:4
jewish hunting law based on the torah is similar permitting hunting of non-preying animals that are considered kosher for food although hunting preying animals for food is strictly prohibited under rabbinic law hence birds of prey are specifically prohibited and non-kosher hunting for sport and not for food is also forbidden in rabbinical law
islamic sharia law regarding hunting is the same as jewish law in that only non-preying animals that can be considered halal for food can be hunted but only for food and not as sport
== national traditions ==
=== new zealand ===
new zealand has a strong hunting culture the islands making up new zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats however once europeans arrived game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide new zealanders with sport and a hunting resource deer pigs goats rabbits hare tahr and chamois all adapted well to the new zealand terrain and with no natural predators their population exploded government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production but hunters view them as a resource
=== shikar (indian subcontinent) ===
during the feudal and colonial times in british india hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous princely states as many maharajas and nawabs as well as british officers maintained a whole corps of shikaris (big-game hunters) who were native professional hunters they would be headed by a master of the hunt who might be styled mir-shikar often they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting techniques big game such as bengal tigers might be hunted from the back of an elephant
regional social norms are generally antagonistic to hunting while a few sects such as the bishnoi lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species such as the antelope india's wildlife protection act of 1972 bans the killing of all wild animals however the chief wildlife warden may if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery permit any person to hunt such an animal in this case the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property
=== safari ===
a safari from a swahili word meaning a long journey especially in africa is defined as an overland journey
safari as a distinctive way of hunting was popularised by the us author ernest hemingway and president theodore roosevelt a safari may consist of a several-days- or even weeks-long journey with camping in the bush or jungle while pursuing big game nowadays it is often used to describe tours through african national parks to watch or hunt wildlife
hunters are usually tourists accompanied by licensed and highly regulated professional hunters local guides skinners and porters in more difficult terrains a special safari type is the solo-safari where all the license acquiring stalking preparation and outfitting is done by the hunter himself
=== united kingdom ===
unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the united kingdom in fact hunting without qualification implies fox hunting what in other countries is called hunting is called shooting (birds) or stalking (deer) in britain originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds pairs of sight hounds (or long-dogs) such as greyhounds may be used to pursue a hare in coursing where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare (but are not intended to actually catch it) or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags (deer) or mink deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds using stealth
these forms of hunting have been controversial in the uk animal welfare supporters believe that hunting causes unnecessary suffering to foxes horses and hounds proponents argue that it is culturally and perhaps economically important using dogs to chase wild mammals was made illegal in february 2005 by the hunting act 2004 there were a number of exemptions (under which the activity may not be illegal) in the act for hunting with hounds but no exemptions at all for hare-coursing
shooting traditions
game birds especially pheasants are shot with shotguns for sport in the uk the british association for shooting and conservation says that over a million people per year participate in shooting including game shooting clay pigeon shooting and target shooting
shooting as practised in britain as opposed to traditional hunting requires little questing for gamearound thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year some having been factory farmed shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns when in position beaters move through the areas of cover swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out such events are often called drives the open season for grouse in the uk begins on 12 august the so-called glorious twelfth the definition of game in the united kingdom is governed by the game act 1831
=== united states ===
north american hunting pre-dates the united states by thousands of years and was an important part of many pre-columbian native american cultures native americans retain some hunting rights and are exempt from some laws as part of indian treaties and otherwise under federal lawexamples include eagle feather laws and exemptions in the marine mammal protection act this is considered particularly important in alaskan native communities
hunting is primarily regulated by state law additional regulations are imposed through united states environmental law in the case of migratory birds and endangered species regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas time periods techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted some states make a distinction between protected species and unprotected species (often vermin or varmints for which there are no hunting regulations) hunters of protected species require a hunting license in all states for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite
typically game animals are divided into several categories for regulatory purposes typical categories along with example species are as follows
big game white-tailed deer mule deer moose elk caribou bear bighorn sheep pronghorn boar javelina bison
small game rabbit hare squirrel oppossum raccoon porcupine skunk ring-tailed cat armadillo ruffed grouse
furbearers beaver red fox mink pine marten musk rat otter bobcat
predators cougar (mountain lion and panther) wolf coyote
upland game bird grouse woodcock chukar pheasant quail dove
waterfowl duck teal merganser geese swan
hunting big game typically requires a tag for each animal harvested tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited in cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species tags are usually assigned by lottery tags may be further restricted to a specific area or wildlife management unit hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the fish and wildlife service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license
harvest of animals other than big game is typically restricted by a bag limit and a possession limit a bag limit is the maximum number of a specific animal species that an individual can harvest in a single day a possession limit is the maximum number of a specific animal species that can be in an individual's possession at any time
==== shooting ====
gun usage in hunting is typically regulated by game category area within the state and time period regulations for big-game hunting often specify a minimum caliber or muzzle energy for firearms the use of rifles is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high population densities or limited topographic relief regulations may also limit or ban the use of lead in ammunition because of environmental concerns specific seasons for bow hunting or muzzle-loading black-powder guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective weapons
hunting in the united states is not associated with any particular class or culture a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of americans supported legal hunting although relatively few americans actually hunt at the beginning of the 21st century just six percent of americans hunted southerners in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent slightly below the national average and while hunting was more common in other parts of the south at nine percent these rates did not surpass those of the plains states where twelve percent of midwesterners hunted hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average overall in the 19962006 period the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent a drop attributable to a number of factors including habitat loss and changes in recreation habits
==== regulation ====
regulation of hunting within the united states dates from the 19th century some modern hunters see themselves as conservationists and sportsmen in the mode of theodore roosevelt and the boone and crockett club local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use some groups represent a specific hunting interest such as ducks unlimited pheasants forever or the delta waterfowl foundation many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government
each year nearly $200 million in hunters federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs the purchase of lands open to hunters and hunter education and safety classes since 1934 the sale of federal duck stamps a required purchase for migratory waterfowl hunters over sixteen years old has raised over $700 million to help purchase more than 5,200,000 acres (8,100 sq mi 21,000 km2) of habitat for the national wildlife refuge system lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting states also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals as designated by law a key task of federal and state park rangers and game wardens is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting including species protection hunting seasons and hunting bans
==== varmint hunting ====
varmint hunting is an american phrase for the selective killing of non-game animals seen as pests while not always an efficient form of pest control varmint hunting achieves selective control of pests while providing recreation and is much less regulated varmint species are often responsible for detrimental effects on crops livestock landscaping infrastructure and pets some animals such as wild rabbits or squirrels may be utilised for fur or meat but often no use is made of the carcass which species are varmints depends on the circumstance and area common varmints may include various rodents coyotes crows foxes feral cats and feral hogs some animals once considered varmints are now protected such as wolves in the us state of louisiana a non-native rodent known as a nutria has become so destructive to the local ecosystem that the state has initiated a bounty program to help control the population
==== fair chase ====
the principles of the fair chase have been a part of the american hunting tradition for over one hundred years the role of the hunter-conservationist popularised by theodore roosevelt and perpetuated by roosevelt's formation of the boone and crockett club has been central to the development of the modern fair chase tradition
beyond fair chase the ethic and tradition of hunting a book by jim posewitz describes fair chase
fundamental to ethical hunting is the idea of fair chase this concept addresses the balance between the hunter and the hunted it is a balance that allows hunters to occasionally succeed while animals generally avoid being taken.
when internet hunting was introduced in 2005 allowing people to hunt over the internet using remotely controlled guns the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase as a representative of the national rifle association (nra) explained the nra has always maintained that fair chase being in the field with your firearm or bow is an important element of hunting tradition sitting at your desk in front of your computer clicking at a mouse has nothing to do with hunting.
one hunting club declares that a fair chase shall not involve the taking of animals under the following conditions
helpless in a trap deep snow or water or on ice
from any power vehicle or power boat
by jacklighting or shining at night
by the use of any tranquilizers or poisons
while inside escape-proof fenced enclosures
by the use of any power vehicle or power boat for herding or driving animals including use of aircraft to land alongside or to communicate with or direct a hunter on the ground
by the use of electronic devices for attracting locating or pursuing game or guiding the hunter to such game or by the use of a bow or arrow to which any electronic device is attached
==== ranches ====
indian blackbuck nilgai axis deer fallow deer and barasingha can now be found on hunting ranches in texas where they were introduced for sport hunting hunters can pay upwards of $4000 as fees for hunting a barasingha
=== russia ===
the russian imperial hunts evolved from hunting traditions of early russian rulersgrand princes and tsarsunder the influence of hunting customs of european royal courts the imperial hunts were organised mainly in peterhof tsarskoye selo and gatchina
=== australia ===
hunting in australia has evolved around the hunting and eradication of various animals considered to be pests all native animals are protected by law and can only be killed under special permit hunted introduced species include deer pigs goats foxes and rabbits
=== japan ===
the numbers of licensed hunters in japan including those using snares and guns is generally decreasing while their average age is increasing as of 2010 there were approximately 190,000 registered hunters approximately 65% of whom were sixty years old or older
=== trinidad and tobago ===
there is a very active tradition of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game in trinidad and tobago hunting is carried out with firearms and aided by the use of hounds with the illegal use of trap guns trap cages and snare nets with approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years (in a very small country of about the size of the state of delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants) there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable in addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long (5 months - october to february inclusive) as such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high added to that there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high as a result the populations of the five major mammalian game species (red-rumped agouti lowland paca nine-banded armadillo collared peccary and red brocket deer) are thought to be quite low (although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013) it appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on tobago as a result of over-hunting various herons ducks doves the green iguana the gold tegu the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached there is also some poaching of fully protected species including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys southern tamanduas brazilian porcupines yellow-footed tortoises trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds the scarlet ibis legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training there is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country (with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit) the local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws with hunting occurring both in and out of season and even in wildlife sanctuaries there is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously with well drafted legislation being brought before parliament in 2015 it remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management
== wildlife management ==
hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species or in some instances damage human health or safety however in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability and hunting for population control has no effect on the annual population of species in some cases it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area thus artificially increasing the population hunting advocates assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter reducing mortality among the remaining animals some environmentalists assert that (re)introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain
in the united states wildlife managers are frequently part of hunting regulatory and licensing bodies where they help to set rules on the number manner and conditions in which game may be hunted
management agencies sometimes rely on hunting to control specific animal populations as has been the case with deer in north america these hunts may sometimes be carried out by professional shooters although others may include amateur hunters many us city and local governments hire professional and amateur hunters each year to reduce populations of animals such as deer that are becoming hazardous in a restricted area such as neighbourhood parks and metropolitan open spaces
a large part of managing populations involves managing the number and sometimes the size or age of animals harvested so as to ensure the sustainability of the population tools that are frequently used to control harvest are bag limits and season closures although gear restrictions such as archery-only seasons are becoming increasingly popular in an effort to reduce hunter success rates
=== bag limits ===
bag limits are provisions under the law that control how many animals of a given species or group of species can be killed although there are often species for which bag limits do not apply there are also jurisdictions where bag limits are not applied at all or are not applied under certain circumstances the phrase bag limits comes from the custom among hunters of small game to carry successful kills in a small basket similar to a fishing creel
where bag limits are used there can be daily or seasonal bag limits for example ducks can often be harvested at a rate of six per hunter per day big game like moose most often have a seasonal bag limit of one animal per hunter bag limits may also regulate the size sex or age of animal that a hunter can kill in many cases bag limits are designed to allocate harvest among the hunting population more equitably rather than to protect animal populations
=== closed and open season ===
a closed season is a time during which hunting an animal of a given species is contrary to law typically closed seasons are designed to protect a species when they are most vulnerable or to protect them during their breeding season by extension the period that is not the closed season is known as the open season
=== laws ===
illegal hunting and harvesting of wild species contrary to local and international conservation and wildlife management laws is called poaching game preservation is one of the tactics used to prevent poaching violations of hunting laws and regulations involving poaching are normally punishable by law punishment can include confiscation of equipment fines and/or a prison sentence in costa rica all forms of sport hunting have been illegal since december 10 2012
== methods ==
historical subsistence and sport hunting techniques can differ radically with modern hunting regulations often addressing issues of where when and how hunts are conducted techniques may vary depending on government regulations a hunter's personal ethics local custom hunting equipment and the animal being hunted often a hunter will use a combination of more than one technique laws may forbid sport hunters from using some methods used primarily in poaching and wildlife management
baiting is the use of decoys lures scent or food
battue involves scaring animals (by beating sticks) into a killing zone or ambush
beagling is the use of beagles in hunting rabbits and sometimes in hunting foxes
beating uses beaters to flush out game and/or drive it into position
blind hunting or stand hunting is waiting for animals from a concealed or elevated position
calling is the use of animal noises to attract or drive animals
camouflage is the use of visual or odour concealment to blend with the environment
dogs may be used to course or to help flush herd drive track point at pursue or retrieve prey
driving is the herding of animals in a particular direction usually toward another hunter in the group
flushing is the practice of scaring animals from concealed areas
glassing is the use of optics such as binoculars to locate animals more easily
glue is an indiscriminate passive form to kill birds
internet hunting is a method of hunting over the internet using webcams and remotely controlled guns
netting involves using nets including active netting with the use of cannon nets and rocket nets
persistence hunting is the use of running and tracking to pursue the prey to exhaustion
scouting for game is typically done prior to a hunt and will ensure the desired species are in a chosen area looking for animal sign such as tracks scat etc and utilizing trail cameras are commonly used tactics while scouting
solunar theory says that animals move according to the location of the moon in comparison to their bodies and is said to have been used long before this by hunters to know the best times to hunt their desired game
spotlighting or shining is the use of artificial light to find or blind animals before killing
stalking or still hunting is the practice of walking quietly in search of animals or in pursuit of an individual animal
tracking is the practice of reading physical evidence in pursuing animals
trapping is the use of devices such as snares pits and deadfalls to capture or kill an animal
== trophy hunting ==
trophy hunting is the selective seeking of wild game it may also include the controversial hunting of captive or semi-captive animals expressly bred and raised under controlled or semi-controlled conditions so as to attain trophy characteristics this is sometimes known as canned hunts
=== history ===
in the 19th century southern and central european sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy usually the head or pelt of an animal which was then displayed as a sign of prowess the rest of the animal was typically discarded some cultures however disapprove of such waste in nordic countries hunting for trophies wasand still isfrowned upon hunting in north america in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies although it is now undertaken mainly for sport the safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in africa india and other places in pursuit of trophies in modern times trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas
=== conservation tool ===
according to the u.s fish and wildlife service hunting provides an economic incentive for ranchers to continue to breed those species and that hunting reduces the threat of the species extinction.
a scientific study in the journal biological conservation states that trophy hunting is of major importance to conservation in africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism. however another study states that less than 3% of a trophy hunters expenditures reach the local level meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is minimal particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy.
financial incentives from trophy hunting effectively more than double the land area that is used for wildlife conservation relative to what would be conserved relying on national parks alone according to biological conservation although local communities usually derive no more than 18 cents per hectare from trophy hunting
trophy hunting has been considered essential for providing economic incentives to conserve large carnivores according to research studies in conservation biology journal of sustainable tourism wildlife conservation by sustainable use and animal conservation studies by the centre for responsible tourism and the iucn state that ecotourism is a superior economic incentive generating twice the revenue per acre and 39 times more permanent employment
=== controversy ===
trophy hunting is most often criticised when it involves rare or endangered animals opponents may also see trophy hunting as an issue of morality or animal cruelty criticising the killing of living creatures for recreation victorian era dramatist w s gilbert remarked deer-stalking would be a very fine sport if only the deer had guns.
there is also debate about the extent to which trophy hunting benefits the local economy hunters argue that fees paid contribute to the local economy and provide value to animals that would otherwise be seen as competition for grazing livestock and crops this analysis is disputed by opponents of trophy hunting some argue that the animals are worth more to the community for ecotourism than hunting
== economics ==
a variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds in tanzania it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist while the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas uninviting to the typical ecotourist advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities
in the united kingdom the game hunting of birds as an industry is said to be extremely important to the rural economy the cobham report of 1997 suggested it to be worth around 700 million and hunting and shooting lobby groups claimed it to be worth over a billion pounds less than ten years later
hunting also has a significant financial impact in the united states with many companies specialising in hunting equipment or speciality tourism many different technologies have been created to assist hunters even including iphone applications today's hunters come from a broad range of economic social and cultural backgrounds in 2001 over thirteen million hunters averaged eighteen days hunting and spent over $20.5 billion on their sport in the us proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game management programs including preservation of wildlife habitat

lead bullets that miss their target or remain in an unretrieved carcass become a persistent toxicant in the environment waterfowl or other birds may ingest the lead and poison themselves with the neurotoxicant since 1991 us federal law forbids lead shot in waterfowl hunts and 30 states have some type of restriction
in december 2014 a federal appeals court denied a lawsuit by environmental groups that the epa must use the toxic substances control act to regulate lead in shells and cartridges the groups sought epa to regulate spent lead yet the court found epa could not regulate spent lead without also regulating cartridges and shells
== conservation ==
hunters have been driving forces throughout history in the movement to ensure long-term sustainability of natural resources and wildlife habitats
however excessive hunting and poachers have also contributed heavily to the endangerment extirpation and extinction of many animals such as the quagga the great auk steller's sea cow the thylacine the bluebuck the arabian oryx the caspian and javan tigers the markhor the sumatran rhinoceros the bison the north american cougar the altai argali sheep the asian elephant and many more primarily for commercial sale or sport all these animals have been hunted to endangerment or extinction
=== legislation ===
==== pittmanrobertson wildlife restoration act of 1937 ====
in 1937 american hunters successfully lobbied the us congress to pass the pittman-robertson wildlife restoration act which placed an eleven percent tax on all hunting equipment this self-imposed tax now generates over $700 million each year and is used exclusively to establish restore and protect wildlife habitats the act is named for nevada senator key pittman and virginia congressman absalom willis robertson
==== federal duck stamp program ====
on 16 march 1934 president franklin d roosevelt signed the migratory bird hunting stamp act which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen the stamps are created on behalf of the program by the us postal service and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest they play an important role in habitat conservation because ninety-eight percent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of wetland habitat for protection in the national wildlife refuge system in addition to waterfowl it is estimated that one third of the nation's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using duck stamp funds
since 1934 the sale of federal duck stamps has generated $670 million and helped to purchase or lease 5,200,000 acres (8,100 sq mi 21,000 km2) of habitat the stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds an entrance pass for all national wildlife refuge areas and are also considered collectors items often purchased for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities although non-hunters buy a significant number of duck stamps eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters which is logical as hunters are required to purchase them distribution of funds is managed by the migratory bird conservation commission (mbcc)
=== species ===
==== arabian oryx ====
the arabian oryx a species of large antelope once inhabited much of the desert areas of the middle east however the species striking appearance made it (along with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax) a popular quarry for sport hunters especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region the use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage speed and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972 the scimitar-horned oryx followed suit while the addax became critically endangered however the arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from extinct in the wild to vulnerable due to conservation efforts like captive breeding
==== markhor ====
the markhor is an endangered species of wild goat which inhabits the mountains of central asia and pakistan the colonization of these regions by britain gave british sport hunters access to the species and they were hunted heavily almost to the point of extinction only their willingness to breed in captivity and the inhospitability of their mountainous habitat prevented this despite these factors the markhor is still endangered
==== american bison ====
the american bison is a large bovid which inhabited much of western north america prior to the 1800s living on the prairies in large herds however the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters who killed dozens of bison for their hides only leaving the rest to rot thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase but the bison remains near-threatened
==== white rhino ====
the journal of international wildlife law and policy cites that the legalization of white rhinoceros hunting in south africa motivated private landowners to reintroduce the species onto their lands as a result the country saw an increase in white rhinos from fewer than one hundred individuals to more than 11,000 even while a limited number were killed as trophies
however the illegal hunting of rhinoceros for their horns is highly damaging to the population and is currently growing globally with 1004 being killed in south africa alone according to the most recent estimate
==== other species ====
according to richard conniff namibia is home to 1,750 of the roughly 5,000 black rhinos surviving in the wild because it allows trophy hunting of various species namibia's mountain zebra population has increased to 27,000 from 1,000 in 1982 elephants which are gunned down elsewhere for their ivory have gone to 20,000 from 15,000 in 1995 lions which were on the brink of extinction from senegal to kenya are increasing in namibia
in contrast botswana has recently been forced to ban trophy hunting following a precipitous wildlife decline the numbers of antelope plummeted across botswana with a resultant decline in predator numbers while elephant numbers remained stable and hippopotamus numbers rose according to the government of botswana trophy hunting is at least partly to blame for this but many other factors such as poaching drought and habitat loss are also to blame uganda recently did the same arguing that the share of benefits of sport hunting were lopsided and unlikely to deter poaching or improve [uganda's] capacity to manage the wildlife reserves.
=== studies ===
a study issued by the wildlife society concluded that hunting and trapping are cost effective tools that reduce wildlife damage by reducing a population below the capacity of the environment to carry it and changing the behaviors of animals to stop them from causing damage the study furthermore states that the cessation of hunting could cause wildlife to be severely harmed rural property values to fall and the incentive of landowners to maintain natural habitats to diminish
