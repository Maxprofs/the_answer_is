a tape measure or measuring tape is a flexible ruler it consists of a ribbon of cloth plastic fiber glass or metal strip with linear-measurement markings it is a common measuring tool its design allows for a measure of great length to be easily carried in pocket or toolkit and permits one to measure around curves or corners today it is ubiquitous even appearing in miniature form as a keychain fob or novelty item surveyors use tape measures in lengths of over 100 m (300+ ft) various types of measuring tapes and construction materials are explained at this reference
== usesedit ==
tape measures that were intended for use in tailoring or dressmaking were made from flexible cloth or plastic.these types of tape measures were mainly used for the measuring of the human's waist line today measuring tapes made for sewing are made of fiberglass which does not tear or stretch as easily measuring tapes designed for carpentry or construction often use a stiff curved metallic ribbon that can remain stiff and straight when extended but retracts into a coil for convenient storage this type of tape measure will have a floating tang or hook on the end to aid measuring the tang is connected to the tape with loose rivets through oval holes and can move a distance equal to its thickness to provide both inside and outside measurements that are accurate a tape measure of 25 or even 100 feet can wind into a relatively small container the self-marking tape measure allows the user an accurate one hand measure
== historyedit ==
the first record of a people using a measuring device was by the romans using marked strips of leather but this was more like a regular ruler than a tape measure on july 14 1868 a patent was filed by one alvin j fellows of new haven connecticut fellows rule although crude and flimsy was the first attempt to make a spring tape measure on 3 january 1922 hiram a farrand received the patent he filed in 1919 for his spring tape measure sometime between 1922 and december 1926 farrand experimented with the help of the brown company in berlin new hampshire it is there hiram and william wentworth brown began mass-producing the tape measure their product was later sold to stanley works

the basic design on which all modern spring tape measures are built can trace its origins back to an 1868 patent by a new haven connecticut resident named a j fellows according to the text of his patent fellows tape measure was an improvement on other versions previously designed
the spring tape measure has existed since fellows patent in 1868 but its usage did not become very popular due to the difficulty in communication from one town to another in the early 1900s carpenters began slowly adopting h a farrand's design as the one more commonly used which is the design all modern tape measures use today
with the mass production of the integrated circuit (ic) the tape measure has also entered into the digital age with the digital tape measure some incorporate a digital screen to give measurement readouts in multiple formats an early patent for this type of measure was published in 1977
there are also other styles of tape measures that have incorporated lasers and ultrasonic technology to measure the distance of an object with fairly reliable accuracy
=== united statesedit ===
justus roe a surveyor and tape-maker by trade made the longest tape measure in 1956 at 600 feet (180 m)
the northern virginia surveyors association presented the 600-foot gold-plated surveyor's tape measure to mickey mantle in 1956
some tapes sold in the united states have additional marks in the shape of small black diamonds which appear every 19.2 inches (49 cm) these are known as metric layouts markings and are used to mark out equal truss lengths for roofing materials (five trusses per standard 8-foot (2.4 m) length of building material)
many tapes also have special markings every 16 inches (41 cm) which is a standard interval for studs in housing
