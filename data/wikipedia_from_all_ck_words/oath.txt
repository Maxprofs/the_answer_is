traditionally an oath (from anglo-saxon  also called plight) is either a statement of fact or a promise with wording relating to something considered sacred as a sign of verity legal substitute for those who conscientiously object to making a sacred oath is to give an affirmation instead nowadays even when there's no notion of sanctity involved certain promises said out loud in ceremonial or juridical purpose are referred to as oaths to swear is a verb used to describe the taking of an oath to making a solemn vow
== divine oath ==
usually oaths have referred to a deity significant in the cultural sphere in question the reciter's personal views upon the divinity of the aspects considered sacred in a predictated text of an oath may or may not be taken in to account there might not be alternative personal proclamations with no mention of the sacred dogma in question such as affirmations to be made this might mean an impasse to those with unwillingness to edify the dogma they see as untrue and those who decline to refer to sacred matters on the subject at hand
the essence of a divine oath is an invocation of divine agency to be a guarantor of the oath taker's own honesty and integrity in the matter under question by implication this invokes divine displeasure if the oath taker fails in their sworn duties it therefore implies greater care than usual in the act of the performance of one's duty such as in testimony to the facts of the matter in a court of law
a person taking an oath indicates this in a number of ways the most usual is the explicit i swear, but any statement or promise that includes with * as my witness or so help me *, with * being something or someone the oath-taker holds sacred is an oath many people take an oath by holding in their hand or placing over their head a book of scripture or a sacred object thus indicating the sacred witness through their action such an oath is called corporal however the chief purpose of such an act is for ceremony or solemnity and the act does not of itself make an oath
== historical development as a legal concept ==
making vows and taking oaths became a symbolic concept in law practice that developed over time in different cultures
=== jewish tradition ===
the concept of oaths is deeply rooted within judaism it is found in genesis 8:21 when god swears that he will never again curse the ground because of man and never again smite every living thing. this repetition of the term never again is explained by rashi the pre-eminent biblical commentator as serving as an oath citing the talmud shavous 36a for this ruling
the first personage in the biblical tradition to take an oath is held to be eliezer the chief servant of abraham when the latter requested of the former that he not take a wife for his son isaac from the daughters of canaan but rather from among abraham's own family
the foundational text for oath making is in the when a man voweth a vow unto the lord or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth (numbers 30:2) according to the rabbis a neder (usually translated as vow") refers to the object a shvua (usually translated as oath") to the person the passage (bamidbar 30:2-17) distinguishes between a neder and a shvua an important distinction between the two in halacha a neder changes the status of some external thing while a shvua initiates an internal change in the one who swears the oath
=== roman tradition ===
in the roman tradition oaths were sworn upon iuppiter lapis or the jupiter stone located in the temple of jupiter capitoline hill iuppiter lapis was held in the roman tradition to be an oath stone an aspect of jupiter in his role as divine law-maker responsible for order and used principally for the investiture of the oathtaking of office
according to cyril bailey in the religion of ancient rome (1907)
we have for instance the sacred stone (silex) which was preserved in the temple of iuppiter on the capitol and was brought out to play a prominent part in the ceremony of treaty-making the fetial who on that occasion represented the roman people at the solemn moment of the oath-taking struck the sacrificial pig with the silex saying as he did so do thou diespiter strike the roman people as i strike this pig here to-day and strike them the more as thou art greater and stronger. here no doubt the underlying notion is not merely symbolical but in origin the stone is itself the god an idea which later religion expressed in the cult-title specially used in this connection iuppiter lapis
the punisher of broken oaths was the infernal deity orcus
=== greek tradition ===
walter burkert has shown that since lycurgus of athens (d 324 bce) who held that it is the oath which holds democracy together religion morality and political organization had been linked by the oath and the oath and its prerequisite altar had become the basis of both civil and criminal as well as international law
=== christian tradition ===
various religious groups have objected to the taking of oaths most notably the religious society of friends (quakers) and mennonites this is principally based on matthew 5:34-37 the antithesis of the law here christ is written to say i say to you swear not at all james the just stated in james 5:12 above all my brothers do not swearnot by heaven or by earth or by anything else let your yes be yes and your no, no or you will be condemned. beyond this scriptural authority quakers place importance on being truthful at all times so the testimony opposing oaths springs from a view that taking legal oaths implies a double standard of truthfulness suggesting that truthfulness in legal contexts is somehow more important than truthfulness in non-legal contexts and that truthfulness in those other contexts is therefore somehow less important
not all christians interpret this reading as forbidding all types of oaths however opposition to oath-taking among some groups of christian caused many problems for these groups throughout their history quakers were frequently imprisoned because of their refusal to swear loyalty oaths testifying in court was also difficult george fox quakers founder famously challenged a judge who had asked him to swear saying that he would do so once the judge could point to any bible passage where jesus or his apostles took oaths (the judge could not but this did not allow fox to escape punishment.) legal reforms from the 18th century onwards mean that everyone in the united kingdom now has the right to make a solemn affirmation instead of an oath the united states has permitted affirmations since it was founded it is explicitly mentioned in the constitution only president franklin pierce has chosen to affirm rather than swear at his inauguration
as late as 1880 charles bradlaugh was denied a seat as an mp in the parliament of the united kingdom because of his professed atheism as he was judged unable to swear the oath of allegiance in spite of his proposal to swear the oath as a matter of form
=== islam ===
islam takes the fulfillment of oaths extremely seriously
quran chapter 5 verse 89 god does not hold you responsible for the mere utterance of oaths he holds you responsible for your actual intentions if you violate an oath you shall atone by feeding ten poor people from the same food you offer to your own family or clothing them or by freeing a slave if you cannot afford this then you shall fast three days this is the atonement for violating the oaths that you swore to keep you shall fulfill your oaths god thus explains his revelations to you that you may be appreciative
=== germanic tradition ===

a prose passage inserted in the eddic poem helgakvia hjrvarssonar relates hedin was coming home alone from the forest one yule-eve and found a troll-woman she rode on a wolf and had snakes in place of a bridle she asked hedin for his company nay, said he she said thou shalt pay for this at the bragarfull. that evening the great vows were taken the sacred boar was brought in the men laid their hands thereon and took their vows at the bragarfull hedin vowed that he would have svva eylimi's daughter the beloved of his brother helgi then such great grief seized him that he went forth on wild paths southward over the land and found helgi his brother such norse traditions are directly parallel to the bird oaths of late medieval france such as the voeux du faisan (oath on the pheasant) or the (fictional) voeux du paon (oath on the peacock).huizinga the autumn of the middle ages (ch 3) michel margue vogelgelbde am hof des frsten ritterliches integrationsritual zwischen traditions- und gegenwartsbezug (14 15 jahrhundert)
=== modern law ===
in law oaths are made by a witness to a court of law before giving testimony and usually by a newly appointed government officer to the people of a state before taking office in both of those cases though an affirmation can be usually substituted a written statement if the author swears the statement is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth is called an affidavit the oath given to support an affidavit is frequently administered by a notary who will certify the giving of the oath by affixing her or his seal to the document willfully delivering a false oath (or affirmation) is the crime of perjury
there is confusion between oaths and other statements or promises the current olympic oath for instance is really a pledge and not properly an oath since there is only a promise and no appeal to a sacred witness oaths are also confused with vows but really a vow is a special kind of oath
== hand gestures ==
instead or in addition to holding ones hand upon an object of ceremonial importance it can be customary for a person swearing an oath to hold a raised hand in a specific gesture most often the right hand is raised this custom has been explained with reference to medieval practices of branding palms however the practice is referred to in the old testament ("their mouths speak untruth their right hands are raised in lying oaths psalm 144:8)
