mangroves are various large and extensive types of trees up to medium height and shrubs that grow in saline coastal sediment habitats in the tropics and subtropicsmainly between latitudes 25 n and 25 s the remaining mangrove forest areas of the world in 2000 was 53,190 square miles (137,760 km) spanning 118 countries and territories
mangroves are salt tolerant trees (halophytes) adapted to live in harsh coastal conditions they contain a complex salt filtration system and complex root system to cope with salt water immersion and wave action they are adapted to the low oxygen (anoxic) conditions of waterlogged mud
the word is used in at least three senses (1) most broadly to refer to the habitat and entire plant assemblage or mangal for which the terms mangrove forest biome mangrove swamp and mangrove forest are also used (2) to refer to all trees and large shrubs in the mangrove swamp and (3) narrowly to refer to the mangrove family of plants the rhizophoraceae or even more specifically just to mangrove trees of the genus rhizophora
the mangrove biome or mangal is a distinct saline woodland or shrubland habitat characterized by depositional coastal environments where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high-energy wave action the saline conditions tolerated by various mangrove species range from brackish water through pure seawater (30 to 40 ppt (parts per thousand)) to water concentrated by evaporation to over twice the salinity of ocean seawater (up to 90 ppt)
== etymologyedit ==
the term mangrove comes to english from spanish (perhaps by way of portuguese) and is likely to originate from guarani it was earlier mangrow (from portuguese mangue or spanish mangle) but this word was corrupted via folk etymology influence of the word grove
== ecologyedit ==
mangrove swamps are found in tropical and subtropical tidal areas areas where mangal occurs include estuaries and marine shorelines
the intertidal existence to which these trees are adapted represents the major limitation to the number of species able to thrive in their habitat high tide brings in salt water and when the tide recedes solar evaporation of the seawater in the soil leads to further increases in salinity the return of tide can flush out these soils bringing them back to salinity levels comparable to that of seawater
at low tide organisms are also exposed to increases in temperature and desiccation and are then cooled and flooded by the tide thus for a plant to survive in this environment it must tolerate broad ranges of salinity temperature and moisture as well as a number of other key environmental factors thus only a select few species make up the mangrove tree community
about 110 species are considered mangroves in the sense of being a tree that grows in such a saline swamp though only a few are from the mangrove plant genus rhizophora however a given mangrove swamp typically features only a small number of tree species it is not uncommon for a mangrove forest in the caribbean to feature only three or four tree species for comparison the tropical rainforest biome contains thousands of tree species but this is not to say mangrove forests lack diversity though the trees themselves are few in species the ecosystem that these trees create provides a home (habitat) for a great variety of other organisms
mangrove plants require a number of physiological adaptations to overcome the problems of anoxia high salinity and frequent tidal inundation each species has its own solutions to these problems this may be the primary reason why on some shorelines mangrove tree species show distinct zonation small environmental variations within a mangal may lead to greatly differing methods for coping with the environment therefore the mix of species is partly determined by the tolerances of individual species to physical conditions such as tidal inundation and salinity but may also be influenced by other factors such as predation of plant seedlings by crabs
once established mangrove roots provide an oyster habitat and slow water flow thereby enhancing sediment deposition in areas where it is already occurring the fine anoxic sediments under mangroves act as sinks for a variety of heavy (trace) metals which colloidal particles in the sediments have scavenged from the water mangrove removal disturbs these underlying sediments often creating problems of trace metal contamination of seawater and biota
mangrove swamps protect coastal areas from erosion storm surge (especially during hurricanes) and tsunamis the mangroves massive root systems are efficient at dissipating wave energy likewise they slow down tidal water enough so its sediment is deposited as the tide comes in leaving all except fine particles when the tide ebbs in this way mangroves build their own environments because of the uniqueness of mangrove ecosystems and the protection against erosion they provide they are often the object of conservation programs including national biodiversity action plans
however mangrove swamps protective value is sometimes overstated wave energy is typically low in areas where mangroves grow so their effect on erosion can only be measured over long periods their capacity to limit high-energy wave erosion is limited to events such as storm surges and tsunamis erosion often occurs on the outer sides of bends in river channels that wind through mangroves while new stands of mangroves are appearing on the inner sides where sediment is accruing
the unique ecosystem found in the intricate mesh of mangrove roots offers a quiet marine region for young organisms in areas where roots are permanently submerged the organisms they host include algae barnacles oysters sponges and bryozoans which all require a hard surface for anchoring while they filter feed shrimps and mud lobsters use the muddy bottoms as their home mangrove crabs munch on the mangrove leaves adding nutritients to the mangal muds for other bottom feeders in at least some cases export of carbon fixed in mangroves is important in coastal food webs
mangrove plantations in vietnam thailand philippines and india host several commercially important species of fishes and crustaceans despite restoration efforts developers and others have removed over half of the world's mangroves in recent times
mangrove forests can decay into peat deposits because of fungal and bacterial processes as well as by the action of termites it becomes peat in good geochemical sedimentary and tectonic conditions the nature of these deposits depends on the environment and the types of mangrove involved in puerto rico the red (rhizophora mangle) white (laguncularia racemosa) and black (avicennia germinans) mangroves occupy different ecological niches and have slightly different chemical compositions so the carbon content varies between the species as well between the different tissues of the plant e.g leaf matter vs roots
in puerto rico there is a clear succession of these three trees from the lower elevations which are dominated by red mangroves to farther inland with a higher concentration of white mangroves mangrove forests are an important part of the cycling and storage of carbon in tropical coastal ecosystems using this it is possible to attempt to reconstruct the environment and investigate changes to the coastal ecosystem for thousands of years by using sediment cores however an additional complication is the imported marine organic matter that also gets deposited in the sediment due to tidal flushing of mangrove forests
in order to understand peat formation by mangroves it is important to understand the conditions they grew in and how they decayed termites are an important part of this decay and so an understanding of their action on the organic matter is crucial to the chemical stabilization of mangrove peats
== biologyedit ==
of the recognized 110 mangrove species only about 54 species in 20 genera from 16 families constitute the true mangroves species that occur almost exclusively in mangrove habitats demonstrating convergent evolution many of these species found similar solutions to the tropical conditions of variable salinity tidal range (inundation) anaerobic soils and intense sunlight plant biodiversity is generally low in a given mangal the greatest biodiversity occurs in the mangal of new guinea indonesia and malaysia
=== adaptations to low oxygenedit ===
red mangroves which can survive in the most inundated areas prop themselves above the water level with stilt roots and can then absorb air through pores in their bark (lenticels) black mangroves live on higher ground and make many pneumatophores (specialised root-like structures which stick up out of the soil like straws for breathing) which are also covered in lenticels
these breathing tubes typically reach heights of up to 30 cm and in some species over 3 m the four types of pneumatophores are stilt or prop type snorkel or peg type knee type and ribbon or plank type knee and ribbon types may be combined with buttress roots at the base of the tree the roots also contain wide aerenchyma to facilitate transport within the plants
=== limiting salt intakeedit ===
red mangroves exclude salt by having significantly impermeable roots which are highly suberised (impregnate with suberin) acting as an ultrafiltration mechanism to exclude sodium salts from the rest of the plant analysis of water inside mangroves has shown 90% to 97% of salt has been excluded at the roots in a frequently cited concept that has become known as the sacrificial leaf salt which does accumulate in the shoot (sprout) then concentrates in old leaves which the plant then sheds however recent research suggests the older yellowing leaves have no more measurable salt content than the other greener leaves red mangroves can also store salt in cell vacuoles as seen in the photograph on the right white or grey mangroves can secrete salts directly they have two salt glands at each leaf base (correlating with their namethey are covered in white salt crystals)
=== limiting water lossedit ===
because of the limited fresh water available in salty intertidal soils mangroves limit the amount of water they lose through their leaves they can restrict the opening of their stomata (pores on the leaf surfaces which exchange carbon dioxide gas and water vapour during photosynthesis) they also vary the orientation of their leaves to avoid the harsh midday sun and so reduce evaporation from the leaves anthony calfo a noted aquarium author observed anecdotally a red mangrove in captivity only grows if its leaves are misted with fresh water several times a week simulating the frequent tropical rainstorms
=== nutrient uptakeedit ===
because the soil is perpetually waterlogged little free oxygen is available anaerobic bacteria liberate nitrogen gas soluble ferrum (iron) inorganic phosphates sulfides and methane which make the soil much less nutritious pneumatophores (aerial roots) allow mangroves to absorb gases directly from the atmosphere and other nutrients such as iron from the inhospitable soil mangroves store gases directly inside the roots processing them even when the roots are submerged during high tide
=== increasing survival of offspringedit ===
in this harsh environment mangroves have evolved a special mechanism to help their offspring survive mangrove seeds are buoyant and are therefore suited to water dispersal unlike most plants whose seeds germinate in soil many mangroves (e.g red mangrove) are viviparous whose seeds germinate while still attached to the parent tree once germinated the seedling grows either within the fruit (e.g aegialitis avicennia and aegiceras) or out through the fruit (e.g rhizophora ceriops bruguiera and nypa) to form a propagule (a ready-to-go seedling) which can produce its own food via photosynthesis
the mature propagule then drops into the water which can transport it great distances propagules can survive desiccation and remain dormant for over a year before arriving in a suitable environment once a propagule is ready to root its density changes so the elongated shape now floats vertically rather than horizontally in this position it is more likely to lodge in the mud and root if it does not root it can alter its density and drift again in search of more favorable conditions
== taxonomy and evolutionedit ==
the following listing (modified from tomlinson 1986) gives the number of species of mangroves in each listed plant genus and family mangrove environments in the eastern hemisphere harbor six times as many species of trees and shrubs as do mangroves in the new world genetic divergence of mangrove lineages from terrestrial relatives in combination with fossil evidence suggests mangrove diversity is limited by evolutionary transition into the stressful marine environment and the number of mangrove lineages has increased steadily over the tertiary with little global extinction

== exploitation and conservationedit ==
approximately 35% of mangrove area was lost during the last several decades of the 20th century (in countries for which sufficient data exist) which encompass about half of the area of mangroves the united nations environment program & hamilton (2013) estimate that shrimp farming causes approximately a quarter of the destruction of mangrove forests likewise the 2010 update of the world mangrove atlas indicated a fifth of the world's mangrove ecosystems have been lost since 1980
grassroots efforts to save mangroves from development are becoming more popular as their benefits become more widely known in the bahamas for example active efforts to save mangroves are occurring on the islands of bimini and great guana cay in trinidad and tobago as well efforts are underway to protect a mangrove threatened by the construction of a steelmill and a port in thailand community management has been effective in restoring damaged mangroves within northern ecuador mangrove regrowth is reported in almost all estuaries and stems primarily from local actors responding to earlier periods of deforestation in the esmeraldas region
mangroves have been reported to be able to help buffer against tsunami cyclones and other storms one village in tamil nadu was protected from tsunami destructionthe villagers in naluvedapathy planted 80,244 saplings to get into the guinness book of world records this created a kilometre-wide belt of trees of various varieties when the tsunami struck much of the land around the village was flooded but the village itself suffered minimal damage
== reforestationedit ==
in some areas mangrove reforestation and mangrove restoration is also underway red mangroves are the most common choice for cultivation used particularly in marine aquariums in a sump to reduce nitrates and other nutrients in the water mangroves also appear in home aquariums and as ornamental plants such as in japan
in senegal hadar el ali has started the fr project which (amongst others) focuses on reforesting several areas with mangroves
the manzanar mangrove initiative is an ongoing experiment in arkiko eritrea part of the manzanar project founded by gordon h sato establishing new mangrove plantations on the coastal mudflats initial plantings failed but observation of the areas where mangroves did survive by themselves led to the conclusion that nutrients in water flow from inland were important to the health of the mangroves trials with the eritrean ministry of fisheries followed and a planting system was designed to provide the nitrogen phosphorus and iron missing from seawater
the propagules are planted inside a reused galvanized steel can with the bottom knocked out a small piece of iron and a pierced plastic bag with fertilizer containing nitrogen and phosphorus are buried with the propagule as of 2007 after six years of planting 700,000 mangroves are growing providing stock feed for sheep and habitat for oysters crabs other bivalves and fish
== national studiesedit ==
in terms of local and national studies of mangrove loss the case of belize's mangroves is illustrative in its contrast to the global picture a recent satellite-based studyfunded by the world wildlife fund and conducted by the water center for the humid tropics of latin america and the caribbean (cathalac)indicates belize's mangrove cover declined by a mere 2% over a 30-year period the study was born out of the need to verify the popular conception that mangrove clearing in belize was rampant
instead the assessment showed between 1980 and 2010 under 4,000 acres (16 km2) of mangroves had been cleared although clearing of mangroves near belize's main coastal settlements (e.g belize city and san pedro) was relatively high the rate of loss of belize's mangrovesat 0.07% per year between 1980 and 2010was much lower than belize's overall rate of forest clearing (0.6% per year in the same period) these findings can also be interpreted to indicate belize's mangrove regulations (under the nation's) have largely been effective nevertheless the need to protect belize's mangroves is imperative as a 2009 study by the world resources institute (wri) indicates the ecosystems contribute us$174249 million per year to belize's national economy
