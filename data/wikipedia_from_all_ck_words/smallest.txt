the smallest organisms found on earth can be determined according to various aspects of organism size including volume mass height length or genome size
given the incomplete nature of scientific knowledge it is possible that the smallest organism is undiscovered furthermore there is some debate over the definition of life and what entities qualify
== microorganisms ==
=== viruses ===
many biologists consider viruses to be non-living because they lack a cellular structure and cannot metabolize by themselves requiring a host cell to replicate and synthesise new products a minority of scientists hold that because viruses do have genetic material and can employ the metabolism of their host they can be considered organisms the smallest rna viruses in terms of genome size are small retroviruses such as rous sarcoma virus with genomes of 3.5 kilo base pairs (kb) and particle diameters of 80 nanometres (nm) the smallest double stranded dna viruses are the hepadnaviruses such as hepatitis b at 3.2 kb and 42 nm parvoviruses have smaller capsids at 18-26 nm but larger genomes at 5 kb the smallest dna bacteriophage is the phi-x174 phage thought to be larger than hepatitis b at about 4 kb it is important to consider other self replicating genetic elements such as satelliviruses viroids and ribozymes
the smallest virus known to humanity however is the single-stranded dna virus porcine circovirus type 1 it has a genome of only 1759 nucleotides and a capsid diameter of only 17 nm as a whole the viral family geminiviridae is only about 30 nm in length however the two capsids making up the virus are fused divided the capsids would be 15 nm in length
