an alligator is a crocodilian in the genus alligator of the family alligatoridae the two living species are the american alligator (a mississippiensis) and the chinese alligator (a sinensis) in addition several extinct species of alligator are known from fossil remains alligators first appeared during the oligocene epoch about 37 million years ago
the name alligator is probably an anglicized form of el lagarto the spanish term for the lizard which early spanish explorers and settlers in florida called the alligator later english spellings of the name included allagarta and alagarto
== description ==
an average adult american alligator's weight and length is 360 kg (790 lb) and 4.0 m (13.1 ft) but they sometimes grow to 4.4 m (14 ft) long and weigh over 450 kg (990 lb) the largest ever recorded found in louisiana measured 5.84 m (19.2 ft) the chinese alligator is smaller rarely exceeding 2.1 m (6.9 ft) in length in addition it weighs considerably less with males rarely over 45 kg
no average lifespan for an alligator has been measured in 1937 a one-year-old specimen was brought to the belgrade zoo in serbia from germany it is now 76 years old although no valid records exist about its date of birth this alligator officially named muja is considered the oldest alligator living in captivity
== habitat ==
alligators are native only to the united states and china
american alligators are found in the southeast united states all of florida and louisiana the southern parts of georgia alabama and mississippi coastal south and north carolina east texas the southeast corner of oklahoma and the southern tip of arkansas according to the 2005 scholastic book of world records louisiana has the largest alligator population the majority of american alligators inhabit florida and louisiana with over a million alligators in each state southern florida is the only place where both alligators and crocodiles live side by side
american alligators live in freshwater environments such as ponds marshes wetlands rivers lakes and swamps as well as in brackish environments when they construct alligator holes in the wetlands they increase plant diversity and provide habitat for other animals during droughts they are therefore considered an important species for maintaining ecological diversity in wetlands further west in louisiana heavy grazing by coypu and muskrat are causing severe damage to coastal wetlands large alligators feed extensively on coypu and provide a vital ecological service by reducing coypu numbers
the chinese alligator currently is found only in the yangtze river valley and is extremely endangered with only a few dozen believed to be left in the wild indeed far more chinese alligators live in zoos around the world than can be found in the wild rockefeller wildlife refuge in southern louisiana has several in captivity in an attempt to preserve the species miami metrozoo in florida also has a breeding pair of chinese alligators
== behavior ==
large male alligators are solitary territorial animals smaller alligators can often be found in large numbers close to each other the largest of the species (both males and females) defend prime territory smaller alligators have a higher tolerance for other alligators within a similar size class
alligators move on land by two forms of locomotion referred to as sprawl and high walk the sprawl is a forward movement with the belly making contact with the ground and is used to transition to high walk or to slither over wet substrate into water the high walk is an up on four limbs forward motion used for overland travel with the belly well up from the ground alligators have also been observed to rise up and balance on their hind legs and semi step forward as part of a forward or upward lunge however they can not walk on their hind legs for long distances
although the alligator has a heavy body and a slow metabolism it is capable of short bursts of speed especially in very short lunges alligators main prey are smaller animals they can kill and eat with a single bite they may kill larger prey by grabbing it and dragging it into the water to drown alligators consume food that can not be eaten in one bite by allowing it to rot or by biting and then spinning or convulsing wildly until bite-sized chunks are torn off this is referred to as a death roll critical to the alligator's ability to initiate a death roll the tail must flex to a significant angle relative to its body an alligator with an immobilized tail cannot perform a death roll
most of the muscle in an alligator's jaw evolved to bite and grip prey the muscles that close the jaws are exceptionally powerful but the muscles for opening their jaws are comparatively weak as a result an adult human can hold an alligator's jaws shut bare-handed it is common today to use several wraps of duct tape to prevent an adult alligator from opening its jaws when being handled or transported
alligators are generally timid towards humans and tend to walk or swim away if one approaches this has led some people to the practice of approaching alligators and their nests in a manner that may provoke the animals into attacking in florida feeding wild alligators at any time is illegal if fed the alligators will eventually lose their fear of humans and will learn to associate humans with food thereby becoming both a greater danger to people and at greater risk from them
== diet ==
the type of food eaten by alligators depends upon their age and size when young alligators eat fish insects snails crustaceans and worms as they mature progressively larger prey is taken including larger fish such as gar turtles and various mammals particularly coypu and muskrat as well as birds deer and other reptiles their stomachs also often contain gizzard stones they will even consume carrion if they are sufficiently hungry in some cases larger alligators are known to ambush dogs florida panthers and black bears making it the apex predator throughout its distribution in this role as a top predator it may determine the abundance of prey species including turtles and coypu as humans encroach into their habitat attacks are few but not unknown alligators unlike the large crocodiles do not immediately regard a human upon encounter as prey but may still attack in self-defense if provoked
== reproduction ==
alligators generally mature at a length of 6 feet (1.8 m) the mating season is in late spring in april and may alligators form so-called bellowing choruses large groups of animals bellow together for a few minutes a few times a day usually one to three hours after sunrise the bellows of male american alligators are accompanied by powerful blasts of infrasound another form of male display is a loud head-slap recently on spring nights alligators were found to gather in large numbers for group courtship the so-called alligator dances
in summer the female builds a nest of vegetation where the decomposition of the vegetation provides the heat needed to incubate the eggs the sex of the offspring is determined by the temperature in the nest and is fixed within seven to 21 days of the start of incubation incubation temperatures of 86 f (30 c) or lower produce a clutch of females those of 93 f (34 c) or higher produce entirely males nests constructed on leaves are hotter than those constructed on wet marsh so the former tend to produce males and the latter females the natural sex ratio at hatching is five females to one male females hatched from eggs incubated at 86 f weigh significantly more than males hatched from eggs incubated at 93 f the mother defends the nest from predators and assists the hatchlings to water she will provide protection to the young for about a year if they remain in the area the largest threat to the young are adult alligators the baby alligator's egg tooth helps it get out of its egg during hatching time predation by adults on young can account for a mortality rate of up to 50% in the first year in the past immediately following the outlawing of alligator hunting populations rebounded quickly due to the suppressed number of adults preying upon juveniles increasing survival among the young alligators
== anatomy ==
alligators much like birds have been shown to exhibit unidirectional movement of air through their lungs most other amniotes are believed to exhibit bidirectional or tidal breathing for a tidal breathing animal such as a mammal air flows into and out of the lungs through branching bronchi which terminate in small dead-end chambers called alveoli as the alveoli represent dead-ends to flow the inspired air must move back out the same way it came in in contrast air in alligator lungs makes a circuit moving in only one direction through the parabronchi the air first enters the outer branch moves through the parabronchi and exits the lung through the inner branch extensive vasculature around the parabronchi are where oxygen exchange takes place
they have muscular flat tails that propel them while swimming
the two kinds of white alligators are albino and leucistic these alligators are practically impossible to find in the wild they could survive only in captivity and are few in number the aquarium of the americas in new orleans has leucistic alligators found in a louisiana swamp in 1987
== human uses ==
alligators are raised commercially for their meat and skin which is used for bags and shoes they also provide economic benefits through the ecotourism industry visitors may take swamp tours in which alligators are a feature their most important economic benefit to humans may be the control of coypu and muskrats louisiana spends millions of dollars of bounty money to control coypu this service is provided by alligators
alligator meat is also consumed by humans the archbishop of new orleans ruled in 2010 that for purposes of catholic church discipline in relation to abstention from meat the flesh of the alligator is characterised as fish
