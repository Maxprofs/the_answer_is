in geology and related fields a stratum (plural strata) is a layer of sedimentary rock or soil with internally consistent characteristics that distinguish it from other layers the stratum is the fundamental unit in a stratigraphic column and forms the basis of the study of stratigraphy
== characteristics ==
each layer is generally one of a number of parallel layers that lie one upon another laid down by natural processes they may extend over hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of the earth's surface strata are typically seen as bands of different colored or differently structured material exposed in cliffs road cuts quarries and river banks individual bands may vary in thickness from a few millimeters to a kilometer or more each band represents a specific mode of deposition river silt beach sand coal swamp sand dune lava bed etc
== naming ==
geologists study rock strata and categorize them by the material of beds each distinct layer is typically assigned to the name of sheet usually based on a town river mountain or region where the formation is exposed and available for study for example the burgess shale is a thick exposure of dark occasionally fossiliferous shale exposed high in the canadian rockies near burgess pass slight distinctions in material in a formation may be described as members (or sometimes beds") formations are collected into groups while groups may be collected into supergroups
