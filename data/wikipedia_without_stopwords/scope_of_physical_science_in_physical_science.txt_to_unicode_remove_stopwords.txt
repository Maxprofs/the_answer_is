introduction
liquid one four primary states matter others solid gas plasma liquid fluid unlike solid molecules liquid much greater freedom move forces bind molecules together solid temporary liquid allowing liquid flow solid remains rigid

mechanisms atomicmolecular diffusion particle displacement solids closely related mechanisms viscous flow solidification liquid materials descriptions viscosity terms molecular free space within liquid modified needed order account liquids whose molecules known associated liquid state ordinary temperatures various molecules combine together form associated molecule enclose within semirigid system certain amount space available free space mobile molecules thus increase viscosity upon cooling due tendency substances become associated cooling
similar arguments could used describe effects pressure viscosity may assumed viscosity chiefly function volume liquids finite compressibility increasing viscosity rise pressure therefore expected addition volume expanded heat reduced pressure viscosity remains
local tendency orientation molecules small groups lends liquid referred previously certain degree association association results considerable internal pressure within liquid due almost entirely molecules account temporary low velocities following maxwell distribution coalesced molecules internal pressure several molecules might correspond group molecules solid form
