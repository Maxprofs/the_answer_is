historyedit
among ancient greeks several pythagorean school believed rotation earth rather apparent diurnal rotation heavens perhaps first philolaus bce though system complicated including counterearth rotating daily central fire
conventional picture supported hicetas heraclides ecphantus fourth century bce assumed earth rotated suggest earth revolved sun third century bce aristarchus samos suggested suns central place
however aristotle fourth century criticized ideas philolaus based theory rather observation established idea sphere fixed stars rotated earth accepted came particular claudius ptolemy nd century ce thought earth would devastated gales rotated
ce indian astronomer aryabhata wrote spherical earth rotates axis daily apparent movement stars relative motion caused rotation earth provided following analogy man boat going one direction sees stationary things bank moving opposite direction way man lanka xed stars appear going westward
th century muslim astronomers accepted earth rotates around axis according albiruni abu said alsijzi d circa invented astrolabe called alzraq based idea believed contemporaries motion see due earths movement sky prevalence view confirmed reference th century states according geometers engineers muhandisn earth constant circular motion appears motion heavens actually due motion earth stars treatises written discuss possibility either refutations expressing doubts ptolemys arguments maragha samarkand observatories earths rotation discussed tusi b qushji b arguments evidence used resemble used copernicus support earths motion
medieval europe thomas aquinas accepted aristotles view reluctantly john buridan nicole oresme fourteenth century nicolaus copernicus adopted heliocentric world system earths rotation begin established copernicus pointed movement earth violent movement stars must much acknowledged contribution pythagoreans pointed examples relative motion copernicus first step establishing simpler pattern planets circling central sun
tycho brahe produced accurate observations kepler based laws used copernicuss work basis system assuming stationary earth william gilbert strongly supported earths rotation treatise earths magnetism thereby influenced many contemporaries like gilbert openly support reject motion earth sun often called semicopernicans century copernicus riccioli disputed model rotating earth due lack thenobservable eastward deflections falling bodies deflections would later called coriolis effect however contributions kepler galileo newton gathered support theory rotation earth

true solar dayedit
earths rotation period relative sun true noon true noon true solar day apparent solar day depends earths orbital motion thus affected changes eccentricity inclination earths orbit vary thousands years annual variation true solar day also varies generally longer mean solar day two periods year shorter another two true solar day tends longer near perihelion sun apparently moves along ecliptic greater angle usual taking seconds longer conversely seconds shorter near aphelion seconds longer near solstice projection suns apparent movement along ecliptic onto celestial equator causes sun move greater angle usual conversely near equinox projection onto equator shorter seconds currently perihelion solstice effects combine lengthen true solar day near december mean solar seconds solstice effect partially cancelled aphelion effect near june seconds longer effects equinoxes shorten near march september seconds seconds respectively
