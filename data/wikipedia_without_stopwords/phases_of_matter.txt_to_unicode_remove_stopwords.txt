term phase sometimes used synonym state matter several immiscible phases state matter also term phase sometimes used refer set equilibrium states demarcated terms state variables pressure temperature phase boundary phase diagram phase boundaries relate changes organization matter change liquid solid subtle change one crystal structure another latter usage similar use phase synonym state matter however state matter phase diagram usages commensurate formal definition given intended meaning must determined part context term used

distinct phases may described different states matter gas liquid solid plasma boseeinstein condensate useful mesophases solid liquid form states matter
distinct phases may also exist within given state matter shown diagram iron alloys several phases exist solid liquid states phases may also differentiated based solubility polar hydrophilic nonpolar hydrophobic mixture water polar liquid oil nonpolar liquid spontaneously separate two phases water low solubility insoluble oil oil low solubility water solubility maximum amount solute dissolve solvent solute ceases dissolve remains separate phase mixture separate two liquid phases concept phase separation extends solids ie solids form solid solutions crystallize distinct crystal phases metal pairs mutually soluble form alloys whereas metal pairs mutually insoluble cannot
many eight immiscible liquid phases observed mutually immiscible liquid phases formed water aqueous phase hydrophobic organic solvents perfluorocarbons fluorous phase silicones several different metals also molten phosphorus organic solvents completely miscible eg mixture ethylene glycol toluene may separate two distinct organic phases
phases need macroscopically separate spontaneously emulsions colloids examples immiscible phase pair combinations physically separate

number phasesedit
given composition certain phases possible given temperature pressure number type phases form hard predict usually determined experiment results experiments plotted phase diagrams
