rutherford model model atom devised ernest rutherford rutherford directed famous geigermarsden experiment suggested upon rutherfords analysis j j thomsons socalled plum pudding model atom incorrect rutherfords new model atom based experimental results contained new features relatively high central charge concentrated small volume comparison rest atom central volume also containing bulk atomic mass atom region would named nucleus atom later years
experimental basis model
rutherford overturned thomsons model wellknown gold foil experiment demonstrated atom tiny heavy nucleus rutherford designed experiment use alpha particles emitted radioactive element probes unseen world atomic structure
rutherford presented physical model subatomic structure interpretation unexpected experimental results atom made central charge modern atomic nucleus though rutherford use term nucleus paper surrounded cloud presumably orbiting electrons may paper rutherford commits small central region high positive negative charge atom
concreteness consider passage high speed particle atom positive central charge n e surrounded compensating charge n electrons
purely energetic considerations far particles known speed would able penetrate toward central charge e rutherford able calculate radius gold central charge would need less much less could told x meters gold atom known meters radiusa surprising finding implied strong central charge less th diameter atom

rutherford paper suggested central charge atom might proportional atomic mass hydrogen mass units u roughly rutherfords model gold mass number known great accuracy therefore modeled rutherford possibly u however rutherford attempt make direct connection central charge atomic number since golds atomic number time merely place number periodic table rutherford modeled charge units actually suggested units positive charge make half thus rutherford formally suggest two numbers periodic table place nuclear charge might exactly
month rutherfords paper appeared proposal regarding exact identity atomic number nuclear charge made antonius van den broek later confirmed experimentally within two years henry moseley
key points
atoms electron cloud influence alpha particle scattering
much atoms positive charge concentrated relatively tiny volume center atom known today nucleus magnitude charge proportional charge number approximately half atoms atomic mass remaining mass known mostly attributed neutrons concentrated central mass charge responsible deflecting alpha beta particles
mass heavy atoms gold mostly concentrated central charge region since calculations show deflected moved high speed alpha particles high momentum comparison electrons regard heavy atom whole
atom times diameter nucleus could related putting apple middle football field
contribution modern science
rutherfords discovery scientists started realize atom ultimately single particle made far smaller subatomic particles subsequent research determined exact atomic structure led rutherfords gold foil experiment scientists eventually discovered atoms positively charged nucleus exact atomic number charges center radius x meters x atomic mass number electrons found even smaller
later scientists found expected number electrons atomic number atom using xrays xray passes atom scattered rest passes atom since xray loses intensity primarily due scattering electrons noting rate decrease xray intensity number electrons contained atom accurately estimated
