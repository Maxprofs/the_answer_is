land sometimes referred to as dry land is the solid surface of the earth that is not permanently covered by water the vast majority of human activity occurs in land areas that support agriculture habitat and various natural resources
some life forms (including terrestrial plants and terrestrial animals) have developed from predecessor species that lived in bodies of water
areas where land meets large bodies of water are called coastal zones the division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans the demarcation between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors a maritime boundary is one example of a political demarcation a variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land solid rock landforms are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun demarcation can further vary due to tides and weather
== etymology and terminologyedit ==
the word land is derived from middle english land lond and old english land lond (earth land soil ground defined piece of land territory realm province district landed property country (not town) ridge in a ploughed field) from proto-germanic *land (land) and from proto-indo-european *lend- (land heath) cognate with scots land (land) west frisian ln (land) dutch land (land) german land (land country state) swedish land (land country shore territory) icelandic land (land) non-germanic cognates include old irish lann (heath) welsh llan (enclosure) breton lann (heath) old church slavonic ld from proto-slavic *lenda (heath wasteland) and albanian lndin (heath grassland) from lnd (matter substance)
a continuous area of land surrounded by ocean is called a landmass although it may be most often written as one word to distinguish it from the usage land mass"the measure of land areait is also used as two words landmasses include supercontinents continents and islands there are four major continuous landmasses of the earth afro-eurasia americas australia and antarctica land capable of being ploughed and used to grow crops is called arable land
a country or region may be referred to as the motherland fatherland or homeland of its people many countries and other places have names incorporating -land (e.g iceland)
== history of land on earthedit ==
the earliest material found in the solar system is dated to 70171441298707200004.56720.0006 bya (billion years ago) therefore the earth itself must have been formed by accretion around this time by 70171432715040000004.540.04 bya the primordial earth had formed the formation and evolution of the solar system bodies occurred in tandem with the sun in theory a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk which the planets then grow out of in tandem with the star a nebula contains gas ice grains and dust (including primordial nuclides) in nebular theory planetesimals commence forming as particulate matter accrues by cohesive clumping and then by gravity the assembly of the primordial earth proceeded for 10701463115200000000020 myr
earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing that included water vapor the origin of the world's oceans was condensation augmented by water and ice delivered by asteroids proto-planets and comets in this model atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing while the newly forming sun was only at 70% luminosity by 70171104516000000003.5 bya the earth's magnetic field was established which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind the atmosphere and oceans of the earth continuously shape the land by eroding and transporting solids on the surface
the crust which currently forms the earth's land was created when the molten outer layer of the planet earth cooled to form a solid mass as the accumulated water vapor began to act in the atmosphere once land became capable of supporting life biodiversity evolved over hundreds of million years expanding continually except when punctuated by mass extinctions
the two models that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present-day forms or more likely a rapid growth early in earth history followed by a long-term steady continental area continents formed by plate tectonics a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from the earth's interior on time scales lasting hundreds of millions of years the supercontinents have formed and broken apart three times roughly 7016236682000000000750 mya (million years ago) one of the earliest known supercontinents rodinia began to break apart the continents later recombined to form pannotia 6007016170411040000000540 mya then finally pangaea which also broke apart 7015568036800000000180 mya
== land massedit ==
land mass refers to the total surface area of the land of a geographical region or country (which may include discontinuous pieces of land such as islands) it is written as two words to distinguish it from the usage landmass the contiguous area of land surrounded by ocean
the earth's total land mass is 148,939,063.133 km2 (57,505,693.767 sq mi) which is about 29.2% of its total surface water covers approximately 70.8% of the earth's surface mostly in the form of oceans and ice formations
== cultural perspectivesedit ==
creation myths in many religions recall a story involving the creation of the world by a supernatural deity or deities including accounts wherein the land is separated from the oceans and the air the earth itself has often been personified as a deity in particular a goddess in many cultures the mother goddess is also portrayed as a fertility deity to the aztecs earth was called tonantzin"our mother to the incas earth was called pachamama"mother earth the chinese earth goddess hou tu is similar to gaia the greek goddess personifying the earth bhuma devi is the goddess of earth in hinduism influenced by graha in norse mythology the earth giantess jr was the mother of thor and the daughter of annar ancient egyptian mythology is different from that of other cultures because earth (geb) is male and sky (nut) is female
in the past there were varying levels of belief in a flat earth the jewish conception of a flat earth is found in both biblical and post-biblical times
in early egyptian and mesopotamian thought the world was portrayed as a flat disk floating in the ocean the egyptian universe was pictured as a rectangular box with a north-south orientation and with a slightly concave surface with egypt in the center a similar model is found in the homeric account of the 8th century bc in which okeanos the personified body of water surrounding the circular surface of the earth is the begetter of all life and possibly of all gods. the biblical earth is a flat disc floating on water
the pyramid texts and coffin texts reveal that the ancient egyptians believed nun (the ocean) was a circular body surrounding nbwt (a term meaning dry lands or islands") and therefore believed in a similar ancient near eastern circular earth cosmography surrounded by water
the spherical form of the earth was suggested by early greek philosophers a belief espoused by pythagoras contrary to popular belief most people in the middle ages did not believe the earth was flat this misconception is often called the myth of the flat earth as evidenced by thinkers such as thomas aquinas the european belief in a spherical earth was widespread by this point in time prior to circumnavigation of the planet and the introduction of space flight belief in a spherical earth was based on observations of the secondary effects of the earth's shape and parallels drawn with the shape of other planets
== extraterrestrial landedit ==
most planets known to humans are either gaseous jovian planets or solid terrestrial planets terrestrial planets include mercury venus earth and mars these inner planets have a rocky surface with metal interiors the jovian planets consist of jupiter saturn uranus and neptune while these planets are larger their only land surface is a small rocky core surrounded by a large thick atmosphere the gas giants jupiter and saturn are thought to have surface layers composed of liquid hydrogen rather than solid land however their planetary geology is not well understood the possibility of uranus and neptune (the ice giants) possessing hot highly compressed supercritical water under their thick atmospheres has been hypothesised while their composition is still not fully understood a 2006 study by wiktorowicz et al ruled out the possibility of such a water ocean existing on neptune though some studies have suggested that exotic oceans of liquid diamond are possible the entire surface of a rocky planet or moon is considered land even with a lack of seas or oceans for contrast planetary bodies that have a thin atmosphere often have land that is marked by impact craters since atmospheric conditions would normally break-down incoming objects and erode rough impact sites land on planetary bodies other than earth can also be bought and sold although ownership of extraterrestrial real estate is not recognized by any authority
== land and climateedit ==
the land of the earth interacts with and influences climate heavily since the surface of the land heats up and cools down faster than air or water latitude elevation topography reflectivity and land use all have varying impacts the latitude of the land will influence how much solar radiation reaches the surface high latitudes receive less solar radiation than low latitudes the height of the land is important in creating and transforming airflow and precipitation on earth large landforms such as mountain ranges divert wind energy and make the air parcel less dense and able to hold less heat as air rises this cooling effect causes condensation and precipitation reflectivity of the earth is called planetary albedo and the type of land cover that receives energy from the sun has an impact on the amount of energy that is reflected or transferred to earth vegetation has a relatively low albedo meaning that vegetated surfaces are good absorbers of the suns energy forests have an albedo of 10-15% while grasslands have an albedo of 15-20% in comparison sandy deserts have an albedo of 25-40% land use by humans also plays a role in the regional and global climate densely populated cities are warmer and create urban heat islands that have effects on the precipitation cloud cover and temperature of the region
