choice platinum
choice platinum hydrogen electrode due several factors
inertness platinum corrode
capability platinum catalyze reaction proton reduction
high intrinsic exchange current density proton reduction platinum
excellent reproducibility potential bias less v two wellmade hydrogen electrodes compared one another
surface platinum platinized ie covered platinum black
increase total surface area improves reaction kinetics maximum possible current
use surface material adsorbs hydrogen well interface also improves reaction kinetics
metals used building electrodes similar function palladiumhydrogen electrode
interference
