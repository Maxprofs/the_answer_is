masaya nakamura founded the company as nakamura manufacturing in 1955 based in tokyo the company started out by running children's rides on the roof of a department store in yokohama the business eventually expanded throughout the tokyo area nakamura manufacturing was reorganized in 1958 and later underwent a name change to nakamura amusement machine manufacturing company which would be used to form the acronym namco. in 1970 the company produced a coin-operated mechanical driving simulator called racer.
atari japan the tokyo-based subsidiary of atari was struggling financially by 1974 general manager hide nakajima was left in charge of the company after his boss had quit nakajima claims that employees had been stealing money and that he had contributed funds from his personal savings in order to pay creditors and stave off bankruptcy though nakajima wanted to try saving atari japan owner nolan bushnell was already struggling to keep the parent company afloat due to undercapitalization and was looking to sell the japanese subsidiary for some badly needed cash sega then a manufacturer of pinball machines offered to acquire atari japan for $50,000 nakamura put in a bid for $800,000 and shocked others out of competition the deal was finalized at $500,000 and bushnell was glad to take it debts inherited from atari japan would take nakamura two years to pay off but the deal had also secured for him an exclusive license to distribute atari's games in japan for ten years nakamura would follow up by opening video arcades featuring atari games
everyone thought [nakamura] was mad when he paid so much for atari but it turned out to be a very wise investment
nakajima was promoted to vice president in 1978 and on his recommendation namco opened a subsidiary namco america in the united states the location he chose was across the street from atari's former headquarters in sunnyvale california at the time games were not released in the u.s under the namco label namco america existed mainly to license namco's games to companies such as atari and midway games for distribution in the u.s
namco's first original video game was gee bee (1978) galaxian (1979) revolutionized the industry as the first video game to use rgb color graphics it was pac-man (1980) however that would become definitive of namco's legacy going on to become a fixture in popular culture galaga (1981) a follow-up to galaxian was one of the most successful sequels of the era dig dug (1982) xevious (1982) and pole position (1982) continued namco's success in establishing iconic franchises during the golden age during this period as namco entered the console software publishing business in earnest it created the short-lived namco home entertainment (shortened to namcot) a separate division intended to handle console game releases

by 1989 games for the nintendo entertainment system accounted for 40% of namco's sales as nintendo's first licensee namco had previously been given privileged terms such as the right to manufacture their own cartridges however upon renewal of the license these special terms were revoked prompting nakamura to publicly criticize nintendo for monopolistic behavior in addition nakamura announced that namco would support sega's mega drive/genesis console which eventually received most of the better productions the company developed for the home market in the 16-bit era
