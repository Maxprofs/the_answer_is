in physical geography tundra is type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons the term tundra comes through russian from the kildin sami word tndr uplands treeless mountain tract there are three types of tundra arctic tundra alpine tundra and antarctic tundra in tundra the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs sedges and grasses mosses and lichens scattered trees grow in some tundra regions the ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline
== arctic ==
arctic tundra occurs in the far northern hemisphere north of the taiga belt the word tundra usually refers only to the areas where the subsoil is permafrost or permanently frozen soil (it may also refer to the treeless plain in general so that northern spmi would be included.) permafrost tundra includes vast areas of northern russia and canada the polar tundra is home to several peoples who are mostly nomadic reindeer herders such as the nganasan and nenets in the permafrost area (and the sami in spmi)
arctic tundra contains areas of stark landscape and is frozen for much of the year the soil there is frozen from 2590 cm (1035 in) down and it is impossible for trees to grow instead bare and sometimes rocky land can only support low growing plants such as moss heath (ericaceae varieties such as crowberry and black bearberry) and lichen there are two main seasons winter and summer in the polar tundra areas during the winter it is very cold and dark with the average temperature around 28 c (18 f) sometimes dipping as low as 50 c (58 f) however extreme cold temperatures on the tundra do not drop as low as those experienced in taiga areas further south (for example russia's and canada's lowest temperatures were recorded in locations south of the tree line) during the summer temperatures rise somewhat and the top layer of seasonally-frozen soil melts leaving the ground very soggy the tundra is covered in marshes lakes bogs and streams during the warm months generally daytime temperatures during the summer rise to about 12 c (54 f) but can often drop to 3 c (37 f) or even below freezing arctic tundras are sometimes the subject of habitat conservation programs in canada and russia many of these areas are protected through a national biodiversity action plan
tundra tends to be windy with winds often blowing upwards of 50100 km/h (3060 mph) however in terms of precipitation it is desert-like with only about 1525 cm (610 in) falling per year (the summer is typically the season of maximum precipitation) although precipitation is light evaporation is also relatively minimal during the summer the permafrost thaws just enough to let plants grow and reproduce but because the ground below this is frozen the water cannot sink any lower and so the water forms the lakes and marshes found during the summer months there is a natural pattern of accumulation of fuel and wildfire which varies depending on the nature of vegetation and terrain research in alaska has shown fire-event return intervals (fris) that typically vary from 150 to 200 years with dryer lowland areas burning more frequently than wetter highland areas
the biodiversity of tundra is low 1,700 species of vascular plants and only 48 species of land mammals can be found although millions of birds migrate there each year for the marshes there are also a few fish species there are few species with large populations notable animals in the arctic tundra include caribou (reindeer) musk ox arctic hare arctic fox snowy owl lemmings and polar bears (only near ocean-fed bodies of water) tundra is largely devoid of poikilotherms such as frogs or lizards
due to the harsh climate of arctic tundra regions of this kind have seen little human activity even though they are sometimes rich in natural resources such as oil and uranium in recent times this has begun to change in alaska russia and some other parts of the world
=== relationship with global warming ===
a severe threat to tundra is global warming which causes permafrost to melt the melting of the permafrost in a given area on human time scales (decades or centuries) could radically change which species can survive there
another concern is that about one third of the world's soil-bound carbon is in taiga and tundra areas when the permafrost melts it releases carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and methane both of which are greenhouse gases the effect has been observed in alaska in the 1970s the tundra was a carbon sink but today it is a carbon source methane is produced when vegetation decays in lakes and wetlands
the amount of greenhouse gases which will be released under projected scenarios for global warming have not been reliably quantified by scientific studies although a few studies were reported to be underway in 2011 it is uncertain whether the impact of increased greenhouse gases from this source will be minimal or massive
in locations where dead vegetation and peat has accumulated there is a risk of wildfire such as the 1,039 square kilometres (401 sq mi) of tundra which burned in 2007 on the north slope of the brooks range in alaska such events may both result from and contribute to global warming
== antarctic ==
antarctic tundra occurs on antarctica and on several antarctic and subantarctic islands including south georgia and the south sandwich islands and the kerguelen islands most of antarctica is too cold and dry to support vegetation and most of the continent is covered by ice fields however some portions of the continent particularly the antarctic peninsula have areas of rocky soil that support plant life the flora presently consists of around 300400 lichens 100 mosses 25 liverworts and around 700 terrestrial and aquatic algae species which live on the areas of exposed rock and soil around the shore of the continent antarctica's two flowering plant species the antarctic hair grass (deschampsia antarctica) and antarctic pearlwort (colobanthus quitensis) are found on the northern and western parts of the antarctic peninsula in contrast with the arctic tundra the antarctic tundra lacks a large mammal fauna mostly due to its physical isolation from the other continents sea mammals and sea birds including seals and penguins inhabit areas near the shore and some small mammals like rabbits and cats have been introduced by humans to some of the subantarctic islands the antipodes subantarctic islands tundra ecoregion includes the bounty islands auckland islands antipodes islands the campbell island group and macquarie island species endemic to this ecoregion include nematoceras dienemum and nematoceras sulcatum the only subantarctic orchids the royal penguin and the antipodean albatross
the flora and fauna of antarctica and the antarctic islands (south of 60 south latitude) are protected by the antarctic treaty
== alpine ==
alpine tundra does not contain trees because the climate and soils at high altitude block tree growth alpine tundra is distinguished from arctic tundra in that alpine tundra typically does not have permafrost and alpine soils are generally better drained than arctic soils alpine tundra transitions to subalpine forests below the tree line stunted forests occurring at the forest-tundra ecotone are known as krummholz
alpine tundra occurs in mountains worldwide the flora of the alpine tundra is characterized by dwarf shrubs close to the ground the cold climate of the alpine tundra is caused by the low air temperatures and is similar to polar climate
== climatic classification ==
tundra climates ordinarily fit the kppen climate classification et signifying a local climate in which at least one month has an average temperature high enough to melt snow (0 c (32 f)) but no month with an average temperature in excess of 10 c (50 f) the cold limit generally meets the ef climates of permanent ice and snows the warm-summer limit generally corresponds with the poleward or altitudinal limit of trees where they grade into the subarctic climates designated dfd and dwd (extreme winters as in parts of siberia) dfc typical in alaska canada parts of scandinavia european russia and western siberia (cold winters with months of freezing) or even cfc (no month colder than 3 c (27 f) as in parts of iceland and southernmost south america) tundra climates as a rule are hostile to woody vegetation even where the winters are comparatively mild by polar standards as in iceland
despite the potential diversity of climates in the et category involving precipitation extreme temperatures and relative wet and dry seasons this category is rarely subdivided rainfall and snowfall are generally slight due to the low vapor pressure of water in the chilly atmosphere but as a rule potential evapotranspiration is extremely low allowing soggy terrain of swamps and bogs even in places that get precipitation typical of deserts of lower and middle latitudes the amount of native tundra biomass depends more on the local temperature than the amount of precipitation
