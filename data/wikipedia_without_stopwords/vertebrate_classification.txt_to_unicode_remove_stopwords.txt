reptilian changes adaptations diet geography chronicled fossil record varying forms therapsida true mammals showed triassic period ma around time dinosaurs also sprouted reptilian line

history
one people helped figure vertebrate progression french zoologist georges cuvier realized fossils found older rock strata differed greatly recent fossils modern animals published findings although steadfastly refuted evolution work proved time contested theory extinction species
thomas jefferson credited initiating science vertebrate paleontology united states reading paper american philosophical society philadelphia jefferson presented fossil bones ground sloth found cave western virginia named genus megalonyx species ultimately named megalonyx jeffersonii honor jefferson corresponded cuvier including sending shipment highly desirable bones american mastodon woolly mammoth
paleontology really got started though publication recherches sur les poissons fossils swiss naturalist louis agassiz studied described listed hundreds species fossil fish beginning serious study lives extinct animals publication origin species charles darwin field got theoretical framework much subsequent work map relationship fossil extant organisms well history time
modern times alfred romer wrote termed definitive textbook subject called vertebrate paleontology shows progression evolution fossil fish amphibians reptiles comparative anatomy including list known fossil vertebrate genera romer became first president society vertebrate paleontology alongside cofounder howard chiu updated work largely carried tradition romer many considered definitive book subject written robert l carroll mcgill university text vertebrate paleontology evolution carroll president society vertebrate paleontology society keeps members informed latest discoveries newsletters journal vertebrate paleontology
paleontological vertebrate classification
traditional vertebrate classification scheme employ evolutionary taxonomy several taxa listed paraphyletic ie given rise another taxa given rank instance birds generally considered descendants reptiles saurischian dinosaurs precise system listed separate classes phylogenetic nomenclature arrangement unacceptable though offers excellent overview
classical scheme still used works systematic overview essential eg benton hildebrand goslow knobill neill mostly seen general works also still used specialist works like fortuny al
