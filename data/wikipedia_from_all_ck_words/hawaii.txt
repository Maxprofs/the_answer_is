hawaii (english pronunciation /hwai/ h-wy-(y)ee locally [hw()i] hawaiian hawaii [hvji]) is the 50th and most recent u.s state to join the united states having joined on august 21 1959 hawaii is the only u.s state located in oceania and the only one composed entirely of islands it is the northernmost island group in polynesia occupying most of an archipelago in the central pacific ocean hawaii is the only u.s state not located in the americas the state does not observe daylight saving time
the state encompasses nearly the entire volcanic hawaiian archipelago which comprises hundreds of islands spread over 1,500 miles (2,400 km) at the southeastern end of the archipelago the eight main islands arein order from northwest to southeast niihau kauai oahu molokai lnai kahoolawe maui and the island of hawaii the last is the largest island in the group it is often called the big island or hawaii island to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago the archipelago is physiographically and ethnologically part of the polynesian subregion of oceania
hawaii's diverse natural scenery warm tropical climate abundance of public beaches oceanic surroundings and active volcanoes make it a popular destination for tourists surfers biologists and volcanologists because of its central location in the pacific and 19th-century labor migration hawaii's culture is strongly influenced by north american and asian cultures in addition to its indigenous hawaiian culture hawaii has over a million permanent residents along with many visitors and u.s military personnel its capital is honolulu on the island of oahu
hawaii is the 8th-smallest and the 11th-least populous but the 13th-most densely populated of the fifty u.s states it is the only state with an asian plurality the state's coastline is about 750 miles (1,210 km) long the fourth longest in the u.s after the coastlines of alaska florida and california
== etymology ==
the state of hawaii derives its name from the name of its largest island hawaii a common hawaiian explanation of the name of hawaii is that was named for hawaiiloa a legendary figure from hawaiian myth he is said to have discovered the islands when they were first settled
the hawaiian language word hawaii is very similar to proto-polynesian *sawaiki with the reconstructed meaning homeland cognates of hawaii are found in other polynesian languages including mori (hawaiki) rarotongan (avaiki) and samoan (savaii)  according to linguists pukui and elbert [e]lsewhere in polynesia hawaii or a cognate is the name of the underworld or of the ancestral home but in hawaii the name has no meaning
=== spelling of state name ===
a somewhat divisive political issue arose in 1978 when the constitution of the state of hawaii added hawaiian as a second official state language the title of the state constitution is the constitution of the state of hawaii article xv section 1 of the constitution uses the state of hawaii diacritics were not used because the document drafted in 1949 predates the use of the okina () and the kahak in modern hawaiian orthography the exact spelling of the state's name in the islands language is hawaii in the hawaii admission act that granted hawaiian statehood the federal government recognized hawaii as the official state name official government publications as well as department and office titles use the traditional hawaiian spelling with no symbols for glottal stops or vowel length in contrast the national and state parks services the university of hawaii and some private enterprises implement these symbols a precedent for changes to u.s state names was set in 1780 when the massachusetts bay state changed its name to the commonwealth of massachusetts and in the 1820s when the territory of arkansaw changed the spelling of its name to the territory of arkansas
== geography and environment ==
there are eight main hawaiian islands seven of which are permanently inhabited the island of niihau is privately managed by brothers bruce and keith robinson access is restricted to those who have permission from the island's owners
=== topography ===
the hawaiian archipelago is located 2,000 mi (3,200 km) southwest of the continental united states hawaii is the southernmost u.s state and the second westernmost after alaska hawaii along with alaska does not border any other u.s state it is the only u.s state that is not geographically located in north america the only state completely surrounded by water and that is entirely an archipelago and the only state in which coffee is cultivable
in addition to the eight main islands the state has many smaller islands and islets kaula is a small island near niihau that is often overlooked the northwest hawaiian islands is a group of nine small older islands to the northwest of kauai that extend from nihoa to kure atoll these are remnants of once much larger volcanic mountains across the archipelago are around 130 small rocks and islets such as molokini which are either volcanic marine sedimentary or erosional in origin
hawaii's tallest mountain mauna kea is 13,796 ft (4,205 m) above mean sea level it is taller than mount everest if measured from the base of the mountain which lies on the floor of the pacific ocean and rises about 33,500 feet (10,200 m)
=== geology ===
the hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an undersea magma source called the hawaii hotspot the process is continuing to build islands the tectonic plate beneath much of the pacific ocean continually moves northwest and the hot spot remains stationary slowly creating new volcanoes because of the hotspot's location all currently-active land volcanoes are located on the southern half of hawaii island the newest volcano lihi seamount is located south of the coast of hawaii island
the last volcanic eruption outside hawaii island occurred at haleakal on maui before the late 18th century though it could have been hundreds of years earlier in 1790 klauea exploded it was the deadliest eruption known to have occurred in the modern era in what is now the united states up to 5,405 warriors and their families marching on klauea were killed by the eruption volcanic activity and subsequent erosion have created impressive geological features hawaii island has the third-highest point among the world's islands
on the flanks of the volcanoes slope instability has generated damaging earthquakes and related tsunamis particularly in 1868 and 1975 steep cliffs have been created by catastrophic debris avalanches on the submerged flanks of ocean island volcanoes
=== flora and fauna ===
because the islands of hawaii are distant from other land habitats life is thought to have arrived there by wind waves (i.e by ocean currents) and wings (i.e birds insects and any seeds they may have carried on their feathers) this isolation in combination with the diverse environment (including extreme altitudes tropical climates and arid shorelines) produced an array of endemic flora and fauna hawaii has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other u.s state one endemic plant brighamia now requires hand-pollination because its natural pollinator is presumed to be extinct the two species of brighamiab rockii and b insignisare represented in the wild by around 120 individual plants to ensure these plants set seed biologists rappel down 3,000-foot (910 m) cliffs to brush pollen onto their stigmas
the extant main islands of the archipelago have been above the surface of the ocean for fewer than 10 million years a fraction of the time biological colonization and evolution have occurred there the islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on high mountains within a trade winds field on a single island the climate around the coasts can range from dry tropical (less than 20 inches or 510 millimetres annual rainfall) to wet tropical on the slopes envionments range from tropical rainforest (more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimetres per year) through a temperate climate to alpine conditions with a cold dry climate the rainy climate impacts soil development which largely determines ground permeability affecting the distribution of streams and wetlands
=== protected areas ===
several areas in hawaii are under the protection of the national park service hawaii has two national parks haleakala national park located near kula on the island of maui which features the dormant volcano haleakal that formed east maui and hawaii volcanoes national park in the southeast region of the hawaii island which includes the active volcano klauea and its rift zones
there are three national historical parks kalaupapa national historical park in kalaupapa molokai the site of a former leper colony kaloko-honokhau national historical park in kailua-kona on hawaii island and puuhonua o hnaunau national historical park an ancient place of refuge on hawaii island's west coast other areas under the control of the national park service include ala kahakai national historic trail on hawaii island and the uss arizona memorial at pearl harbor on oahu
the papahnaumokukea marine national monument was proclaimed by president george w bush on june 15 2006 the monument covers roughly 140,000 square miles (360,000 km2) of reefs atolls and shallow and deep sea out to 50 miles (80 km) offshore in the pacific oceanan area larger than all of the national parks in the u.s combined
=== climate ===
hawaii's climate is typical for the tropics although temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme because of near-constant trade winds from the east summer highs usually reach around 88 f (31 c) during the day and 75 f (24 c) at night winter day temperatures are usually around 83 f (28 c) at low elevation they seldom dip below 65 f (18 c) at night snow not usually associated with the tropics falls at 13,800 feet (4,200 m) on mauna kea and mauna loa on hawaii island in some winter months snow rarely falls on haleakal mount waialeale on kauai has the second-highest average annual rainfall on earth about 460 inches (12,000 mm) per year most of hawaii experiences only two seasons the dry season runs from may to october and the wet season is from october to april
the warmest temperature recorded in the state in pahala on april 27 1931 is 100 f (38 c) making it tied with alaska as the lowest high temperature recorded in a u.s state hawaii's record low temperature is 12 f (11 c) observed in may 1979 on the summit of mauna kea hawaii is the only state to have never recorded sub-zero fahrenheit temperatures
climates vary considerably on each island they can be divided into windward and leeward (koolau and kona respectively) areas based upon location relative to the higher mountains windward sides face cloud cover
=== antipodes ===
hawaii is the only u.s state that is antipodal to inhabited land most of the state lies opposite botswana though niihau's antipode aligns with namibia and kauai's straddles the botswananamibia border this area of africa near maun botswana and ghanzi includes nature reserves and small settlements near the okavango delta
== history ==
hawaii is one of four u.s statesapart from the original thirteenthe vermont republic (1791) the republic of texas (1845) and the california republic (1846)that were independent nations prior to statehood along with texas hawaii had formal international diplomatic recognition as a nation
the kingdom of hawaii was sovereign from 1810 until 1893 when the monarchy was overthrown by resident american and european capitalists and landholders in a coup d'tat hawaii was an independent republic from 1894 until august 12 1898 when it officially became a territory of the united states hawaii was admitted as a u.s state on august 21 1959
=== first human settlement ancient hawaii (8001778) ===
based on archaeological evidence the earliest habitation of the hawaiian islands dates to around 300 ce probably by polynesian settlers from the marquesas islands a second wave of migration from raiatea and bora bora took place in the 11th century the date of the human discovery and habitation of the hawaiian islands is the subject of academic debate some archaeologists and historians believe there was an early settlement from the marquesas they think it was a later wave of immigrants from tahiti around 1000 ce who introduced a new line of high chiefs the kapu system the practice of human sacrifice and the building of heiau this later immigration is detailed in hawaiian mythology (moolelo) about paao other authors say there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a later influx of tahitian settlers and that paao must be regarded as a myth
the history of the islands is marked by a slow steady growth in population and the size of the chiefdoms which grew to encompass whole islands local chiefs called alii ruled their settlements and launched wars to extend their influence and defend their communities from predatory rivals ancient hawaii was a caste-based society much like that of hindus in india
=== european arrival ===
it is possible that spanish explorers arrived in the hawaiian islands in the 16th century200 years before captain james cook's first documented visit in 1778 ruy lpez de villalobos commanded a fleet of six ships that left acapulco in 1542 bound for the philippines with a spanish sailor named juan gaetano aboard as pilot depending on the interpretation gaetano's reports describe an encounter with either hawaii or the marshall islands if de villalobos crew spotted hawaii gaetano would be considered the first european to see the islands some scholars have dismissed these claims due to a lack of credibility
spanish archives contain a chart that depicts islands at the same latitude as hawaii but with a longitude ten degrees east of the islands in this manuscript the island of maui is named la desgraciada (the unfortunate island) and what appears to be hawaii island is named la mesa (the table) islands resembling kahoolawe lanai and molokai are named los monjes (the monks) for two-and-a-half centuries spanish galleons crossed the pacific from mexico along a route that passed south of hawaii on their way to manila the exact route was kept secret to protect the spanish trade monopoly against competing powers
the 1778 arrival of british explorer james cook was the first documented contact by a european explorer with hawaii cook named the archipelago as the sandwich islands in honor of his sponsor john montagu 4th earl of sandwich cook published the islands location and rendered the native name as owyhee this spelling lives on in owyhee county idaho it was named after three native hawaiian members of a trapping party who went missing in that area the owyhee mountains were also named for them
cook visited the hawaiian islands twice as he prepared for departure after his second visit in 1779 a quarrel ensued as cook took temple idols and fencing as firewood and a minor chief and his men took a ship's boat cook abducted the king of hawaii island kalanipuu and held him for ransom aboard his ship in order to gain return of cook's boat this tactic had worked in tahiti and other islands instead kalanipuu's supporters fought back killing cook and four marines as cook's party retreated along the beach to their ship they departed without the ship's boat
after cook's visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages the hawaiian islands attracted many european visitors explorers traders and eventually whalers who found the islands to be a convenient harbor and source of supplies early british influence can be seen in the design of the flag of hawaii which bears the union jack in the top-left corner these visitors introduced diseases to the once-isolated islands causing the hawaiian population to drop precipitously native hawaiians had no resistance to eurasian diseases such as influenza smallpox and measles by 1820 disease famine and wars between the chiefs killed more than half of the native hawaiian population during the 1850s measles killed a fifth of hawaii's people
historical records indicated the earliest chinese immigrants to hawaii originated from guangdong province a few sailors arrived in 1778 with captain cook's journey and more arrived in 1789 with an american trader who settled in hawaii in the late 18th century it appears that leprosy was introduced by chinese workers by 1830 as with the other new infectious diseases it proved damaging to the hawaiians
=== kingdom of hawaii ===
==== house of kamehameha ====
during the 1780s and 1790s chiefs often fought for power after a series of battles that ended in 1795 all inhabited islands were subjugated under a single ruler who became known as king kamehameha the great he established the house of kamehameha a dynasty that ruled the kingdom until 1872
after kamehameha ii inherited the throne in 1819 american protestant missionaries to hawaii converted many hawaiians to christianity they used their influence to end many traditional practices of the people the islands first christan king was kamehameha iii hiram bingham i a prominent protestant missionary was a trusted adviser to the monarchy during this period other missionaries and their descendants became active in commercial and political affairs leading to conflicts between the monarchy and its restive american subjects catholic and mormon missionaries were also active in the kingdom but they converted a minority of the native hawaiian population missionaries from each major group administered to the leper colony at kalaupapa on molokai which was established in 1866 and operated well into the 20th century the best known were father damien and mother marianne cope both of whom were canonized in the early 21st century as roman catholic saints
the death of the bachelor king kamehameha vwho did not name an heirresulted in the popular election of lunalilo over kalkaua lunalilo died the next year also without naming an heir in 1874 the election was contested within the legislature between kalkaua and emma queen consort of kamehameha iv after riots broke out the united states and britain landed troops on the islands to restore order governance passed to the house of kalkaua
==== 1887 constitution and overthrow preparations ====
in 1887 kalkaua was forced to sign the 1887 constitution of the kingdom of hawaii drafted by white businessmen and lawyers the document stripped the king of much of his authority it established a property qualification for voting that effectively disenfranchised most hawaiians and immigrant laborers and favored the wealthier white elite resident whites were allowed to vote but resident asians were not because the 1887 constitution was signed under threat of violence it is known as the bayonet constitution king kalkaua reduced to a figurehead reigned until his death in 1891 his sister queen liliuokalani succeeded him she was the last monarch of hawaii
in 1893 queen liliuokalani announced plans for a new constitution on january 14 1893 a group of mostly euro-american business leaders and residents formed the committee of safety to stage a coup d'tat against the kingdom and seek annexation by the united states united states government minister john l stevens responding to a request from the committee of safety summoned a company of u.s marines according to historian william russ these troops effectively rendered the monarchy unable to protect itself
=== overthrow of 1893the republic of hawaii (18941898) ===
in january 1893 queen liliuokalani was overthrown and replaced by a provisional government composed of members of the american committee of safety american lawyer sanford b dole became president of the republic when the provisional government of hawaii ended on july 4 1894 controversy ensued in the following years as the queen tried to regain her throne the administration of president grover cleveland commissioned the blount report which concluded that the removal of liliuokalani had been illegal the u.s government first demanded that queen liliuokalani be reinstated but the provisional government refused
congress conducted an independent investigation and on february 26 1894 submitted the morgan report which found all parties including minister stevenswith the exception of the queen"not guilty and not responsible for the coup partisans on both sides of the debate questioned the accuracy and impartiality of both the blount and morgan reports over the events of 1893
in 1993 the us congress passed a joint apology resolution regarding the overthrow it was signed by president bill clinton the resolution apologized for the overthrow of the hawaiian kingdom and acknowledged that the united states had annexed hawaii unlawfully
=== annexationthe territory of hawaii (18981959) ===
after william mckinley won the 1896 u.s presidential election advocates pressed to annex hawaii the previous president grover cleveland was a friend of queen liliuokalani mckinley was open to persuasion by u.s expansionists and by annexationists from hawaii he met with three annexationists lorrin a thurston francis march hatch and william ansel kinney after negotiations in june 1897 secretary of state john sherman agreed to a treaty of annexation with these representatives of the republic of hawaii the u.s senate never ratified the treaty despite the opposition of most native hawaiians the newlands resolution was used to annex the republic to the u.s. it became the territory of hawaii the newlands resolution was passed by the house on june 15 1898 by 209 votes in favor to 91 against and by the senate on july 6 1898 by a vote of 42 to 21
in 1900 hawaii was granted self-governance and retained iolani palace as the territorial capitol building despite several attempts to become a state hawaii remained a territory for sixty years plantation owners and capitalists who maintained control through financial institutions such as the big five found territorial status convenient because they remained able to import cheap foreign labor such immigration and labor practices were prohibited in many states
puerto rican immigration to hawaii began in 1899 when puerto rico's sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes causing a worldwide shortage of sugar and a huge demand for sugar from hawaii hawaiian sugar plantation owners began to recruit experienced unemployed laborers in puerto rico two waves of korean immigration to hawaii occurred in the 20th century the first wave arrived between 1903 and 1924 the second wave began in 1965 after president lyndon b johnson signed the immigration and nationality act of 1965 into law
oahu was the target of a surprise attack on pearl harbor by imperial japan on december 7 1941 the attack on pearl harbor and other military and naval installations carried out by aircraft and by midget submarines brought the united states into world war ii
=== political changes of 1954the state of hawaii (1959present) ===
in the 1950s the power of the plantation owners was broken by the descendants of immigrant laborers who were born in the incorporated u.s territory and were u.s citizens they voted against the hawaii republican party strongly supported by plantation owners the new majority voted for the democratic party of hawaii which dominated territorial and state politics for more than 40 years eager to gain full voting rights hawaii's residents actively campaigned for statehood
in march 1959 congress passed the hawaii admission act which u.s president dwight d eisenhower signed into law the act excluded palmyra atoll from statehood it had been part of the kingdom and territory of hawaii on june 27 1959 a referendum asked residents of hawaii to vote on the statehood bill 94.3% voted in favor of statehood and 5.7% opposed it the referendum asked voters to choose between accepting the act and remaining a u.s territory the united nations special committee on decolonization later removed hawaii from its list of self-governing territories
after attaining statehood hawaii quickly modernized through construction and a rapidly growing tourism economy later state programs promoted hawaiian culture the hawaii state constitutional convention of 1978 created institutions such as the office of hawaiian affairs to promote indigenous language and culture
== demographics ==
=== population ===
after the arrival of europeans and americans the population of hawaii fell dramatically until an influx of primarily asian settlers arrived as migrant laborers at the end of the 19th century
the united states census bureau estimates the population of hawaii was 1,419,561 on july 1 2014 an increase of 4.36% since the 2010 united states census as of 2014 hawaii had an estimated population of 1,419,561 an increase of 15,507 from the previous year and an increase of 59,260 (4.36%) since 2010 this includes a natural increase of 48,111 (96,028 births minus 47,917 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 16,956 people into the state immigration from outside the united states resulted in a net increase of 30,068 migration within the country produced a net loss of 13,112 people the center of population of hawaii is located between the two islands of o'ahu and moloka'i large numbers of native hawaiians have moved to las vegas which has been called the ninth island of hawaii
hawaii has a de facto population of over 1.4 million due in part to a large number of military settlers and tourist residents o'ahu is the most populous island it has the highest population density with a resident population of just under one million in 597 square miles (1,546 km2) about 1,650 people per square mile hawaii's 1.4 million residents spread across 6,000 square miles (15,500 km2) of land results in an average population density of 188.6 persons per square mile the state has a lower population density than ohio and illinois
the average projected lifespan of people born in hawaii in 2000 is 79.8 years 77.1 years if male 82.5 if femalelonger than the average lifespan of any other u.s state as of 2011 the u.s military reported it had 42,371 personnel on the islands
=== race and ethnicity ===
according to the 2010 united states census hawaii had a population of 1,360,301 the state's population identified as 38.6% asian 24.7% white (22.7% non-hispanic white alone) 23.6% from two or more races 10.0% native hawaiians and other pacific islanders 8.9% hispanics and latinos of any race 1.6% black or african american 1.2% from some other race and 0.3% native american and alaska native
hawaii has the highest percentage of asian americans and multiracial americans and the lowest percentage of white americans of any state it is the only state where asian americans identify as the largest ethnic group in 2011 14.5% of births were to white non-hispanic parents hawaii's asian population consists mainly of 198,000 (14.6%) filipino americans 185,000 (13.6%) japanese americans roughly 55,000 (4.0%) chinese americans and 24,000 (1.8%) korean americans there are over 80,000 indigenous hawaiians5.9% of the population including those with partial ancestry samoan americans comprise 2.8% of hawaii's population and tongan americans comprise 0.6%
over 120,000 (8.8%) of hispanic and latino americans live in hawaii mexican americans number over 35,000 (2.6%) puerto ricans exceed 44,000 (3.2%) multiracial americans comprise almost 25% of hawaii's population exceeding 320,000 people eurasian americans are a prominent mixed-race group numbering about 66,000 (4.9%) the non-hispanic white population numbers around 310,000just over 20% of the population the multi-racial population outnumbers the non-hispanic white population by about 10,000 people in 1970 the census bureau reported hawaii's population was 38.8% white and 57.7% asian and pacific islander
the five largest european ancestries in hawaii are german (7.4%) irish (5.2%) english (4.6%) portuguese (4.3%) and italian (2.7%) about 82.2% of the state's residents were born in the united states roughly 75% of foreign-born residents originate in asia hawaii is a majority-minority state it is expected to be one of three states that will not have a non-hispanic white plurality in 2014 the other two are california and new mexico
=== ancestry groups ===
the third group of foreigners to arrive in hawaii were from china chinese workers on western trading ships settled in hawaii starting in 1789 in 1820 the first american missionaries arrived to preach christianity and teach the hawaiians western ways as of 2015 a large proportion of hawaii's population have asian ancestryespecially filipino japanese and chinese many are descendants of immigrants brought to work on the sugar plantations in the md-to-late 19th century the first 153 japanese immigrants arrived in hawaii on june 19 1868 they were not legally approved by the japanese government because the contract was between a broker and the tokugawa shogunateby then replaced by the meiji restoration the first japanese government-approved immigrants arrived on february 9 1885 after kalkaua's petition to emperor meiji when kalkaua visited japan in 1881
almost 13,000 portuguese migrants had arrived by 1899 they also worked on the sugar plantations by 1901 over 5,000 puerto ricans were living in hawaii
=== languages ===
english (general american) and hawaiian are listed as hawaii's official languages in the state's 1978 constitution article xv section 4 specifies that hawaiian shall be required for public acts and transactions only as provided by law hawaii creole english locally referred to as pidgin is the native language of many native residents and is a second language for many others
as of the 2000 census 73.44% of hawaii residents aged five and older exclusively speak english at home according to the 2008 american community survey 74.6% of hawaii's residents over the age of five speak only english at home in their homes 21.0% of state residents speak an additional asian language 2.6% speak spanish 1.6% speak other indo-european languages and 0.2% speak an other language
after english other languages popularly spoken in the state are tagalog japanese and ilokano significant numbers of european immigrants and their descendants also speak their native languages the most numerous are german portuguese italian and french 5.37% of residents speak tagalogwhich includes non-native speakers of filipino language the national co-official tagalog-based language 4.96% speak japanese and 4.05% speak ilokano 1.2% speak chinese 1.68% speak hawaiian 1.66% speak spanish 1.61% speak korean and 1.01% speak samoan
==== hawaiian ====
the hawaiian language has about 2,000 native speakers less than 0.1% of the total population according to the united states census there were over 24,000 total speakers of the language in hawaii in 2006-2008 hawaiian is a polynesian member of the austronesian language family it is closely related to other polynesian languages such as marquesan tahitian mori rapa nui (the language of easter island) and less closely to samoan and tongan
according to schtz the marquesans colonized the archipelago in roughly 300 ce and were later followed by waves of seafarers from the society islands samoa and tonga
these polynesians remained in the islands they eventually became the hawaiian people and their languages evolved into the hawaiian language kimura and wilson say [l]inguists agree that hawaiian is closely related to eastern polynesian with a particularly strong link in the southern marquesas and a secondary link in tahiti which may be explained by voyaging between the hawaiian and society islands before the arrival of captain james cook the hawaiian language had no written form that form was developed mainly by american protestant |missionaries between 1820 and 1826 they assigned to the hawaiian phonemes letters from the latin alphabet
interest in hawaiian increased significantly in the late 20th century with the help of the office of hawaiian affairs specially designated immersion schools in which all subjects would be taught in hawaiian were established the university of hawaii developed a hawaiian language graduate studies program municipal codes were altered to favor hawaiian place and street names for new civic developments a sign language for the deaf based on the hawaiian language has been in use in the islands since the early 1800s hawaii sign language is now nearly extinct
hawaiian distinguishes between long and short vowel sounds in modern practice vowel length is indicated with a macron (kahak) hawaiian-language newspapers (npepa) published from 1834 to 1948 and traditional native speakers of hawaiian generally omit the marks in their own writing the okina and kahak are intended to help non-native speakers the hawaiian language uses the glottal stop (okina) as a consonant it is written as a symbol similar to the apostrophe or left-hanging (opening) single quotation mark
==== hawaiian pidgin ====
some residents of hawaii speak hawaii creole english (hce) endonymically called pidgin or pidgin english the lexicon of hce derives mainly from english but also uses words that have derived from hawaiian chinese japanese portuguese ilocano and tagalog during the 19th century the increase in immigrationmainly from china japan portugalespecially from the azores and madeira and spaincatalyzed the development of a hybrid variant of english known to its speakers as pidgin by the early 20th century pidgin speakers had children who acquired it as their first language hce speakers use some hawaiian words without those words being considered archaic most place names are retained from hawaiian as are some names for plants and animals for example tuna fish is often called by its hawaiian name ahi
hce speakers have modified the meanings of some english words for example aunty and uncle may either refer to any adult who is a friend or be used to show respect to an elder syntax and grammar follow distinctive rules different from those of general american english for example instead of it is hot today isn't it? an hce speaker would say simply stay hot eh? the term da kine is used as a filler a substitute for virtually any word or phrase during the surfing boom in hawaii hce was influenced by surfer slang some hce expressions such as brah and da kine have found their ways elsewhere through surfing communities

== economy ==
the history of hawaii's economy can be traced through a succession of dominant industries sandalwood whaling sugarcane pineapple military tourism and education since statehood in 1959 tourism has been the largest industry contributing 24.3% of the gross state product (gsp) in 1997 despite efforts to diversify the state's gross output for 2003 was us$47 billion per capita income for hawaii residents was us$30,441 hawaiian exports include food and clothing these industries play a small role in the hawaiian economy due to the shipping distance to viable markets such as the west coast of the continental u.s the state's food exports include coffee macadamia nuts pineapple livestock sugarcane and honey
by weight honey bees may be the state's most valuable export according to the hawaii agricultural statistics service agricultural sales were us$370.9 million from diversified agriculture us$100.6 million from pineapple and us$64.3 million from sugarcane hawaii's relatively consistent climate has attracted the seed industry which is able to test three generations of crops per year on the islands compared with one or two on the mainland seeds yielded us$264 million in 2012 supporting 1,400 workers
as of january 2010 the state's unemployment rate was 6.9%
in 2009 the united states military spent us$12.2 billion in hawaii accounting for 18% of spending in the state for that year 75,000 united states department of defense personnel live in hawaii
according to a 2013 study by phoenix marketing international hawaii had the fourth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the united states with a ratio of 7.18%
=== taxation ===

=== cost of living ===
the cost of living in hawaii specifically honolulu is high compared to that of most major u.s cities however the cost of living in honolulu is 6.7% lower than in new york city and 3.6% lower than in san francisco these numbers may not take some costs such as increased travel costs for flights additional shipping fees and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers outside the continental u.s. into account while some online stores offer free shipping on orders to hawaii many merchants exclude hawaii alaska puerto rico and certain other u.s territories
hawaiian electric industries a privately-owned company provides 95% of the state's population with electricity mostly from fossil-fuel power stations average electricity prices in october 2014 (36.41 cents per kilowatt-hour) were nearly three times the national average (12.58 cents per kilowatt-hour) and 80% higher than the second-highest state connecticut
the median home value in hawaii in the 2000 u.s census was us$272,700 while the national median home value was us$119,600 hawaii home values were the highest of all states including california with a median home value of us$211,500 research from the national association of realtors places the 2010 median sale price of a single family home in honolulu hawaii at us$607,600 and the u.s median sales price at us$173,200 the sale price of single family homes in hawaii was the highest of any u.s city in 2010 just above that of the silicon valley area of california (us$602,000)
one of the most significant contributors to the high cost of living in hawaii is the merchant marine act of 1920 (also known as the jones act) which prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two american portsa practice known as cabotage most u.s consumer goods are manufactured in east asia because of the jones act foreign ships inbound with those goods cannot stop in honolulu offload hawaii-bound goods load mainland-bound hawaii-manufactured goods and continue to west coast ports instead they must proceed directly to the west coast where distributors break bulk and ship hawaiian-bound asian-manufactured goods back across the ocean by u.s.-flagged ships
hawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the jones act this law makes hawaii less competitive than west coast ports as a shopping destination for tourists from countries with much higher taxes like japan even though prices for asian-manufactured goods should be cheaper because hawaii is much closer than mainland states to asia

public elementary middle and high school test scores in hawaii are below national averages on tests mandated under the no child left behind act the hawaii board of education requires all eligible students to take these tests and report all student test scores some other statestexas and michigan for exampledo not this may have unbalanced the results that reported in august 2005 that of 282 schools across the state 185 failed to reach federal minimum performance standards in mathematics and reading the act college placement tests show that in 2005 seniors scored slightly above the national average (21.9 compared with 20.9) but in the widely accepted sat examinations hawaii's college-bound seniors tend to score below the national average in all categories except mathematics

the or&l was important for moving troops and goods during world war ii traffic on this line was busy enough for signals to be used to facilitate movement of trains and to require wigwag signals at some railroad crossings for the protection of motorists the main line was officially abandoned in 1947 although part of it was bought by the u.s navy and operated until 1970 thirteen miles (21 km) of track remain preservationists occasionally run trains over a portion of this line the honolulu high-capacity transit corridor project aims to add elevated passenger rail on oahu to relieve highway congestion
