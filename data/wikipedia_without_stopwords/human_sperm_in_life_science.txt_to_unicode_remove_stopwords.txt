sperm male reproductive cell derived greek word sperma meaning seed types sexual reproduction known anisogamy subtype oogamy marked difference size gametes smaller one termed male sperm cell uniflagellar sperm cell motile referred spermatozoon whereas nonmotile sperm cell referred spermatium sperm cells cannot divide limited life span fusion egg cells fertilization new organism begins developing starting totipotent zygote human sperm cell haploid chromosomes join chromosomes female egg form diploid cell mammals sperm develops testicles released penis also possible extract sperm tese sperm banks hold litres imp gal us gal sperm
sperm animalsedit
anatomyedit
mammalian sperm cell consists head midpiece tail head contains nucleus densely coiled chromatin fibres surrounded anteriorly acrosome contains enzymes used penetrating female egg midpiece central filamentous core many mitochondria spiralled around used atp production journey female cervix uterus uterine tubes tail flagellum executes lashing movements propel spermatocyte
fertilization sperm provides three essential parts oocyte signalling activating factor causes metabolically dormant oocyte activate haploid paternal genome centrosome responsible maintaining microtubule system
although semen contains millions sperm egg admit one ones soon die absorbed
originedit
spermatozoa animals produced spermatogenesis inside male gonads testicles via meiotic division initial spermatozoon process takes around days complete spermatid stage sperm develops familiar tail next stage becomes fully mature takes around days called spermatozoan sperm cells carried male body fluid known semen human sperm cells survive within female reproductive tract days post coitus semen produced seminal vesicles prostate gland urethral glands
sperm qualityedit
sperm quantity quality main parameters semen quality measure ability semen accomplish fertilization thus humans measure fertility man genetic quality sperm well volume motility typically decrease age see paternal age effect
dna damages present sperm cells period meiosis fertilization may repaired fertilized egg repaired serious deleterious effects fertility developing embryo human sperm cells particularly vulnerable free radical attack generation oxidative dna damage see eg oxodeoxyguanosine
postmeiotic phase mouse spermatogenesis sensitive environmental genotoxic agents male germ cells form mature sperm progressively lose ability repair dna damage irradiation male mice late spermatogenesis induce damage persists least days fertilizing sperm cells disruption maternal dna doublestrand break repair pathways increases sperm cellderived chromosomal aberrations treatment male mice melphalan bifunctional alkylating agent frequently employed chemotherapy induces dna lesions meiosis may persist unrepaired state germ cells progress though dna repaircompetent phases spermatogenic development unrepaired dna damages sperm cells fertilization lead offspring various abnormalities
market human spermedit
global market denmark welldeveloped system human sperm export success mainly comes reputation danish sperm donors high quality contrast law nordic countries gives donors choice either anonymous nonanonymous receiving couple furthermore nordic sperm donors tend tall highly educated altruistic motives donations partly due relatively low monetary compensation nordic countries countries worldwide importers danish sperm including paraguay canada kenya hong kong however food drug administration fda us banned import sperm motivated risk transmission creutzfeldtjakob disease although risk insignificant since artificial insemination different route transmission creutzfeldtjakob disease prevalence creutzfeldtjakob disease donors one million donor carrier infectious proteins would still cross bloodtestis barrier make transmission possible
historyedit
sperm first observed antonie van leeuwenhoek using microscope described animalcules little animals probably due belief preformationism thought sperm contained fully formed small human
forensic analysisedit
ejaculated fluids detected ultraviolet light irrespective structure colour surface sperm heads eg vaginal swabs still detected microscopy using christmas tree stain method ie kernechtrotpicroindigocarmine kpic staining
sperm plantsedit
sperm cells algal many plant gametophytes produced male gametangia antheridia via mitotic division flowering plants sperm nuclei produced inside pollen
motile sperm cellsedit
motile sperm cells typically move via flagella require water medium order swim toward egg fertilization animals energy sperm motility derived metabolism fructose carried seminal fluid takes place mitochondria located sperms midpiece base sperm head cells cannot swim backwards due nature propulsion uniflagellated sperm cells one flagellum animals referred spermatozoa known vary size
motile sperm also produced many protists gametophytes bryophytes ferns gymnosperms cycads ginkgo sperm cells flagellated cells life cycle plants many ferns lycophytes multiflagellated carrying one flagellum
nematodes sperm cells amoeboid crawl rather swim towards egg cell
nonmotile sperm cellsedit
nonmotile sperm cells called spermatia lack flagella therefore cannot swim spermatia produced spermatangium
spermatia cannot swim depend environment carry egg cell red algae polysiphonia produce nonmotile spermatia spread water currents release spermatia rust fungi covered sticky substance produced flaskshaped structures containing nectar attract flies transfer spermatia nearby hyphae fertilization mechanism similar insect pollination flowering plants
fungal spermatia also called pycniospores especially uredinales may confused conidia conidia spores germinate independently fertilization whereas spermatia gametes required fertilization fungi neurospora crassa spermatia identical microconidia perform functions fertilization well giving rise new organisms without fertilization
sperm nucleiedit
many land plants including gymnosperms angiosperms male gametophytes pollen grains primary mode dispersal example via wind insect pollination eliminating need water bridge gap male female pollen grain contains spermatogenous generative cell pollen lands stigma receptive flower germinates starts growing pollen tube carpel tube reaches ovule nucleus generative cell pollen grain divides gives rise two sperm nuclei discharged tube ovule fertilization
protists fertilization also involves sperm nuclei rather cells migrating toward egg cell fertilization tube oomycetes form sperm nuclei syncytical antheridium surrounding egg cells sperm nuclei reach eggs fertilization tubes similar pollen tube mechanism plants
