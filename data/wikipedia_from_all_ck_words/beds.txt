== history ==
=== ancient world ===
early beds were little more than piles of straw or some other natural material (e.g a heap of palm leaves animal skins or dried bracken) an important change was raising them off the ground to avoid drafts dirt and pests bedding dated to 77,000 bc was discovered in sibudu cave south africa the bedding consists of sedge and other monocotyledons topped with the leaves of cryptocarya woodii engl beds found in a preserved northern scottish village which were raised boxes made of stone and likely topped with comfortable fillers were dated to between 3200 bc and 2200 bc the egyptians had high bedsteads which were ascended by steps with bolsters or pillows and curtains to hang around the elite of egyptian society such as its pharaohs and queens even had beds made of wood sometimes gilded often there was a head-rest as well semi-cylindrical and made of stone wood or metal ancient assyrians medes and persians had beds of a similar kind and frequently decorated their furniture with inlays or appliques of metal mother-of-pearl and ivory
the image to the right showcases a headrest headrests like this were used in life to support the head while sleeping they are also found supporting a mummys head in the coffin this headrest perhaps was made specifically for the tomb since the offering prayer has been inscribed on the supporting column although the prayer may have been added after the death of the owner
the oldest account of a bed is probably that of odysseus a charpoy woven of rope plays a role in the odyssey a similar bed can be seen at the st fagans national history museum in wales odysseus also gives an account of how he crafted the nuptial bed for himself and penelope out of an ancient huge olive tree trunk that used to grow on the spot before the bridal chamber was built his detailed description finally persuades the doubting penelope that the shipwrecked aged man is indeed her long-lost husband homer also mentions the inlaying of the woodwork of beds with gold silver and ivory the greek bed had a wooden frame with a board at the head and bands of hide laced across upon which skins were placed at a later period the bedstead was often veneered with expensive woods sometimes it was of solid ivory veneered with tortoise-shell and with silver feet often it was of bronze the pillows and coverings also became more costly and beautiful the most celebrated places for their manufacture were miletus corinth and carthage folding beds too appear in the famous ancient greek vase paintings
roman mattresses were stuffed with reeds hay or wool feathers were used towards the end of the republic when custom demanded luxury small cushions were placed at the head and sometimes at the back the bedsteads were high and could only be ascended by the help of steps they were often arranged for two people and had a board or railing at the back as well as the raised portion at the head the counterpanes were sometimes very costly generally purple embroidered with figures in gold and rich hangings fell to the ground masking the front the bedsteads themselves were often of bronze inlaid with silver and elagabalus had one of solid silver in the walls of some houses at pompeii bed niches are found which were probably closed by curtains or sliding partitions ancient romans had various kinds of beds for repose these included
lectus cubicularis or chamber bed for normal sleeping
lectus genialis the marriage bed it was much decorated and was placed in the atrium opposite the door
lectus discubitorius or table bed on which they atefor they ate while lying on their left sidesthere usually being three people to one bed with the middle place accounted the most honorable position
lectus lucubratorius for studying
and a lectus funebris or emortualis on which the dead were carried to the pyre
=== medieval europe ===
the ancient germans lay on the floor on beds of leaves covered with skins or in a kind of shallow chest filled with leaves and moss in the early middle ages they laid carpets on the floor or on a bench against the wall placed upon them mattresses stuffed with feathers wool or hair and used skins as a covering curtains were hung from the ceiling or from an iron arm projecting from the wall they appear to have generally lain naked in bed wrapping themselves in large linen sheets which were stretched over the cushions
in the 12th century luxury increased and bedsteads were made of wood much decorated with inlaid carved and painted ornamentation they also used folding beds which served as couches by day and had cushions covered with silk laid upon leather at night a linen sheet was spread and pillows placed while silk-covered skins served as coverlets the carolingian manuscripts show metal bedsteads much higher at the head than at the feet and this shape continued in use until the 13th century in france many cushions being added to raise the body to a sloping position in 12th-century manuscripts the bedsteads appear much richer with inlays carving and painting and with embroidered coverlets and mattresses in harmony curtains were hung above the bed and a small hanging lamp is often shown
in the 14th century the woodwork became of less importance generally being entirely covered by hangings of rich materials silk velvet and even cloth of gold were frequently used inventories from the beginning of the 14th century give details of these hangings lined with fur and richly embroidered it was then that the four poster bed (also known as a tester bed) made its first appearance the bed being slung from the ceiling or fastened to the walls a form which developed later into a room within a room shut in by double curtains sometimes even to exclude all drafts the space between bed and wall was called the ruelle and very intimate friends were received there the 14th century is also the time when feather beds became highly prized possessions
in the 15th century beds became very large reaching 7 to 8 feet (2.1 to 2.4 m) by 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 m) the mattresses were often filled with pea-shucks straw or feathers at this time great personages were in the habit of carrying most of their property about with them including beds and bed-hangings and for this reason the bedsteads were for the most part mere frameworks to be covered up but about the beginning of the 16th century bedsteads were made lighter and more decorative since the lords remained in the same place for longer periods
=== renaissance and modern europe ===
in the 17th century which has been called the century of magnificent beds the style a la duchesse with tester and curtains only at the head replaced the more enclosed beds in france though they lasted much longer in england louis xiv had an enormous number of sumptuous beds as many as 413 being described in the inventories of his palaces some of them had embroideries enriched with pearls and figures on a silver or golden ground the great bed at versailles had crimson velvet curtains on which the triumph of venus was embroidered so much gold was used that the velvet scarcely showed
in the 18th century feather pillows were first used as coverings in germany which in the fashions of the bed and the curious etiquette connected with the bedchamber followed france for the most part the beds were a la duchesse but in france itself there was great variety both of name and shape the custom of the bed of justice upon which the king of france reclined when he was present in parliament the princes being seated the great officials standing and the lesser officials kneeling was held to denote the royal power even more than the throne
louis xi is credited with its first use and the custom lasted till the end of the monarchy in the chambre de parade where the ceremonial bed was placed certain persons such as ambassadors or great lords whom it was desired to honour were received in a more intimate fashion than the crowd of courtiers at versailles women received their friends in their beds both before and after childbirth during periods of mourning and even directly after marriagein fact in any circumstances which were thought deserving of congratulation or condolence during the 17th century this curious custom became general perhaps to avoid the tiresome details of etiquette portable beds were used in high society in france till the end of the ancien rgime the earliest of which mention has been found belonged to charles the bold they had curtains over a light framework and were in their way as fine as the stationary beds
iron beds appear in the 18th century the advertisements declare them as free from the insects which sometimes infested wooden bedsteads elsewhere there was also the closed bed with sliding or folding shutters and in englandwhere beds were commonly quite simple in formthe four poster was the usual citizen's bed until the middle of the 19th century
== bed sizes ==
bed sizes vary considerably around the world with most countries having their own standards and terminology
while the double size appears to be standard among english speaking countries based on the imperial measurement of 4 ft 6 in by 6 ft 3 in (137 cm x 190 cm) the sizes for other bed types tend to vary the mainland european sizes differ not merely because of the use of the metric system
in the mid-1950s the u.s bedding industry introduced a new size the king size a king-sized bed differs from the other sizes in implementation as it is not common to have a king-sized box spring rather two smaller box-springs are used under a king-sized mattress it is a common misconception that in a u.s standard or eastern king the box springs are identical in size to a twin extra-long however twin extra-long mattresses next to each other add up to 78 inches (200 cm) wide instead of the 76 inches (190 cm) width that is standard for an eastern king another size variant in the united states is the california king which measures 72 by 84 inches (180 cm 210 cm) long (narrower but longer than the standard king)
what is referred to as a single bed in many parts of the world may also be known in u.s terminology as a twin bed. in some countries a twin bed may also be used to describe one of two single beds in the same room
as another example in some cultures the full mattress is referred to as a master size bed.
when a mattress is available in fixed size (for example twin or queen) and the description does not specify the exact size this table may be used
all mattresses are made according to certain standards but different brands sometimes have exceptions most often the difference is 2-5 inches when calling a business to check specify the exact size of the mattress

bed rails are made of wood or metal and are attached to a headboard and footboard wooden slats are placed perpendicular to the bed rails to support the mattress/mattress box spring
bed rails and frames are often attached to the bed post using knock-down fittings a knock-down fitting enables the bed to be easily dismantled for removal primary knock-down fittings for bed rails are as follows
pin-and-hook fastener a mortise or slot is cut vertically in the bedpost pins are inserted horizontally in the bed post so that the pins perpendicularly intersect the mortise for example if one looked in the mortise one might see part of one horizontal pin at the bottom of the mortise and a part of a second pin toward the top of the mortise hooks are installed at the end of the rail usually these hooks are part of a plate that is attached to the rail the hooks then are inserted into the bed post mortise and hook over the pins
plate-and-hook fastener instead of pins inserted horizontally into the bedpost an eye plate (post plate) is installed on the bedpost the hooks are installed on the rail either as surface mount or recessed depending on the hardware the bedpost may require a mortise in order to allow the hooks to fasten to the plate this is also referred to as a keyhole fastener especially if the connector is more of a plug than a hook
bed bolts ("through-bolts") are a different means of a knock-down connection a hole is typically drilled through the bedpost the bolt head is inset and covered with a plug in the rail a dowel nut or other type of nut receives the bolt the springs are made from metal which are swirled for maximum comfort
safety rails or cot sides can be added to the sides of a bed (normally a child or elderly person's bed) to stop anyone falling out of the sides of the bed a safety rail is normally a piece of wood that attaches to the side rails on one or both sides of the bed they are made so that they can be easily removed when no longer required
