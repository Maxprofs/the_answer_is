season 5 follows two timelines the first timeline takes place on the island where the survivors who were left behind erratically jump forward and backward through time in one of these time periods john speaks with richard alpert one of the others who says that to save the island he must bring everyone back john goes to the same underground station ben went to after moving the wheel himself john is transported to the sahara desert in 2007 as the time shifts on the island stop and the survivors are stranded with the dharma initiative in 1974 in 2007 john contacts the oceanic six but no one wants to return the last one of the oceanic six he finds is a depressed jack john tells jack his father is alive on the island this seriously affects jack and he begins taking flights hoping to crash on the island again ben finds john and kills him after john's death the oceanic six are told to board the ajira airways flight 316 to return to the island and in order to go back they have to take john locke's body in the plane they take the flight but some land in 1977 in which they meet with the other survivors who are now part of the dharma initiative and others land in 2007 the survivors in 1977 are told by daniel faraday that if they detonate a hydrogen bomb at the hatch's construction site the electromagnetic energy below it will be negated and thus the hatch would never be built and thus their future could be changed in 2007 john locke apparently comes back to life he instructs richard alpert to speak with a time-traveling john and tell him that he must bring everyone back to the island after this he goes to speak with jacob the season finale reveals that john locke is still dead and another entity has taken over his form just to make ben kill jacob in 1977 juliet detonates the hydrogen bomb
season 6 the final follows two timelines in the first timeline the survivors are sent to the present day as the death of jacob allows for his brother the man in black the human alter ego of the smoke monster to take over the island having assumed the form of john locke the smoke monster seeks to escape the island and forces a final war between the forces of good and evil the second timeline called flash-sideways narrative follows the lives of the main characters in a setting where oceanic 815 never crashed though additional changes are revealed as other characters are shown living completely different lives than they did in the final episodes a flashback to the distant past shows the origins of the island's power and of the conflict between jacob and the man in black who are revealed to be twin brothers with jacob desperate to keep his brother from leaving the island after he is transmogrified by the power of the island and becomes the smoke monster the man in black seeks to kill all of the survivors who were named candidates by jacob and could become the new protector of the island the ghost of jacob appears to the last-of-the-surviving candidates and jack is appointed as the new protector jack catches up with the man in black who says that he wants to go to the heart of the island to turn it off and therefore finally leave the island they reach the place but after doing this the man in black becomes mortal the man in black is killed by kate but jack is seriously injured hurley one of the survivors becomes the new caretaker of the island several of the survivors die in the conflict or stay on the island and the remaining escape in the ajira plane once and for all jack returns to the heart of the island and turns it on again saving it hurley as the new protector asks ben to help him in his new job which he agrees after having saved the island jack dies peacefully in the same place in which he woke up when he arrived in the island the series finale reveals that the flash-sideways timeline is actually a form of limbo in the afterlife where some of the survivors and other characters from the island are reunited after having died in the last scene the survivors are all reunited in a church where they move on together
=== mythology and interpretations ===
episodes of lost include a number of mysterious elements ascribed to science fiction or supernatural phenomena the creators of the series refer to these elements as composing the mythology of the series and they formed the basis of fan speculation the show's mythological elements include a smoke monster that roams the island a mysterious group of inhabitants whom the survivors called the others a scientific organization called the dharma initiative that placed several research stations on the island a sequence of numbers that frequently appears in the lives of the characters in the past present and future and personal connections (synchronicity) between the characters of which they are often unaware
at the heart of the series is a complex and cryptic storyline which spawned numerous questions and discussions among viewers encouraged by lost's writers and stars who often interacted with fans online viewers and tv critics alike took to widespread theorizing in an attempt to unravel the mysteries theories mainly concerned the nature of the island the origins of the monster and the others the meaning of the numbers and the reasons for both the crash and the survival of some passengers several of the more common fan theories were discussed and rejected by the show's creators the most common being that the survivors of oceanic flight 815 are dead and in purgatory lindelof rejected speculation that spaceships or aliens influenced the events on the island or that everything seen was a fictional reality taking place in someone's mind carlton cuse dismissed the theory that the island was a reality tv show and the castaways unwitting housemates and lindelof many times refuted the theory that the monster was a nanobot cloud similar to the one featured in michael crichton's novel prey (which happened to share the protagonist's name jack)
=== recurring elements ===
there are several recurring elements and motifs on lost which generally have no direct effect on the story itself but expand the show's literary and philosophical subtext these elements include frequent appearances of black and white which reflect the dualism within characters and situations as well as rebellion in almost all characters especially kate dysfunctional family situations (especially ones that revolve around the fathers of many characters) as portrayed in the lives of nearly all the main characters apocalyptic references including desmond's pushing the button to forestall the end of the world coincidence versus fate revealed most apparently through the juxtaposition of the characters locke and mr eko conflict between science and faith embodied by the leadership tug-of-war between jack and locke and their stark disagreements on subjects such as the hatch the button and leaving the island the struggle between good and evil shown by the relationship between jacob and the man in black several times by locke using symbols such as his backgammon set also the white and black rocks that the man in black referred to as an inside joke and references to numerous works of literature including mentions and discussions of particular novels one notable reference to a novel is john steinbeck's of mice and men usually when sawyer is seen reading it or referencing it there are also many allusions in characters names to famous historical thinkers and writers such as ben linus (after chemist linus pauling) john locke (after the philosopher) and his alias jeremy bentham (after the philosopher) danielle rousseau (after philosopher jean-jacques rousseau) desmond david hume (after philosopher david hume) juliet's ex-husband (after philosopher edmund burke) mikhail bakunin (after the anarchist philosopher) daniel faraday (after physicist michael faraday) eloise hawking (after physicist stephen hawking) george minkowski (after mathematician hermann minkowski) richard alpert (the birth name of spiritual teacher ram dass) boone carlyle (after daniel boone american pioneer) and charlotte staples lewis (after author clive staples lewis c s lewis)

== production ==
lost was produced by abc studios bad robot productions and grass skirt productions throughout its run the executive producers of the series were damon lindelof j.j abrams bryan burk carlton cuse jack bender jeff pinkner edward kitsis adam horowitz jean higgins and elizabeth sarnoff with lindelof and cuse serving as showrunners
=== conception ===
the series was conceived by lloyd braun head of abc at the time while he was on vacation in hawaii during 2003 and thought of a cross between the movie cast away and the popular reality show survivor braun later pitched his ideas at the network's gathering of executives at the grand californian hotel in anaheim describing the concept as parts cast away survivor and gilligan's island with a lord of the flies element. many found the idea laughable but senior vice president thom sherman saw potential and decided to order an initial script from spelling television spelling producer ted gold turned to writer jeffrey lieber who presented a pitch to abc in september 2003 titled nowhere which sherman approved unhappy with the eventual script by lieber and a subsequent rewrite in january 2004 braun contacted j j abrams who had developed the tv series alias for abc to write a new pilot script lieber would later receive a story credit for the lost pilot and subsequently shared the created by credit with abrams and lindelof after a request for arbitration at the writers guild of america the one inviolable edict braun made to abrams was that the show's title must be lost having conceived of the title and being angry at its change to nowhere by lieber
although initially hesitant abrams warmed to the idea on the condition that the series would have a supernatural angle to it and if he had a writing partner abc executive heather kadin sent him damon lindelof who had long intended to meet abrams as he wished to write for alias together abrams and lindelof created the series style and characters and also wrote a series bible that conceived and detailed the major mythological ideas and plot points for an ideal four-to-five-season run for the show the novel idea of a story arc spanning several years was inspired by babylon 5 because abc felt that alias was too serialized lindelof and abrams assured the network in the bible that the show would be self-contained we promise  that [each episode] requires no knowledge of the episode(s) that preceded it  there is no ultimate mystery which requires solving while such statements contradicted their true plans the ruse succeeded in persuading abc to purchase the show the game myst also set in a tropical island was noted as an influence by lindelof as in its narrative no one told you what the rules were you just had to walk around and explore these environments and gradually a story was told.
abrams created the sound opening of the show and its title card being inspired by the twilight zone he withdrew from production of lost partway through the first season to direct mission impossible iii leaving lindelof and new executive producer carlton cuse to develop much of the overall mythology of the series themselves however abrams briefly returned to help co-write the third season premiere along with lindelof the development of the show was constrained by tight deadlines as it had been commissioned late in the 2004 season's development cycle despite the short schedule the creative team remained flexible enough to modify or create characters to fit actors they wished to cast
lost's two-part pilot episode was the most expensive in the network's history reportedly costing between us$10 and $14 million compared to the average cost of an hour-long pilot in 2005 of $4 million the world premiere of the pilot episode was on july 24 2004 at comic-con international in san diego abc's parent company disney fired braun before lost's broadcast debut partly because of low ratings at the network and also because he had greenlighted such an expensive and risky project the series debuted on september 22 2004 becoming one of the biggest critical and commercial successes of the 2004 television season along with fellow new series desperate housewives and grey's anatomy lost helped to reverse the flagging fortunes of abc and its great success likely caused the network to ignore that the show almost immediately broke lindelof and abrams promises to it regarding lost's plots
=== casting ===
many of the first season roles were a result of the executive producers liking of various actors the main character jack was originally going to die in the pilot and the role was planned for michael keaton however abc executives were adamant that jack live before it was decided that jack would live kate was to emerge as the leader of the survivors she was originally conceived as a middle-aged businesswoman whose husband had apparently died in the crash a role later fulfilled by the recurring character rose dominic monaghan auditioned for the role of sawyer who at the time was supposed to be a slick suit-wearing city con man the producers enjoyed monaghan's performance and changed the character of charlie originally an over-the-hill former rock star to fit him jorge garcia also auditioned for sawyer and the part of hurley was written for him when josh holloway auditioned for sawyer the producers liked the edge he brought to the character (he reportedly kicked a chair when he forgot his lines and got angry in the audition) and his southern accent so they changed sawyer to fit holloway's acting yunjin kim auditioned for kate but the producers wrote the character of sun for her and the character of jin portrayed by daniel dae kim to be her husband sayid played by naveen andrews was also not in the original script locke and michael were written with their actors in mind emilie de ravin who played claire was originally cast in what was supposed to be a recurring role in the second season michael emerson was contracted to play ben ("henry gale") for three episodes his role was extended to eight episodes because of his acting skills and eventually for the whole of season three and later seasons
=== filming ===

lost has been described by numerous critics as being among the greatest television series of all time bill carter television reporter of the new york times defined lost as the show with perhaps the most compelling continuing story line in television history entertainment weekly put the show on its end-of-the-decade best-of list saying name another network drama that can so wondrously turn a  into a  in 2012 entertainment weekly also listed the show at #10 in the 25 best cult tv shows from the past 25 years with a hot-and-cold description lost was initially celebrated as a moving character-driven drama with a broad humanistic worldview that also presented itself as dramatic cryptography that demanded to be solved the appeal narrowed as seasons progressed and the mythology became more complex culminating in a still-debated finale that was deeply meaningful to some and dissatisfying poppycock to others. in 2013 it was ranked at #36 on tv guide's list of the 60 best series of all time
the first season received critical acclaim usa today said it was a totally original fabulously enjoyable lost-at-sea series lost had taken an outlandish saturday-serial setup and imbued it with real characters and honest emotions without sacrificing any of the old-fashioned fun. the los angeles times praised the production values and said it knows the buttons it wants to push (fear of flying fear of abandonment fear of the unknown) and pushes them repeatedly like a kid playing a video game. ign noted that the first season succeeded first and foremost in character development. lost season one was ranked number one in the best of 2005 tv coverage critic top ten lists by matthew gilbert of the boston globe tom gliatto of people weekly charlie mccollum of the san jose mercury news and robert bianco of usa today
the second season received favorable reviews but it was noted that the season stumbled with some storylines going nowhere and some characters underutilized ign also noted the addition of desmond hume as a standout new character the san francisco chronicle called season 2 an extended mostly unsatisfying foray into deeper mythology with very little payoff after winning best drama series for season one lost was snubbed by the emmy awards in season 2 nearing the end of the second season usa today listed the most popular fan theories during season 2the island as a psychological experiment that the hatch had electromagnetic properties string theory of time and that everyone on the island had developed a collective consciousness that allowed them to appear in each other's past one fan interview by usa today said that real suspense comes from answers not questions suspense comes not from wondering what's going on but from wondering what happens next if you withhold answers it becomes impossible to satisfy.
the first block of episodes of the third season was criticized for raising too many mysteries and not providing enough answers complaints were also made about the limited screen-time for many of the main characters in the first block locke played by terry o'quinn who had tied for the highest second season episode count appeared in only 13 of 22 episodes in the third seasononly two more than guest star m.c gainey who played tom reaction to two new characters nikki and paulo was generally negative and lindelof even acknowledged that the couple was universally despised by fans the decision to split the season and the american timeslot switch after the hiatus were also criticized cuse acknowledged that no one was happy with the six-episode run. the second block of episodes was critically acclaimed however with the crew dealing with problems from the first block more answers were written into the show and nikki and paulo were killed off it was also announced that the series would end three seasons after the third season which cuse hoped would tell the audience that the writers knew where the story was going
the fourth season opened to critical acclaim not seen since the first season metacritic gave season four a weighted average of 87 based on the impressions of a select twelve critical reviews earning the second highest metascore in the 20072008 television season after the fifth and final season of hbo's the wire for the first time since season one lost received an emmy nomination for outstanding drama series tim goodman of the san francisco chronicle said that the season 4 episodes were roller coasters of fast action and revelation and that series was back on track in a survey conducted by tvweek of professional critics lost was voted the best show on television in the first half of 2008 by a wide margin apparently crack[ing] the top five on nearly every critic's submission and receiving nothing but praise the new york times said the show reveled in critiques of capitalism using the fictional mittelos bioscience and the malevolent british industrialist character of charles widmore as examples the critic also said that the show in the dark business of exploring just how futile the modern search for peace knowledge recovery or profit really is the critic did go on to say that series was not as philosophically refined as the sopranos or the wire but that it has maximized the potential of narrative uncertainty and made it a beguiling constant
the fifth season once again received mostly positive critical reception season 5 was given a weighted average of 78 out of 100 by metacritic variety said that the abc series remains one of primetime's most uncompromising efforts and this year's latest wrinkle on flashbacks flash-forwards and island-disappearing flashes of light does nothing to alter that perception. alan sepinwall of the newark star ledger said that season 5 may finally be a day of reckoning between those viewers who embrace the show's science-fiction trappings and those who prefer not to think about them sepinwall also related that i loved every minute but i'm also a geek who read ray bradbury and isaac asimov growing up. heather havrilesky of salon.com criticized the use of time travel saying that when a narrator brings magic or time travel or an act of god into the picture then uses it without restraint the story loses its anchor to real life. the critic also asked why does it matter what locke and richard alpert and daniel faraday or anyone else does when they all seem as clueless and unfettered from reality as we are as viewers how can these characters have any concrete agenda or strategic approach or philosophical perspective on anything when the rug is pulled out from under them by another act of god every few seconds? the new york times also commented that what has been most dispiriting about the current season is the show's willingness to abandon many of the larger and more compelling themes that grounded the elaborate plot the struggles between faith and reason the indictments of extreme capitalism the futility of recovery all that remains is the reductively limned battle between fate and free will largely playing out now in jack shephard's belief that returning to the island is his destiny. the a.v club said of the fifth season finale me i found the ending frustrating but in a good way this finale was entertaining as all get-out to me and despite the occasional groaner moment i think this may be lost's most purposeful surprising finale.
season six opened to much hype and curiosity the a.v club asked i'm guessing that one of the biggest fears of lost fans as we ride out this sixth and final seasonbumps and allis that we're going to come to the end and find a big nothing in return for all we've invested in these characters we don't just need answers we need justifications why has whatever happened happened who has called this particular meeting to order and does it really matter who showed up? the episodes dr linus ab aeterno happily ever after and the candidate opened to highly positive critical reception while the third-to-last episode across the sea was the episode with the most negative reception the time spent at the others temple was criticized e online described the show as lightning in a bottle and picked it as top tv drama of 2010.
the series finale opened to highly polarized critical and fan reception according to the web site metacritic the end received generally favorable reviews with a metascorea weighted average based on the impressions of 31 critical reviewsof 74 out of 100 ign reviewer chris carbot gave the finale a 10/10 tying it with the initial review of pilot part 1 through the looking glass the constant and there's no place like home parts 2 & 3 as the best-reviewed episode of lost he described it as one of the most enthralling entertaining and satisfying conclusions i could have hoped for. carbot also noted that the discussions about the episode may never end saying lost may be gone but it will hardly be forgotten. eric deggans of the st petersburg times also gave the finale a perfect score stating sunday's show was an emotional funny expertly measured reminder of what lost has really centered on since its first moments on the prime time tv landscape faith hope romance and the power of redemption through belief in the best of what moves mankind. robert bianco of usa today rated the episode perfect as well deeming the finale can stand with the best any series has produced hal boedeker of orlando sentinel cited the finale being a stunner
british newspapers the guardian and the daily telegraph both reported that the end had received negative reviews and disappointed its viewers alan sepinwall of star-ledger was less enthusiastic of the finale stating i'm still wrestling with my feelings about the end i thought most of it worked like gangbusters  but as someone who did spend at least part of the last six years dwelling on the questions that were unansweredbe they little things like the outrigger shootout or why the others left dharma in charge of the swan station after the purge or bigger ones like walti can't say i found the end wholly satisfying either as closure for this season or the series  there are narrative dead ends in every season of lost, but it felt like season six had more than usual. mike hale of the new york times gave the end a mixed review as the episode showed that the series was shaky on the big pictureon organizing the welter of mythic-religious-philosophical material it insisted on incorporating into its plotbut highly skilled at the small one the moment to moment business of telling an exciting story rendered insignificant  were the particulars of what they had done on the island. david zurawik of the baltimore sun gave the episode a highly negative review writing if this is supposed to be such a smart and wise show unlike anything else on network tv (blah blah blah) why such a wimpy phony quasi-religious white-light huggy-bear ending  once jack stepped into the church it looked like he was walking into a hollywood wrap party without food or musicjust a bunch of actors grinning idiotically for 10 minutes and hugging one another.
