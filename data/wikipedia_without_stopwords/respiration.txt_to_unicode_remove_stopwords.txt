osteophagy practice animals usually herbivores consume bones vegetation around world lacks sufficient amounts phosphate phosphorus essential mineral animals plays major role formation skeletal system necessary many biological processes including energy metabolism protein synthesis cell signaling lactation phosphate deficiencies cause physiological side effects especially pertaining reproductive system well side effects delayed growth failure regenerate new bone importance sufficient amounts phosphorus resides physiological importance maintaining proper phosphorus calcium ratio cap ratio important absorption minerals deviations optimal ratio inhibit absorption dietary calcium phosphorus ratio along vitamin d regulates bone mineralization turnover affecting calcium phosphorus transport absorption intestine
suggested osteophagy innate behavior allows animals supplement phosphorus calcium uptake order avoid costly effects deficiencies minerals osteophagic behavior observed pastoral wild animals notably ungulates herbivores two hundred years based observational studies dental wear pleistocene fossils proposed osteophagia dates far back thousand years ago seen domestic animals well red deer camels giraffes wildebeest antelopes tortoises grizzly bears due differences tooth structure herbivores tend chew old dry bones easier break carnivores prefer chew softer fresh bones variations behavior also observed humans
osteophagy regarded beneficial behavior combat mineral deficiencies animals osteophagic practices also observed detrimental dentition herbivores observed pattern wear cheek teeth herbivores congruous manner herbivores hold chew bones major cost osteophagy therefore significant wear teeth dental breakage herbivores whose teeth designed regular consumption hard materials rather grinding vegetal fibers
animals
tortoise
osteophagy desert tortoises largely observed captivity rarely wild osteophagy observed ground quick seldom usually lasting minutes
desert plants major food source desert tortoises gopherus agassizii mainly herbivorous diet addition desert plants desert tortoises also consume vulture feces contain bones soil layers contain calcium mammal hairs feathers arthropods stones bones conspecifics well snake lizard skin castings desert tortoises observed exhibit mounting behavior aggressive biting repeated striking carcasses practicing osteophagy
osteophagy herbivores viewed serve source supplemental minerals desert plants grow mineraldeficient soil may cause mineral deficiency desert tortoise diets resulting intake supplemental material
observational study tortoises near st george utah found tortoises exclusively consume mojave deserts white stones composed calcite mostly calcium carbonate opposed brown grey colored stones ingestion white stones attributed deliberate intake additional calcium
furthermore thought additional sources food sources calcium also nutrients including phosphorus sodium iron copper selenium
also hypothesized osteophagy practice necessary maintenance desert tortoise shells parallels phenomenon osteophagy birds snail shells ingested egglaying females supplement increased calcium needed eggshell formation therefore would expected increased physiological needs juvenile gravid female tortoises would also increased mineral demands promote ingestion bones stones soil alternatively need consume supplemental minerals may serve purpose detoxifying plant compounds may serve purposes related nutrition dislodge gut parasites
cattle
late relatively unknown disease called botulism seen high levels south african cattle especially grazed pastures low phosphorus levels researchers found feeding cattle sterile bonemeal corn unnaturally high levels phosphorus nearly eliminated botulism simplest conclusion botulism symptoms caused lack phosphorus
early sir thomas thieler revisited issue began following herds cattle observe behavior incredibly found phosphorusdeficient cattle would eat decomposing bones dead cattle animals activity highly correlated botulism next several years able show bacterial strain living decomposing carcasses clostridium botulinum true cause disease cattle would eat carcasses replenish phosphorus deficiency would contract disease
recently found cows experimentally depleted phosphate extended provision lowphosphate diet exhibited specific appetite bones compared controls develop interest bones researchers increased blood plasma inorganic phosphate levels experimental group cattle appetite whole bones suppressed experiment provided evidence causal link osteophagy phosphorus deficiency cattle
bears
grizzly bears wild observed gnaw shed moose antlers provide valuable source protein calcium phosphorus
grizzly bears weakest point annual cycle following emergence hibernation terms lacking mineral protein nutrition grizzly bears ursus arctos emerging hibernation may experiencing skewed phosphorustocalcium ratio due lack consumption animal resources period hibernation
winter conditions grizzly bears may able continue maintain calcium intake ingestion plants maintain levels vitamin d solar radiation low protein availability results phosphorus deficiency grizzly bear diets lack protein winter conditions attributed scarcity animal proteins phenomenon occurs many ecosystems prior greenup ending winter conditions therefore overall bones serve valuable source minerals times animal protein availability low
resulting phosphorus deficiency grizzly bear diets results skewed calcium phosphorus ratio creates appetite bone deficiency associated cycle seasons osteophagy bears likely seasonal phenomenon rather constant dietary supplement
giraffes
giraffes rely solely browsing maintain diet consists primarily leafy material however commonly observed supplementing diet bones although exact purpose behavior unknown hypothesized ingestion bones serves additional source calcium phosphorus leaves usually serve sufficient source nutrients calcium phosphorus concentrations leaves vary seasonally rainfall giraffes osteophagic behavior observed parallel variance mineral concentration
benefits behavior remain unclear researchers found actually unlikely giraffes sufficiently digest bones extract calcium phosphorus also evidence suggest osteophagy associated development kidney stones medullary cortical lesions giraffes due nutritional imbalance diet
domestic dogs
media often portrays domestic dogs chewing bones slightly misleading dogs chew bones eat residual meat bone marrow left truly form osteophagy modern toy bones dogs actually rawhide simply dried animal skin animal bones actually dangerous dogs chew
birds
osteophagic behavior frequently observed among several carnivorous bird species including hawks owls however motivations differ aforementioned herbivores presumably birds main purpose ingest maximum amount soft tissue prey possible often resulting consumption preys entire body digestible materials broken indigestible material ie bone forms pellet regurgitated regurgitation bone advantageous frees space stomach new prey behavior harmful pellets often larger digestive tract could cause damage obstruction
humans
pica
pica craving consumption nonnutrient substances cause health risks osteophagy humans would considered form pica unlike calcium phosphorus animals pica associated iron deficiencies humans humans unlikely suffer calcium phosphorus deficiencies minerals widely abundant foods consume iron deficiencies common usable form mineral fortified cow milk increasing consumption uptake
geophagy eating clay another form pica commonly observed osteophagy
religious practice
yanomami tribe live nomads brazilian venezuelan amazon tribe member dies custom family set spirit free religious ritual ritual tribe grinds bones fine ashen powder mixes powder plantain soup eaten family deceased possible ritual originated way increase phosphorus minerals tribes diet though may religious ritual without purpose
