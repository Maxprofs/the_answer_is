produc autotroph typic plant alga plant alga usual eat organ pull nutrient soil ocean manufactur food use photosynthesi reason call primari produc way energi sun usual power base food chain except occur deepsea hydrotherm ecosystem sunlight primari produc manufactur food process call chemosynthesi
consum heterotroph speci cannot manufactur food need consum organ anim eat primari produc like plant call herbivor anim eat anim call carnivor anim eat plant anim call omnivor
decompos detritivor break dead plant anim materi wast releas energi nutrient ecosystem recycl decompos bacteria fungi mushroom feed wast dead matter convert inorgan chemic recycl miner nutrient plant use
