humoral immunity also called antibodymediated beta cellularis immune system aspect immunity mediated macromolecules opposed cellmediated immunity found extracellular fluids secreted antibodies complement proteins certain antimicrobial peptides humoral immunity named involves substances found humours body fluids
study molecular cellular components form immune system including function interaction central science immunology immune system divided primitive innate immune system acquired adaptive immune system vertebrates contains humoral cellular components
humoral immunity refers antibody production accessory processes accompany including th activation cytokine production germinal center formation isotype switching affinity maturation memory cell generation also refers effector functions antibodies include pathogen toxin neutralization classical complement activation opsonin promotion phagocytosis pathogen elimination
historyedit
concept humoral immunity developed based analysis antibacterial activity serum components hans buchner credited development humoral theory described alexins protective substances exist blood serum bodily fluid capable killing microorganisms alexins later redefined complement paul ehrlich shown soluble components innate response lead combination cellular humoral immunity bridged features innate acquired immunity
following discovery bacteria cause diphtheria tetanus emil von behring kitasato shibasabur showed disease need caused microorganisms discovered cellfree filtrates sufficient cause disease filtrates diphtheria later named diphtheria toxins used vaccinate animals attempt demonstrate immunized serum contained antitoxin could neutralize activity toxin could transfer immunity nonimmune animals paul ehrlich showed antibodies form plant toxins ricin abrin proposed antibodies responsible immunity ehrlich friend emil von behring went develop diphtheria antitoxin became first major success modern immunotherapy presence specificity compatibility antibodies became major tool standardizing state immunity identifying presence previous infections
complement systemedit
complement system biochemical cascade innate immune system helps clear pathogens organism derived many small blood plasma proteins work together disrupt target cells plasma membrane leading cytolysis cell complement system consists soluble cellbound proteins directly involved complement pathways complement system involved activities innate immunity acquired immunity
activation system leads cytolysis chemotaxis opsonization immune clearance inflammation well marking pathogens phagocytosis proteins account serum globulin fraction proteins circulate zymogens inactive proteolytic cleavage
three biochemical pathways activate complement system classical complement pathway alternate complement pathway mannosebinding lectin pathway classical complement pathway typically requires antibodies activation specific immune response alternate pathway activated without presence antibodies considered nonspecific immune response antibodies particular igg class also fix complement

antibodiesedit
immunoglobulins glycoproteins immunoglobulin superfamily function antibodies terms antibody immunoglobulin often used interchangeably found blood tissue fluids well many secretions structure large yshaped globular proteins mammals five types antibody iga igd ige igg igm immunoglobulin class differs biological properties evolved deal different antigens antibodies synthesized secreted plasma cells derived b cells immune system
antibody used acquired immune system identify neutralize foreign objects like bacteria viruses antibody recognizes specific antigen unique target binding specific antigens antibodies cause agglutination precipitation antibodyantigen products prime phagocytosis macrophages cells block viral receptors stimulate immune responses complement pathway
