nonrenewable resource also called finite resource resource renew sufficient rate sustainable economic extraction meaningful human timeframes example carbonbased organicallyderived fuel original organic material aid heat pressure becomes fuel oil gas earth minerals metal ores fossil fuels coal petroleum natural gas groundwater certain aquifers nonrenewable resources

earth minerals metal ores
earth minerals metal ores examples nonrenewable resources metals present vast amounts earths crust extraction humans occurs concentrated natural geological processes heat pressure organic activity weathering processes enough become economically viable extract processes generally take tens thousands millions years plate tectonics tectonic subsidence crustal recycling
localized deposits metal ores near surface extracted economically humans nonrenewable human timeframes certain rare earth minerals elements scarce exhaustible others high demand manufacturing particularly electronics industry
metal ores considered vastly greater supply fossil fuels metal ores formed crustalscale processes make much larger portion earths nearsurface environment form fossil fuels limited areas carbonbased life forms flourish die quickly buried
fossil fuels
natural resources coal petroleum crude oil natural gas take thousands years form naturally cannot replaced fast consumed eventually considered fossilbased resources become costly harvest humanity need shift reliance sources energy solar wind power see renewable energy
alternative hypothesis carbon based fuel virtually inexhaustible human terms one includes sources carbonbased energy methane hydrates sea floor vastly greater carbon based fossil fuel resources combined sources carbon also considered nonrenewable although rate formationreplenishment sea floor known however extraction economically viable costs rates yet determined
present main energy source used humans nonrenewable fossil fuels since dawn internal combustion engine technologies th century petroleum fossil fuels remained continual demand result conventional infrastructure transport systems fitted combustion engines remain prominent throughout globe continual use fossil fuels current rate believed increase global warming cause severe climate change
nuclear fuels
world commission environment development wced organization set independent united nations classified fission reactors produce fissile nuclear fuel consume ie breeder reactors developed fusion power among conventional renewable energy sources solar falling water american petroleum institute likewise consider conventional nuclear fission renewable breeder reactor nuclear power fuel considered renewable sustainable explaining radioactive waste used spent fuel rods remains dangerous carefully stored thousand years careful monitoring radioactive waste products also required upon use renewable energy sources geothermal energy
use nuclear technology relying fission requires naturally occurring radioactive material fuel uranium common fission fuel present ground relatively low concentrations mined countries mined uranium used fuel energygenerating nuclear reactors fissionable uranium generates heat ultimately used power turbines generate electricity

renewable resources
natural resources known renewable resources replaced natural processes forces persistent natural environment intermittent reoccurring renewables recyclable materials utilized cycle across certain amount time harnessed number cycles
production goods services manufacturing products economic systems creates many types waste production consumer made use material either incinerated buried landfill recycled reuse recycling turns materials value would otherwise become waste valuable resources
natural environment soil water forests plants animals renewable resources long adequately monitored protected conserved sustainable agriculture cultivation plant animal materials manner preserves plant animal ecosystems long term overfishing oceans one example industry practice method threaten ecosystem endanger species possibly even determine whether fishery sustainable use humans unregulated industry practice method lead complete resource depletion
renewable energy sun wind wave biomass geothermal energies based renewable resources renewable resources movement water hydropower tidal power wave power wind radiant energy geothermal heat used geothermal power solar energy used solar power practically infinite cannot depleted unlike nonrenewable counterparts likely run used sparingly

renewable energy energy efficiency longer niche sectors promoted governments environmentalists increasing levels investment capital conventional financial actors suggest sustainable energy become mainstream future energy production nonrenewable resources decline reinforced climate change concerns nuclear dangers accumulating radioactive waste high oil prices peak oil increasing government support renewable energy factors commercializing renewable energy enlarging market growing demand adoption new products replace obsolete technology conversion existing infrastructure renewable standard
economic models
economics nonrenewable resource defined goods greater consumption today implies less consumption tomorrow david ricardo early works analysed pricing exhaustible resources argued price mineral resource increase time argued spot price always determined mine highest cost extraction mine owners lower extraction costs benefit differential rent first model defined hotellings rule economic model nonrenewable resource management harold hotelling shows efficient exploitation nonrenewable nonaugmentable resource would otherwise stable conditions lead depletion resource rule states would lead net price hotelling rent rose annually rate equal rate interest reflecting increasing scarcity resources hartwicks rule provides important result sustainability welfare economy uses nonrenewable source
however nearly metal prices declining time inflation adjusted terms number false assumptions firstly metal resources nonrenewable world scale largely inexhaustible present throughout earths crust vast scale far exceeding human demand time scales metal ores however extracted areas nature concentrated metal crust level whereby locally economic extract also depends available technology finding metal ores well extracting constantly changing technology demand changes vast amounts metal previously ignored become economically extractable ricardos simplistic notion price mineral resource increase time fact turned opposite nearly metal ores decreased inflation adjusted prices since well early th century main reason wrong assumed metals exhaustible world scale also misunderstood effect globally competing markets human terms amount metal earths crust essentially limitless localized areas metal ores become depleted local areas compete extraction costs resources elsewhere ramifications sustainability local economies
