trophoblasts greek trephein feed blastos germinator cells forming outer layer blastocyst provide nutrients embryo develop large part placenta formed first stage pregnancy first cells differentiate fertilized egg layer trophoblasts also collectively referred trophoblast gastrulation trophectoderm contiguous ectoderm embryo
structure
trophoblast proliferates differentiates cell layers approximately days fertilization humans
function
trophoblasts specialized cells placenta play important role embryo implantation interaction decidualised maternal uterus core placental villi contain mesenchymal cells placental blood vessels directly connected fetal circulation via umbilical cord core surrounded two layers trophoblast single layer mononuclear cytotrophoblast fuse together form overlying multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast layer covers entire surface placenta syncytiotrophoblast direct contact maternal blood reaches placental surface thus facilitates exchange nutrients wastes gases maternal fetal systems
addition cytotrophoblast tips villi differentiate another type trophoblast called extravillous trophoblast extravillous trophoblast grow placenta penetrate decidualised uterus process essential physically attaching placenta mother also altering vasculature uterus allow provide adequate blood supply growing fetus pregnancy progresses trophoblast even replace endothelial cells uterine spiral arteries remodel vessels wide bore conduits independent maternal vasoconstriction ensures fetus receives steady supply blood placenta subjected fluctuations oxygen could cause damage
clinical significance
invasion specific type trophoblast extravillous trophoblast maternal uterus vital stage establishment pregnancy failure trophoblast invade sufficiently important development cases preeclampsia firm attachment may lead placenta accreta
