substrate bindingedit
enzymes must bind substrates catalyse chemical reaction enzymes usually specific substrates bind chemical reaction catalysed specificity achieved binding pockets complementary shape charge hydrophilichydrophobic characteristics substrates enzymes therefore distinguish similar substrate molecules chemoselective regioselective stereospecific
enzymes showing highest specificity accuracy involved copying expression genome enzymes proofreading mechanisms enzyme dna polymerase catalyzes reaction first step checks product correct second step twostep process results average error rates less error million reactions highfidelity mammalian polymerases similar proofreading mechanisms also found rna polymerase aminoacyl trna synthetases ribosomes
conversely enzymes display enzyme promiscuity broad specificity acting range different physiologically relevant substrates many enzymes possess small side activities arose fortuitously ie neutrally may starting point evolutionary selection new function

orienting substrates productive arrangement reduce reaction entropy change contribution mechanism catalysis relatively small
enzymes may use several mechanisms simultaneously example proteases trypsin perform covalent catalysis using catalytic triad stabilise charge buildup transition states using oxyanion hole complete hydrolysis using oriented water substrate

allosteric sites pockets enzyme distinct active site bind molecules cellular environment molecules cause change conformation dynamics enzyme transduced active site thus affects reaction rate enzyme way allosteric interactions either inhibit activate enzymes allosteric interactions metabolites upstream downstream enzymes metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation altering activity enzyme according flux rest pathway
cofactorsedit
enzymes need additional components show full activity others require nonprotein molecules called cofactors bound activity cofactors either inorganic eg metal ions ironsulfur clusters organic compounds eg flavin heme organic cofactors either coenzymes released enzymes active site reaction prosthetic groups tightly bound enzyme organic prosthetic groups covalently bound eg biotin enzymes pyruvate carboxylase
example enzyme contains cofactor carbonic anhydrase shown ribbon diagram zinc cofactor bound part active site tightly bound ions molecules usually found active site involved catalysis example flavin heme cofactors often involved redox reactions
