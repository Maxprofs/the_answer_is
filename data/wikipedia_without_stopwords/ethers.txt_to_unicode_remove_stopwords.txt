ethers ir class organic compounds contain ether groupan oxygen atom connected two alkyl aryl groupsof general formula ror ethers classified two varieties alkyl groups sides oxygen atom simple symmetrical ether whereas different ethers called mixed unsymmetrical ethers typical example solvent anesthetic diethyl ether commonly referred simply ether chchochch ethers common organic chemistry pervasive biochemistry common linkages carbohydrates lignin
structure bondingedit
ethers feature coc linkage defined bond angle co distances pm barrier rotation co bonds low bonding oxygen ethers alcohols water similar language valence bond theory hybridization oxygen sp
oxygen electronegative carbon thus hydrogens alpha ethers acidic simple hydrocarbons far less acidic hydrogens alpha carbonyl groups ketones aldehydes however
depending groups r r ethers classified two types
simple ethers symmetrical ethers eg diethyl ether dimethyl ether etc
mixed ethers asymmetrical ethers eg methyl ethyl ether methyl phenyl ether etc
nomenclatureedit
iupac nomenclature system ethers named using general formula alkoxyalkane example chchoch methoxyethane ether part complex molecule described alkoxy substituent och would considered methoxy group simpler alkyl radical written front chochch would given methoxychoethanechch
trivial nameedit
iupac rules often followed simple ethers trivial names simple ethers ie none functional groups composite two substituents followed ether example ethyl methyl ether choch diphenylether choch organic compounds common ethers acquired names rules nomenclature formalized diethyl ether simply called ether called sweet oil vitriol methyl phenyl ether anisole originally found aniseed aromatic ethers include furans acetals alkoxy ethers rchoror another class ethers characteristic properties
polyethersedit
polyethers compounds one ether group
crown ethers examples small polyethers toxins produced dinoflagellates brevetoxin ciguatoxin extremely large known cyclic ladder polyethers
polyether generally refers polymers contain ether functional group main chain term glycol reserved low medium range molar mass polymer nature endgroup usually hydroxyl group still matters term oxide terms used high molar mass polymer endgroups longer affect polymer properties
aliphatic polyethers
aromatic polyethers
phenyl ether polymers class polyethers containing aromatic cycles main chain polyphenyl ether ppe polypphenylene oxide ppo

physical propertiesedit
ether molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds resulting relatively low boiling points compared analogous alcohols difference however boiling points ethers isomeric alcohols becomes lower carbon chains become longer van der waals interactions extended carbon chain dominates presence hydrogen bonding
ethers slightly polar coc bond angle functional group co dipoles cancel ethers polar alkenes polar alcohols esters amides comparable structure however presence two lone pairs electrons oxygen atoms makes hydrogen bonding water molecules possible
cyclic ethers tetrahydrofuran dioxane miscible water exposed oxygen atom hydrogen bonding compared linear aliphatic ethers
properties
lower ethers highly volatile flammable
lower ethers also act anaesthetics
ethers act good organic solvents
simple ethers diethyl ether tasteless
reactionsedit
ethers quite stable chemical compounds react bases active metals dilute acids oxidising agents reducing agents generally low chemical reactivity reactive alkanes epoxides ketals acetals unrepresentative classes ethers discussed separate articles important reactions listed
ether cleavageedit
although ethers resist hydrolysis polar bonds cloven mineral acids hydrobromic acid hydroiodic acid hydrogen chloride cleaves ethers slowly methyl ethers typically afford methyl halides
roch hbr chbr roh
reactions proceed via onium intermediates ie rohchbr
ethers undergo rapid cleavage boron tribromide even aluminium chloride used cases give alkyl bromide depending substituents ethers cloven variety reagents eg strong base
peroxide formationedit
stored presence air oxygen ethers tend form explosive peroxides diethyl ether peroxide reaction accelerated light metal catalysts aldehydes addition avoiding storage conditions likely form peroxides recommended ether used solvent distill dryness peroxides may formed less volatile original ether become concentrated last drops liquid
lewis basesedit
ethers serve lewis bases bronsted bases strong acids protonate oxygen give onium ions instance diethyl ether forms complex boron trifluoride ie diethyl etherate bfoet ethers also coordinate mgii center grignard reagents
alphahalogenationedit

synthesisedit
ethers prepared laboratory several different ways
dehydration alcoholsedit
dehydration alcohols affords ethers

direct nucleophillic subsititution reaction requires elevated temperatures c reaction catalyzed acids usually sulfuric acid method effective generating symmetrical ethers unsymmetrical ethers since either oh protonated would give mixture products diethyl ether produced ethanol method cyclic ethers readily generated approach elimination reactions compete dehydration alcohol

dehydration route often requires conditions incompatible delicate molecules several milder methods exist produce ethers
