plate tectonics divergent boundary divergent plate boundary also known constructive boundary extensional boundary linear feature exists two tectonic plates moving away divergent boundaries within continents initially produce rifts eventually become rift valleys active divergent plate boundaries occur oceanic plates exist midoceanic ridges divergent boundaries also form volcanic islands occur plates move apart produce gaps molten lava rises fill
current research indicates complex convection within earths mantle allows material rise base lithosphere beneath divergent plate boundary supplies area vast amounts heat reduction pressure melts rock asthenosphere upper mantle beneath rift area forming large flood basalt lava flows eruption occurs part plate boundary one time occur fills opening gap two opposing plates move away
