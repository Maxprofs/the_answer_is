a meteorite is a solid piece of debris from a source such as an asteroid or a comet which originates in outer space and survives its impact with the earth's surface it is called a meteoroid before its impact a meteorite's size can range from small to extremely large when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere friction pressure and chemical interactions with the atmospheric gases cause it to heat up and radiate that energy thus forming a fireball also known as a meteor or shooting/falling star a bolide is either an extraterrestrial body that collides with the earth or an exceptionally bright fireball-like meteor regardless of whether it ultimately impacts the surface
more generally a meteorite on the surface of any celestial body is a natural object that has come from outer space meteorites have been found on the moon and mars meteorites that are recovered after being observed as they transit the atmosphere or impact the earth are called meteorite fall all other meteorites are known as finds as of february 2010 there are approximately 1,086 witnessed falls having specimens in the world's collections there are more than 38,660 well-documented meteorite finds
meteorites have traditionally been divided into three broad categories stony meteorites are rocks mainly composed of silicate minerals iron meteorites that are largely composed of metallic iron-nickel and stony-iron meteorites that contain large amounts of both metallic and rocky material modern classification schemes divide meteorites into groups according to their structure chemical and isotopic composition and mineralogy meteorites smaller than 2mm are classified as micrometeorites
== naming ==
meteorites are always named for the places they were found usually a nearby town or geographic feature in cases where many meteorites were found in one place the name may be followed by a number or letter (e.g. allan hills 84001 or dimmitt (b)) the name designated by the meteoritical society is used by scientists catalogers and most collectors
== fall phenomena ==
most meteoroids disintegrate when entering earth's atmosphere usually five to ten a year are observed to fall and are subsequently recovered and made known to scientists few meteorites are large enough to create large impact craters instead they typically arrive at the surface at their terminal velocity and at most create a small pit
large meteoroids may strike the ground with a significant fraction of their second cosmic velocity leaving behind a hypervelocity impact crater the kind of crater will depend on the size composition degree of fragmentation and incoming angle of the impactor the force of such collisions has the potential to cause widespread destruction the most frequent hypervelocity cratering events on the earth are caused by iron meteoroids which are most easily able to transit the atmosphere intact examples of craters caused by iron meteoroids include barringer meteor crater odessa meteor crater wabar craters and wolfe creek crater iron meteorites are found in association with all of these craters in contrast even relatively large stony or icy bodies like small comets or asteroids up to millions of tons are disrupted in the atmosphere and do not make impact craters although such disruption events are uncommon they can cause a considerable concussion to occur the famed tunguska event probably resulted from such an incident very large stony objects hundreds of meters in diameter or more weighing tens of millions of tons or more can reach the surface and cause large craters but are very rare such events are generally so energetic that the impactor is completely destroyed leaving no meteorites (the very first example of a stony meteorite found in association with a large impact crater the morokweng crater in south africa was reported in may 2006.)
several phenomena are well documented during witnessed meteorite falls too small to produce hypervelocity craters the fireball that occurs as the meteoroid passes through the atmosphere can appear to be very bright rivaling the sun in intensity although most are far dimmer and may not even be noticed during daytime various colors have been reported including yellow green and red flashes and bursts of light can occur as the object breaks up explosions detonations and rumblings are often heard during meteorite falls which can be caused by sonic booms as well as shock waves resulting from major fragmentation events these sounds can be heard over wide areas with a radius of a hundred or more kilometers whistling and hissing sounds are also sometimes heard but are poorly understood following passage of the fireball it is not unusual for a dust trail to linger in the atmosphere for several minutes
as meteoroids are heated during atmospheric entry their surfaces melt and experience ablation they can be sculpted into various shapes during this process sometimes resulting in shallow thumbprint-like indentations on their surfaces called regmaglypts if the meteoroid maintains a fixed orientation for some time without tumbling it may develop a conical nose cone or heat shield shape as it decelerates eventually the molten surface layer solidifies into a thin fusion crust which on most meteorites is black (on some achondrites the fusion crust may be very light colored) on stony meteorites the heat-affected zone is at most a few mm deep in iron meteorites which are more thermally conductive the structure of the metal may be affected by heat up to 1 centimetre (0.39 in) below the surface reports vary some meteorites are reported to be burning hot to the touch upon landing while others have been cold enough to condense water and form a frost meteorites from multiple falls such as bjurbole tagish lake and buzzard coulee have been found having fallen upon lake and sea ice perhaps suggesting that they were not hot when they fell
meteoroids that experience disruption in the atmosphere may fall as meteorite showers which can range from only a few up to thousands of separate individuals the area over which a meteorite shower falls is known as its strewn field strewn fields are commonly elliptical in shape with the major axis parallel to the direction of flight in most cases the largest meteorites in a shower are found farthest down-range in the strewn field
== meteorite types ==
most meteorites are stony meteorites classed as chondrites and achondrites only about 6% of meteorites are iron meteorites or a blend of rock and metal the stony-iron meteorites modern classification of meteorites is complex the review paper of krot et al (2007) summarizes modern meteorite taxonomy
about 86% of the meteorites that fall on earth are chondrites which are named for the small round particles they contain these particles or chondrules are composed mostly of silicate minerals that appear to have been melted while they were free-floating objects in space certain types of chondrites also contain small amounts of organic matter including amino acids and presolar grains chondrites are typically about 4.55 billion years old and are thought to represent material from the asteroid belt that never coalesced into large bodies like comets chondritic asteroids are some of the oldest and most primitive materials in the solar system chondrites are often considered to be the building blocks of the planets.
about 8% of the meteorites that fall on earth are achondrites (meaning they do not contain chondrules) some of which are similar to terrestrial igneous rocks most achondrites are also ancient rocks and are thought to represent crustal material of differentiated planetesimals one large family of achondrites (the hed meteorites) may have originated on the parent body of the vesta family although this claim is disputed others derive from unidentified asteroids two small groups of achondrites are special as they are younger and do not appear to come from the asteroid belt one of these groups comes from the moon and includes rocks similar to those brought back to earth by apollo and luna programs the other group is almost certainly from mars and are the only materials from other planets ever recovered by humans
about 5% of meteorites that have been seen to fall are iron meteorites composed of iron-nickel alloys such as kamacite and/or taenite most iron meteorites are thought to come from the cores of planetesimals that were once molten as on earth the denser metal separated from silicate material and sank toward the center of the planetesimal forming its core after the planetesimal solidified it broke up in a collision with another planetesimal due to the low abundance of iron meteorites in collection areas such as antarctica where most of the meteoric material that has fallen can be recovered it is possible that the percentage of iron-meteorite falls is lower than 5% this would be explained by a recovery bias laypeople are more likely to notice and recover solid masses of metal than most other meteorite types the abundance of iron meteorites relative to total antarctic finds is 0.4%
stony-iron meteorites constitute the remaining 1% they are a mixture of iron-nickel metal and silicate minerals one type called pallasites is thought to have originated in the boundary zone above the core regions where iron meteorites originated the other major type of stony-iron meteorites is the mesosiderites
tektites (from greek tektos molten) are not themselves meteorites but are rather natural glass objects up to a few centimeters in size which were formedaccording to most scientistsby the impacts of large meteorites on earth's surface a few researchers have favored tektites originating from the moon as volcanic ejecta but this theory has lost much of its support over the last few decades
== meteorite chemistry ==
in march 2015 nasa scientists reported that for the first time complex organic compounds found in dna and rna including uracil cytosine and thymine have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions using starting chemicals such as pyrimidine found in meteorites pyrimidine like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds according to the scientists
== meteorite recovery ==
=== falls ===
most meteorite falls are recovered on the basis of eyewitness accounts of the fireball or the impact of the object on the ground or both therefore despite the fact that meteorites fall with virtually equal probability everywhere on earth verified meteorite falls tend to be concentrated in areas with high human population densities such as europe japan and northern india
a small number of meteorite falls have been observed with automated cameras and recovered following calculation of the impact point the first of these was the pibram meteorite which fell in czechoslovakia (now the czech republic) in 1959 in this case two cameras used to photograph meteors captured images of the fireball the images were used both to determine the location of the stones on the ground and more significantly to calculate for the first time an accurate orbit for a recovered meteorite
following the pribram fall other nations established automated observing programs aimed at studying infalling meteorites one of these was the prairie network operated by the smithsonian astrophysical observatory from 1963 to 1975 in the midwestern us this program also observed a meteorite fall the lost city chondrite allowing its recovery and a calculation of its orbit another program in canada the meteorite observation and recovery project ran from 1971 to 1985 it too recovered a single meteorite innisfree in 1977 finally observations by the european fireball network a descendant of the original czech program that recovered pribram led to the discovery and orbit calculations for the neuschwanstein meteorite in 2002 nasa has an automated system that detects meteors and calculates the orbit magnitude ground track and other parameters over the southeast usa which often detects a number of events each night
=== finds ===
until the twentieth century only a few hundred meteorite finds had ever been discovered more than 80% of these were iron and stony-iron meteorites which are easily distinguished from local rocks to this day few stony meteorites are reported each year that can be considered to be accidental finds the reason there are now more than 30,000 meteorite finds in the world's collections started with the discovery by harvey h nininger that meteorites are much more common on the surface of the earth than was previously thought
==== the great plains of the us ====
nininger's strategy was to search for meteorites in the great plains of the united states where the land was largely cultivated and the soil contained few rocks between the late 1920s and the 1950s he traveled across the region educating local people about what meteorites looked like and what to do if they thought they had found one for example in the course of clearing a field the result was the discovery of over 200 new meteorites mostly stony types
in the late 1960s roosevelt county new mexico in the great plains was found to be a particularly good place to find meteorites after the discovery of a few meteorites in 1967 a public awareness campaign resulted in the finding of nearly 100 new specimens in the next few years with many being by a single person ivan wilson in total nearly 140 meteorites were found in the region since 1967 in the area of the finds the ground was originally covered by a shallow loose soil sitting atop a hardpan layer during the dustbowl era the loose soil was blown off leaving any rocks and meteorites that were present stranded on the exposed surface
==== antarctica ====
a few meteorites were found in antarctica between 1912 and 1964 in 1969 the 10th japanese antarctic research expedition found nine meteorites on a blue ice field near the yamato mountains with this discovery came the realization that movement of ice sheets might act to concentrate meteorites in certain areas after a dozen other specimens were found in the same place in 1973 a japanese expedition was launched in 1974 dedicated to the search for meteorites this team recovered nearly 700 meteorites
shortly thereafter the united states began its own program to search for antarctic meteorites operating along the transantarctic mountains on the other side of the continent the antarctic search for meteorites (ansmet) program european teams starting with a consortium called euromet in the late 1980s and continuing with a program by the italian programma nazionale di ricerche in antartide have also conducted systematic searches for antarctic meteorites
the antarctic scientific exploration of china has conducted successful meteorite searches since 2000 a korean program (koreamet) was launched in 2007 and has collected a few meteorites the combined efforts of all of these expeditions have produced more than 23,000 classified meteorite specimens since 1974 with thousands more that have not yet been classified for more information see the article by harvey (2003)
==== australia ====
at about the same time as meteorite concentrations were being discovered in the cold desert of antarctica collectors discovered that many meteorites could also be found in the hot deserts of australia several dozen meteorites had already been found in the nullarbor region of western and south australia systematic searches between about 1971 and the present recovered more than 500 others ~300 of which are currently well characterized the meteorites can be found in this region because the land presents a flat featureless plain covered by limestone in the extremely arid climate there has been relatively little weathering or sedimentation on the surface for tens of thousands of years allowing meteorites to accumulate without being buried or destroyed the dark colored meteorites can then be recognized among the very different looking limestone pebbles and rocks
==== the sahara ====
in 198687 a german team installing a network of seismic stations while prospecting for oil discovered about 65 meteorites on a flat desert plain about 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of dirj (daraj) libya a few years later a desert enthusiast saw photographs of meteorites being recovered by scientists in antarctica and thought that he had seen similar occurrences in northern africa in 1989 he recovered about 100 meteorites from several distinct locations in libya and algeria over the next several years he and others who followed found at least 400 more meteorites the find locations were generally in regions known as regs or hamadas flat featureless areas covered only by small pebbles and minor amounts of sand dark-colored meteorites can be easily spotted in these places in the case of several meteorite fields such as dar el gani dhofar and others favorable light-colored geology consisting of basic rocks (clays dolomites and limestones) makes meteorites particularly easy to identify
although meteorites had been sold commercially and collected by hobbyists for many decades up to the time of the saharan finds of the late 1980s and early 1990s most meteorites were deposited in or purchased by museums and similar institutions where they were exhibited and made available for scientific research the sudden availability of large numbers of meteorites that could be found with relative ease in places that were readily accessible (especially compared to antarctica) led to a rapid rise in commercial collection of meteorites this process was accelerated when in 1997 meteorites coming from both the moon and mars were found in libya by the late 1990s private meteorite-collecting expeditions had been launched throughout the sahara specimens of the meteorites recovered in this way are still deposited in research collections but most of the material is sold to private collectors these expeditions have now brought the total number of well-described meteorites found in algeria and libya to more than 500
===== northwest africa =====
meteorite markets came into existence in the late 1990s especially in morocco this trade was driven by western commercialization and an increasing number of collectors the meteorites were supplied by nomads and local people who combed the deserts looking for specimens to sell many thousands of meteorites have been distributed in this way most of which lack any information about how when or where they were discovered these are the so-called northwest africa meteorites when they get classified they are named northwest africa (abbreviated nwa) followed by a number it is generally accepted that nwa meteorites originate in morocco algeria western sahara mali and possibly even further afield nearly all of these meteorites leave africa through morocco scores of important meteorites including lunar and martian meteorites have been discovered and made available to science via this route a few of the more notable meteorites recovered include tissint and northwest africa 7034 tissint was the first witnessed martian meteorite fall in over fifty years nwa 7034 is the oldest meteorite known to come from mars and is a unique water-bearing regolith breccia
==== arabian peninsula ====
in 1999 meteorite hunters discovered that the desert in southern and central oman were also favorable for the collection of many specimens the gravel plains in the dhofar and al wusta regions of oman south of the sandy deserts of the rub al khali had yielded about 5,000 meteorites as of mid-2009 included among these are a large number of lunar and martian meteorites making oman a particularly important area both for scientists and collectors early expeditions to oman were mainly done by commercial meteorite dealers however international teams of omani and european scientists have also now collected specimens
the recovery of meteorites from oman is currently prohibited by national law but a number of international hunters continue to remove specimens now deemed national treasures. this new law provoked a small international incident as its implementation preceded any public notification of such a law resulting in the prolonged imprisonment of a large group of meteorite hunters primarily from russia but whose party also consisted of members from the us as well as several other european countries
the black stone in the wall of the kaaba in mecca is thought to be a meteorite by some historians but there is little support for this in the scientific literature
==== the american southwest ====
beginning in the mid-1990s amateur meteorite hunters began scouring the arid areas of the southwestern united states to date meteorites numbering possibly into the thousands have been recovered from the mojave sonoran great basin and chihuahuan deserts with many being recovered on dry lake beds significant finds include the superior valley 014 acapulcoite one of two of its type found within the united states as well as the blue eagle meteorite the first rumuruti-type chondrite yet found in the americas perhaps the most notable find in recent years has been the los angeles meteorite a martian meteorite that was found by robert verish a number of finds from the american southwest have yet to be formally submitted to the meteorite nomenclature committee as many finders think it is unwise to publicly state the coordinates of their discoveries for fear of confiscation by the federal government and competition with other hunters at published find sites several of the meteorites found recently are currently on display in the griffith observatory in los angeles
== meteorites in history ==
meteorite falls may have been the source of cultish worship the cult in the temple of artemis at ephesus one of the seven wonders of the ancient world possibly originated with the observation of a meteorite fall which was understood by contemporaries to have fallen to the earth from the abode of deities there are reports that a sacred stone was enshrined at the temple that may have been a meteorite although the use of the metal found in meteorites is also recorded in myths of many countries and cultures where the celestial source was often acknowledged scientific documentation only began in the last few centuries
the oldest known iron artifacts are nine small beads hammered from meteoritic iron they were found in northern egypt and have been securely dated to 3200 bc
in the 1970s a stone meteorite was uncovered during an archaeological dig at danebury iron age hillfort danebury england it was found deposited part way down in an iron age pit since it must have been deliberately placed there this could indicate one of the first (known) human finds of a meteorite in europe
some native americans treated meteorites as ceremonial objects in 1915 a 135-pound iron meteorite was found in a sinagua (c 11001200) burial cyst near camp verde arizona respectfully wrapped in a feather cloth a small pallasite was found in a pottery jar in an old burial found at pojoaque pueblo new mexico nininger reports several other such instances in the southwest us and elsewhere such as the discovery of native american beads of meteoric iron found in hopewell burial mounds and the discovery of the winona meteorite in a native american stone-walled crypt
indigenous peoples often prized iron-nickel meteorites as an easy if limited source of iron metal for example the inuit used chips of the cape york meteorite to form cutting edges for tools and spear tips
the german physicist ernst florens chladni was the first to publish the then audacious idea that meteorites were rocks from space he published his booklet on the origin of the iron masses found by pallas and others similar to it and on some associated natural phenomena in 1794 in this he compiled all available data on several meteorite finds and falls concluded that they must have their origins in outer space the scientific community of the time responded with resistance and mockery it took nearly ten years before a general acceptance of the origin of meteorites was achieved through the work of the french scientist jean-baptiste biot and the british chemist edward howard biot's study initiated by the french academy of sciences was compelled by a meteorite fall of thousands of meteorites on 26 april 1803 from the skies of l'aigle france
one of the leading theories for the cause of the cretaceouspaleogene extinction event that included the dinosaurs is a large meteorite impact the chicxulub crater has been identified as the site of this impact there has been a lively scientific debate as to whether other major extinctions including the ones at the end of the permian and triassic periods might also have been the result of large impact events but the evidence is much less compelling than for the end cretaceous extinction
there are several reported instances of falling meteorites having killed people and livestock but a few of these appear more credible than others the most infamous reported fatality from a meteorite impact is that of an egyptian dog that was killed in 1911 although this report is highly disputed this meteorite fall was identified in the 1980s as martian in origin there is substantial evidence that the meteorite known as valera (venezuela 1972 see meteorite fall) hit and killed a cow upon impact nearly dividing the animal in two and similar unsubstantiated reports of a horse being struck and killed by a stone of the new concord fall also abound throughout history many first and second-hand reports of meteorites falling on and killing both humans and other animals abound one example is from 1490 ad in china which purportedly killed thousands of people john lewis has compiled some of these reports and summarizes no one in recorded history has ever been killed by a meteorite in the presence of a meteoriticist and a medical doctor and reviewers who make sweeping negative conclusions usually do not cite any of the primary publications in which the eyewitnesses describe their experiences and give no evidence of having read them
the first known modern case of a human hit by a space rock occurred on 30 november 1954 in sylacauga alabama there a 4 kilograms (8.8 lb) stone chondrite crashed through a roof and hit ann hodges in her living room after it bounced off her radio she was badly bruised the hodges meteorite or sylacauga meteorite is currently on exhibit at the alabama museum of natural history
another claim was put forth by a young boy who stated that he had been hit by a small (~3 gram) stone of the mbale meteorite fall from uganda and who stood to gain nothing from this assertion the stone reportedly fell through banana leaves before striking the boy on the head causing little to no pain as it was small enough to have been slowed by both friction with the atmosphere as well as that with banana leaves before striking the boy
several persons have since claimed to have been struck by meteorites but no verifiable meteorites have resulted
== meteorite weathering ==
most meteorites date from the oldest times in the solar system and are by far the oldest material available on our planet despite their age they are fairly vulnerable to terrestrial environment water salt oxygen attack the meteorites as soon they reach the ground
the terrestrial alteration of meteorites is called weathering in order to quantify the degree of alteration that a meteorite experienced several qualitative weathering indices have been applied to antarctic and desertic samples
the most known weathering scale used for ordinary chondrites ranges from w0 (pristine state) to w6 (heavy alteration)
== notable meteorites ==
apart from meteorites fallen onto the earth two tiny fragments of asteroids were found among the samples collected on the moon these were the bench crater meteorite (apollo 12 1969) and the hadley rille meteorite (apollo 15 1971) the opportunity rover discovered the heat shield rock meteorite on mars and five similar iron meteorites two nickel-iron meteorites were identified by the spirit rover (see also mars rocks)
