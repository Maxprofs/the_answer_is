ribosome locations
ribosomes classified either free membranebound
free membranebound ribosomes differ spatial distribution identical structure whether ribosome exists free membranebound state depends presence ertargeting signal sequence protein synthesized individual ribosome might membranebound making one protein free cytosol makes another protein
ribosomes sometimes referred organelles use term organelle often restricted describing subcellular components include phospholipid membrane ribosomes entirely particulate reason ribosomes may sometimes described nonmembranous organelles
free ribosomes
free ribosomes move anywhere cytosol excluded cell nucleus organelles proteins formed free ribosomes released cytosol used within cell since cytosol contains high concentrations glutathione therefore reducing environment proteins containing disulfide bonds formed oxidized cysteine residues cannot produced within
membranebound ribosomes
