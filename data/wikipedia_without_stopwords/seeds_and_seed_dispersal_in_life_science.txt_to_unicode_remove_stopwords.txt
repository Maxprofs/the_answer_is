seed dispersal movement transport seeds away parent plant plants limited mobility consequently rely upon variety dispersal vectors transport propagules including abiotic biotic vectors seeds dispersed away parent plant individually collectively well dispersed space time patterns seed dispersal determined large part dispersal mechanism important implications demographic genetic structure plant populations well migration patterns species interactions five main modes seed dispersal gravity wind ballistic water animals plants serotinous disperse seeds response environmental stimulus
benefits
seed dispersal likely several benefits plant species first seed survival often higher away parent plant higher survival may result actions densitydependent seed seedling predators pathogens often target high concentrations seeds beneath adults competition adult plants may also lower seeds transported away parent
seed dispersal also allows plants reach specific habitats favorable survival hypothesis known directed dispersal example ocotea endresiana lauraceae tree species latin america dispersed several species birds including threewattled bellbird male bellbirds perch dead trees order attract mates often defecate seeds beneath perches seeds high chance survival high light conditions escape fungal pathogens case fleshyfruited plants seeddispersal animal guts endozoochory often enhances amount speed asynchrony germination important plant benefits
seeds dispersed ants myrmecochory dispersed short distances also buried underground ants seeds thus avoid adverse environmental effects fire drought reach nutrientrich microsites survive longer seeds features peculiar myrmecochory may thus provide additional benefits present dispersal modes
finally another scale seed dispersal may allow plants colonize vacant habitats even new geographic regions
types
seed dispersal sometimes split autochory dispersal attained using plants means allochory obtained external means
autochory
gravity
barochory plant use gravity dispersal simple means achieving seed dispersal effect gravity heavier fruits causes fall plant ripe fruits exhibiting type dispersal include apples coconuts passionfruit harder shells often roll away plant gain distance gravity dispersal also allows later transmission water animal
two types autochory ballochory seed forcefully ejected dehiscence squeezing herpochory seed crawls means trichomes changes humidity
allochory
wind
wind dispersal anemochory one primitive means dispersal wind dispersal take one two primary forms seeds float breeze alternatively flutter ground classic examples dispersal mechanisms include dandelions feathery pappus attached seeds dispersed long distances maples winged seeds samara flutter ground important constraint wind dispersal need abundant seed production maximise likelihood seed landing site suitable germination also strong evolutionary constraints dispersal mechanism instance cody overton found species asteraceae islands tended reduced dispersal capabilities ie larger seed mass smaller pappus relative species mainland reliance wind dispersal common among many weedy ruderal species unusual mechanisms wind dispersal include tumbleweeds physalis fruits fully ripe may sometimes dispersed wind due space fruit covering calyx acts air bladder
water
many aquatic water terrestrial ground plant species use hydrochory seed dispersal water seeds travel extremely long distances depending specific mode water dispersalthis fruits waterproof float
water lily example plant water lilies flowers make fruit floats water drops bottom take root floor pond seeds palm trees also dispersed water grow near oceans seeds transported ocean currents long distances allowing seeds dispersed far continents
mangrove trees live right water seeds fall tree grow roots soon touch kind soil low tide might fall soil instead water start growing right fell water level high however carried far away fell mangrove trees often make little islands dirt things collect roots making little bodies land
special review oceanic waters hydrochory seen oceanic dispersal
animals
animals disperse plant seeds several ways named zoochory seeds transported outside vertebrate animals mostly mammals process known epizoochory plant species transported externally animals variety adaptations dispersal including adhesive mucus variety hooks spines barbs typical example epizoochorous plant trifolium angustifolium species old world clover adheres animal fur means stiff hairs covering seed epizoochorous plants tend herbaceous plants many representative species families apiaceae asteraceae however epizoochory relatively rare dispersal syndrome plants whole percentage plant species seeds adapted transport outside animals estimated nevertheless epizoochorous transport highly effective seeds attach wideranging animals form seed dispersal implicated rapid plant migration spread invasive species
seed dispersal via ingestion vertebrate animals mostly birds mammals endozoochory dispersal mechanism tree species endozoochory generally coevolved mutualistic relationship plant surrounds seeds edible nutritious fruit good food animals consume birds mammals important seed dispersers wide variety animals including turtles fish transport viable seeds exact percentage tree species dispersed endozoochory varies habitats range tropical rainforests seed dispersal animals tropical rainforests received much attention interaction considered important force shaping ecology evolution vertebrate tree populations tropics large animal seed dispersers tapirs chimpanzees hornbills may disperse large seeds seed dispersal agents extinction large frugivores poaching habitat loss may negative effects tree populations depend seed dispersal
seed dispersal ants myrmecochory dispersal mechanism many shrubs southern hemisphere understorey herbs northern hemisphere seeds myrmecochorous plants lipidrich attachment called elaiosome attracts ants ants carry seeds colonies feed elaiosome larvae discard otherwise intact seed underground chamber myrmecochory thus coevolved mutualistic relationship plants seeddisperser ants myrmecochory independently evolved least times flowering plants estimated present least species likely species flowering plants myrmecochorous plants frequent fynbos vegetation cape floristic region south africa kwongan vegetation dry habitat types australia dry forests grasslands mediterranean region northern temperate forests western eurasia eastern north america understorey herbs myrmecochorous
seed predators include many rodents squirrels birds jays may also disperse seeds hoarding seeds hidden caches seeds caches usually wellprotected seed predators left uneaten grow new plants addition rodents may also disperse seeds via seed spitting due presence secondary metabolites ripe fruits finally seeds may secondarily dispersed seeds deposited primary animal dispersers example dung beetles known disperse seeds clumps feces process collecting dung feed larvae
types zoochory chiropterochory bats malacochory molluscs mainly terrestrial snails ornithochory birds saurochory nonbird sauropsids
humans
dispersal humans anthropochory used seen form dispersal animals recent research points human dispersers differ animal dispersers much higher mobility based technical means human transport dispersal humans one hand may act large geographical scales lead invasive species hand dispersal humans also acts smaller regional scales drives dynamics existing biological populations humans may disperse seeds many various means surprisingly high distances repeatedly measured examples dispersal human clothes m shoes km cars regularly m singles cases km
deliberate seed dispersal also occurs seed bombing risks unsuitable provenance may introduce genetically unsuitable plants new environments
consequences
seed dispersal many consequences ecology evolution plants dispersal necessary species migrations recent times dispersal ability important factor whether species transported new habitat humans become invasive species dispersal also predicted play major role origin maintenance species diversity example myrmecochory increased rate diversification twofold plant groups evolved myrmecochorous lineages contain twice many species nonmyrmecochorous sister groups dispersal seeds away parent organism central role two major theories biodiversity maintained natural ecosystems janzenconnell hypothesis recruitment limitation seed dispersal essential allowing forest migration flowering plants
addition speed direction wind highly influential dispersal process turn deposition patterns floating seeds stagnant water bodies transportation seeds led wind direction effects colonization situated banks river wetlands adjacent streams relative distinct wind directions wind dispersal process also effect connections water bodies essentially wind plays larger role dispersal waterborne seeds short period time days seasons ecological process allows process become balanced throughout time period several years time period dispersal occurs essential considering consequences wind ecological process
