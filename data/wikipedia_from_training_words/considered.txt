== background ==
atc programming combines news analysis commentary interviews and special features broadcast live daily from 4:00 p.m to 6:00 p.m eastern time (20:00 to 22:00 utc) and is re-fed with updates until 10 p.m et (02:00 utc) broadcasts run about 105 minutes with local content interspersed in between to complete two hours in 2005 atc aired on over 560 radio stations and reached an audience of approximately 12 million listeners each weekday making it the third most listened to radio program in the united states after the rush limbaugh show and morning edition in september 2010 all things considered had an average quarter-hour audience of 1.8 million atc is co-hosted by robert siegel audie cornish and melissa block
the first broadcast of atc was fed to about 90 radio stations on may 3 1971 with host robert conley during the first week these stations were not allowed to broadcast the feed live but could record it for later broadcast the first story was about the march on washington d.c and the growing anti-vietnam war protests taking place there npr chose to place its inaugural daily newscast at the afternoon commute timeslot instead of the morning because many of its affiliates at that time did not sign on for the day until mid-morning or afterward it was not until 1979 by which time most affiliates had expanded their broadcast days to begin at 6 a.m or earlier that npr premiered morning edition
weekends on all things considered (watc) is a one-hour version of the show that premiered in 1977 with host robert conley and is broadcast on saturdays and sundays guy raz was the host of this program until he left to be the host of the ted radio hour on february 13 2013 npr announced that it was relocating production of watc to npr west
atc was excluded from the npr deal with sirius satellite radio so as not to compete with local stations airing the show
to coordinate the choice of interview partners in cultural coverage between atc and other npr shows (as of 2010 morning edition the weekend editions talk of the nation and tell me more) npr set up a dibs list system around 2005 whereby the first show to declare interest in a particular guest can reserve that person
== format ==
the format is less rigid than that of morning edition with a wider array of type and length of stories the length of stories tends to be greater than morning edition with some stories lasting for almost 23 minutes certain types of personal interest stories are almost always covered within this limit those relating to hard news or entertainment tend to last the standard three-and-a-half to four minutes
the program begins with the familiar don voegeli theme song under a one-minute billboard of the stories to be covered during the hour then the standard five-minute npr newscast is delivered from one minute to six minutes past the hour the newscast offers a cutaway after three minutes (at four minutes past the hour) allowing stations to cover the last 2.5 minutes with evening rush-hour news and traffic reports for those stations that run the newscast untouched a thirty-second music bed follows instead
the first or a segment begins at 06:30 after the hour it features important news stories although not necessarily the most important news stories of the day often it is here that the most significant interviews or developing stories are placed segment a runs 11:29 in duration and closes out at 18 after with a two-minute station break
at 20:35 past the hour atc picks back up with segment b this segment which runs 8:24 features more news and analysis and often contains lighter stories and commentary segment b breaks for the half-hour at 29 past the program goes into a one-minute local break
at the bottom of the hour atc resumes with a host return in the thirty-second return the host or hosts discuss what's coming up in the remaining half-hour and intro the news this is immediately followed by a 3:30 newscast which ends at 34 after the hour followed by a one-minute local break
segment c kicks off at 35:35 past the hour and runs 8:24 long feature stories are heard here or as many as three shorter stories or commentaries may be heard as well segment d occurs immediately after segment c at 44 past the hour and runs for four minutes segment d is a designated cutaway for stations to run local commentary or features in lieu of the national segment segment d ends at 48 after the hour and another two-minute break ensues occasionally the show will break format and place a long 12-minute story in segments c and d without a local cutaway
segment e starts at 50 after and concludes the hour the segment runs 8:09 unlike morning edition there is no set format for this segment although usually the second hour will contain an arts culture or lighter news story in this segment other times hard news otherwise not fitting in the program may be placed here
stations receive a preliminary rundown before each broadcast (usually a few minutes before 4:00 p.m eastern) denoting the timing and placement of stories so they can schedule local content as appropriate this rundown is updated as stories change until the feed ends at 10 p.m et as with morning edition two hours of content are scheduled for each program after 6 p.m eastern the feed repeats the earlier hours for the midwest and west coast although information is updated through the evening as appropriate
