louis pasteur (/lui pstr/ french [lwi past] december 27 1822 september 28 1895) was a french chemist and microbiologist renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination microbial fermentation and pasteurization he is remembered for his remarkable breakthroughs in the causes and preventions of diseases and his discoveries have saved countless lives ever since he reduced mortality from puerperal fever and created the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax his medical discoveries provided direct support for the germ theory of disease and its application in clinical medicine he is best known to the general public for his invention of the technique of treating milk and wine to stop bacterial contamination a process now called pasteurization he is regarded as one of the three main founders of bacteriology together with ferdinand cohn and robert koch and is popularly known as the father of microbiology
pasteur was responsible for disproving the doctrine of spontaneous generation he performed experiments that showed that without contamination microorganisms could not develop under the auspices of the french academy of sciences he demonstrated that in sterilized and sealed flasks nothing ever developed and in sterilized but open flasks microorganisms could grow this experiment won him the alhumbert prize of the academy
although pasteur was not the first to propose the germ theory he developed it and conducted experiments that clearly indicated its correctness and managed to convince most of europe that it was true (he was preceded by girolamo fracastoro agostino bassi and others with the significant experimental demonstration by francesco redi in the 17th century.) today he is often regarded as (one of the) fathers of germ theory
pasteur also made significant discoveries in chemistry most notably on the molecular basis for the asymmetry of certain crystals and racemization early in his career his investigation of tartaric acid resulted in the first resolution of what we now call optical isomers his work led the way to our current understanding of a fundamental principal in the structure of organic compounds
he was the director of the pasteur institute established in 1887 till his death and his body lies beneath the institute in a vault covered in depictions of his accomplishments in byzantine mosaics
although pasteur made groundbreaking experiments his reputation became associated with various controversies historical reassessment of his notebook revealed that he practiced deception to overcome his rivals
== education and early lifeedit ==
louis pasteur was born on december 27 1822 in dole jura france to a catholic family of a poor tanner he was the third child of jean-joseph pasteur and jeanne-etiennette roqui in 1827 the family moved to arbois where he entered primary school in 1831 he was an average student in his early years and not particularly academic as his interests were fishing and sketching his pastels and portraits of his parents and friends made when he was 15 were later kept in the museum of the pasteur institute in paris in 1838 he left for paris to join the institution barbet but became homesick and returned in november in 1839 he entered the collge royal de besanon and earned his baccalaurat (ba) degree in 1840 he was appointed teaching assistant at the besanon college while continuing a degree science course with special mathematics he failed his first examination in 1841 he managed to pass the baccalaurat scientifique (general science) degree in 1842 from dijon but with a poor grade in chemistry after one failed attempt for the entrance test for the cole normale suprieure in paris in 1842 he succeeded in 1844 in 1845 he received the licenci s sciences (bachelor of science) degree in 1846 he was appointed professor of physics at the collge de tournon (now called lyce gabriel-faure) in ardche but antoine jrome balard (one of the discoverers of the element bromine) wanted him back at the cole normale suprieure as a graduate assistant (prparateur) for chemistry courses he joined balard and simultaneously started his research in crystallography and in 1847 he submitted his two theses one in chemistry and the other in physics after serving briefly as professor of physics at the dijon lyce in 1848 he became professor of chemistry at the university of strasbourg where he met and courted marie laurent daughter of the university's rector in 1849 they were married on may 29 1849 and together had five children only two of whom survived to adulthood the other three died of typhoid these personal tragedies were his motivations for curing infectious diseases
== careeredit ==
pasteur was appointed to the chair of chemistry in the faculty of sciences of the university of strasbourg in 1848 in 1854 he was named dean of the new faculty of sciences at lille university where he began his studies on fermentation it was on this occasion that pasteur uttered his oft-quoted remark dans les champs de l'observation le hasard ne favorise que les esprits prpars. (in the field of observation chance favors only the prepared mind.)
in 1857 he moved to paris as the director of scientific studies at the cole normale suprieure where he took control from 1858 to 1867 and introduced a series of reforms to improve the standard of scientific work the examinations became more rigid which led to better results greater competition and increased prestige many of his decrees however were rigid and authoritarian leading to two serious student revolts during the bean revolt he decreed that a mutton stew which students had refused to eat would be served and eaten every monday on another occasion he threatened to expel any student caught smoking and 73 of the 80 students in the school resigned
in 1862 he was appointed professor of geology physics and chemistry at the cole nationale suprieure des beaux-arts the position which held until his resignation in 1867 in paris he established the pasteur institute in 1887 in which he was its director for the rest of his life

=== molecular asymmetryedit ===
in pasteur's early work as a chemist beginning at the cole normale suprieure and continuing at strasbourg and lille he examined the chemical optical and crystallographic properties of a group of compounds known as tartrates he resolved a problem concerning the nature of tartaric acid (1848) a solution of this compound derived from living things (specifically wine lees) rotated the plane of polarization of light passing through it the mystery was that tartaric acid derived by chemical synthesis had no such effect even though its chemical reactions were identical and its elemental composition was the same pasteur was able to show not only that optical activity related to the shape of the crystals but also that an asymmetric internal arrangement of the molecules of the compound was responsible for twisting the light the (2r,3r)- and (2s,3s)- tartrates were isometric non-superposable mirror images of each other this was the first time anyone had demonstrated molecular chirality and also the first explanation of isomerism some historians consider pasteur's work in this area to be his most profound and most original contributions to science and his greatest scientific discovery.
=== fermentation and germ theory of diseasesedit ===
pasteur demonstrated that fermentation is caused by the growth of micro-organisms and the emergent growth of bacteria in nutrient broths is due not to spontaneous generation but rather to biogenesis (omne vivum ex vivo all life from life") he was motivated to investigate the matter while working at lille in 1856 a local wine manufacturer m bigot the father of his student sought for his advice on the problems of making beetroot alcohol and souring after long storage in 1857 he developed his ideas stating that i intend to establish that just as there is an alcoholic ferment the yeast of beer which is found everywhere that sugar is decomposed into alcohol and carbonic acid so also there is a particular ferment a lactic yeast always present when sugar becomes lactic acid. according to his son-in-law pasteur presented his experiment on sour milk titled latate fermentation in august 1857 before the socit des sciences de lille (but according to a memoire subsequently published it was dated november 30 1857) it was published in full form in 1858 he demonstrated that yeast was responsible for fermentation to produce alcohol from sugar and that air (oxygen) was not required he also demonstrated that fermentation could also produce lactic acid (due to bacterial contamination) which make wines sour this is regarded as the foundation of pasteur's fermentation experiment and disprove of spontaneous generation of life
pasteur's research also showed that the growth of micro-organisms was responsible for spoiling beverages such as beer wine and milk with this established he invented a process in which liquids such as milk were heated to a temperature between 60 and 100 c this killed most bacteria and moulds already present within them pasteur and claude bernard completed the first test on april 20 1862 pasteur patented the process to fight the diseases of wine in 1865 the method became known as pasteurization and was soon applied to beer and milk
beverage contamination led pasteur to the idea that micro-organisms infecting animals and humans cause disease he proposed preventing the entry of micro-organisms into the human body leading joseph lister to develop antiseptic methods in surgery lister's work in turn inspired joseph lawrence to develop his own alcohol-based antiseptic which he named in tribute listerine
in 1865 two parasitic diseases called pbrine and flacherie were killing great numbers of silkworms at alais (now als) pasteur worked several years proving that these diseases were caused by a microbe attacking silkworm eggs and that eliminating the microbe in silkworm nurseries would eradicate the disease
pasteur also discovered anaerobiosis whereby some micro-organisms can develop and live without air or oxygen called the pasteur effect
=== spontaneous generationedit ===
following his fermentation experiments pasteur demonstrated that the skin of grapes was the natural source of yeasts and that sterilized grapes and grape juice never fermented he drew grape juice from under the skin with sterilzed needles and also covered grapes with sterilized cloth both experiments could not produce wine in sterilized containers his findings and ideas were against the prevailing notion of spontaneous generation he received a particularly stern criticism from flix archimde pouchet who was director of the rouen museum of natural history to settle the debate between the eminent scientists the french academy of sciences offered alhumbert prize carrying 2,500 francs to whoever could experimentally demonstrate for or against the doctrine
to prove himself correct pasteur exposed boiled broths to air in swan-neck flasks that contained a filter to prevent all particles from passing through to the growth medium and even in flasks with no filter at all with air being admitted via a long tortuous tube that would not allow dust particles to pass nothing grew in the broths unless the flasks were broken open showing that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside as spores on dust rather than spontaneously generated within the broth this was one of the last and most important experiments disproving the theory of spontaneous generation for which pasteur won the alhumbert prize in 1862 he concluded that
never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow of this simple experiment there is no known circumstance in which it can be confirmed that microscopic beings came into the world without germs without parents similar to themselves
=== immunology and vaccinationedit ===
pasteur's later work on diseases included work on chicken cholera during this work a culture of the responsible bacteria had spoiled and failed to induce the disease in some chickens he was infecting with the disease upon reusing these healthy chickens pasteur discovered he could not infect them even with fresh bacteria the weakened bacteria had caused the chickens to become immune to the disease though they had caused only mild symptoms
his assistant charles chamberland (of french origin) had been instructed to inoculate the chickens after pasteur went on holiday chamberland failed to do this but instead went on holiday himself on his return the month-old cultures made the chickens unwell but instead of the infections being fatal as they usually were the chickens recovered completely chamberland assumed an error had been made and wanted to discard the apparently faulty culture when pasteur stopped him pasteur guessed the recovered animals now might be immune to the disease as were the animals at eure-et-loir that had recovered from anthrax
in the 1870s he applied this immunization method to anthrax which affected cattle and aroused interest in combating other diseases
pasteur publicly claimed he had made the anthrax vaccine by exposing the bacilli to oxygen his laboratory notebooks now in the bibliothque nationale in paris in fact show that he used the method of rival jean-joseph-henri toussaint a toulouse veterinary surgeon to create the anthrax vaccine this method used the oxidizing agent potassium dichromate pasteur's oxygen method did eventually produce a vaccine but only after he had been awarded a patent on the production of an anthrax vaccine
the notion of a weak form of a disease causing immunity to the virulent version was not new this had been known for a long time for smallpox inoculation with smallpox (variolation) was known to result in far less scarring and greatly reduced mortality in comparison with the naturally acquired disease edward jenner had also discovered vaccination using cowpox (vaccinia) to give cross-immunity to smallpox in 1796 and by pasteur's time this had generally replaced the use of actual smallpox (variola) material in inoculation the difference between smallpox vaccination and anthrax or chicken cholera vaccination was that the weakened form of the latter two disease organisms had been generated artificially so a naturally weak form of the disease organism did not need to be found this discovery revolutionized work in infectious diseases and pasteur gave these artificially weakened diseases the generic name of vaccines in honour of jenner's discovery pasteur produced the first vaccine for rabies by growing the virus in rabbits and then weakening it by drying the affected nerve tissue
the rabies vaccine was initially created by emile roux a french doctor and a colleague of pasteur who had been working with a killed vaccine produced by desiccating the spinal cords of infected rabbits the vaccine had been tested in 50 dogs before its first human trial this vaccine was first used on 9-year old joseph meister on july 6 1885 after the boy was badly mauled by a rabid dog this was done at some personal risk for pasteur since he was not a licensed physician and could have faced prosecution for treating the boy after consulting with colleagues he decided to go ahead with the treatment three months later he examined meister and found that he was in good health pasteur was hailed as a hero and the legal matter was not pursued the treatment's success laid the foundations for the manufacture of many other vaccines the first of the pasteur institutes was also built on the basis of this achievement
legal risk was not the only kind pasteur undertook in the story of san michele axel munthe writes of the rabies vaccine research
pasteur himself was absolutely fearless anxious to secure a sample of saliva straight from the jaws of a rabid dog i once saw him with the glass tube held between his lips draw a few drops of the deadly saliva from the mouth of a rabid bull-dog held on the table by two assistants their hands protected by leather gloves
because of his study in germs pasteur encouraged doctors to sanitize their hands and equipment before surgery prior to this few doctors or their assistants practiced these procedures
=== publicationsedit ===
pasteur's principal published works are
== controversiesedit ==
a french national hero at age 55 in 1878 pasteur discreetly told his family never to reveal his laboratory notebooks to anyone his family obeyed and all his documents were held and inherited in secrecy finally in 1946 pasteur's grandson and last surviving male descendant pasteur valley-radot donated the papers to the french national library (bibliothque nationale de france) yet the papers were restricted for historical studies until the death of valley-radot in 1971 the documents were given catalogue number only in 1985 in 1995 the centennial of the death of louis pasteur a historian of science gerald l geison published an analysis of pasteur's private notebooks in his the private science of louis pasteur and declared that pasteur had given several misleading accounts and played deceptions in his most important discoveries max perutz published a defense of pasteur in the new york review of books based on further examinations of pasteur's documents french immnunologist patrice debr concluded in his book louis pasteur (1998) that in spite of his genius pasteur was sometimes unfair combative arrogant unattractive in attitude inflexible and even dogmatic
=== fermentationedit ===
when pasteur published his theory and experiments on fermentation in 1858 it was not new to science neither the idea nor the experiment in 1840 a german chemist justus von liebig had noted that yeast could induce fermentation in water however he did not know that yeasts were organisms in 1856 another german ludersdorrf reported that yeasts were microorganisms that convert sugar into alcohol in 1855 antoine bchamp professor of chemistry at the university of montpellier showed that sugar was converted to sucrose and fructose in a closed bottle containing water and when he added calcium or zinc chloride to it no reaction occurred he also noticed moulds developing in the solution but could not fathom the significance of it he concluded that water was the factor for fermentation he changed his conclusion in 1858 that water was not the main factor in fact fermentation was directly related to the growth of moulds and moulds required air for growth he regarded himself as the first to show the role of microorganisms in fermentation pasteur started his experiments only in 1857 and published his findings in 1858 (april issue of comptes rendus chimie bchamp's paper appeared in january issue) which as bchamp noted did not bring any novel idea or experiments that earlier works had not shown on the other hand bchamp was probably aware of pasteur's 1857 preliminary works with both scientists claiming priority on the discovery a bitter and protracted dispute lasted throughout their lives their rivalry extended to ideas on microbiology pathogenesis and germ theory particularly on the spontaneous generation because pasteur in his 1858 paper explicitly stated that the lactic acid bacteria (he named them lactic yeasts") which caused wine souring takes birth spontaneously as easily as beer yeast every time that the conditions are favourable. this statement directly implied that pasteur did believe in spontaneous generation he condemned the ideas of pasteur as the greatest scientific silliness of the age however bchamp was on the losing side as the bmj obituary remarked his name was associated with bygone controversies as to priority which it would be unprofitable to recall pasteur and bchamp believed that fermentation was exclusively cellular activity that is it was only due to living cells but later extraction of enzymes such as invertase by marcelin barthelot in 1860 showed that it was simply an enzymatic reaction
=== anthrax vaccineedit ===
pasteur had given a misleading account of the preparation of the anthrax vaccine used in the experiment at pouilly-le-fort the fact is that pasteur publicly claimed his success in developing anthrax vaccine in 1881 however his admirer-turned-rival toussaint was the one who developed the first vaccine toussaint isolated the gram-negative bacteria cholera des poules (later named to add irony pasteurella in honour of pasteur) in 1879 and gave samples to pasteur who used for his own works in 1880 with his publishing on july 12 at the french academy of sciences toussaint presented his successful result with an attenuated vaccine against anthrax in dogs and sheep pasteur purely on grounds of jealousy contested the discovery by publicly displaying his vaccination method in pouilly-le-fort on 5 may 1881 the promotional experiment was a success and helped pasteur sell his products getting all the benefits and glory
=== experimental ethicsedit ===
pasteur experiments are often cited as against medical ethics especially on his vaccination of meister firstly he did not have any experience in medical practice and more importantly a medical license this is often cited as a serious threat to his professional and personal reputation even his closest partner dr emile roux refused to participate in the unjust clinical trial but pasteur executed vaccination of the boy under the close watch of practising physician jacques-joseph grancher head of the paediatric clinic at paris children's hospital he was even not allowed to hold the syringe although the inoculations were entirely under his supervision it was grancher who was responsible for the injections and defended pasteur before the french national academy of medicine in the issue still giving someone a clinical test without proper diagnosis was unjustifiable (meister had not shown symptoms of rabies at the time however it must be understood that by the time symptoms appear death is almost certain even today.) secondly he kept secrecy of his procedure and did not give proper pre-clinical trials but these accusations were not entirely correct he disclosed his methods to a small group of scientists before using in human he had successfully vaccinated 50 rabid dogs
== awards and honoursedit ==
pasteur was awarded the prize of 1,500 francs in 1853 by the pharmaceutical society for the synthesis of racemic acid in 1856 the royal society of london presented him the rumford medal for his discovery of the nature of racemic acid and its relations to polarized light and the copley medal in 1874 for his work on fermentation he was elected a foreign member of the royal society (formemrs) in 1869 the french academy of sciences awarded him the montyon prizes in 1859 for experimental physiology and the jecker prize in 1861 and the alhumbert prize in 1862 for his experimental refutation of spontaneous generation though he lost election in 1857 for membership to the french academy of sciences he won it in 1862 in mineralogy section and was appointed to permanent secretary of the physical science section of the academy in 1887 in 1873 he was elected to the acadmie nationale de mdecine he was elected to littr's seat at the acadmie franaise in 1881 in 1883 he became foreign member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences
in 1873 he was made the commander in the brazilian order of the rose
pasteur won the leeuwenhoek medal microbiology's highest dutch honor in arts and sciences in 1895 both the institute pasteur and universit louis pasteur were named after him
he was made a chevalier of the legion of honour in 1853 promoted to commander in 1868 to grand officer in 1878 and made a grand cross of the legion of honor one of only 75 in all of france - in 1881
on june 8 1886 the ottoman sultan abdul hamid ii awarded pasteur with the order of the medjidie (i class) and 10000 ottoman liras
=== legacyedit ===
in many localities worldwide streets are named in his honor for example in the usa palo alto and irvine california boston and polk florida adjacent to the university of texas health science center at san antonio jonquire qubec san salvador de jujuy and buenos aires (argentina) great yarmouth in norfolk in the united kingdom jericho and wulguru in queensland (australia) phnom penh in cambodia ho chi minh city batna in algeria bandung in indonesia tehran in iran near the central campus of the warsaw university in warsaw poland adjacent to the odessa state medical university in odessa ukraine milan in italy and bucharest cluj-napoca and timioara in romania the avenue pasteur in saigon vietnam is one of the few streets in that city to retain its french name

his statue is erected at san rafael high school in san rafael california
a bronze bust of pasteur resides on the french campus of kaiser permanente's san francisco medical center in san francisco the sculpture was designed by harriet g moore and cast in 1984 by artworks foundry
the unesco/institut pasteur medal was created on the centenary of pasteur's death and is given every two years in his name in recognition of outstanding research contributing to a beneficial impact on human health
=== pasteur instituteedit ===
the pasteur institute was established by pasteur to perpetuate his commitment to basic research and its practical applications he brought together scientists with various specialties the first five departments were directed by two normaliens (graduates of the cole normale suprieure) mile duclaux (general microbiology research) and charles chamberland (microbe research applied to hygiene) as well as a biologist lie metchnikoff (morphological microbe research) and two physicians jacques-joseph grancher (rabies) and mile roux (technical microbe research) one year after the inauguration of the institute roux set up the first course of microbiology ever taught in the world then entitled cours de microbie technique (course of microbe research techniques) since 1891 the pasteur institute had been extended to different countries and currently there are 32 institutes in 29 countries in various parts of the world
== personal lifeedit ==
=== faith and spiritualityedit ===
his grandson louis pasteur vallery-radot wrote that pasteur had only kept from his catholic background a spiritualism without religious practice although catholic observers often said louis pasteur remained throughout his whole life an ardent christian and his son-in-law in perhaps the most complete biography of louis pasteur writes
absolute faith in god and in eternity and a conviction that the power for good given to us in this world will be continued beyond it were feelings which pervaded his whole life the virtues of the gospel had ever been present to him full of respect for the form of religion which had been that of his forefathers he came simply to it and naturally for spiritual help in these last weeks of his life
maurice vallery-radot grandson of the brother of the son-in-law of pasteur and outspoken catholic also holds that pasteur fundamentally remained catholic according to both pasteur vallery-radot and maurice vallery-radot the following well-known quotation attributed to pasteur is apocryphal the more i know the more nearly is my faith that of the breton peasant could i but know all i would have the faith of a breton peasant's wife according to maurice vallery-radot the false quotation appeared for the first time shortly after the death of pasteur however despite his belief in god it has been said that his views were that of a freethinker rather than a catholic a spiritual more than a religious man he was also against mixing science with religion
=== deathedit ===
pasteur was frequently stricken by strokes beginning in 1868 and the one in 1894 severely impaired his health failing to fully recover he died in 1895 near paris he was given a state funeral and was buried in the cathedral of notre dame but his remains were reinterred in a crypt in the pasteur institute in paris where the crypt is engraved with his life-saving works
