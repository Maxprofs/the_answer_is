may (/me/ may) is the fifth month of the year in the julian and gregorian calendars and one of seven months with the length of 31 days
may is a month of spring in the northern hemisphere and autumn in the southern hemisphere therefore may in the southern hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of november in the northern hemisphere and vice versa late may typically marks the start of the summer vacation season in the united states and canada and ends on labor day first monday of september
== history and origin ==
the month may was named for the greek goddess maia who was identified with the roman era goddess of fertility bona dea whose festival was held in may conversely the roman poet ovid provides a second etymology in which he says that the month of may is named for the maiores latin for elders, and that the following month (june) is named for the iuniores or young people (fasti vi.88)
mayovka in the context of the late russian empire was a picnic in the countryside or in a park in the early days of may hence the name eventually mayovka (specifically proletarian mayovka") came to mean an illegal celebration of may 1 by revolutionary public typically presented as an innocent picnic
== may symbols ==

the may birth flower is the lily of the valley and the crataegus monogyna it is native throughout the cool temperate northern hemisphere in asia europe and in the southern appalachian mountains in the united states but has been naturalized throughout the temperate climactic world
the mayflower epigaea repens is a north american harbinger of may and the floral emblem of both nova scotia and massachusetts its native range extends from newfoundland south to florida west to kentucky in the southern range and to northwest territories in the north
