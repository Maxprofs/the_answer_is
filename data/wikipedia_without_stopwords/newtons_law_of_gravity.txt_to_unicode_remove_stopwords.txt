historyedit
early historyedit
recent assessment ofer gal early history inverse square law late assumption inverse proportion gravity square distance rather common advanced number different people different reasons author credit hooke significant even seminal contribution treats hookes claim priority inverse square point uninteresting since several individuals besides newton hooke least suggested points instead idea compounding celestial motions conversion newtons thinking away centrifugal towards centripetal force hookes significant contributions
plagiarism disputeedit
first book newtons principia presented royal society robert hooke accused newton plagiarism claiming taken notion rule decrease gravity reciprocally squares distances center time according edmond halleys contemporary report hooke agreed demonstration curves generated thereby wholly newtons
way question arose anything newton owed hooke subject extensively discussed since time points continue excite controversy
hookes work claimsedit
robert hooke published ideas system world read royal society march paper gravity concerning inflection direct motion curve supervening attractive principle published somewhat developed form addition attempt prove motion earth observations hooke announced planned explain system world differing many particulars yet known based three suppositions celestial bodies whatsoever attraction gravitating power towards centers also attract celestial bodies within sphere activity bodies whatsoever put direct simple motion continue move forward straight line till effectual powers deflected bent attractive powers much powerful operating much nearer body wrought upon centers thus hooke clearly postulated mutual attractions sun planets way increased nearness attracting body together principle linear inertia
hookes statements made mention however inverse square law applies might apply attractions hookes gravitation also yet universal though approached universality closely previous hypotheses also provide accompanying evidence mathematical demonstration latter two aspects hooke stated several degrees attraction yet experimentally verified whole proposal hint present self many things hand would first compleat therefore cannot well attend ie prosecuting inquiry later writing january newton hooke communicated supposition attraction always duplicate proportion distance center reciprocall consequently velocity subduplicate proportion attraction consequently kepler supposes reciprocall distance inference velocity incorrect
hookes correspondence newton mentioned inverse square supposition decline attraction increasing distance also hookes opening letter newton november approach compounding celestial motions planets direct motion tangent attractive motion towards central body
newtons work claimsedit
newton faced may hookes claim inverse square law denied hooke credited author idea among reasons newton recalled idea discussed sir christopher wren previous hookes letter newton also pointed acknowledged prior work others including bullialdus suggested without demonstration attractive force sun inverse square proportion distance borelli suggested also without demonstration centrifugal tendency counterbalance gravitational attraction towards sun make planets move ellipses d whiteside described contribution newtons thinking came borellis book copy newtons library death
newton defended work saying first heard inverse square proportion hooke would still rights view demonstrations accuracy hooke without evidence favor supposition could guess inverse square law approximately valid great distances center according newton principia still prepublication stage many apriori reasons doubt accuracy inversesquare law especially close attracting sphere without newtons demonstrations mr hooke yet stranger cannot believed judicious philosopher accurate
remark refers among things newtons finding supported mathematical demonstration inverse square law applies tiny particles even large spherically symmetrical mass also attracts masses external surface even close exactly mass concentrated center thus newton gave justification otherwise lacking applying inverse square law large spherical planetary masses tiny particles addition newton formulated propositions book associated sections book sensitive test accuracy inverse square law showed law force accurately inverse square distance directions orientation planets orbital ellipses stay constant observed apart small effects attributable interplanetary perturbations
regard evidence still survives earlier history manuscripts written newton show newton arrived proofs circular case planetary motion endeavour recede later called centrifugal force inversesquare relation distance center correspondence hooke newton adopted language inward centripetal force according newton scholar j bruce brackenridge although much made change language difference point view centrifugal centripetal forces actual computations proofs remained either way also involved combination tangential radial displacements newton making lesson offered hooke newton although significant one perspective change analysis background shows basis newton deny deriving inverse square law hooke
newtons acknowledgmentedit
hand newton accept acknowledge editions principia hooke exclusively hooke separately appreciated inverse square law solar system newton acknowledged wren hooke halley connection scholium proposition book newton also acknowledged halley correspondence hooke reawakened dormant interest astronomical matters mean according newton hooke told newton anything new original yet beholden light business diversion gave studies think things dogmaticalness writing found motion ellipsis inclined try
modern controversyedit
since time newton hooke scholarly discussion also touched question whether hookes mention compounding motions provided newton something new valuable even though claim actually voiced hooke time described newtons manuscripts show actually combining tangential motion effects radially directed force endeavour example derivation inverse square relation circular case also show newton clearly expressing concept linear inertiafor indebted descartes work published hooke probably matters appear learned newton hooke
nevertheless number authors say newton gained hooke aspects remain controversial fact hookes private papers destroyed disappeared help establish truth
newtons role relation inverse square law sometimes represented claim think bare idea newton show inversesquare law attraction many necessary mathematical connections observable features motions bodies solar system related way observational evidence mathematical demonstrations taken together gave reason believe inverse square law approximately true exactly true accuracy achievable newtons time two centuries afterwards loose ends points could yet certainly examined implications theory yet adequately identified calculated
thirty years newtons death alexis clairaut mathematical astronomer eminent right field gravitational studies wrote reviewing hooke published one must think idea hooke diminishes newtons glory example hooke serves show distance truth glimpsed truth demonstrated
modern formedit
modern language law states following
assuming si units f measured newtons n m m kilograms kg r meters m constant g approximately equal n m kg value constant g first accurately determined results cavendish experiment conducted british scientist henry cavendish although cavendish calculate numerical value g experiment also first test newtons theory gravitation masses laboratory took place years publication newtons principia years newtons death none newtons calculations could use value g instead could calculate force relative another force
bodies spatial extentedit
bodies question spatial extent rather theoretical point masses gravitational force calculated summing contributions notional point masses constitute bodies limit component point masses become infinitely small entails integrating force vector form see extents two bodies
way shown object sphericallysymmetric distribution mass exerts gravitational attraction external bodies objects mass concentrated point centre generally true nonsphericallysymmetrical bodies
points inside sphericallysymmetric distribution matter newtons shell theorem used find gravitational force theorem tells us different parts mass distribution affect gravitational force measured point located distance r center mass distribution
portion mass located radii r r causes force r mass enclosed within sphere radius r concentrated center mass distribution noted
portion mass located radii r r exerts net gravitational force distance r center individual gravitational forces exerted elements sphere point r cancel
consequence example within shell uniform thickness density net gravitational acceleration anywhere within hollow sphere
furthermore inside uniform sphere gravity increases linearly distance center increase due additional mass times decrease due larger distance center thus spherically symmetric body uniform core uniform mantle density less core gravity initially decreases outwardly beyond boundary sphere large enough outward gravity increases eventually exceeds gravity coremantle boundary gravity earth may highest coremantle boundary
