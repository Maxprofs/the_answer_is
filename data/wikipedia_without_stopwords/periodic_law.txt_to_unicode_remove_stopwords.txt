periodic table arrangement chemical elements organized basis atomic numbers electron configurations recurring chemical properties elements presented order increasing atomic number standard form table consists grid elements rows called periods columns called groups
history periodic table reflects century growth understanding chemical properties important event history occurred table published dmitri mendeleev built upon earlier discoveries scientists antoinelaurent de lavoisier john newlands nevertheless generally given sole credit development
ancient times
number physical elements platinum tin zinc known antiquity found native form relatively simple mine primitive tools however notion limited number elements everything composed originated around bce greek philosopher aristotle proposed everything made mixture one roots idea originally suggested sicilian philosopher empedocles four roots later renamed elements plato earth water air fire aristotle plato introduced concept element ideas nothing advance understanding nature matter

hennig brand
history periodic table also history discovery chemical elements first person history discover new element hennig brand bankrupt german merchant brand tried discover philosophers stone mythical object supposed turn inexpensive base metals gold experiments distilled human urine resulted production glowing white substance named phosphorus kept discovery secret robert boyle rediscovered phosphorus published findings discovery phosphorus helped raise question meant substance element
boyle defined element substance cannot broken simpler substance chemical reaction simple definition served three centuries lasted discovery subatomic particles
antoinelaurent de lavoisier
lavoisiers trait lmentaire de chimie elementary treatise chemistry written first translated english writer robert kerr considered first modern textbook chemistry contained list simple substances lavoisier believed could broken included oxygen nitrogen hydrogen phosphorus mercury zinc sulfur formed basis modern list elements lavoisiers list also included light caloric time believed material substances classified substances metals non metals many leading chemists refused believe lavoisiers new revelations elementary treatise written well enough convince younger generation however lavoisiers descriptions elements lack completeness classified metals nonmetals

alexandreemile bguyer de chancourtois
alexandreemile bguyer de chancourtois french geologist first person notice periodicity elements similar elements occurring regular intervals ordered atomic weights devised early form periodic table named vis tellurique telluric helix element tellurium fell near center diagram elements arranged spiral cylinder order increasing atomic weight de chancourtois saw elements similar properties lined vertically publication included chart contained ions compounds addition elements original paper comptes rendus academie des scances used geological rather chemical terms include diagram result de chancourtois ideas received little attention work dmitri mendeleev publicised
john newlands
english chemist john newlands classified sixtytwo known elements eight groups based physical properties
newlands noted many pairs similar elements existed differed multiple eight mass number first assign atomic number law octaves printed chemistry news likening periodicity eights musical scale ridiculed contemporaries lecture chemistry society march published society defending decision saying theoretical topics might controversial
importance newlands analysis eventually recognised chemistry society gold medal five years recognised mendeleevs work following century gilbert n lewis valence bond theory irving langmuirs octet theory chemical bonding importance periodicity eight would accepted royal chemistry society acknowledged newlands contribution science put blue plaque house born described discoverer periodic law chemical elements contributed word periodic chemistry
dmitri mendeleev
russian chemist dmitri mendeleev first scientist make periodic table similar one used today mendeleev arranged elements atomic mass corresponding relative molar mass sometimes said played chemical solitaire long train journeys using cards various facts known elements march formal presentation made russian chemical society entitled dependence properties atomic weights elements table published obscure russian journal republished german journal zeitschrift fr chemie mendeleev stated
elements arranged according atomic mass exhibit apparent periodicity properties
elements similar regards chemical properties atomic weights either nearly value eg pt ir os increase regularly eg k rb cs
arrangement elements groups elements order atomic masses corresponds socalled valencies well extent distinctive chemical properties apparent among series li b c n o f
elements widely diffused small atomic weights
magnitude atomic weight determines character element magnitude molecule determines character compound body
must expect discovery many yet unknown elements example elements analogous aluminium silicon whose atomic weight would
atomic weight element may sometimes amended knowledge contiguous elements thus atomic weight tellurium must lie cannot
certain characteristic properties elements foretold atomic masses
scientific benefits mendeleevs table
enabled mendeleev predict discovery new elements left spaces namely ekasilicon germanium ekaaluminium gallium ekaboron scandium thus disturbance periodic table
could used mendeleev point atomic weights used time incorrect
provided variance atomic weight order
shortcomings mendeleevs table
table able predict existence noble gases however entire family elements discovered sir william ramsay able add table group without basic concept periodic table disturbed
single position could assigned hydrogen could placed either alkali metals group halogens group separately table boron carbon
lothar meyer
unknown mendeleev german chemist lothar meyer also working periodic table although work published done independently mendeleev historians regard equal cocreator periodic table meyers table included twentyeight elements classified atomic weight valence never reached idea predicting new elements correcting atomic weights months mendeleev published periodic table known elements predicted new elements help complete table corrected atomic weights elements meyer published virtually identical periodic table
meyer mendeleev considered historians science cocreators periodic table mendeleevs accurate prediction qualities undiscovered elements enables larger share credit
william odling
english chemist william odling also drew table remarkably similar table produced mendeleev odling overcame telluriumiodine problem even managed get thallium lead mercury platinum right groups something mendeleev failed first attempt odling failed achieve recognition however since suspected secretary chemical society london instrumental discrediting newlands earlier work periodic table
th century
henry moseley
year killed action gallipoli english physicist henry moseley found relationship xray wavelength element atomic number able resequence periodic table nuclear charge rather atomic weight discovery atomic numbers sequential numbers based elements atomic weight moseleys discovery showed atomic numbers fact based upon experimental measurements
using information xray wavelengths moseley placed argon atomic number z potassium z despite fact argons atomic weight greater atomic weight potassium new order agreement chemical properties elements since argon noble gas potassium alkali metal similarly moseley placed cobalt nickel able explain tellurium occurs iodine without revising experimental atomic weight tellurium proposed mendeleev
moseleys research showed gaps periodic table atomic numbers known occupied technetium promethium respectively
glenn seaborg
manhattan project research glenn seaborg experienced unexpected difficulties isolating elements americium curium seaborg wondered elements belonged different series would explain chemical properties different expected advice colleagues proposed significant change mendeleevs table actinide series
