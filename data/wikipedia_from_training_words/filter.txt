toleration is the practice of deliberately allowing or permitting a thing of which one disapproves one can meaningfully speak of toleratingi.e. of allowing or permittingonly if one is in a position to disallow. it has also been defined as to bear or endure or to nourish sustain or preserve. toleration may signify no more than forbearance and the permission given by the adherents of a dominant religion for other religions to exist even though the latter are looked on with disapproval as inferior mistaken or harmful.
there is only one verb to tolerate and one adjective tolerant, but the two nouns tolerance and toleration have evolved slightly different meanings tolerance is an attitude of mind that implies non-judgmental acceptance of different lifestyles or beliefs whereas toleration implies putting up with something that one disapproves of
historically most incidents and writings pertaining to toleration involve the status of minority and dissenting viewpoints in relation to a dominant state religion in the twentieth century and after analysis of the doctrine of toleration has been expanded to include political and ethnic groups homosexuals and other minorities and human rights embodies the principle of legally enforced toleration

the new testament parable of the tares which speaks of the difficulty of distinguishing wheat from weeds before harvest time has also been invoked in support of religious toleration in his letter to bishop roger of chalons bishop wazo of liege (c 9851048 ad) relied on the parable to argue that the church should let dissent grow with orthodoxy until the lord comes to separate and judge them
roger williams a baptist theologian and founder of rhode island used this parable to support government toleration of all of the weeds (heretics) in the world because civil persecution often inadvertently hurts the wheat (believers) too instead williams believed it was god's duty to judge in the end not man's this parable lent further support to williams biblical philosophy of a wall of separation between church and state as described in his 1644 book the bloody tenent of persecution

bayle was repelled by the use of scripture to justify coercion and violence one must transcribe almost the whole new testament to collect all the proofs it affords us of that gentleness and long-suffering which constitute the distinguishing and essential character of the gospel. he did not regard toleration as a danger to the state but to the contrary if the multiplicity of religions prejudices the state it proceeds from their not bearing with one another but on the contrary endeavoring each to crush and destroy the other by methods of persecution in a word all the mischief arises not from toleration but from the want of it.

=== hindu religionedit ===
the rigveda says ekam sath viprah bahudha vadanti which translates to the truth is one but sages call it by different names consistent with this tradition india chose to be a secular country even though it was divided partitioning on religious lines whatever intolerance hindu scholars displayed towards other religions was subtle and symbolic and most likely was done to present a superior argument in defence of their own faith traditionally hindus showed their intolerance by withdrawing and avoiding contact with those whom they held in contempt instead of using violence and aggression to strike fear in their hearts hinduism is perhaps the only religion in the world which showed remarkable tolerance towards other religions in difficult times and under testing conditions even buddhism which spread in india mostly through negative campaigns against hinduism cannot claim that credit criticizing other religions and showing them in poor light to attract converts to its own fold was never an approved practice in hinduism
pluralism and tolerance of diversity are built into hindu theology india's long history is a testimony to its tolerance of religious diversity christianity came to india with st thomas in the first century a.d. long before it became popular in the west judaism came to india after the jewish temple was destroyed by the romans in 70 a.d and the jews were expelled from their homeland in a recent book titled who are the jews of india?

=== buddhismedit ===
although bhikkhu bodhi states that the buddha taught the path to the supreme goal of the holy life is made known only in his own teaching buddhists have nevertheless shown significant tolerance for other religions buddhist tolerance springs from the recognition that the dispositions and spiritual needs of human beings are too vastly diverse to be encompassed by any single teaching and thus that these needs will naturally find expression in a wide variety of religious forms. james freeman clarke said in ten great religions (1871) the buddhists have founded no inquisition they have combined the zeal which converted kingdoms with a toleration almost inexplicable to our western experience.
the edicts of ashoka issued by king ashoka the great (269231 bce) a buddhist declared ethnic and religious tolerance his edict xii engraved in stone stated the faiths of others all deserve to be honored for one reason or another by honoring them one exalts one's own faith and at the same time performs a service to the faith of others.

=== modern definitionedit ===
historian alexandra walsham notes that the modern understanding of the word toleration may be very different from its historic meaning toleration in modern parlance has been analyzed as a component of a liberal or libertarian view of human rights hans oberdiek writes as long as no one is harmed or no one's fundamental rights are violated the state should keep hands off tolerating what those controlling the state find disgusting deplorable or even debased this for a long time has been the most prevalent defense of toleration by liberals it is found for example in the writings of american philosophers john rawls robert nozick ronald dworkin brian barry and a canadian will kymlicka among others.
isaiah berlin attributes to herbert butterfield the notion that toleration implies a certain disrespect i tolerate your absurd beliefs and your foolish acts though i know them to be absurd and foolish mill would i think have agreed.
john gray states that when we tolerate a practice a belief or a character trait we let something be that we judge to be undesirable false or at least inferior our toleration expresses the conviction that despite its badness the object of toleration should be left alone. however according to gray new liberalismthe liberalism of rawls dworkin ackerman and suchlike seems to imply that it is wrong for government to discriminate in favour of or against any form of life animated by a definite conception of the good.
john rawls theory of political liberalism conceives of toleration as a pragmatic response to the fact of diversity. diverse groups learn to tolerate one another by developing what rawls calls overlapping consensus individuals and groups with diverse metaphysical views or comprehensive schemes will find reasons to agree about certain principles of justice that will include principles of toleration.

=== tolerating the intolerantedit ===
walzer karl popper and john rawls have discussed the paradox of tolerating intolerance walzer asks should we tolerate the intolerant? he notes that most minority religious groups who are the beneficiaries of tolerance are themselves intolerant at least in some respects rawls argues that an intolerant sect should be tolerated in a tolerant society unless the sect directly threatens the security of other members of the society he links this principle to the stability of a tolerant society in which members of an intolerant sect in a tolerant society will over time acquire the tolerance of the wider society
=== other criticisms and issuesedit ===
toleration has been described as undermining itself via moral relativism either the claim self-referentially undermines itself or it provides us with no compelling reason to believe it if we are skeptical about knowledge then we have no way of knowing that toleration is good.
ronald dworkin argues that in exchange for toleration minorities must bear with the criticisms and insults which are part of the freedom of speech in an otherwise tolerant society dworkin has also questioned whether the united states is a tolerant secular nation or is re-characterizing itself as a tolerant religious nation based on the increasing re-introduction of religious themes into conservative politics dworkin concludes that the tolerant secular model is preferable although he invited people to use the concept of personal responsibility to argue in favor of the tolerant religious model.
in the end of faith sam harris asserts that society should be unwilling to tolerate unjustified religious beliefs about morality spirituality politics and the origin of humanity especially beliefs which promote violence
