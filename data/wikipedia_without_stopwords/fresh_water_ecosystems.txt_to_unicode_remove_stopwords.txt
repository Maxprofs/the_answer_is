types
many waste types defined modern systems waste management notably including
municipal waste includes household waste commercial waste demolition waste
hazardous waste includes industrial waste
biomedical waste includes clinical waste
special hazardous waste includes radioactive waste explosive waste electronic waste ewaste
reporting
many issues surround reporting waste commonly measured size weight stark difference two example organic waste much heavier wet plastic glass bottles different weights size global scale difficult report waste countries different definitions waste falls waste categories well different ways reporting based incomplete reports parties basel convention estimated million tonnes waste generated year oecd estimated billion tonnes member countries despite inconsistencies waste reporting still useful small large scale determine key causes locations find ways preventing minimizing recovering treating disposing waste
costs
environmental costs
inappropriately managed waste attract rodents insects harbour gastrointestinal parasites yellow fever worms plague conditions humans exposure hazardous wastes particularly burned cause various diseases including cancers toxic waste materials contaminate surface water groundwater soil air causes problems humans species ecosystems waste treatment disposal produces significant green house gas ghg emissions notably methane contributing significantly global warming
social costs
waste management significant environmental justice issue many environmental burdens cited often borne marginalized groups racial minorities women residents developing nations nimby back yard opposition residents proposal new development close however need expansion siting waste treatment disposal facilities increasing worldwide growing market transboundary movement waste although waste flows countries goes developed nations significant amount waste moved developed developing nations
economic costs
economic costs managing waste high often paid municipal governments money often saved efficiently designed collection routes modifying vehicles public education environmental policies pay throw reduce cost management reduce waste quantities waste recovery recycling reuse curb economic costs avoids extracting raw materials often cuts transportation costs economic assessment municipal waste management systems case studies using combination lifecycle assessment lca lifecycle costing lcc location waste treatment disposal facilities often impact property values due noise dust pollution unsightliness negative stigma informal waste sector consists mostly waste pickers scavenge metals glass plastic textiles materials trade profit sector significantly alter reduce waste particular system negative economic effects come disease poverty exploitation abuse workers
resource recovery
resource recovery retrieval recyclable waste intended disposal specific next use processing recyclables extract recover materials resources convert energy process carried resource recovery facility resource recovery important environment cost effective decreasing amount waste sent disposal stream reduce amount space needed landfills protect limited natural resources
energy recovery
energy recovery waste using nonrecyclable waste materials extracting heat electricity energy variety processes including combustion gasification pyrolyzation anaerobic digestion process referred wastetoenergy
several ways recover energy waste anaerobic digestion naturally occurring process decomposition organic matter reduced simpler chemical component absence oxygen incineration direct controlled burning municipal solid waste reduce waste make energy secondary recovered fuel energy recovery waste cannot reused recycled mechanical biological treatment activities pyrolysis involves heating waste absence oxygen high temperatures break carbon content mixture gaseous liquid fuels solid residue gasification conversion carbon rich material high temperature partial oxidation gas stream plasma arc heating high heating municipal solid waste temperatures ranging c energy released electrical discharge inert atmosphere
using waste fuel offer important environmental benefits provide safe costeffective option wastes would normally dealt disposal help reduce carbon dioxide emissions diverting energy use fossil fuels also generating energy using waste fuel reduce methane emissions generated landfills averting waste landfills
debate classification certain biomass feedstock wastes crude tall oil cto coproduct pulp papermaking process defined waste residue european countries fact produced purpose significant value add potential industrial applications several companies use cto produce fuel pine chemicals industry maximizes feedstock producing lowcarbon biobased chemicals cascading use
education awareness
education awareness area waste waste management increasingly important global perspective resource management talloires declaration declaration sustainability concerned unprecedented scale speed environmental pollution degradation depletion natural resources local regional global air pollution accumulation distribution toxic wastes destruction depletion forests soil water depletion ozone layer emission green house gases threaten survival humans thousands living species integrity earth biodiversity security nations heritage future generations several universities implemented talloires declaration establishing environmental management waste management programs eg waste management universityproject university vocational education promoted various organizations eg wamitab chartered institution wastes management
