definition metric
metric defines distance measured two nearby points space terms coordinate system coordinate systems locate points space whatever number dimensions assigning unique positions grid known coordinates point metric formula describes displacement space interest translated distances
metric earths surface
example consider measurement distance two places surface earth simple familiar example spherical geometry surface earth twodimensional points surface earth specified two coordinatesfor example latitude longitude specification metric requires one first specify coordinates used simple example surface earth could choose kind coordinate system wish example latitude longitude xyz cartesian coordinates chosen specific coordinate system numerical values coordinates two points uniquely determined based upon properties space discussed appropriate metric mathematically established curved surface earth see effect longhaul airline flights distance two points measured based upon great circle rather straight line one might plot twodimensional map earths surface general shortestdistance paths called geodesics euclidean geometry geodesic straight line noneuclidean geometry earths surface case indeed even shortestdistance great circle path always longer euclidean straight line path passes interior earth difference straight line path shortestdistance great circle path due curvature earths surface always effect due curvature short distances effect small enough unnoticeable
plane maps great circles earth mostly shown straight lines indeed seldomused map projection namely gnomonic projection great circles shown straight lines projection distance scale varies much different areas map projection distance two points earth measured along great circle geodesics directly proportional distance map
metric tensor
differential geometry backbone mathematics general relativity metric tensor defined precisely characterizes space described explaining way distances measured every possible direction general relativity necessarily invokes metric four dimensions one time three space general different reference frames experience different intervals time space depending inertial frame means metric tensor general relativity relates precisely two events spacetime separated metric expansion occurs metric tensor changes time specifically whenever spatial part metric gets larger time goes forward kind expansion different kinds expansions explosions commonly seen nature small part times distances reference frames instead subject change useful visualization approach subject rather objects fixed space moving apart emptiness space growing objects without acceleration objects space objects grows shrinks various geodesics converge diverge

topology expanding space
time space makes universe expanding words space universe sometimes used interchangeably distinct meanings context space mathematical concept stands threedimensional manifold respective positions embedded universe refers everything exists including matter energy space extradimensions may wrapped various strings time various events take place expansion space reference d manifold description involves structures extra dimensions exterior universe
ultimate topology space posteriorisomething principle must observedas constraints simply reasoned words priori constraints space live connected whether wraps around compact space though certain cosmological models gdels universe even permit bizarre worldlines intersect ultimately question whether something like pacman universe traveling far enough one direction would allow one simply end back place like going way around surface balloon planet like earth observational question constrained measurable nonmeasurable universes global geometry present observations consistent universe infinite extent simply connected though limited distinguishing simple complicated proposals cosmological horizons universe could infinite extent could finite evidence leads inflationary model early universe also implies total universe much larger observable universe edges exotic geometries topologies would directly observable light reached scales aspects universe exist still allowed intents purposes safe assume universe infinite spatial extent without edge strange connectedness
regardless overall shape universe question universe expanding one require answer according theories describe expansion way define space universe way requires additional exterior space expand since expansion infinite expanse happen without changing infinite extent expanse certain manifold space live simply property distances objects getting larger time goes implies simple observational consequences associated metric expansion explored outside embedding hyperspace required expansion occur visualizations often seen universe growing bubble nothingness misleading respect reason believe anything outside expanding universe universe expands
even overall spatial extent infinite thus universe get larger still say space expanding locally characteristic distance objects increasing infinite space grows remains infinite
effects expansion small scales
expansion space sometimes described force acts push objects apart though accurate description effect cosmological constant accurate picture phenomenon expansion general much universes history expansion due mainly inertia matter early universe flying apart unknown reasons likely result cosmic inflation simply continued though everdecreasing rate due attractive effect gravity
