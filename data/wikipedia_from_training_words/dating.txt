dating is a part of the human mating process whereby two people meet socially for companionship beyond the level of friendship or with the aim of each assessing the other's suitability as a partner in an intimate relationship or marriage it can be a form of courtship consisting of social activities done by the couple while the term has several meanings it usually refers to the act of meeting and engaging in some mutually agreed upon social activity in public together as a couple
the protocols and practices of dating and the terms used to describe it vary considerably from country to country and over time the most common idea is two people trying out a relationship and exploring whether they are compatible by going out together in public as a couple who may or may not yet be having sexual relations this period of courtship is sometimes seen as a precursor to engagement or marriage
== history ==
dating as an institution is a relatively recent phenomenon which has mainly emerged in the last few centuries from the standpoint of anthropology and sociology dating is linked with other institutions such as marriage and the family which have also been changing rapidly and which have been subject to many forces including advances in technology and medicine as humans have evolved from hunter-gatherers into civilized societies and more recently into modern societies there have been substantial changes in the relationship between men and women with perhaps one of a few remaining biological constants being that both adult women and men must have sexual intercourse for human procreation to happen
humans have been compared to other species in terms of sexual behavior neurobiologist robert sapolsky constructed a reproductive spectrum with opposite poles being tournament species in which males compete fiercely for reproductive privileges with females and pair bond arrangements in which a male and female will bond for life according to sapolsky humans are somewhat in the middle of this spectrum in the sense that humans form pair bonds but there is the possibility of cheating or changing partners these species-particular behavior patterns provide a context for aspects of human reproduction including dating however one particularity of the human species is that pair bonds are often formed without necessarily having the intention of reproduction in modern times emphasis on the institution of marriage generally described as a male-female bond has obscured pair bonds formed by same-sex and transsexual couples and that many heterosexual couples also bond for life without offspring or that often pairs that do have offspring separate thus the concept of marriage is changing widely in many countries
historically marriages in most societies were arranged by parents and older relatives with the goal not being love but legacy and economic stability and political alliances according to anthropologists accordingly there was little need for a temporary trial period such as dating before a permanent community-recognized union was formed between a man and a woman while pair-bonds of varying forms were recognized by most societies as acceptable social arrangements marriage was reserved for heterosexual pairings and had a transactional nature where wives were in many cases a form of property being exchanged between father and husband and who would have to serve the function of reproduction communities exerted pressure on people to form pair-bonds in places such as europe in china society demanded people get married before having a sexual relationship and many societies found that some formally recognized bond between a man and a woman was the best way of rearing and educating children as well as helping to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings regarding competition for mates
generally during much of recorded history of humans in civilization and into the middle ages in europe weddings were seen as business arrangements between families while romance was something that happened outside of marriage discreetly such as covert meetings the 12th-century book the art of courtly love advised that true love can have no place between husband and wife. according to one view clandestine meetings between men and women generally outside of marriage or before marriage were the precursors to today's dating
from about 1700 a worldwide movement perhaps described as the empowerment of the individual took hold leading to the emancipation of women and the equality of individuals men and women became more equal politically financially and socially in many nations women won the right to vote and own property and receive equal treatment by the law and these changes had profound impacts on the relationships between men and women parental influence declined in many societies individuals could decideon their ownwhether they should marry whom they should marry and when they should marry a few centuries ago dating was sometimes described as a courtship ritual where young women entertained gentleman callers usually in the home under the watchful eye of a chaperone, but increasingly in many western countries it became a self-initiated activity with two young people going out as a couple in public together still dating varies considerably by nation custom religious upbringing technology and social class and important exceptions with regards to individual freedoms remain as many countries today still practice arranged marriages request dowries and forbid same-sex pairings although in many countries movies meals and meeting in coffeehouses and other places is now popular as are advice books suggesting various strategies for men and women in other parts of the world such as in south asia and many parts of the middle east being alone in public as a couple with another person is not only frowned upon but can even lead to either person being socially ostracized
in the twentieth century dating was sometimes seen as a precursor to marriage but it could also be considered as an end-in-itself that is an informal social activity akin to friendship it generally happened in that portion of a person's life before the age of marriage but as marriage became less permanent with the advent of divorce dating could happen at other times in peoples lives as well people became more mobile rapidly developing technology played a huge role new communication technology such as the telephone internet and text messaging enabled dates to be arranged without face-to-face contact cars extended the range of dating as well as enabled back-seat sexual exploration in the mid-twentieth century the advent of birth control as well as safer procedures for abortion changed the equation considerably and there was less pressure to marry as a means for satisfying sexual urges new types of relationships formed it was possible for people to live together without marrying and without children information about human sexuality grew and with it an acceptance of all types of sexual orientations is becoming more common today the institution of dating continues to evolve at a rapid rate with new possibilities and choices opening up
== dating as a social relationship ==
=== wide variation in behavior patterns ===
and the only rule is that there are no rules
social rules regarding dating vary considerably according to variables such as country social class religion age sexual orientation and gender behavior patterns are generally unwritten and constantly changing there are considerable differences between social and personal values each culture has particular patterns which determine such choices as whether the man asks the woman out where people might meet whether kissing is acceptable on a first date the substance of conversation who should pay for meals or entertainment or whether splitting expenses is allowed among the karen people in burma and thailand women are expected to write love poetry and give gifts to win over the man since dating can be a stressful situation there is the possibility of humor to try to reduce tensions for example director blake edwards wanted to date singing star julie andrews and he joked in parties about her persona by saying that her endlessly cheerful governess image from movies such as mary poppins and the sound of music gave her the image of possibly having lilacs for pubic hair andrews appreciated his humor sent him lilacs dated him and later married him and the couple stayed together for 41 years until his death in 2010
=== different meanings of the term ===
while the term dating has many meanings the most common refers to a trial period in which two people explore whether to take the relationship further towards a more permanent relationship in this sense dating refers to the time when people are physically together in public as opposed to the earlier time period in which people are arranging the date perhaps by corresponding by email or text or phone another meaning of the term dating is to describe a stage in a person's life when he or she is actively pursuing romantic relationships with different people if two unmarried celebrities are seen in public together they are often described as dating which means they were seen in public together and it is not clear whether they are merely friends exploring a more intimate relationship or are romantically involved a related sense of the term is when two people have been out in public only a few times but have not yet committed to a relationship in this sense dating describes an initial trial period and can be contrasted with being in a committed relationship
=== evaluation ===
one of the main purposes of dating is for two or more people to evaluate one anothers suitability as a long term companion or spouse often physical characteristics personality financial status and other aspects of the involved persons are judged and as a result feelings can be hurt and confidence shaken because of the uncertainty of the whole situation the desire to be acceptable to the other person and the possibility of rejection dating can be very stressful for all parties involved
while some of what happens on a date is guided by an understanding of basic unspoken rules there is considerable room to experiment and there are numerous sources of advice available sources of advice include magazine articles self-help books dating coaches friends and many other sources and the advice given can pertain to all facets of dating including such aspects as where to go what to say what not to say what to wear how to end a date how to flirt and differing approaches regarding first dates versus subsequent dates in addition advice can apply to periods before a date such as how to meet prospective partners as well as after a date such as how to break off a relationship
there are now more than 500 businesses worldwide that offer dating coach serviceswith almost 350 of those operating in the u.s and the number of these businesses has surged since 2005 frequency of dating varies by person and situation among singles actively seeking partners 36% had been on no dates in the past three months 13% had one date 22% had two to four dates and 25% had five or more dates according to a 2005 u.s survey traumatic events can sometimes cause people to start dating for example two passengers aboard us airways flight 1549 which crashed in the hudson river but without loss of life began dating afterwards
the copulatory gaze looking lengthily at a new possible partner brings you straight into a sparring scenario you will stare for two to three seconds when you first spy each other then look down or away before bringing your eyes in sync again this may be combined with displacement gestures small repetitive fiddles that signal a desire to speed things up and make contact when approaching a stranger you want to impress exude confidence in your stance even if you're on edge pull up to your full height in a subtle chest-thrust pose which arches your back puffs out your upper body and pushes out your buttocks roll your shoulders back and down and relax your facial expression
=== meeting places ===
there are numerous ways to meet potential dates including blind dates classified ads dating websites hobbies holidays office romance social networking speed dating and others a pew study in 2005 which examined internet users in long-term relationships including marriage found that many met by contacts at work or at school the survey found that 55% of relationship-seeking singles agreed that it was difficult to meet people where they live. one writer suggested that meeting possible partners was easier in pedestrian-oriented cities such as berlin or barcelona rather than los angeles since there were more chances for face-to-face contact work is a common place to meet potential spouses although there are some indications that the internet is overtaking the workplace as an introduction venue some couples met because they lived in the same building and shared a common bathroom hobbies can be an informal way for people to meet in britain one in five marry a co-worker but half of all workplace romances end within three months in india there are incidents of people meeting future spouses in the workplace one drawback of office dating is that a bad date can lead to workplace awkwardness.
=== gender differences ===
there is general perception that men and women approach dating differently hence the reason why advice for each sex varies greatly particularly when dispensed by popular magazines for example it is a common belief that heterosexual men often seek women based on beauty and youth psychology researchers at the university of michigan suggested that men prefer women who seem to be malleable and awed and prefer younger women with subordinate jobs such as secretaries and assistants and fact-checkers rather than executive-type women online dating patterns suggest that men are more likely to initiate online exchanges (over 75%) and extrapolate that men are less choosy seek younger women and cast a wide net in a similar vein the stereotype for heterosexual women is that they seek well-educated men who are their age or older with high-paying jobs evolutionary psychology suggests that women are the choosier of the genders since reproduction is a much larger investment for women who have more to lose by making bad choices.
all of these are examples of gender stereotypes which plague dating discourse and shape individuals and societies expectations of how heterosexual relationships should be navigated in addition to the deterimental effects of upholding limited views of relationships and sexual and romantic desires stereotypes also lead to framing social problems in a problematic way for example some have noted that educated women in many countries including italy and russia and the united states find it difficult to have a career as well as raise a family prompting a number of writers to suggest how women should approach dating and how to time their careers and personal life yet the advice comes with the assumption that the work-life balance is inherently a woman's problem in many societies there is a view that women should fulfill the role of primary caregivers with little to no spousal support and with few services by employers or government such as parental leave or child care accordingly an issue regarding dating is the subject of career timing which generates controversy some views reflect a traditional notion of gender roles for example danielle crittenden in what our mothers didn't tell us argued that having both a career and family at the same time was taxing and stressful for a woman as a result she suggested that women should date in their early twenties with a seriousness of purpose marry when their relative beauty permitted them to find a reliable partner have children then return to work in their early thirties with kids in school crittenden acknowledged that splitting a career path with a ten-year baby-raising hiatus posed difficulties there are contrasting views which suggest that women should focus on careers in their twenties and thirties columnist maureen dowd quoted comedian bill maher on the subject of differing dating agendas between men and women women get in relationships because they want somebody to talk to -- men want women to shut up.
it is increasingly common today however with new generations and in a growing number of countries to frame the work-life balance issue as a social problem rather than a gender problem with the advent of a changing workplace the increased participation of women in the labor force an increasing number of men who are picking up their share of parenting and housework and more and more governments and industries committing themselves to achieving gender equality the question of whether or not or when to start a family is slowly being recognized as an issue that touches (or should touch) both genders
=== love ===
if there is any aspect of dating which is common for both sexes then perhaps the idea of being in love can be scary one said being really intimate with someone in a committed sense is kind of threatening and described love as the most terrifying thing. in her psychology today column research scientist columnist and author debby herbenick compared it to a roller coaster
there's something wonderful i think about taking chances on love and sex  going out on a limb can be roller-coaster scary because none of us want to be rejected or to have our heart broken but so what if that happens i for one would rather fall flat on my face as i serenade my partner (off-key and all) in a bikini and a short little pool skirt than sit on the edge of the pool dipping my toes in silence
one dating adviser agreed that love is risky and wrote that there is truly only one real danger that we must concern ourselves with and that is closing our hearts to the possibility that love exists.
=== controversy ===
what happens in the dating world can reflect larger currents within popular culture for example when the 1995 book the rules appeared it touched off media controversy about how men and women should relate to each other with different positions taken by new york times columnist maureen dowd and british writer kira cochrane of the guardian and others it has even caused anthropologists such as helen fisher to suggest that dating is a game designed to impress and capture which is not about honesty but novelty excitement and even danger which can boost dopamine levels in the brain the subject of dating has spun off popular culture terms such as the friend zone which refers to a situation in which a dating relation evolves into a platonic non-sexual union
=== stranger danger ===
since people dating often do not know each other well there is the risk of violence including date rape according to one report there was a 10% chance of violence between students happening between a boyfriend and girlfriend sometimes described as intimate partner violence over a 12month period another estimate was that 20% of u.s high school girls aged 1418 were hit slapped shoved or forced into sexual activity there is evidence that violence while dating isn't limited to any one culture or group or religion but that it remains an issue in different countries it is usually the female who is the victim but there have been cases where males have been hurt as well sara mccorquodale suggests that women meeting strangers on dates meet initially in busy public places share details of upcoming dates with friends or family so they know where they'll be and who they'll be with avoid revealing one's surname or address and conducting searches on them on the internet prior to the date one advisor suggested don't leave drinks unattended have an exit plan if things go badly and ask a friend to call you on your cell phone an hour into the date to ask how it's going in some regions of the world such as chechnya bride stealing is fairly common enough to provoke leader ramzan kadyrov to urge young men to use persuasion instead kadyrov advised
if you explain beautifully a woman does not look to see whether you are handsome or not -- but listens more so you can win her heart that is why i advise our boys to read stories and watch movies more and to learn more beautiful phrases to tell girls
=== technology ===
the internet and several websites are shaping the way new generations date facebook skype whatsapp and other applications like loveroom lulu and grindr have made remote connections possible particularly for the lgbti community where the dating pool can be more difficult to navigate because of discrimination and having a minority status in society online dating tools are an alternate way to meet potential dates new software applications such as grindr has also provided a means for homosexual people to meet with possible partners for sexual encounters in close proximity

==== india ====
indian dating is heavily influenced by the custom of arranged marriages which require little dating although there are strong indications that the institution is undergoing change and that love marriages are becoming more accepted as india becomes more intertwined with the rest of the world in the cities at least it is becoming more accepted for two people to meet and try to find if there is compatibility
the majority of indian marriages are arranged by parents and relatives and one estimate is that 7 of every 10 marriages are arranged sometimes the bride and groom don't meet until the wedding and there is no courtship or wooing before the joining in the past it meant that couples were chosen from the same caste and religion and economic status there is widespread support for arranged marriages generally writer lavina melwani described a happy marriage which had been arranged by the bride's father and noted that during the engagement the woman was allowed to go out with him before they were married on only one occasion the couple married and found happiness supporters of arranged marriage suggest that there is a risk of having the marriage fall apart whether it was arranged by relatives or by the couple themselves and that what's important is not how the marriage came to be but what the couple does after being married parents and relatives exert considerable influence sometimes posting matrimonial ads in newspapers and online customs encourage families to put people together and discourage sexual experimentation as well as so-called serial courtship in which a prospective bride or groom dates but continually rejects possible partners since the interests of the family are seen as more important than the romantic needs of the people marrying indian writers such as mistry in his book family matters sometimes depict arranged marriages as unhappy writer sarita sarvate of india currents thinks people calculate their value on the indian marriage market according to measures such as family status and that arranged marriages typically united spouses who often didn't love each other she suggested love was out of place in this world because it risked passion and sordid sexual liaisons love as she sees it is waking up in the morning and thinking about someone. writer jennifer marshall described the wife in an arranged marriage as living in a world of solitude without much happiness and feeling pressured by relatives to conceive a son so she wouldn't be considered as barren by her husband's family in this sense the arranged marriage didn't bring love happiness and companionship. writer vijaysree venkatraman believes arranged marriages are unlikely to disappear soon commenting in his book review of shoba narayan's monsoon diary which has a detailed description of the steps involved in a present day arranged marriage there are indications that even the institution of arranged marriages is changing with marriages increasingly being arranged by unknown unfamiliar sources and less based on local families who know each other writer lavina melwani in little india compared indian marriages to business deals
until recently indian marriages had all the trappings of a business transaction involving two deal-making families a hardboiled matchmaker and a vocal board of shareholders concerned uncles and aunts the couple was almost incidental to the deal they just dressed and showed up for the wedding ceremony and after that the onus was on them to adjust to the 1,001 relatives get to know each other and make the marriage work
relationships in which dating is undertaken by two people who choose their dates without parental involvement and sometimes carry on clandestine get-togethers has become increasingly common when this leads to a wedding the resulting unions are sometimes called love marriages there are increasing incidences when couples initiate contact on their own particularly if they live in a foreign country in one case a couple met surreptitiously over a game of cards indians who move abroad to britain or america often follow the cultural patterns of their new country for example one indian woman met a white american man while skiing and married him and the formerly all-important relatives were reduced to bystanders trying to influence things ineffectively factors operating worldwide such as increased affluence the need for longer education and greater mobility have lessened the appeal for arranged marriages and these trends have affected criteria about which possible partners are acceptable making it more likely that pairings will cross previously impenetrable barriers such as caste or ethnic background indian-americans in the u.s sometimes participate in singles meets organized by websites which happen about once a month with 100 participants at each event an organizer did not have firm statistics about the success rate leading to a long-term relationship but estimated about one in every ten members finds a partner through the site

in britain the term dating bears similarity to the american sense of the tentative exploratory part of a relationship if two people are going out together it may mean they're dating but that their relationship has advanced to a relatively long-standing and sexual boyfriend-girlfriend relationship although they're not cohabitating although britons are familiar with the term dating the rituals surrounding courtship are somewhat different from those commonly found in north america writer kira cochrane advises daters to get out there and meet people while noting a trend of temporary suspension of marriage until an individual reaches his or her thirties she sees a trend for developing new ways of meeting people in contrast writer bibi van der zee found dating etiquette rules to be helpful and found that supposedly liberated advice such as just be yourself to be the most useless advice in history. she expresses frustration following fruitless sexual relationships and that her mid twenties saw dating relationships with partners who were less willing to return phone calls or display interest in long-term commitment she felt clueless and unwanted she wrote and found advice books such as the rules helpful british writer henry castiglione signed up for a weekend flirting course and found the experience helpful he was advised to talk to and smile at everyone he met emailing back-and-forth after meeting on a dating website is one way to get to know people in britain and elsewhere in the uk one estimate from 2009 is that 15 million people are single and half of these are seeking a long-term relationship three-quarters of them have not been in a relationship for more than 18 months in a twelve-month period the average number of dates that a single person will have is four when dating 43% of people google their dates ahead of time almost five million britons visited a dating website in the past twelve months a third admitting to lying on their profile a fifth of married individuals between 19 and 25 met their spouse online one poll in 2009 of 3,000 couples suggested that the average duration of their courtship period between first meeting to the acceptance of a marriage proposal was three years

==== german-speaking countries ====
while analysts such as harald martenstein and others suggest that it is easier for persons to initiate contact in america many germans view the american dating habits as unspontaneous ridiculous and rigid until the 1960s countries such as germany switzerland and austria had a more formal approach for first contacts that was eased during seasonal festivals like carnival and festivals and funfairs like the oktoberfest which allowed for more casual flirts
membership in voluntary associations is relatively high in german-speaking countries and these provided further chances for possible partners to meet strolling on esplanades and promenade walkways such as the one in hamburg called the jungfernstieg (maidens way) have been another venue for introductions as early as the 19th century analyst geoffrey gorer described dating as an american idiosyncrasy focusing on youth of college age and expressed in activities such as american proms in contrast german speaking countries and the longstanding musical tradition there provided ample opportunity of persons of varying ages enjoying social dances such as the vienna opera ball and other occasions
romantic encounters were often described with french terms like rendezvous or tte--tte the german term of stelldichein (as translated by joachim heinrich campes) is used to signify dating when the age of consent to marriage was relatively high german traditions to signify lovers who met in hiding were described with terms like fensterln (windowing) or kiltgang (dawn stroll) used in bavaria and switzerland analyst sebastian heinzel sees a major cultural divide between american dating habits and european informality and leads to instances in which european expatriates in cities such as new york keep to themselves
today most german couples in long-term relationships get to know each other through mutual friends at work or while going out at night the first few months of dating often involve sexual intercourse but are still rather casual and do not imply a serious wish to get married

==== canada and united states ====
one report suggested the united states as well as other western-oriented countries were different from the rest of the world because love is the reason for mating, as opposed to marriages being arranged to cement economic and class ties between families and promote political stability dating by mutual consent of two single people is the norm british writer kira cochrane after moving to the u.s. found herself grappling with the american approach to dating she wondered why it was acceptable to juggle 10 potential partners while weighing different attributes she found american-style dating to be exhausting and strange. she found dating in america to be organized in a fairly formal fashion with men approaching women and asking point blank for a date she found this to be awkward. she described the third date rule which was that women weren't supposed to have sex until the third date even if they desired it although men were supposed to try for sex she wrote dating rules almost always cast the man as aggressor and the woman as prey which frankly makes me feel nauseous. canadian writer danielle crittenden however chronicling female angst criticized a tendency not to take dating seriously and suggested that postponing marriage into one's thirties was problematic
by waiting and waiting and waiting to commit to someone our capacity for love shrinks and withers this doesn't mean that women or men should marry the first reasonable person to come along or someone with whom they are not in love but we should at a much earlier age than we do now take a serious attitude toward dating and begin preparing ourselves to settle down for it's in the act of taking up the roles we've been taught to avoid or postponewife husband mother fatherthat we build our identities expand our lives and achieve the fullness of character we desire
there is evidence that couples differ in the pace and timing with which they initiate sex in their relationships studies show that approximately 50% of premarital young adult couples become sexually involved within the first month of dating while 25% initiate sex one to three months after beginning to date and a small proportion of couples wait until marriage before initiating sexual relations

== impact of sexual orientation ==
a report in psychology today found that homosexual men were attracted to men in their late teens and early twenties and didn't care much about the status of a prospective partner rather physical attractiveness was the key gay men on average tend to have more sexual partners while lesbians tended to form steadier one-on-one relationships and tend to be less promiscuous than heterosexual women one gay man found dating online difficult and found that there is an element of deception on dating website profiles just like everywhere else
very attractive translates as big-headed  average build means a bit paunchy  5ft 10 is actually 5ft 7 and a half  the picture is always taken from the best most flattering angle  black and white photos mean i am pretentious or i've something to hide  anyone who writes in text speak or says i heart instead of i like should be avoided  ditto for people whose interests include feet
the deception got worse when he met his date who he had befriended online who he dubbed facebook guy for the first time he wrote

== matchmakers ==
people can meet other people on their own or the get-together can be arranged by someone else matchmaking is an art based entirely on hunches since it is impossible to predict with certainty whether two people will like each other or not all you should ever try and do is make two people be in the same room at the same time, advised matchmaker sarah beeny in 2009 and the only rule is to make sure the people involved want to be set up one matchmaker advised it was good to match brains as well as beauty and try to find people with similar religious and political viewpoints and thinks that like-minded people result in more matches although acknowledging that opposites sometimes attract it is easier to put several people together at the same time so there are other candidates possible if one doesn't work out and after introducing people don't meddle
=== friends as matchmakers ===
friends remain an extremely common way for people to meet however the internet promises to overtake friends in the future if present trends continue a friend can introduce two people who don't know each other and the friend may play matchmaker and send them on a blind date in the guardian british writer hannah pool was cynical about being set up on a blind date she was told basically he's you but in a male form by the mutual friend she googled her blind date's name along with the words wife and girlfriend and partner and boyfriend to see whether her prospective date was in any kind of relationship or gay he wasn't any of these things she met him for coffee in london and she now lives with him sharing a home and business when friends introduce two people who do not know each other it is often called a blind date
=== family as matchmakers ===

=== matchmaking systems and services ===
dating systems can be systematic and organized ways to improve matchmaking by using rules or technology the meeting can be in-person or live as well as separated by time or space such as by telephone or email or chat-based the purpose of the meeting is for the two persons to decide whether to go on a date in the future
speed dating consists of organized matchmaking events that have multiple single persons meet one-on-one in brief timed sessions so that singles can assess further whether to have subsequent dates an example is meeting perhaps twenty potential partners in a bar with brief interviews between each possible couple perhaps lasting three minutes in length and shuffling partners in shanghai one event featured eight-minute one-on-one meetings in which participants were pre-screened by age and education and career and which costs 50 yuan ($6 usd) per participant participants are asked not to reveal contact information during the brief meeting with the other person but rather place names in cards for organizers to arrange subsequent dates advantages of speed dating efficiency avoids an embarrassing disaster date cost-effective way to make friends disadvantages it can turn into a beauty contest with only a few good-looking participants getting most offers while less attractive peers received few or no offers critics suggest that the format prevents factors such as personality and intelligence from emerging particularly in large groups with extra-brief meeting times
(speed dating is) a fast and comfortable way to meet people it helps enlarge my social contacts i don't care if i can't find a girlfriend there i just want to try my luck and if she is there then that will be a big bonus
video dating systems of the 1980s and 1990s especially where customers gave a performance on (typically vhs) video which was viewable by other customers usually in private in the same facility some services would record and play back videos for men and women on alternate days to minimize the chance that customers would meet each other on the street
phone dating systems of about the same vintage where customers call a common voice mail or phone-chat server at a common local phone number and are connected with other (reputed) singles and typically charged by the minute as if it were a long-distance call (often a very expensive one) a key problem of such systems was that they were hard to differentiate from a phone porn service or phone sex where female operators are paid to arouse male customers and have no intention of ever dating them
=== computers as matchmakers ===
computer dating systems of the later 20th century especially popular in the 1960s and 1970s before the rise of sophisticated phone and computer systems gave customers forms that they filled out with important tolerances and preferences which were matched by computer to determine compatibility of the two customers the history of dating systems is closely tied to the history of technologies that support them although a statistics-based dating service that used data from forms filled out by customers opened in newark new jersey in 1941 the first large-scale computer dating system the scientific marriage foundation was established in 1957 by dr george w crane in this system forms that applicants filled out were processed by an ibm card sorting machine the earliest computerized dating service was operation match started by harvard university students in 1965 in the early 1980s in new york city software developer gary robinson developed a nowdefunct dating service called 212-romance which used computer algorithms to match singles romantically using a voicemail based interface backed by community-based automated recommendations enhanced by collaborative filtering technologies compatibility algorithms and matching software are becoming increasingly sophisticated
