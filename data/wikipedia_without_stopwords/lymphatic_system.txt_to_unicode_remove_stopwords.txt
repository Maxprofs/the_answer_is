lymphatic system part circulatory system vital part immune system comprising network lymphatic vessels carry clear fluid called lymph latin lympha meaning water directionally towards heart lymphatic system first described seventeenth century independently olaus rudbeck thomas bartholin unlike cardiovascular system lymphatic system closed system human circulatory system processes average litres blood per day capillary filtration removes plasma leaving blood cells roughly litres filtered plasma reabsorbed directly blood vessels remaining three litres remain interstitial fluid one main functions lymph system provide accessory return route blood surplus three litres
main function defense immune system lymph similar blood plasma contains lymphocytes white blood cells also contains waste products debris cells together bacteria protein associated organs composed lymphoid tissue sites lymphocyte production lymphocytes concentrated lymph nodes spleen thymus also lymphoid organs immune system tonsils lymphoid organs also associated digestive system lymphoid tissues contain lymphocytes also contain types cells support system also includes structures dedicated circulation production lymphocytes primary cellular component lymph also includes bone marrow lymphoid tissue associated digestive system
blood come direct contact parenchymal cells tissues body except case injury causing rupture one blood vessels constituents blood first exit microvascular exchange blood vessels become interstitial fluid comes contact parenchymal cells body lymph fluid formed interstitial fluid enters initial lymphatic vessels lymphatic system lymph moved along lymphatic vessel network either intrinsic contractions lymphatic passages extrinsic compression lymphatic vessels via external tissue forces eg contractions skeletal muscles lymph hearts animals organization lymph nodes drainage follows organization body external internal regions therefore lymphatic drainage head limbs body cavity walls follows external route lymphatic drainage thorax abdomen pelvic cavities follows internal route eventually lymph vessels empty lymphatic ducts drain one two subclavian veins near junction internal jugular veins
structureedit
lymphatic system consists lymphatic organs conducting network lymphatic vessels circulating lymph
thymus bone marrow constitute primary lymphoid organs involved production early clonal selection lymphocyte tissues bone marrow responsible creation cells production maturation b cells bone marrow b cells immediately join circulatory system travel secondary lymphoid organs search pathogens cells hand travel bone marrow thymus develop mature cells join b cells search pathogens cells begin process apoptosis programmed cell death
central primary lymphoid organs generate lymphocytes immature progenitor cells
secondary peripheral lymphoid organs include lymph nodes spleen maintain mature naive lymphocytes initiate adaptive immune response peripheral lymphoid organs sites lymphocyte activation antigens activation leads clonal expansion affinity maturation mature lymphocytes recirculate blood peripheral lymphoid organs encounter specific antigen
secondary lymphoid tissue provides environment foreign altered native molecules antigens interact lymphocytes exemplified lymph nodes lymphoid follicles tonsils peyers patches spleen adenoids skin etc associated mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue malt
gastrointestinal wall appendix mucosa resembling colon heavily infiltrated lymphocytes
tertiary lymphoid tissue typically contains far fewer lymphocytes assumes immune role challenged antigens result inflammation achieves importing lymphocytes blood lymph
thymusedit
thymus primary lymphoid organ site maturation cells lymphocytes adaptive immune system loss lack thymus results severe immunodeficiency subsequent high susceptibility infection
spleenedit
spleen synthesizes antibodies white pulp removes antibodycoated bacteria antibodycoated blood cells way blood lymph node circulation study published using mice found spleen contains reserve half bodys monocytes within red pulp monocytes upon moving injured tissue heart turn dendritic cells macrophages promoting tissue healing spleen center activity mononuclear phagocyte system considered analogous large lymph node absence causes predisposition certain infections
like thymus spleen efferent lymphatic vessels short gastric arteries splenic artery supply blood
germinal centers supplied arterioles called penicilliary radicles
fifth month prenatal development spleen creates red blood cells birth bone marrow solely responsible hematopoiesis major lymphoid organ central player reticuloendothelial system spleen retains ability produce lymphocytes spleen stores red blood cells lymphocytes store enough blood cells help emergency lymphocytes stored one time
lymph nodesedit
lymph node organized collection lymphoid tissue lymph passes way back blood lymph nodes located intervals along lymphatic system several afferent lymph vessels bring lymph percolates substance lymph node drained efferent lymph vessel five six hundred lymph nodes human body many grouped clusters different regions underarm abdominal areas lymph node clusters commonly found base limbs groin armpits neck lymph collected regions body likely sustain pathogen contamination injuries
substance lymph node consists lymphoid follicles outer portion called cortex inner portion node called medulla surrounded cortex sides except portion known hilum hilum presents depression surface lymph node causing otherwise spherical lymph node beanshaped ovoid efferent lymph vessel directly emerges lymph node hilum arteries veins supplying lymph node blood enter exit hilum
region lymph node called paracortex immediately surrounds medulla unlike cortex mostly immature cells thymocytes paracortex mixture immature mature cells lymphocytes enter lymph nodes specialised high endothelial venules found paracortex
lymph follicle dense collection lymphocytes number size configuration change accordance functional state lymph node example follicles expand significantly encountering foreign antigen selection b cells b lymphocytes occurs germinal center lymph nodes
lymph nodes particularly numerous mediastinum chest neck pelvis axilla inguinal region association blood vessels intestines
lymphoid tissueedit
lymphoid tissue associated lymphatic system concerned immune functions defending body infections spread tumors consists connective tissue formed reticular fibers various types leukocytes white blood cells mostly lymphocytes enmeshed lymph passes regions lymphoid tissue densely packed lymphocytes known lymphoid follicles lymphoid tissue either structurally well organized lymph nodes may consist loosely organized lymphoid follicles known mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue
lymphaticsedit
lymphatic vessels also called lymph vessels conduct lymph different parts body include tubular vessels lymph capillaries larger collecting vesselsthe right lymphatic duct thoracic duct left lymphatic duct lymph capillaries mainly responsible absorption interstitial fluid tissues lymph vessels propel absorbed fluid forward larger collecting ducts ultimately returns bloodstream via one subclavian veins vessels also called lymphatic channels simply lymphatics
lymphatics responsible maintaining balance body fluids network capillaries collecting lymphatic vessels work efficiently drain transport extravasated fluid along proteins antigens back circulatory system numerous intraluminal valves vessels ensure unidirectional flow lymph without reflux two valve systems used achieve one directional flowa primary secondary valve system capillaries blindended valves ends capillaries use specialised junctions together anchoring filaments allow unidirectional flow primary vessels collecting lymphatics however act propel lymph combined actions intraluminal valves lymphatic muscle cells
developmentedit
lymphatic tissues begin develop end fifth week embryonic development lymphatic vessels develop lymph sacs arise developing veins derived mesoderm
first lymph sacs appear paired jugular lymph sacs junction internal jugular subclavian veins jugular lymph sacs lymphatic capillary plexuses spread thorax upper limbs neck head plexuses enlarge form lymphatic vessels respective regions jugular lymph sac retains least one connection jugular vein left one developing superior portion thoracic duct
next lymph sac appear unpaired retroperitoneal lymph sac root mesentery intestine develops primitive vena cava mesonephric veins capillary plexuses lymphatic vessels spread retroperitoneal lymph sac abdominal viscera diaphragm sac establishes connections cisterna chyli loses connections neighboring veins
last lymph sacs paired posterior lymph sacs develop iliac veins posterior lymph sacs produce capillary plexuses lymphatic vessels abdominal wall pelvic region lower limbs posterior lymph sacs join cisterna chyli lose connections adjacent veins
exception anterior part sac cisterna chyli develops lymph sacs become invaded mesenchymal cells converted groups lymph nodes
spleen develops mesenchymal cells layers dorsal mesentery stomach thymus arises outgrowth third pharyngeal pouch
functionedit
lymphatic system multiple interrelated functions
