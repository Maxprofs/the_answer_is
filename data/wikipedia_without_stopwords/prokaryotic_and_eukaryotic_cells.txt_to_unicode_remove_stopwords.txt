hygromycin b antibiotic produced bacterium streptomyces hygroscopicus aminoglycoside kills bacteria fungi higher eukaryotic cells inhibiting protein synthesis
history
hygromycin b originally developed use animals still added swine chicken feed anthelmintic antiworming agent product name hygromix hygromycin b produced streptomyces hygroscopicus bacterium isolated soil sample resistance genes discovered early
mechanism action
hygromycin active prokaryotic eukaryotic cells acts inhibiting polypeptide synthesis stabilizes trnaribosomal acceptor site thereby inhibiting translocation
use research
laboratory used selection maintenance prokaryotic eukaryotic cells contain hygromycin resistance gene resistance gene kinase inactivates hygromycin b phosphorylation since discovery hygromycinresistance genes hygromycin b become standard selection antibiotic gene transfer experiments many prokaryotic eukaryotic cells based impurity monitor method four different kinds impurities discovered commercial hygromycin b different suppliers toxicities different impurities cell lines described following external links
use plant research
hygromycin resistance gene frequently used selectable marker research plants rice agrobacteriummediated transformation system hygromycin used mg l average mg l use hygromycin mg l demonstrated highly toxic nontransformed calli thus efficiently used select transformants
