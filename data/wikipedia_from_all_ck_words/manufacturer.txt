manufacturing is the production of merchandise for use or sale using labour and machines tools chemical and biological processing or formulation the term may refer to a range of human activity from handicraft to high tech but is most commonly applied to industrial production in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale such finished goods may be used for manufacturing other more complex products such as aircraft household appliances or automobiles or sold to wholesalers who in turn sell them to retailers who then sell them to end users and consumers
manufacturing takes turns under all types of economic systems in a free market economy manufacturing is usually directed toward the mass production of products for sale to consumers at a profit in a collectivist economy manufacturing is more frequently directed by the state to supply a centrally planned economy in mixed market economies manufacturing occurs under some degree of government regulation
modern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes required for the production and integration of a product's components some industries such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers use the term fabrication instead
the manufacturing sector is closely connected with engineering and industrial design examples of major manufacturers in north america include general motors corporation general electric procter & gamble general dynamics boeing pfizer and precision castparts examples in europe include volkswagen group siemens and michelin examples in asia include sony huawei lenovo toyota samsung and bridgestone
== history and developmentedit ==
in its earliest form manufacturing was usually carried out by a single skilled artisan with assistants training was by apprenticeship in much of the pre-industrial world the guild system protected the privileges and trade secrets of urban artisans
before the industrial revolution most manufacturing occurred in rural areas where household-based manufacturing served as a supplemental subsistence strategy to agriculture (and continues to do so in places) entrepreneurs organized a number of manufacturing households into a single enterprise through the putting-out system
toll manufacturing is an arrangement whereby a first firm with specialized equipment processes raw materials or semi-finished goods for a second firm

=== economics of manufacturingedit ===
according to some economists manufacturing is a wealth-producing sector of an economy whereas a service sector tends to be wealth-consuming emerging technologies have provided some new growth in advanced manufacturing employment opportunities in the manufacturing belt in the united states manufacturing provides important material support for national infrastructure and for national defense
on the other hand most manufacturing may involve significant social and environmental costs the clean-up costs of hazardous waste for example may outweigh the benefits of a product that creates it hazardous materials may expose workers to health risks these costs are now well known and there is effort to address them by improving efficiency reducing waste using industrial symbiosis and eliminating harmful chemicals the increased use of technologies such as 3d printing also offer the potential to reduce the environmental impact of producing finished goods through distributed manufacturing
the negative costs of manufacturing can also be addressed legally developed countries regulate manufacturing activity with labor laws and environmental laws across the globe manufacturers can be subject to regulations and pollution taxes to offset the environmental costs of manufacturing activities labor unions and craft guilds have played a historic role in the negotiation of worker rights and wages environment laws and labor protections that are available in developed nations may not be available in the third world tort law and product liability impose additional costs on manufacturing these are significant dynamics in the ongoing process occurring over the last few decades of manufacture-based industries relocating operations to developing-world economies where the costs of production are significantly lower than in developed-world economies
=== manufacturing and investmentedit ===
surveys and analyses of trends and issues in manufacturing and investment around the world focus on such things as
the nature and sources of the considerable variations that occur cross-nationally in levels of manufacturing and wider industrial-economic growth
competitiveness and
attractiveness to foreign direct
in addition to general overviews researchers have examined the features and factors affecting particular key aspects of manufacturing development they have compared production and investment in a range of western and non-western countries and presented case studies of growth and performance in important individual industries and market-economic sectors
on june 26 2009 jeff immelt the ceo of general electric called for the united states to increase its manufacturing base employment to 20% of the workforce commenting that the u.s has outsourced too much in some areas and can no longer rely on the financial sector and consumer spending to drive demand further while u.s manufacturing performs well compared to the rest of the u.s economy research shows that it performs poorly compared to manufacturing in other high-wage countries a total of 3.2 million one in six u.s manufacturing jobs have disappeared between 2000 and 2007 in the uk eef the manufacturers organisation has led calls for the uk economy to be rebalanced to rely less on financial services and has actively promoted the manufacturing agenda
