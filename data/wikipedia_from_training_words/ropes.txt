a rose (/roz/) is a woody perennial of the genus rosa within the family rosaceae there are over 100 species and thousands of cultivars they form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds most species are native to asia with smaller numbers native to europe north america and northwest africa species cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant rose plants range in size from compact miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height different species hybridize easily and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses
the name rose comes from french itself from latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from oscan from greek rhdon (aeolic wrdon) itself borrowed from old persian wrd- (wurdi) related to avestan vara sogdian ward parthian wr
== botany ==
the leaves are borne alternately on the stem in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3) 59 (13) leaflets and basal stipules the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from south east asia) are evergreen or nearly so
the flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of rosa sericea which usually has only four each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea four) these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes roses are insect-pollinated in nature
the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination the hips of most species are red but a few (e.g rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5160 seeds (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin c among the richest sources of any plant the hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds
while the sharp objects along a rose stem are commonly called thorns they are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) (true thorns as produced by e.g citrus or pyracantha are modified stems which always originate at a node and which have nodes and internodes along the length of the thorn itself.) rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points
=== species ===
the genus rosa is subdivided into four subgenera
hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae meaning with single leaves") containing one or two species from southwest asia r persica and rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules
hesperrhodos (from the greek for western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata from north america
platyrhodon (from the greek for flaky rose referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose)
rosa (the type subgenus incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections
banksianae white and yellow flowered roses from china
bracteatae three species two from china and one from india
caninae pink and white flowered species from asia europe and north africa
carolinae white pink and bright pink flowered species all from north america
chinensis white pink yellow red and mixed-color roses from china and burma
gallicanae pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe
gymnocarpae one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa) others in east asia
laevigatae a single white flowered species from china
pimpinellifoliae white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from asia and europe
rosa (syn sect cinnamomeae) white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa
synstylae white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas
== uses ==
roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors they have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization they also have minor medicinal uses
=== ornamental plants ===
the majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers a few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as rosa glauca and rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as rosa moyesii)
ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 bc in mediterranean countries persia and china many thousands of rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having mutated into additional petals
in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england
=== cut flowers ===
roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale
in temperate climates cut roses are often grown in glasshouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world
some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses
=== perfume ===
rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and in religious practices the production technique originated in persia then spread through arabia and india and more recently into eastern europe in bulgaria iran and germany damask roses (rosa damascena trigintipetala') are used in other parts of the world rosa centifolia is commonly used the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour rose absolute is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour the weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil
the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l-citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil -damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent
=== food and drink ===
rose hips are occasionally made into jam jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea primarily for their high vitamin c content they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products
rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used heavily in persian and middle eastern cuisineespecially in sweets such as nougat gumdrops raahat and baklava
rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas
in france there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals in the united states this french rose syrup is used to make rose scones and marshmallows in the indian subcontinent rooh afza a concentrated squash made with roses is popular as well as rose-flavored ice cream and kulfi
rose flowers are used as food also usually as flavouring or to add their scent to food other minor uses include candied rose petals
rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the uk
=== medicine ===
the rose hip usually from r canina is used as a minor source of vitamin c the fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine this and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth
=== culture ===
==== art ====
roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements the luxembourg born belgian artist and botanist pierre-joseph redout is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses
henri fantin-latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses the rose fantin-latour was named after the artist
other impressionists including claude monet paul czanne and pierre-auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works
==== symbolism ====
the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol
== pests and diseases ==
wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases many of these are also shared with other plants including especially other genera of the rosaceae
cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems
