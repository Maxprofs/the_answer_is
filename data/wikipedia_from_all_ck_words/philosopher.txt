a philosopher in a wide sense is someone who studies philosophy the word philosopher comes from the ancient greek (philosophos) which means lover of wisdom the introduction of the terms philosopher and philosophy has been ascribed to the greek thinker pythagoras
a philosopher in the more narrow and common usage is any intellectual who has made contributions in one or more current fields of philosophy such as aesthetics ethics epistemology logic metaphysics social theory and political philosophy a philosopher may also be one who worked in the humanities or other sciences which have since split from philosophy proper over the centuries such as the arts history economics sociology psychology linguistics anthropology theology and politics they may relate this knowledge to the discussion of philosophical problems
in the classical sense a philosopher is someone who lives according to a way of life whose focus is upon resolving existential questions about the human condition and not someone who discourses upon theories or comments upon authors typically these particular brands of philosophy are hellenistic ones and those who most arduously commit themselves to this lifestyle may be considered philosophers
in both definitions philosophers address these questions through critical systematic and reasoned approaches
== historyedit ==
=== ancient greece and romeedit ===
while pythagoras coined the word the first known elaboration on the topic was conducted by plato in his symposium he concludes that love is that which lacks the object it seeks therefore the philosopher is one who seeks wisdom if he attains wisdom he would be a sage therefore the philosopher in antiquity was one who lives in the constant pursuit of wisdom and living in accordance to that wisdom disagreements arose as to what living philosophically entailed these disagreements gave rise to different hellenistic schools of philosophy in consequence the ancient philosopher thought in a tradition as the ancient world became schism by philosophical debate the competition lay in living in manner that would transform his whole way of living in the world
among the last of these philosophers was marcus aurelius who is widely regarded as a philosopher in the modern sense but personally refuses to call himself by such a title since he had a duty to live as an emperor
==== transitionedit ====
according to the classicist pierre hadot the modern conception of a philosopher and philosophy developed predominately through three changes
the first is the natural inclination of the philosophical mind philosophy is a tempting discipline which can easily carry away the individual in analyzing the universe and abstract theory
the second is the historical change through the medieval era with the rise of christianity the philosophical way of life was adopted by its theology thus philosophy was divided between a way of life and the conceptual logical physical and metaphysical materials to justify that way of life philosophy was then the servant to theology
the third is the sociological need with the development of the university the modern university requires professionals to teach maintaining itself requires teaching future professionals to replace the current faculty therefore the discipline degrades into a technical language reserved for specialists completely eschewing its original conception as a way of life
=== medieval eraedit ===
in the fourth century the word philosopher began to designate a man or woman who led a monastic life gregory of nyssa for example describes how his sister macrina persuaded their mother to forsake the distractions of material life for a life of philosophy
later during the middle ages persons who engaged with alchemy was called a philosopher - thus the philosopher's stone
=== early modern eraedit ===
many philosophers still emerged from the classical tradition as saw their philosophy as a way of life among the most notable are ren descartes baruch spinoza nicolas malebranche and gottfried wilhelm leibniz with the rise of the university the modern conception of philosophy became more prominent many of the esteemed philosophers of the eighteenth century and onward have attended taught and developed their works in university early examples include immanuel kant johann gottlieb fichte friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling and georg wilhelm friedrich hegel
after these individuals the classical conception had all but died with the exceptions of arthur schopenhauer and friedrich nietzsche the last considerable figure in philosophy to not have followed a strict and orthodox academic regime was ludwig wittgenstein
=== modern academiaedit ===
in the modern era those attaining advanced degrees in philosophy often choose to stay in careers within the educational system according to a 1993 study by the national research council (as reported by the american philosophical association) 77.1% of the 7,900 holders of a ph.d in philosophy who responded were employed in educational institutions (academia) outside of academia philosophers may employ their writing and reasoning skills in other careers such as medicine bioethics business publishing free-lance writing media and law

women have engaged in philosophy throughout the field's history while there were women philosophers since ancient times and a relatively small number were accepted as philosophers during the ancient medieval and modern eras particularly during the 20th and 21st century almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical western canon
in ancient philosophy in the west while academic philosophy was typically the domain of male philosophers such as plato and aristotle female philosophers such as hipparchia of maroneia (active ca 325 bc) arete of cyrene (active 5th4th century bc) and aspasia of miletus (470400 bc) were active during this period a notable medieval philosopher was hypatia (5th century) notable modern philosophers included anne conway (1631-1679) mary wollstonecraft (1759-1797) and sarah margaret fuller (1810-1850) influential contemporary philosophers include susanne langer (18951985) hannah arendt (19061975) simone de beauvoir (19081986) mary midgley (born 1919) mary warnock (born 1924) julia kristeva (born 1941) patricia churchland (born 1943) and susan haack (born 1945)
in the early 1800s some colleges and universities in the uk and us began admitting women giving rise to new generations of female academics nevertheless u.s department of education reports from the 1990s indicate that philosophy is one of the least proportionate fields in the humanities with respect to gender women make up as little as 17% of philosophy faculty in some studies
in the early 1990s the canadian philosophical association claimed that there is gender imbalance and gender bias in the academic field of philosophy.in june 2013 a us sociology professor stated that out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total. the editors of the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers and they require editors and contributors to ensure they represent the contributions of women philosophers according to eugene sun park [p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male this homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline.
