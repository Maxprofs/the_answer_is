types roundingedit
typical rounding problems
approximating irrational number fraction eg
approximating fraction periodic decimal expansion finite decimal fraction eg
replacing rational number fraction smaller numerator denominator eg
replacing fractional decimal number one fewer digits eg dollars dollars
replacing decimal integer integer trailing zeros eg people people general
replacing value multiple specified amount eg seconds seconds multiple
rounding specified incrementedit
common type rounding round integer generally integer multiple increment rounding whole tenths seconds hundredths dollar whole multiples inch whole dozens thousands etc
general rounding number x multiple specified increment m entails following steps
divide x m let result y
round y integer value call q
multiply q m obtain rounded value z
example rounding x dollars whole cents ie multiple entails computing y xm rounding y integer q finally computing z qm
rounding predetermined number significant digits increment m depends magnitude number rounded rounded result
increment m normally finite fraction whatever number system used represent numbers display humans usually means decimal number system m integer times power like intermediate values stored digital computers often means binary number system m integer times power
