earth science geoscience allencompassing term refers fields science dealing planet earth considered branch planetary science much older history reductionist holistic approaches earth sciences formal discipline earth sciences may include study atmosphere hydrosphere lithosphere biosphere typically earth scientists use tools physics chemistry biology chronology mathematics build quantitative understanding earth system works evolved current state
fields studyedit
following fields science generally categorized within earth sciences
geography specifically physical geography covers aspects geomorphology soil study hydrology meteorology climatology biogeography
geology describes rocky parts earths crust lithosphere historic development major subdisciplines mineralogy petrology geochemistry geomorphology paleontology stratigraphy structural geology engineering geology sedimentology
geophysics geodesy investigate shape earth reaction forces magnetic gravity fields geophysicists explore earths core mantle well tectonic seismic activity lithosphere geophysics commonly used supplement work geologists developing comprehensive understanding crustal geology particularly mineral petroleum exploration see geophysical survey
soil science covers outermost layer earths crust subject soil formation processes pedosphere major subdisciplines include edaphology pedology
ecology covers interactions biota natural environment field study differentiates study earth study planets solar system earth planet teeming life
hydrology includes oceanography limnology describe marine freshwater domains watery parts earth hydrosphere major subdisciplines include hydrogeology physical chemical biological oceanography
glaciology covers icy parts earth cryosphere
atmospheric sciences cover gaseous parts earth atmosphere surface exosphere km major subdisciplines include meteorology climatology atmospheric chemistry atmospheric physics
earths interioredit
plate tectonics mountain ranges volcanoes earthquakes geological phenomena explained terms energy transformations earths crust
beneath earths crust lies mantle heated radioactive decay heavy elements mantle quite solid consists magma state semiperpetual convection convection process causes lithospheric plates move albeit slowly resulting process known plate tectonics
plate tectonics might thought process earth resurfaced process called seafloor spreading new crust created flow magma underneath lithosphere surface fissures cools solidifies process called subduction oceanic crust pushed underground beneath rest lithospherewhere comes contact magma meltsrejoining mantle originally came
areas crust new crust created called divergent boundaries brought back earth convergent boundaries plates slide past new lithospheric material created destroyed referred transform conservative boundaries earthquakes result movement lithospheric plates often occur near convergent boundaries parts crust forced earth part subduction
volcanoes result primarily melting subducted crust material crust material forced asthenosphere melts portion melted material becomes light enough rise surfacegiving birth volcanoes
earths electromagnetic fieldedit
electromagnet magnet created current flows around soft iron core earth solid iron inner core surrounded semiliquid materials outer core move continuous currents around inner core therefore earth electromagnet referred dynamo theory earths magnetism
earths atmosphereedit
troposphere stratosphere mesosphere thermosphere exosphere five layers make earths atmosphere atmosphere made nitrogen oxygen argon gases atmosphere located within troposphere bottommost layer remaining one percent atmosphere nitrogen oxygen argon contains small amounts gases including co water vapors water vapors co allow earths atmosphere catch hold suns energy phenomenon called greenhouse effect allows earths surface warm enough liquid water support life
magnetic field created internal motions core produces magnetosphere protects earths atmosphere solar wind earth billion years old would lost atmosphere protective magnetosphere
addition storing heat atmosphere also protects living organisms shielding earths surface cosmic rays note level protection high enough prevent cosmic rays destroying life earth yet low enough aid mutations important role pushing forward diversity biosphere
methodologyedit
methodologies vary depending nature subjects studied studies typically fall one three categories observational experimental theoretical earth scientists often conduct sophisticated computer analysis go many worlds exotic locations study earth phenomena eg antarctica hot spot island chains
foundational idea within study earth science notion uniformitarianism uniformitarianism dictates ancient geologic features interpreted understanding active processes readily observed words geologic processes work present operated ways throughout geologic time enables study earths history apply knowledge earth processes operate present gain insight planet evolved changed throughout deep history
earths spheresedit
earth science generally recognizes four spheres lithosphere hydrosphere atmosphere biosphere correspond rocks water air life also included cryosphere corresponding ice distinct portion hydrosphere pedosphere corresponding soil active intermixed sphere
