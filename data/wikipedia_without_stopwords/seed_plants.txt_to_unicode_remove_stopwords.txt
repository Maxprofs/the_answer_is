spermatophytes greek word also known phanerogams phenogamae comprise plants produce seeds hence alternative name seed plants subset embryophytes land plants term phanerogams phanerogamae derived greek phaneros visible contrast cryptogamae greek kryptos hidden together suffix gameein marry terms distinguished plants hidden sexual organs cryptogamae visible sexual organs phanerogamae
description
living spermatophytes form five groups
cycads subtropical tropical group plants large crown compound leaves stout trunk
ginkgo single living species tree
conifers conebearing trees shrubs
gnetophytes woody plants genera ephedra gnetum welwitschia
angiosperms magnoliophyta flowering plants large group including many familiar plants wide variety habitats
addition taxa listed fossil record contains evidence many extinct taxa seed plants socalled seed ferns pteridospermae one earliest successful groups land plants forests dominated seed ferns prevalent late paleozoic glossopteris prominent tree genus ancient southern supercontinent gondwana permian period triassic period seed ferns declined ecological importance representatives modern gymnosperm groups abundant dominant end cretaceous angiosperms radiated another late paleozoic group probable spermatophytes gigantopterids
evolution

relationships nomenclature
seedbearing plants traditionally divided angiosperms flowering plants gymnosperms includes gnetophytes cycads ginkgo conifers older morphological studies believed close relationship gnetophytes angiosperms particular based vessel elements however molecular studies recent morphological fossil papers generally shown clade gymnosperms gnetophytes near conifers example one common proposed set relationships known gnepine hypothesis looks like
however relationships groups considered settled
classifications group seed plants single division classes five groups
