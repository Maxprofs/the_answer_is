active laser medium also called gain medium lasing medium source optical gain within laser gain results stimulated emission electronic molecular transitions lower energy state higher energy state previously populated pump source
examples active laser media include
certain crystals typically doped rareearth ions eg neodymium ytterbium erbium transition metal ions titanium chromium often yttrium aluminium garnet yalo yttrium orthovanadate yvo sapphire alo
glasses eg silicate phosphate glasses doped laseractive ions
gases eg mixtures helium neon hene nitrogen argon carbon monoxide carbon dioxide metal vapors
semiconductors eg gallium arsenide gaas indium gallium arsenide ingaas gallium nitride gan
liquids form dye solutions used dye lasers
order lase active gain medium must nonthermal energy distribution known population inversion preparation state requires external energy source known laser pumping pumping may achieved electrical currents eg semiconductors gases via highvoltage discharges light generated discharge lamps lasers semiconductor lasers exotic gain media pumped chemical reactions nuclear fission highenergy electron beams
