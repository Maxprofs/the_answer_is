=== north america ===
==== canada ====
education in canada is within the constitutional jurisdiction of the provinces and the overall curriculum is overseen by the provincial governments as there is no overall national coordinating authority the way the educational stages are grouped and named differs from region to region education is generally divided into primary education followed by secondary education and post-secondary education primary and secondary education are generally divided into numbered grades from 1 to 12 although the first grade may be preceded by kindergarten (optional in many provinces) ontario and quebec offer a pre-kindergarten called a junior kindergarten in ontario and a garderie in quebec
education in ontario once involved an ontario academic credit (oac) as university preparation but that was phased out in 2007 and now all provinces except quebec have 12 grades the oac was informally known as grade 13 and the name was also used to refer to the students who took it
education in quebec differs from the other provinces in that it has an cole primaire (literally primary school") consisting of grades 1-6 and an cole secondaire (literally secondary school") consisting of secondaries i-v secondaries i-v are equivalent to grades 7-11 a student graduating from high school (grade 11) can then either complete a three-year college program or attend a two-year pre-university program required before attending university in some english high schools as well as in most french schools high school students will refer to secondary 1-5 as year one through five so if someone in secondary three is asked what grade/year are you in? they will reply three or sec 3 it is presumed that the person asking the question knows that they are not referring to grade 3 but rather secondary 3 this can be confusing for those outside of quebec
in some provinces grades 1 through 6 are called elementary school grades 6 through 8 are called middle school or junior high school and grades 9 through 12 are considered high school other provinces such as british columbia mainly divide schooling into elementary school (kindergarten to grade 7) and secondary school (grades 8 through 12) in alberta and nova scotia elementary consists of kindergarten through grade 6 junior high consists of grades 7-9 high school consists of grades 10-12 in english provinces the high school (known as academy or secondary school) years can be referred to simply as first second third and fourth year some areas call it by grade such as grade 10 grade 11 and grade 12
the difference between college and university is significantly different from in the united states or even the united kingdom a canadian college is more similar to an american community college but also the british french and other european and british commonwealth such as australian and new zealand etc. on the other hand in contrast a canadian university is also quite comparable to an american university as well as many other universities among the anglosphere and francosphere  in canada colleges are generally geared for individuals seeking applied careers while universities are geared for individuals seeking more academic careers
university students are generally classified as first second third or fourth-year students and the american system of classifying them as freshmen sophomores juniors and seniors is seldom used or even understood in canada in some occasions they can be called senior ones twos threes and fours
==== united states ====
in the united states the first official year of schooling is called kindergarten which is why the students are called kindergarteners kindergarten is optional in most states but few students skip this level pre-kindergarten also known as preschool (and sometimes shortened to pre-k") is becoming a standard of education as academic expectations for the youngest students continue to rise many public schools offer pre-kindergarten programs
in the united states there are 12 years of mandatory schooling the first eight are solely referred to by numbers (e.g 1st grade 5th grade) so students may be referred to as 1st graders 5th graders etc upon entering high school grades 9 through 12 (high school) also have alternate names for students namely freshman sophomore junior and senior the actual divisions of which grade levels belong to which division (whether elementary middle junior high or high school) is a matter decided by state or local jurisdictions
accordingly college students are often called freshmen sophomores juniors and seniors (respectively) unless their undergraduate program calls for more than the traditional 4 years
===== first year =====

===== second year =====
in the u.s. a sophomore also called a soph, is a second-year student outside the united states the term sophomore is rarely used with second-year students simply called second years folk etymology indicates that the word means wise fool consequently sophomoric means pretentious bombastic inflated in style or manner immature crude superficial (according to the oxford english dictionary) it is widely assumed to be formed from greek sophos meaning wise and moros meaning foolish although the etymology suggests an origin from the now-defunct sophumer an obsolete variant of sophism
===== post-second year =====
in the u.s. a junior is a student in the penultimate (usually third) year and a senior is a student in the last (usually fourth) year of college university or high school a student who takes more than the normal number of years to graduate is sometimes referred to as a super senior this term is often used in college but can be used in high school as well the term underclassman is used to refer collectively to freshmen and sophomores and upperclassman to refer collectively to juniors and seniors sometimes even sophomores the term middler is used to describe a third-year student of a school (generally college) that offers five years of study in this situation the fourth and fifth years would be referred to as junior and senior years respectively and the first two years would be the freshman and sophomore years
===== graduate students =====
a graduate student is a student who continues his/her education after graduation some examples of graduate programs are law school medical school veterinary school degrees earned in graduate programs include the masters degree a research doctoral degree or a first professional degree
===== vocational school =====
students attending vocational school focus on their jobs and learning how to work in specific fields of work a vocational program typically takes much less time to complete than a four-year degree program lasting 1224 months liberal arts that are required in four-year universities are less important to these students because the skills necessary for their careers take precedence in order for a timely completion of the program

the united states military academies officially use only numerical terms but there are colloquial expressions used in everyday speech in order from first year to fourth year students are referred to as fourth-class third-class second-class and first-class cadets or midshipmen unofficially other terms are used for example at the united states military academy freshmen are called plebes sophomores are called yearlings or yuks juniors are called cows and seniors are called firsties some universities also use numerical terms to identify classes students enter as first-years and graduate as fourth-years (or in some cases fifth-years sixth-years etc.)
== idiomatic use ==
freshman and sophomore are sometimes used figuratively almost exclusively in the united states to refer to a first or second effort ("the singer's sophomore album") or to a politician's first or second term in office ("freshman senator") or an athlete's first or second year on a professional sports team junior and senior are not used in this figurative way to refer to third and fourth years or efforts because of those words broader meanings of younger and older. a junior senator is therefore not one who is in a third term of office but merely one who has not been in the senate as long as the other senator from their state confusingly this means that it is possible to be both a freshman senator and a senior senator simultaneously for example if a senator wins election in 2008 and then the other senator from the same state steps down and a new senator elected in 2010 the former senator is both senior senator (as in the senate for two years more) and a freshman senator (since still in the first term)
