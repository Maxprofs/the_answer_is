biography
raney born carrollton kentucky william wallace katherine raney without attended high school obtained bachelors degree mechanical engineering university kentucky following graduation became teacher eastern kentucky state normal college also charge heating lighting facilities
worked beater room fort orange paper company castletononhudson new york moved springfield illinois work production steam engines l ide engine company stayed year moved final residence chattanooga tennessee work chattanooga railway light power co power salesman
raney joined lookout oil refining company assigned work assistant manager production hydrogen used hydrogenation vegetable oils time started work preparation later became known raney catalysts left lookout oil take sales manager position gilman paint varnish co eventually becoming president company left gilman paint founded raney catalyst company started dedicate fulltime production catalysts company bought wr grace company still produces raney nickel day
raney twice married first june katherine elizabeth macrae d june one daughter second marriage laura ogden mcclellan d april march awarded honorary doctor science degree member american chemical society american oil chemists society granted total six american five european patents development catalysts metallurgical processes needed preparation
development raney nickel
time lookout oil refining raney responsible production hydrogen used hydrogenation vegetable oils time industry used nickel catalyst prepared nickelii oxide believing better catalysts could produced around started perform independent research matter still working lookout oil produced nickelsilicon alloy treated sodium hydroxide found five times active best catalyst used hydrogenation cottonseed oil granted us patent discovery
raney produced nickelaluminium alloy also ratio following procedure similar one used nickelsilicon catalyst found resulting catalyst even active previous one catalyst commonly known raney nickel subject patent obtained
may interest note raneys choice nickelaluminium ratio fortuitous without real scientific basis however preferred alloy composition production raney nickel catalysts currently use raney said interview lucky idea catalyst worked first time
