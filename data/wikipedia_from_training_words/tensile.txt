a textile or cloth is a flexible woven material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibres (yarn or thread) yarn is produced by spinning raw fibres of wool flax cotton or other material to produce long strands textiles are formed by weaving knitting crocheting knotting or felting
the words fabric and cloth are used in textile assembly trades (such as tailoring and dressmaking) as synonyms for textile however there are subtle differences in these terms in specialized usage textile refers to any material made of interlacing fibres fabric refers to any material made through weaving knitting spreading crocheting or bonding that may be used in production of further goods (garments etc.) cloth may be used synonymously with fabric but often refers to a finished piece of fabric used for a specific purpose (e.g. table cloth)
== etymologyedit ==
the word textile is from latin from the adjective textilis meaning woven from textus the past participle of the verb texere to weave
the word fabric also derives from latin most recently from the middle french fabrique or building thing made and earlier as the latin fabrica workshop an art trade a skillful production structure fabric which is from the latin faber or artisan who works in hard materials from pie dhabh- meaning to fit together
the word cloth derives from the old english cla meaning a cloth woven or felted material to wrap around one from proto-germanic kalithaz (compare o.frisian klath middle dutch cleet dutch kleed middle high german kleit and german kleid all meaning garment") there are several different types of fabric from two main sources manmade and natural inside natural there are two others plant and animal some examples of animal textiles are silk and wool an example of a plant textile is cotton
== historyedit ==
the discovery of dyed flax fibres in a cave in the republic of georgia dated to 34,000 bce suggests textile-like materials were made even in prehistoric times
the production of textiles is a craft whose speed and scale of production has been altered almost beyond recognition by industrialization and the introduction of modern manufacturing techniques however for the main types of textiles plain weave twill or satin weave there is little difference between the ancient and modern methods
incas have been crafting quipus (or khipus) made of fibres either from a protein such as spun and plied thread like wool or hair from camelids such as alpacas llamas and camels or from a cellulose like cotton for thousands of years khipus are a series of knots along pieces of string until recently they were thought to have been only a method of accounting but new evidence discovered by harvard professor gary urton indicates there may be more to the khipu than just numbers preservation of khipus found in museum and archive collections follow general textile preservation principles and practice
during the 15th century textiles were the largest single industry before the 15th century textiles were produced only in a few towns but during they shifted into districts like east anglia and the cotswolds
== usesedit ==
textiles have an assortment of uses the most common of which are for clothing and for containers such as bags and baskets in the household they are used in carpeting upholstered furnishings window shades towels coverings for tables beds and other flat surfaces and in art in the workplace they are used in industrial and scientific processes such as filtering miscellaneous uses include flags backpacks tents nets handkerchiefs cleaning rags transportation devices such as balloons kites sails and parachutes textiles are also used to provide strengthening in composite materials such as fibreglass and industrial geotextiles textiles are used in many traditional crafts such as sewing quilting and embroidery
textiles for industrial purposes and chosen for characteristics other than their appearance are commonly referred to as technical textiles technical textiles include textile structures for automotive applications medical textiles (e.g implants) geotextiles (reinforcement of embankments) agrotextiles (textiles for crop protection) protective clothing (e.g against heat and radiation for fire fighter clothing against molten metals for welders stab protection and bullet proof vests) in all these applications stringent performance requirements must be met woven of threads coated with zinc oxide nanowires laboratory fabric has been shown capable of self-powering nanosystems using vibrations created by everyday actions like wind or body movements
== fashion and textile designersedit ==
fashion designers commonly rely on textile designs to set their fashion collections apart from others armani the late gianni versace and emilio pucci can be easily recognized by their signature print driven designs
== sources and typesedit ==
textiles can be made from many materials these materials come from four main sources animal (wool silk) plant (cotton flax jute) mineral (asbestos glass fibre) and synthetic (nylon polyester acrylic) in the past all textiles were made from natural fibres including plant animal and mineral sources in the 20th century these were supplemented by artificial fibres made from petroleum
textiles are made in various strengths and degrees of durability from the finest gossamer to the sturdiest canvas microfibre refers to fibres made of strands thinner than one denier
=== animal textilesedit ===
animal textiles are commonly made from hair fur skin or silk (in the silkworms case)
wool refers to the hair of the domestic goat or sheep which is distinguished from other types of animal hair in that the individual strands are coated with scales and tightly crimped and the wool as a whole is coated with a wax mixture known as lanolin (sometimes called wool grease) which is waterproof and dirtproof woollen refers to a bulkier yarn produced from carded non-parallel fibre while worsted refers to a finer yarn spun from longer fibres which have been combed to be parallel wool is commonly used for warm clothing cashmere the hair of the indian cashmere goat and mohair the hair of the north african angora goat are types of wool known for their softness
other animal textiles which are made from hair or fur are alpaca wool vicua wool llama wool and camel hair generally used in the production of coats jackets ponchos blankets and other warm coverings angora refers to the long thick soft hair of the angora rabbit qiviut is the fine inner wool of the muskox
wadmal is a coarse cloth made of wool produced in scandinavia mostly 1000~1500 ce
silk is an animal textile made from the fibres of the cocoon of the chinese silkworm which is spun into a smooth fabric prized for its softness there are two main types of the silk mulberry silk produced by the bombyx mori and wild silk such as tussah silk silkworm larvae produce the first type if cultivated in habitats with fresh mulberry leaves for consumption while tussah silk is produced by silkworms feeding purely on oak leaves around four-fifths of the world's silk production consists of cultivated silk
=== plant textilesedit ===
grass rush hemp and sisal are all used in making rope in the first two the entire plant is used for this purpose while in the last two only fibres from the plant are utilized coir (coconut fibre) is used in making twine and also in floormats doormats brushes mattresses floor tiles and sacking
straw and bamboo are both used to make hats straw a dried form of grass is also used for stuffing as is kapok
fibres from pulpwood trees cotton rice hemp and nettle are used in making paper
cotton flax jute hemp modal and even bamboo fibre are all used in clothing pia (pineapple fibre) and ramie are also fibres used in clothing generally with a blend of other fibres such as cotton nettles have also been used to make a fibre and fabric very similar to hemp or flax the use of milkweed stalk fibre has also been reported but it tends to be somewhat weaker than other fibres like hemp or flax
the inner bark of the lacebark tree is a fine netting that has been used to make clothing and accessories as well as utilitarian articles such as rope
acetate is used to increase the shininess of certain fabrics such as silks velvets and taffetas
seaweed is used in the production of textiles a water-soluble fibre known as alginate is produced and is used as a holding fibre when the cloth is finished the alginate is dissolved leaving an open area
lyocell is a man-made fabric derived from wood pulp it is often described as a man-made silk equivalent it is a tough fabric that is often blended with other fabrics cotton for example
fibres from the stalks of plants such as hemp flax and nettles are also known as bast fibres
=== mineral textilesedit ===
asbestos and basalt fibre are used for vinyl tiles sheeting and adhesives transite panels and siding acoustical ceilings stage curtains and fire blankets
glass fibre is used in the production of ironing board and mattress covers ropes and cables reinforcement fibre for composite materials insect netting flame-retardant and protective fabric soundproof fireproof and insulating fibres glass fibres are woven and coated with teflon to produce beta cloth a virtually fireproof fabric which replaced nylon in the outer layer of united states space suits since 1968
metal fibre metal foil and metal wire have a variety of uses including the production of cloth-of-gold and jewellery hardware cloth (us term only) is a coarse woven mesh of steel wire used in construction it is much like standard window screening but heavier and with a more open weave it is sometimes used together with screening on the lower part of screen doors to resist scratching by dogs it serves similar purposes as chicken wire such as fences for poultry and traps for animal control
=== synthetic textilesedit ===
all synthetic textiles are used primarily in the production of clothing
polyester fibre is used in all types of clothing either alone or blended with fibres such as cotton
aramid fibre (e.g twaron) is used for flame-retardant clothing cut-protection and armor
acrylic is a fibre used to imitate wools including cashmere and is often used in replacement of them
nylon is a fibre used to imitate silk it is used in the production of pantyhose thicker nylon fibres are used in rope and outdoor clothing
spandex (trade name lycra) is a polyurethane product that can be made tight-fitting without impeding movement it is used to make activewear bras and swimsuits
olefin fibre is a fibre used in activewear linings and warm clothing olefins are hydrophobic allowing them to dry quickly a sintered felt of olefin fibres is sold under the trade name tyvek
ingeo is a polylactide fibre blended with other fibres such as cotton and used in clothing it is more hydrophilic than most other synthetics allowing it to wick away perspiration
lurex is a metallic fibre used in clothing embellishment
milk proteins have also been used to create synthetic fabric milk or casein fibre cloth was developed during world war i in germany and further developed in italy and america during the 1930s milk fibre fabric is not very durable and wrinkles easily but has a ph similar to human skin and possesses anti-bacterial properties it is marketed as a biodegradable renewable synthetic fibre
carbon fibre is mostly used in composite materials together with resin such as carbon fibre reinforced plastic the fibres are made from polymer fibres through carbonization
== production methodsedit ==
weaving is a textile production method which involves interlacing a set of longer threads (called the warp) with a set of crossing threads (called the weft) this is done on a frame or machine known as a loom of which there are a number of types some weaving is still done by hand but the vast majority is mechanised
knitting and crocheting involve interlacing loops of yarn which are formed either on a knitting needle or on a crochet hook together in a line the two processes are different in that knitting has several active loops at one time on the knitting needle waiting to interlock with another loop while crocheting never has more than one active loop on the needle knitting can be performed by machine but crochet can only be performed by hand
spread tow is a production method where the yarn are spread into thin tapes and then the tapes are woven as warp and weft this method is mostly used for composite materials spread tow fabrics can be made in carbon aramide etc
braiding or plaiting involves twisting threads together into cloth knotting involves tying threads together and is used in making macrame
lace is made by interlocking threads together independently using a backing and any of the methods described above to create a fine fabric with open holes in the work lace can be made by either hand or machine
carpets rugs velvet velour and velveteen are made by interlacing a secondary yarn through woven cloth creating a tufted layer known as a nap or pile
felting involves pressing a mat of fibres together and working them together until they become tangled a liquid such as soapy water is usually added to lubricate the fibres and to open up the microscopic scales on strands of wool
nonwoven textiles are manufactured by the bonding of fibres to make fabric bonding may be thermal or mechanical or adhesives can be used
bark cloth is made by pounding bark until it is soft and flat
== treatmentsedit ==
textiles are often dyed with fabrics available in almost every colour the dying process often requires several dozen gallons of water for each pound of clothing coloured designs in textiles can be created by weaving together fibres of different colours (tartan or uzbek ikat) adding coloured stitches to finished fabric (embroidery) creating patterns by resist dyeing methods tying off areas of cloth and dyeing the rest (tie-dyeing) or drawing wax designs on cloth and dyeing in between them (batik) or using various printing processes on finished fabric woodblock printing still used in india and elsewhere today is the oldest of these dating back to at least 220 ce in china textiles are also sometimes bleached making the textile pale or white
textiles are sometimes finished by chemical processes to change their characteristics in the 19th century and early 20th century starching was commonly used to make clothing more resistant to stains and wrinkles since the 1990s with advances in technologies such as permanent press process finishing agents have been used to strengthen fabrics and make them wrinkle free more recently nanomaterials research has led to additional advancements with companies such as nano-tex and nanohorizons developing permanent treatments based on metallic nanoparticles for making textiles more resistant to things such as water stains wrinkles and pathogens such as bacteria and fungi
more so today than ever before textiles receive a range of treatments before they reach the end-user from formaldehyde finishes (to improve crease-resistance) to biocidic finishes and from flame retardants to dyeing of many types of fabric the possibilities are almost endless however many of these finishes may also have detrimental effects on the end user a number of disperse acid and reactive dyes (for example) have been shown to be allergenic to sensitive individuals further to this specific dyes within this group have also been shown to induce purpuric contact dermatitis
although formaldehyde levels in clothing are unlikely to be at levels high enough to cause an allergic reaction due to the presence of such a chemical quality control and testing are of utmost importance flame retardants (mainly in the brominated form) are also of concern where the environment and their potential toxicity are concerned testing for these additives is possible at a number of commercial laboratories it is also possible to have textiles tested for according to the oeko-tex certification standard which contains limits levels for the use of certain chemicals in textiles products
