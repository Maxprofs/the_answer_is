transportationedit
transportation large contributor greenhouse gas emissions said onethird gasses produced due transportation western countries making transportation sustainable longterm shortterm implementations example modifications available transportation freiburg germany city implemented extensive methods public transportation cycling walking along large areas cars allowed
since many western countries highly automobileorientated areas main transit people use personal vehicles travel involves cars therefore california deep automobileoriented west one highest greenhouse gases emitters country federal government come plans reduce total number vehicle trips order lower greenhouse gases emission
improve public transit provision larger coverage area order provide mobility accessibility new technology provide reliable responsive public transportation network
encourage walking biking provision wider pedestrian pathway bike share station commercial downtown locate parking lot far shopping center limit street parking slower traffic lane downtown area
increase cost car ownership gas taxes increased parking fees tolls encouraging people drive fuel efficient vehicles produce social equity problem since lower people usually drive older vehicles lower fuel efficiency government use extra revenue collected taxes tolls improve public transportation benefit poor community

argued since concept sustainable development slided conservation management economic development whereby original meaning concept stretched somewhat
international community realised many african countries needed national plans safeguard wildlife habitats rural areas confront limits imposed soil climate water availability strategy conservation management however focus shifted broader issues provisioning basic human needs community participation well appropriate technology use throughout developing countries africa strategy economic development strategy carried even brundtland report issues went regional international scope application effect conservationists crowded superseded developers
shifting focus sustainable development conservation development imperceptible effect stretching original forest management term sustainable yield use renewable resources like forestry also accounting use nonrenewable resources like minerals stretching term questioned thus environmental economist kerry turner argued literally thing overall sustainable development industrialised world economy remains heavily dependent extraction earths finite stock exhaustible mineral resources
