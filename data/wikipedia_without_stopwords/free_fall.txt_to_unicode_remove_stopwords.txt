newtonian physics free fall motion body gravity force acting upon context general relativity gravitation reduced spacetime curvature body free fall force acting moves along geodesic present article concerns free fall newtonian domain
object technical sense free fall may necessarily falling usual sense term object moving upwards would normally considered falling subject force gravity said free fall moon thus free fall
uniform gravitational field absence forces gravitation acts part body equally weightlessness condition also occurs gravitational field zero far away gravitating body body free fall experiences g
term free fall often used loosely strict sense defined thus falling atmosphere without deployed parachute lifting device also often referred free fall aerodynamic drag forces situations prevent producing full weightlessness thus skydivers free fall reaching terminal velocity produces sensation bodys weight supported cushion air
historyedit
western world prior sixteenth century generally assumed speed falling body would proportional weightthat kg object expected fall ten times faster otherwise identical kg object medium ancient greek philosopher aristotle bc discussed falling objects perhaps first book mechanics
italian scientist galileo galilei subjected aristotelian theories experimentation careful observation combined results experiments mathematical analysis unprecedented way
tale may apocryphal galileo assistant likely dropped two objects unequal mass leaning tower pisa given speed fall would occur doubtful galileo could extracted much information experiment observations falling bodies really bodies rolling ramps slowed things enough point able measure time intervals water clocks pulse stopwatches yet invented repeated full hundred times achieved accuracy deviation two observations never exceeded onetenth pulse beat
examplesedit
examples objects free fall include
spacecraft space propulsion eg continuous orbit suborbital trajectory ballistics going minutes
object dropped top drop tube
object thrown upward person jumping ground low speed ie long air resistance negligible comparison weight
technically object free fall even moving upwards instantaneously rest top motion gravity influence acting acceleration always downward magnitude bodies commonly denoted
since objects fall rate absence forces objects people experience weightlessness situations
examples objects free fall
flying aircraft also additional force lift
standing ground gravitational force counteracted normal force ground
descending earth using parachute balances force gravity aerodynamic drag force parachutes additional lift force
example falling skydiver yet deployed parachute considered free fall physics perspective since experiences drag force equals weight achieved terminal velocity see however term free fall skydiving commonly used describe case everyday speech skydiving community clear though whether recent sport wingsuit flying fits definition free fall skydiving
