lactase is an enzyme produced by many organisms it is located in the brush border of the small intestine of humans and other mammals lactase is essential to the complete digestion of whole milk it breaks down lactose a sugar which gives milk its sweetness lacking lactase a person consuming dairy products may experience the symptoms of lactose intolerance lactase can be purchased as a food supplement and is added to milk to produce lactose-free milk products
lactase (also known as lactase-phlorizin hydrolase or lph) a part of the -galactosidase family of enzymes is a glycoside hydrolase involved in the hydrolysis of the disaccharide lactose into constituent galactose and glucose monomers lactase is present predominantly along the brush border membrane of the differentiated enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine in humans lactase is encoded by the lct gene
== mechanism ==
the optimum temperature for human lactase is about 37c for its activity and has an optimum ph of 6
in metabolism the -glycosidic bond in d-lactose is hydrolyzed to form d-galactose and d-glucose which can be absorbed through the intestinal walls and into the bloodstream the overall reaction that lactase catalyzes is c12h22o11 + h2o c6h12o6 + c6h12o6 + heat
the catalytic mechanism of d-lactose hydrolysis retains the substrate anomeric configuration in the products while the details of the mechanism are uncertain the stereochemical retention is achieved through a double displacement reaction studies of e coli lactase have proposed that hydrolysis is initiated when a glutamate nucleophile on the enzyme attacks from the axial side of the galactosyl carbon in the -glycosidic bond the removal of the d-glucose leaving group may be facilitated by mg-dependent acid catalysis the enzyme is liberated from the -galactosyl moiety upon equatorial nucleophilic attack by water which produces d-galactose
substrate modification studies have demonstrated that the 3-oh and 2-oh moieties on the galactopyranose ring are essential for enzymatic recognition and hydrolysis the 3-hydroxy group is involved in initial binding to the substrate while the 2- group is not necessary for recognition but needed in subsequent steps this is demonstrated by the fact that a 2-deoxy analog is an effective competitive inhibitor (ki = 10mm) elimination of specific hydroxyl groups on the glucopyranose moiety does not completely eliminate catalysis
lactase also catalyzes the conversion of phlorizin to phloretin and glucose
== structure and biosynthesis ==
preprolactase the primary translation product has a single polypeptide primary structure consisting of 1927 amino acids it can be divided into five domains (i) a 19-amino-acid cleaved signal sequence (ii) a large prosequence domain that is not present in mature lactase (iii) the mature lactase segment (iv) a membrane-spanning hydrophobic anchor and (v) a short hydrophilic carboxyl terminus the signal sequence is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum and the resulting 215-kda pro-lph is sent to the golgi apparatus where it is heavily glycosylated and proteolytically processed to its mature form the prodomain has been shown to act as an intramolecular chaperone in the er preventing trypsin cleavage and allowing lph to adopt the necessary 3-d structure to be transported to the golgi apparatus
mature human lactase consists of a single 160-kda polypeptide chain that localizes to the brush border membrane of intestinal epithelial cells it is oriented with the n-terminus outside the cell and the c-terminus in the cytosol lph contains two catalytic glutamic acid sites in the human enzyme the lactase activity has been connected to glu-1749 while glu-1273 is the site of phlorizin hydrolase function
== genetic expression and regulation ==
lactase is encoded by a single genetic locus on chromosome 2 it is expressed exclusively by mammalian small intestine enterocytes and in very low levels in the colon during fetal development humans are born with high levels of lactase expression in most of the worlds population lactase transcription is down-regulated after weaning resulting in diminished lactase expression in the small intestine which causes the common symptoms of adult-type hypolactasia or lactose intolerance
some population segments exhibit lactase persistence resulting from a mutation that is postulated to have occurred 5,000-10,000 years ago coinciding with the rise of cattle domestication this mutation has allowed almost half of the worlds population to metabolize lactose without symptoms studies have linked the occurrence of lactase persistence to two different single-nucleotide polymorphisms about 14 and 22 kilobases upstream of the 5-end of the lph gene both mutations ct at position -13910 and g a at position -22018 have been independently linked to lactase persistence
the lactase promoter is 150 base pairs long and is located just upstream of the site of transcription initiation the sequence is highly conserved in mammals suggesting that critical cis-transcriptional regulators are located nearby cdx-2 hnf-1 and gata have been identified as transcription factors studies of hypolactasia onset have demonstrated that despite polymorphisms little difference exists in lactase expression in infants showing that the mutations become increasingly relevant during development developmentally regulated dna-binding proteins may down-regulate transcription or destabilize mrna transcripts causing decreased lph expression after weaning
== industrial use ==
lactase produced commercially can be extracted both from yeasts such as kluyveromyces fragilis and kluyveromyces lactis and from fungi such as aspergillus niger and aspergillus oryzae its primary commercial use in supplements such as lacteeze and lactaid is to break down lactose in milk to make it suitable for people with lactose intolerance however the u.s food and drug administration has not formally evaluated the effectiveness of these products
lactase is also used to screen for blue white colonies in the multiple cloning sites of various plasmid vectors in escherichia coli or other bacteria
