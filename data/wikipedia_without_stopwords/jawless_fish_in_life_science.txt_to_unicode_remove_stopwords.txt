term fish defined negatively excludes tetrapods ie amphibians reptiles birds mammals descend within ancestry paraphyletic considered proper grouping systematic biology traditional term pisces also ichthyes considered typological phylogenetic classification
earliest organisms classified fish softbodied chordates first appeared cambrian period although lacked true spine possessed notochords allowed agile invertebrate counterparts fish would continue evolve paleozoic era diversifying wide variety forms many fish paleozoic developed external armor protected predators first fish jaws appeared silurian period many sharks became formidable marine predators rather prey arthropods
evolution
fish represent monophyletic group therefore evolution fish studied single event
early fish fossil record represented group small jawless armored fish known ostracoderms jawless fish lineages mostly extinct extant clade lampreys may approximate ancient prejawed fish first jaws found placodermi fossils diversity jawed vertebrates may indicate evolutionary advantage jawed mouth unclear advantage hinged jaw greater biting force improved respiration combination factors
fish may evolved creature similar corallike sea squirt whose larvae resemble primitive fish important ways first ancestors fish may kept larval form adulthood sea squirts today although perhaps reverse case

anatomy
respiration
gills
fish exchange gases using gills either side pharynx gills consist threadlike structures called filaments filament contains capillary network provides large surface area exchanging oxygen carbon dioxide fish exchange gases pulling oxygenrich water mouths pumping gills fish capillary blood flows opposite direction water causing countercurrent exchange gills push oxygenpoor water openings sides pharynx fish like sharks lampreys possess multiple gill openings however bony fish single gill opening side opening hidden beneath protective bony cover called operculum
juvenile bichirs external gills primitive feature share larval amphibians
air breathing
fish multiple groups live water extended periods amphibious fish mudskipper live move land several days live stagnant otherwise oxygen depleted water many fish breathe air via variety mechanisms skin anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly buccal cavity electric eel may breathe air catfish families loricariidae callichthyidae scoloplacidae absorb air digestive tracts lungfish exception australian lungfish bichirs paired lungs similar tetrapods must surface gulp fresh air mouth pass spent air gills gar bowfin vascularized swim bladder functions way loaches trahiras many catfish breathe passing air gut mudskippers breathe absorbing oxygen across skin similar frogs number fish evolved socalled accessory breathing organs extract oxygen air labyrinth fish gouramis bettas labyrinth organ gills performs function fish structures resembling labyrinth organs form function notably snakeheads pikeheads clariidae catfish family
breathing air primarily use fish inhabit shallow seasonally variable waters waters oxygen concentration may seasonally decline fish dependent solely dissolved oxygen perch cichlids quickly suffocate airbreathers survive much longer cases water little wet mud extreme airbreathing fish able survive damp burrows weeks without water entering state aestivation summertime hibernation water returns
air breathing fish divided obligate air breathers facultative air breathers obligate air breathers african lungfish must breathe air periodically suffocate facultative air breathers catfish hypostomus plecostomus breathe air need otherwise rely gills oxygen air breathing fish facultative air breathers avoid energetic cost rising surface fitness cost exposure surface predators
circulation
fish closedloop circulatory system heart pumps blood single loop throughout body fish heart consists four parts including two chambers entrance exit first part sinus venosus thinwalled sac collects blood fishs veins allowing flow second part atrium large muscular chamber atrium serves oneway antechamber sends blood third part ventricle ventricle another thickwalled muscular chamber pumps blood first fourth part bulbus arteriosus large tube heart bulbus arteriosus connects aorta blood flows gills oxygenation
digestion
jaws allow fish eat wide variety food including plants organisms fish ingest food mouth break esophagus stomach food digested many fish processed fingershaped pouches called pyloric caeca secrete digestive enzymes absorb nutrients organs liver pancreas add enzymes various chemicals food moves digestive tract intestine completes process digestion nutrient absorption
excretion
many aquatic animals fish release nitrogenous wastes ammonia wastes diffuse gills blood wastes filtered kidneys
saltwater fish tend lose water osmosis kidneys return water body reverse happens freshwater fish tend gain water osmotically kidneys produce dilute urine excretion fish specially adapted kidneys vary function allowing move freshwater saltwater
scales
scales fish originate mesoderm skin may similar structure teeth
sensory nervous system
central nervous system
fish typically quite small brains relative body size compared vertebrates typically onefifteenth brain mass similarly sized bird mammal however fish relatively large brains notably mormyrids sharks brains massive relative body weight birds marsupials
fish brains divided several regions front olfactory lobes pair structures receive process signals nostrils via two olfactory nerves olfactory lobes large fish hunt primarily smell hagfish sharks catfish behind olfactory lobes twolobed telencephalon structural equivalent cerebrum higher vertebrates fish telencephalon concerned mostly olfaction together structures form forebrain
connecting forebrain midbrain diencephalon diagram structure optic lobes consequently visible diencephalon performs functions associated hormones homeostasis pineal body lies diencephalon structure detects light maintains circadian rhythms controls color changes
midbrain mesencephalon contains two optic lobes large species hunt sight rainbow trout cichlids
hindbrain metencephalon particularly involved swimming balance cerebellum singlelobed structure typically biggest part brain hagfish lampreys relatively small cerebellae mormyrid cerebellum massive apparently involved electrical sense
brain stem myelencephalon brains posterior well controlling muscles body organs bony fish least brain stem governs respiration osmoregulation
sense organs
fish possess highly developed sense organs nearly daylight fish color vision least good humans see vision fishes many fish also chemoreceptors responsible extraordinary senses taste smell although ears many fish may hear well fish sensitive receptors form lateral line system detects gentle currents vibrations senses motion nearby fish prey fish catfish sharks organs detect weak electric currents order millivolt fish like south american electric fishes gymnotiformes produce weak electric currents use navigation social communication
fish orient using landmarks may use mental maps based multiple landmarks symbols fish behavior mazes reveals possess spatial memory visual discrimination
vision
vision important sensory system species fish fish eyes similar terrestrial vertebrates like birds mammals spherical lens retinas generally rod cells cone cells scotopic photopic vision species colour vision fish see ultraviolet see polarized light amongst jawless fish lamprey welldeveloped eyes hagfish primitive eyespots fish vision shows adaptation visual environment example deep sea fishes eyes suited dark environment
hearing
hearing important sensory system species fish fish sense sound using lateral lines ears
capacity pain
experiments done william tavolga provide evidence fish pain fear responses instance tavolgas experiments toadfish grunted electrically shocked time came grunt mere sight electrode
scottish scientists university edinburgh roslin institute concluded rainbow trout exhibit behaviors often associated pain animals bee venom acetic acid injected lips resulted fish rocking bodies rubbing lips along sides floors tanks researchers concluded attempts relieve pain similar mammals would neurons fired pattern resembling human neuronal patterns
professor james d rose university wyoming claimed study flawed since provide proof fish possess conscious awareness particularly kind awareness meaningfully like rose argues since fish brains different human brains fish probably conscious manner humans reactions similar human reactions pain instead causes rose published study year earlier arguing fish cannot feel pain brains lack neocortex however animal behaviorist temple grandin argues fish could still consciousness without neocortex different species use different brain structures systems handle functions
animal welfare advocates raise concerns possible suffering fish caused angling countries germany banned specific types fishing british rspca formally prosecutes individuals cruel fish
muscular system
fish move alternately contracting paired sets muscles either side backbone contractions form sshaped curves move body curve reaches back fin backward force applied water conjunction fins moves fish forward fishs fins function like airplanes flaps fins also increase tails surface area increasing speed streamlined body fish decreases amount friction water since body tissue denser water fish must compensate difference sink many bony fish internal organ called swim bladder adjusts buoyancy manipulation gases
homeothermy
although fish exclusively ectothermic exceptions
certain species fish maintain elevated body temperatures endothermic teleosts bony fish suborder scombroidei include billfishes tunas one species primitive mackerel gasterochisma melampus sharks family lamnidae shortfin mako long fin mako white porbeagle salmon shark endothermic evidence suggests trait exists family alopiidae thresher sharks degree endothermy varies billfish warm eyes brain bluefin tuna porbeagle sharks maintain body temperatures elevated excess c ambient water temperatures see also gigantothermy endothermy though metabolically costly thought provide advantages increased muscle strength higher rates central nervous system processing higher rates digestion
reproductive system
fish reproductive organs include testes ovaries species gonads paired organs similar size partially totally fused may also range secondary organs increase reproductive fitness
terms spermatogonia distribution structure teleosts testes two types common spermatogonia occur along seminiferous tubules atherinomorph fish confined distal portion structures fish present cystic semicystic spermatogenesis relation release phase germ cells cysts seminiferous tubules lumen
fish ovaries may three types gymnovarian secondary gymnovarian cystovarian first type oocytes released directly coelomic cavity enter ostium oviduct eliminated secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova coelom go directly oviduct third type oocytes conveyed exterior oviduct gymnovaries primitive condition found lungfish sturgeon bowfin cystovaries characterize teleosts ovary lumen continuity oviduct secondary gymnovaries found salmonids teleosts
oogonia development teleosts fish varies according group determination oogenesis dynamics allows understanding maturation fertilization processes changes nucleus ooplasm surrounding layers characterize oocyte maturation process
postovulatory follicles structures formed oocyte release endocrine function present wide irregular lumen rapidly reabsorbed process involving apoptosis follicular cells degenerative process called follicular atresia reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes spawned process also occur less frequently oocytes development stages
fish like california sheephead hermaphrodites testes ovaries either different phases life cycle hamlets simultaneously
known fish oviparous eggs develop outside mothers body examples oviparous fish include salmon goldfish cichlids tuna eels majority species fertilisation takes place outside mothers body male female fish shedding gametes surrounding water however oviparous fish practice internal fertilization male using sort intromittent organ deliver sperm genital opening female notably oviparous sharks horn shark oviparous rays skates cases male equipped pair modified pelvic fins known claspers
marine fish produce high numbers eggs often released open water column eggs average diameter millimetre
newly hatched young oviparous fish called larvae usually poorly formed carry large yolk sac nourishment different appearance juvenile adult specimens larval period oviparous fish relatively short usually several weeks larvae rapidly grow change appearance structure process termed metamorphosis become juveniles transition larvae must switch yolk sac feeding zooplankton prey process depends typically inadequate zooplankton density starving many larvae
ovoviviparous fish eggs develop inside mothers body internal fertilization receive little nourishment directly mother depending instead yolk embryo develops egg familiar examples ovoviviparous fish include guppies angel sharks coelacanths
species fish viviparous species mother retains eggs nourishes embryos typically viviparous fish structure analogous placenta seen mammals connecting mothers blood supply embryo examples viviparous fish include surfperches splitfins lemon shark viviparous fish exhibit oophagy developing embryos eat eggs produced mother observed primarily among sharks shortfin mako porbeagle known bony fish well halfbeak nomorhamphus ebrardtii intrauterine cannibalism even unusual mode vivipary largest embryos eat weaker smaller siblings behavior also commonly found among sharks grey nurse shark also reported nomorhamphus ebrardtii
aquarists commonly refer ovoviviparous viviparous fish livebearers
diseases
like animals fish suffer diseases parasites prevent disease variety defenses nonspecific defenses include skin scales well mucus layer secreted epidermis traps inhibits growth microorganisms pathogens breach defenses fish develop inflammatory response increases blood flow infected region delivers white blood cells attempt destroy pathogens specific defenses respond particular pathogens recognised fishs body ie immune response recent years vaccines become widely used aquaculture also ornamental fish example furunculosis vaccines farmed salmon koi herpes virus koi
species use cleaner fish remove external parasites best known bluestreak cleaner wrasses genus labroides found coral reefs indian pacific oceans small fish maintain socalled cleaning stations fish congregate perform specific movements attract attention cleaners cleaning behaviors observed number fish groups including interesting case two cichlids genus etroplus maculatus cleaner much larger etroplus suratensis
immune system
immune organs vary type fish jawless fish lampreys hagfish true lymphoid organs absent fish rely regions lymphoid tissue within organs produce immune cells example erythrocytes macrophages plasma cells produced anterior kidney pronephros areas gut granulocytes mature resemble primitive bone marrow hagfish cartilaginous fish sharks rays advanced immune system three specialized organs unique chondrichthyes epigonal organs lymphoid tissue similar mammalian bone surround gonads leydigs organ within walls esophagus spiral valve intestine organs house typical immune cells granulocytes lymphocytes plasma cells also possess identifiable thymus welldeveloped spleen important immune organ various lymphocytes plasma cells macrophages develop stored chondrostean fish sturgeons paddlefish bichirs possess major site production granulocytes within mass associated meninges membranes surrounding central nervous system heart frequently covered tissue contains lymphocytes reticular cells small number macrophages chondrostean kidney important hemopoietic organ erythrocytes granulocytes lymphocytes macrophages develop
like chondrostean fish major immune tissues bony fish teleostei include kidney especially anterior kidney houses many different immune cells addition teleost fish possess thymus spleen scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues eg skin gills gut gonads much like mammalian immune system teleost erythrocytes neutrophils granulocytes believed reside spleen whereas lymphocytes major cell type found thymus lymphatic system similar mammals described one species teleost fish zebrafish although confirmed yet system presumably naive unstimulated cells accumulate waiting encounter antigen
b lymphocytes bearing immunoglobulins cell receptors respectively found jawed fishes indeed adaptive immune system whole evolved ancestor jawed vertebrate
