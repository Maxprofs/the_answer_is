background
quantum gravity strings
one deepest problems modern physics problem quantum gravity current understanding gravity based albert einsteins general theory relativity formulated within framework classical physics however nongravitational forces described within framework quantum mechanics radically different formalism describing physical phenomena based probability quantum theory gravity needed order reconcile general relativity principles quantum mechanics difficulties arise one attempts apply usual prescriptions quantum theory force gravity
string theory theoretical framework attempts reconcile gravity quantum mechanics string theory pointlike particles particle physics replaced onedimensional objects called strings string theory describes strings propagate space interact given version string theory one kind string may look like small loop segment ordinary string vibrate different ways distance scales larger string scale string look like ordinary particle mass charge properties determined vibrational state string way different elementary particles may viewed vibrating strings one vibrational states string gives rise graviton quantum mechanical particle carries gravitational force
several versions string theory type type iia type iib two flavors heterotic string theory ee different theories allow different types strings particles arise low energies exhibit different symmetries example type theory includes open strings segments endpoints closed strings form closed loops types iia iib include closed strings five string theories arises special limiting case mtheory theory like string theory predecessors example quantum theory gravity describes force like familiar gravitational force subject rules quantum mechanics
number dimensions
everyday life three familiar dimensions space height width depth einsteins general theory relativity treats time dimension par three spatial dimensions general relativity space time modeled separate entities instead unified fourdimensional spacetime framework phenomenon gravity viewed consequence geometry spacetime
spite fact universe well described fourdimensional spacetime several reasons physicists consider theories dimensions cases modeling spacetime different number dimensions theory becomes mathematically tractable one perform calculations gain general insights easily also situations theories two three spacetime dimensions useful describing phenomena condensed matter physics finally exist scenarios could actually four dimensions spacetime nonetheless managed escape detection
one notable feature string theory mtheory theories require extra dimensions spacetime mathematical consistency string theory spacetime tendimensional mtheory elevendimensional order describe real physical phenomena using theories one must therefore imagine scenarios extra dimensions would observed experiments
compactification one way modifying number dimensions physical theory compactification extra dimensions assumed close form circles limit curled dimensions become small one obtains theory spacetime effectively lower number dimensions standard analogy consider multidimensional object garden hose hose viewed sufficient distance appears one dimension length however one approaches hose one discovers contains second dimension circumference thus ant crawling surface hose would move two dimensions
dualities
theories arise different limits mtheory turn related highly nontrivial ways one relationships exist different physical theories called sduality relationship says collection strongly interacting particles one theory cases viewed collection weakly interacting particles completely different theory roughly speaking collection particles said strongly interacting combine decay often weakly interacting infrequently type string theory turns equivalent sduality heterotic string theory similarly type iib string theory related nontrivial way sduality
another relationship different string theories tduality one considers strings propagating around circular extra dimension tduality states string propagating around circle radius r equivalent string propagating around circle radius r sense observable quantities one description identified quantities dual description example string momentum propagates around circle also wind around circle one times number times string winds around circle called winding number string momentum p winding number n one description momentum n winding number p dual description example type iia string theory equivalent type iib string theory via tduality two versions heterotic string theory also related tduality
general term duality refers situation two seemingly different physical systems turn equivalent nontrivial way two theories related duality means one theory transformed way ends looking like theory two theories said dual one another transformation put differently two theories mathematically different descriptions phenomena
supersymmetry
another important theoretical idea plays role mtheory supersymmetry mathematical relation exists certain physical theories class particles called bosons class particles called fermions roughly speaking fermions constituents matter bosons mediate interactions particles theories supersymmetry boson counterpart fermion vice versa supersymmetry imposed local symmetry one automatically obtains quantum mechanical theory includes gravity theory called supergravity theory
theory strings incorporates idea supersymmetry called superstring theory several different versions superstring theory subsumed within mtheory framework low energies superstring theories approximated supergravity ten spacetime dimensions similarly mtheory approximated low energies supergravity eleven dimensions
branes
string theory related theories supergravity theories brane physical object generalizes notion point particle higher dimensions example point particle viewed brane dimension zero string viewed brane dimension one also possible consider higherdimensional branes dimension p called pbranes branes dynamical objects propagate spacetime according rules quantum mechanics mass attributes charge pbrane sweeps pdimensional volume spacetime called worldvolume physicists often study fields analogous electromagnetic field live worldvolume brane word brane comes word membrane refers twodimensional brane
string theory fundamental objects give rise elementary particles onedimensional strings although physical phenomena described mtheory still poorly understood physicists know theory describes two fivedimensional branes much current research mtheory attempts better understand properties branes
