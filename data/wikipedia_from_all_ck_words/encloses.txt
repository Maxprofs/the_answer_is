an inaccessible district as used here is a portion of a state not completely separated from the main part by alien territory but that can only be reached easily by passing through alien territory
== origin and usage ==
the word enclave is french and first appeared in the mid-15th century as a derivative of the verb enclaver (1283) from the colloquial latin inclavare (to close with a key) originally it was a term of property law that denoted the situation of a land or parcel of land surrounded by land owned by a different owner and that could not be reached for its exploitation in a practical and sufficient manner without crossing the surrounding land in law this created a servitude of passage for the benefit of the owner of the surrounded land
later the term enclave began to be used also to refer to parcels of countries counties fiefs communes towns parishes etc that were surrounded by alien territory this french word eventually entered the english and other languages to denote the same concept although local terms have continued to be used in india the word pocket is often used as a synonym for enclave (such as the pockets of puducherry district") in british administrative history subnational enclaves were usually called detachments or detached parts and national enclaves as detached districts or detached dominions in english ecclesiastic history subnational enclaves were known as peculiars (see also royal peculiar)
the word exclave modeled on enclave is a logical extension of the concept of enclave
== characteristics ==
enclaves exist for a variety of historical political and geographical reasons for example in the feudal system in europe the ownership of feudal domains was often transferred or partitioned either through purchase and sale or through inheritance and often such domains were or came to be surrounded by other domains in particular this state of affairs persisted into the 19th century in the holy roman empire and these domains (principalities etc.) exhibited many of the characteristics of sovereign states
residing in an enclave within another country has often involved difficulties in such areas as passage rights importing goods currency provision of utilities and health services and host nation cooperation thus over time enclaves have tended to be eliminated for example two-thirds of the then-existing national-level enclaves were extinguished on august 1 2015 when the governments of india and bangladesh implemented a land boundary agreement that exchanged 162 first-order enclaves (111 indian and 51 bangladeshi) this exchange thus effectively de-enclaved another two dozen second-order enclaves and one third-order enclave eliminating 197 of the indo-bangladesh enclaves in all the residents in these enclaves had complained of being effectively stateless only bangladesh's dahagramangarpota enclave remained

=== national railway passing through another state's territory ===
changes in borders can make a railway that was previously located solely within a country traverse the new borders since diverting a railway is expensive this arrangement may last a long time this may mean that doors on passenger trains are locked and guarded to prevent illicit entry and exit while the train is temporarily in another country borders can also be in the wrong place forcing railways into difficult terrain
examples include
