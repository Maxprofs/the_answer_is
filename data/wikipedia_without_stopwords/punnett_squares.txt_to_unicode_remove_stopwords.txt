punnett square diagram used predict outcome particular cross breeding experiment named reginald c punnett devised approach diagram used biologists determine probability offspring particular genotype punnett square tabular summary possible combinations maternal alleles paternal alleles tables used examine genotypic outcome probabilities offspring single trait allele crossing multiple traits parents punnett square visual representation mendelian inheritance important understand terms heterozygous homozygous double heterozygote homozygote dominant allele recessive allele using punnet square method multiple traits using forkedline method typically much easier punnett square phenotypes may assessed using punnet square phenotype may appear given genotype influenced many factors
monohybrid cross
mono means one cross indicates examining single trait crossed could mean example looking eye color genetic locus always represented two letters case eye color say b brown eyes b green eyes example parents genotype bb example eye color stated would mean brown eyes produce gametes contain either b b allele conventional genetics use capital letters indicate dominant alleles lowercase letters indicate recessive alleles probability individual offsprings genotype bb bb bb ratio phenotypes typical monohybrid cross assessing phenotype offspring exhibit brown eyes one offspring exhibit green eyes b bb
m maternal p paternal
way b b alleles interact affect appearance offspring depends gene products proteins interact see mendelian inheritance things like lethal effects epistasis one allele masks another regardless dominant recessive status
dihybrid cross
complicated crosses made looking two genes punnett square works however genes independent means particular allele gene alter probability possessing allele gene b equivalent stating genes linked two genes tend sort together meiosis
following example illustrates dihybrid cross two doubleheterozygote pea plants r represents dominant allele shape round r represents recessive allele wrinkled represents dominant allele color yellow represents recessive allele green plant genotype rraa since alleles shape color genes independent produce four types gametes possible combinations ra ra ra ra
since dominant traits mask recessive traits assuming epistasis nine combinations phenotype round yellow three round green three wrinkled yellow one wrinkled green ratio expected outcome crossing two doubleheterozygous parents unlinked genes ratio indicates something else occurred lethal alleles epistasis linked genesetc
forkedline method
forkedline method also known tree method branching system also solve dihybrid multihybrid crosses problem converted series monohybrid crosses results combined tree however tree produces result punnett square less time clarity example assesses another doubleheterozygote cross using rryy x rryy stated phenotypic ratio expected crossing unlinked genes two doubleheterozygotes genotypic ratio obtained diagram diagram branches analyzing phenotypic ratio
