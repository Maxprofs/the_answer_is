the yard (abbreviation yd) is an english unit of length in both the british imperial and us customary systems of measurement that comprises 3 feet or 36 inches it is by international agreement in 1959 standardized as exactly 0.9144 meters a metal yardstick originally formed the physical standard from which all other units of length were officially derived in both english systems
in the 19th and 20th centuries increasingly powerful microscopes and scientific measurement detected variation in these prototype yards which became significant as technology improved in 1959 the united states united kingdom australia new zealand and south africa agreed to adopt the canadian compromise value of 0.9144 meters per yard
the term yard is also sometimes used for translating related lengths in other systems
== name ==
the name derives from the old english gerd gyrd &c. which was used for branches staves and measuring rods it is first attested in the late-7th century laws of ine of wessex where the yard of land mentioned is the yardland an old english unit of tax assessment equal to 14 hide around the same time the lindisfarne gospel's account of the messengers from john the baptist in the book of matthew used it for a branch swayed by the wind in addition to the yardland old and middle english both used their forms of yard to denote the surveying lengths of 15 or 16 12 ft used in computing acres a distance now usually known as the rod
a unit of three english feet is attested in a statute of c.1300 (see below) but there it is called an ell (latin ulna lit arm") a separate and usually longer unit of around 45 inches the use of the word yard (middle english erd or erde) to describe this length is first attested in langland's poem on piers plowman the usage seems to derive from the prototype standard rods held by the king and his magistrates (see below)
the word yard is a homonym of yard in the sense of an enclosed area of land this second meaning of yard has an etymology related to the verb to gird and is probably not related
== history ==
=== origin ===
the origin of the measure is uncertain both the romans and the welsh used multiples of a shorter foot but 2 12 roman feet was a step (gradus) and 3 welsh feet was a pace (cam) the proto-germanic cubit or arm's-length has been reconstructed as *alin which developed into the old english ln middle english elne and modern ell of 1 yd this has led some to derive the yard of three english feet from pacing others from the ell or cubit others from henry i's arm standard (see below) based on the etymology of the other yard others suggest it originally derived from the girth of a person's waist while others believe it originated as a cubic measure
the earliest record of a prototype measure is the statute ii edgar cap 8 (ad 959 x 963) which survives in several variant manuscripts in it edgar the peaceful directed the witenagemot at andover that the measure held at winchester should be observed throughout his realm (some manuscripts read at london and at winchester".) the statutes of william i similarly refer to and uphold the standard measures of his predecessors without naming them
william of malmesbury's deeds of the kings of england records that during the reign of henry i the measure of his arm was applied to correct the false ell of the traders and enjoined on all throughout england. the folktale that the length was bounded by the king's nose was added some centuries later watson dismisses william's account as childish but william was among the most conscientious and trustworthy medieval historians the french king's foot was supposed to have derived from charlemagne and the english kings subsequently repeatedly intervened to impose shorter units with the aim of increasing tax revenue
the earliest surviving definition of this form of the ell appears in the act on the composition of yards and perches one of the statutes of uncertain date tentatively dated to the reign of edward i or ii c.1300 its wording varies in surviving accounts one reads
it is ordained that 3 grains of barley dry and round do make an inch 12 inches make 1 foot 3 feet make 1 yard 5 yards and a half make a perch and 40 perches in length and 4 in breadth make an acre
the liber horn states
and be it remembered that the iron yard of our lord the king containeth 3 feet and no more and a foot ought to contain 12 inches by the right measure of this yard measured to wit the 36th part of this yard rightly measured maketh 1 inch neither more nor less and 5 yards and a half make a perch that is 16 feet and a half measured by the aforesaid yard of our lord the king
in some early books this act was appended to another statute of uncertain date titled the statute for the measuring of land the act was not repealed until the weights and measures act of 1824
=== yard and inch ===
in a law of 1439 (18 henry vi cap 16.) the sale of cloth by the yard and handful was abolished and the yard and inch instituted
there shall be but one measure of cloth through the realm by the yard and the inch and not by the yard and handful according to the london measure
according to connor cloth merchants had previously sold cloth by the yard and handful to evade high taxes on cloth (the extra handful being essentially a black-market transaction) enforcement efforts resulted in cloth merchants switching over to the yard and inch at which point the government gave up and made the yard and inch official in 1552 the yard and inch for cloth measurement was again sanctioned in law (5 & 6 edward vi cap 6 an act for the true making of woolen cloth.)
xiv and that all and every broad cloth and clothes called taunton clothes bridgwaters and other clothes which shall be made after the said feast in taunton bridgwater or in other places of like sort shall contain at the water in length betwixt twelve and thirteen yards yard and inch of the rule and in breadth seven quarters of a yard (2) and every narrow cloth made after the said feast in the said towns or elsewhere of like sorts shall contain in the water in length betwixt three and twenty and five and twenty yards yard and inch as is aforesaid and in breadth one yard of like measure (3) and every such cloth both broad and narrow being well scowred thicked milled and fully dried shall weigh xxxiv li the piece at the least.
xv and that all clothes named check-kersie and straits which shall be made after the said feast shall contain being wet between seventeen and eighteen yards with the inches as is aforesaid and in breadth one yard at the least at the water and being well scowred thicked milled and fully dried shall weigh xxiv li the piece at the least.
and once in legislation of 1557-8 (4 & 5 philip and mary cap 5 an act touching the making of woolen clothes par ix.)
ix item that every ordinary kersie mentioned in the said act shall contain in length in the water betwixt xvi and xvii yards yard and inch and being well scoured thicked milled dressed and fully dried shall weigh nineteen pounds the piece at the least:...
as recently as 1593 we find the same principle mentioned once again (35 elizabeth cap 10 an act for the reformation of sundry abuses in clothes called devonshire kerjies or dozens according to a proclamation of the thirty-fourth year of the reign of our sovereign lady the queen that now is par iii.)
(2) and each and every of the same devonshire kersies or dozens so being raw and as it cometh forth off the weaver's loom (without racking stretching straining or other device to encrease the length thereof) shall contain in length between fifteen and sixteen yards by the measure of yard and inch by the rule,...
=== physical standards ===
one of the oldest yard-rods in existence is the clothyard of the worshipful company of merchant taylors it consists of a hexagonal iron rod 58 inch in diameter and 1100 inch short of a yard encased within a silver rod bearing the hallmark 1445 in the early 15th century the merchant taylors company was authorized to make search at the opening of the annual st bartholemew's day cloth fair in the mid-18th century graham compared the standard yard of the royal society to other existing standards these were a long-disused standard made in 1490 during the reign of henry vii and a brass yard and a brass ell from 1588 in the time of queen elizabeth and still in use at the time held at the exchequer a brass yard and a brass ell at the guildhall and a brass yard presented to the clock-makers company by the exchequer in 1671 the exchequer yard was taken as true the variation was found to be +120 to 115 of an inch and an additional graduation for the exchequer yard was made on the royal society's standard in 1758 the legislature required the construction of a standard yard which was made from the royal society's standard and was deposited with the clerk of the house of commons it was divided into feet one of the feet into inches and one of the inches into tenths a copy of it but with upright cheeks between which other measuring rods could be placed was made for the exchequer for commercial use
=== 19th-century britain ===
following royal society investigations by john playfair hyde wollaston and john warner in 1814 a committee of parliament proposed defining the standard yard based upon the length of a seconds pendulum this idea was examined but not approved the weights and measures act of 1824 (5 george iv cap 74.) an act for ascertaining and establishing uniformity of weights and measures stipulates that
from and after the first day of may one thousand eight hundred and twenty five the straight line or distance between the centres of the two points in the gold studs of the straight brass rod now in the custody of the clerk of the house of commons whereon the words and figures standard yard 1760 are engraved shall be and the same is hereby declared to be the original and genuine standard of that measure of length or lineal extension called a yard and that the same straight line or distance between the centres of the said two points in the said gold studs in the said brass rod the brass being at the temperature of sixty two degrees by fahrenheit's thermometer shall be and is hereby denominated the imperial standard yard and shall be and is hereby declared to be the unit or only standard measure of extension wherefrom or whereby all other measures of extension whatsoever whether the same be lineal superficial or solid shall be derived computed and ascertained and that all measures of length shall be taken in parts or multiples or certain proportions of the said standard yard and that one third part of the said standard yard shall be a foot and the twelfth part of such foot shall be an inch and that the pole or perch in length shall contain five such yards and a half the furlong two hundred and twenty such yards and the mile one thousand seven hundred and sixty such yards
in 1834 the primary imperial yard standard was partially destroyed in a fire known as the burning of parliament in 1838 a commission was formed to reconstruct the lost standards including the troy pound which had also been destroyed in 1845 a new yard standard was constructed based on two previously existing standards known as a1 and a2 both of which had been made for the ordnance survey and r.s 46 the yard of the royal astronomical society all three had been compared to the imperial standard before the fire the new standard was made of baily's metal no 4 consisting of 16 parts copper 2 12 parts tin and 1 part zinc it was 38 inches long and 1 inch square the weights and measures act of 1855 granted official recognition to the new standards between 1845 and 1855 forty yard standards were constructed one of which was selected as the new imperial standard four others known as parliamentary copies were distributed to the royal mint the royal society of london the royal observatory at greenwich and the new palace at westminster commonly called the houses of parliament the other 35 yard standards were distributed to the cities of london edinburgh and dublin as well the united states and other countries (although only the first five had official status) the imperial standard received by the united states is known as bronze yard no 11
the weights and measures act 1878 confirmed the status of the existing yard standard mandated regular intercomparisons between the several yard standards and authorized the construction of one additional parliamentary copy (made in 1879 and known as parliamentary copy vi)
=== definition of the yard in terms of the meter ===
the yard is equal to 3 feet or 36 inches under an agreement in 1959 between australia canada new zealand south africa the united kingdom and the united states the yard (known as the international yard in the united states) was legally defined to be exactly 0.9144 meters
subsequent measurements revealed that the yard standard and its copies were shrinking at the rate of one part per million every twenty years due to the gradual release of strain incurred during the fabrication process the international prototype meter on the other hand was comparatively stable a measurement made in 1895 determined the length of the meter at 700139370113000000039.370113 inches relative to the imperial standard yard the weights and measures (metric) act of 1897 in conjunction with order in council 411 (1898) made this relationship official after 1898 the de facto legal definition of the yard came to be accepted as 36700139370113000000039.370113 of a meter
in 1959 the usa uk canada australia new zealand and south africa agreed to adopt the international yard of exactly 0.9144 meters in the uk the provisions of the treaty were ratified by the weights and measures act of 1963 the imperial standard yard of 1855 was renamed the united kingdom primary standard yard and retained its official status as the national prototype yard
schedule 2 part i of the weights and measures act of 1985 defines the yard as 0.9144 meters and the meter as the distance light travels in 1299792458 of a second it then goes on to state

== current use ==
the yard is used as the standard unit of field-length measurement in american canadian and association football cricket pitch dimensions and in some countries golf fairway measurements
there are corresponding units of area and volume the square yard and cubic yard respectively these are sometimes referred to simply as yards when no ambiguity is possible for example an american or canadian concrete mixer may be marked with a capacity of 11 yards or 1.5 yards where cubic yards are obviously referred to
yards are also used and are the legal requirement on road signs for shorter distances in the united kingdom they are also frequently found in conversation between britons much like in the united states for distance 
=== textiles and fat quarters ===
the yard subdivided into eighths is used for the purchase of fabrics in the united states and united kingdom and was previously used elsewhere in the united states the term fat quarter is used for a piece of fabric which is half a yard in length cut from a roll and then cut again along the width so that it is only half the width of the roll thus the same area as a piece of one quarter yard cut from the full width of the roll these pieces are popular for patchwork and quilting the term fat eighth is also used for a piece of one quarter yard from half the roll width the same area as one eighth cut from the roll
== equivalences ==
for purposes of measuring cloth the early yard was divided by the binary method into two four eight and sixteen parts the two most common divisions were the fourth and sixteenth parts the quarter of a yard was known as the quarter without further qualification while the sixteenth of a yard was called a nail the eighth of a yard was sometimes called a finger but was more commonly referred to simply as an eighth of a yard while the half-yard was called half a yard
other units related to the yard but not specific to cloth measurement two yards are a fathom a quarter of a yard (when not referring to cloth) is a span
== conversions ==
international yard (defined 1959)
1 yard = 0.9144 meter
1 statute mile (international mile) = 8 furlongs = 80 chains = 1760 yards
pre-1959 us yard - defined 1869 implemented 1893
for survey purposes certain pre-1959 units were retained usually prefaced by the word survey, among them the survey inch survey foot and survey mile also known as the statute mile the rod and furlong exist only in their pre-1959 form and are thus not prefaced by the word survey. however it is not clear if a survey yard actually exists if it did its hypothetical values would be as follows
3937 survey yard = 3600 meters
1 survey yard 0.914 401 83 meter
0.999 998 survey yard = 1 yard (exact)
1 statute mile (us survey mile) = 8 furlongs = 80 chains = 1760 survey yards (about 1.000002 international miles)
