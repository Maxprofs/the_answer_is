food chain linear network links food web starting producer organisms grass trees use radiation sun make food ending apex predator species like grizzly bears killer whales detrivores like earthworms woodlice decomposer species fungi bacteria food chain also shows organisms related food eat level food chain represents different trophic level food chain differs food web complex network different animals feeding relations aggregated chain follows direct linear pathway one animal time common metric used quantify food web trophic structure food chain length simplest form length chain number links trophic consumer base web mean chain length entire web arithmetic average lengths chains food web
food chains first introduced africanarab scientist philosopher aljahiz th century later popularized book published charles elton also introduced food web concept
