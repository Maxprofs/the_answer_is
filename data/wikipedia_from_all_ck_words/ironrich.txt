irony (from ancient greek (eirnea) meaning dissimulation feigned ignorance") in its broadest sense is a rhetorical device literary technique or event in which what appears on the surface to be the case differs radically from what is actually the case irony may be divided into categories such as verbal dramatic and situational
verbal dramatic and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth the ironic form of simile used in sarcasm and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth denies the contrary of the truth or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection
other forms as identified by historian connop thirlwall include dialectic and practical irony
== definitionsedit ==
henry watson fowler in the king's english says any definition of ironythough hundreds might be given and very few of them would be acceptedmust include this that the surface meaning and the underlying meaning of what is said are not the same. also eric partridge in usage and abusage writes that irony consists in stating the contrary of what is meant.
the use of irony may require the concept of a double audience fowler's a dictionary of modern english usage says
irony is a form of utterance that postulates a double audience consisting of one party that hearing shall hear & shall not understand & another party that when more is meant than meets the ear is aware both of that more & of the outsiders incomprehension
the term is sometimes used as a synonym for incongruous and applied to every trivial oddity in situations where there is no double audience an example of such usage is
sullivan whose real interest was ironically serious music which he composed with varying degrees of success achieved fame for his comic opera scores rather than for his more earnest efforts
the american heritage dictionary's secondary meaning for irony incongruity between what might be expected and what actually occurs this sense however is not synonymous with incongruous but merely a definition of dramatic or situational irony it is often included in definitions of irony not only that incongruity is present but also that the incongruity must reveal some aspect of human vanity or folly thus the majority of american heritage dictionary's usage panel found it unacceptable to use the word ironic to describe mere unfortunate coincidences or surprising disappointments that suggest no particular lessons about human vanity or folly.
on this aspect the oxford english dictionary (oed) has also
a condition of affairs or events of a character opposite to what was or might naturally be expected a contradictory outcome of events as if in mockery of the promise and fitness of things (in french ironie du sort.)
== origin of the termedit ==
according to the encyclopdia britannica
the term irony has its roots in the greek comic character eiron a clever underdog who by his wit repeatedly triumphs over the boastful character alazon the socratic irony of the platonic dialogues derives from this comic origin
according to richard whately
aristotle mentions eironeia which in his time was commonly employed to signify not according to the modern use of irony saying the contrary to what is meant but what later writers usually express by litotes i.e saying less than is meant
the word came into english as a figure of speech in the 16th century as similar to the french ironie it derives from the latin ironia and ultimately from the greek eirnea meaning dissimulation ignorance purposely affected
== typesedit ==
the new princeton encyclopedia of poetry and poetics distinguishes between the following types of irony
classical irony referring to the origins of irony in ancient greek comedy and the way classical and medieval rhetoricians delineated the term
romantic irony a self-aware and self-critical form of fiction
cosmic irony a contrast between the absolute and the relative the general and the individual which hegel expressed by the phrase general [irony] of the world.
verbal irony a contradiction between a statement's stated and intended meaning
situational irony the disparity of intention and result when the result of an action is contrary to the desired or expected effect
dramatic irony and tragic irony a disparity of awareness between actor and observer when words and actions possess significance that the listener or audience understands but the speaker or character does not for example when a character says to another i'll see you tomorrow! when the audience (but not the character) knows that the character will die before morning it is most often used when the author causes a character to speak or act erroneously out of ignorance of some portion of the truth of which the audience is aware in tragic irony the audience knows the character is making a mistake even as the character is making it
=== verbal ironyedit ===
according to a glossary of literary terms by abrams and hartman
verbal irony is a statement in which the meaning that a speaker employs is sharply different from the meaning that is ostensibly expressed the ironic statement usually involves the explicit expression of one attitude or evaluation but with indications in the overall speech-situation that the speaker intends a very different and often opposite attitude or evaluation
verbal irony is distinguished from situational irony and dramatic irony in that it is produced intentionally by speakers for instance if a man exclaims i'm not upset! but reveals an upset emotional state through his voice while truly trying to claim he's not upset it would not be verbal irony by virtue of its verbal manifestation (it would however be situational irony) but if the same speaker said the same words and intended to communicate that he was upset by claiming he was not the utterance would be verbal irony this distinction illustrates an important aspect of verbal ironyspeakers communicate implied propositions that are intentionally contradictory to the propositions contained in the words themselves there are however examples of verbal irony that do not rely on saying the opposite of what one means and there are cases where all the traditional criteria of irony exist and the utterance is not ironic
in a clear example from literature in shakespeare's julius caesar mark antony's speech after the assassination of caesar appears to praise the assassins particularly brutus ("but brutus says he was ambitious / and brutus is an honourable man") while actually condemning them we're left in no doubt as to who's ambitious and who's honourable the literal truth of what's written clashes with the perceived truth of what's meant to revealing effect which is irony in a nutshell
ironic similes are a form of verbal irony where a speaker intends to communicate the opposite of what they mean for instance the following explicit similes begin with the deceptive formation of a statement that means a but that eventually conveys the meaning not a
as soft as concrete
as clear as mud
as pleasant as a root canal
as pleasant and relaxed as a coiled rattlesnake (kurt vonnegut from breakfast of champions)
the irony is recognizable in each case only by using knowledge of the source concepts (e.g. that mud is opaque that root canal surgery is painful) to detect an incongruity
==== verbal irony and sarcasmedit ====
a fair amount of confusion has surrounded the issue regarding the relationship between verbal irony and sarcasm
fowler's a dictionary of modern english usage states
sarcasm does not necessarily involve irony and irony has often no touch of sarcasm
this suggests that the two concepts are linked but may be considered separately the oed entry for sarcasm does not mention irony but the irony entry reads
a figure of speech in which the intended meaning is the opposite of that expressed by the words used usually taking the form of sarcasm or ridicule in which laudatory expressions are used to imply condemnation or contempt
the encyclopdia britannica has non-literary irony is often called sarcasm while the webster's dictionary entry is
sarcasm 1  a sharp and often satirical or ironic utterance designed to cut or give pain 2 a  a mode of satirical wit depending for its effect on bitter caustic and often ironic language that is usually directed against an individual
partridge in usage and abusage would separate the two forms of speech completely
irony must not be confused with sarcasm which is direct sarcasm means precisely what it says but in a sharp caustic  manner
the psychologist martin in the psychology of humour is quite clear that irony is where the literal meaning is opposite to the intended and sarcasm is aggressive humor that pokes fun he has the following examples for irony he uses the statement what a nice day when it is raining for sarcasm he cites winston churchill who is supposed to have said when told by bessie braddock that he was drunk but i shall be sober in the morning and you will still be ugly as being sarcastic while not saying the opposite of what is intended
psychology researchers lee and katz (1998) have addressed the issue directly they found that ridicule is an important aspect of sarcasm but not of verbal irony in general by this account sarcasm is a particular kind of personal criticism leveled against a person or group of persons that incorporates verbal irony for example a woman reports to her friend that rather than going to a medical doctor to treat her cancer she has decided to see a spiritual healer instead in response her friend says sarcastically oh brilliant what an ingenious idea that's really going to cure you. the friend could have also replied with any number of ironic expressions that should not be labeled as sarcasm exactly but still have many shared elements with sarcasm
most instances of verbal irony are labeled by research subjects as sarcastic suggesting that the term sarcasm is more widely used than its technical definition suggests it should be (bryant & fox tree 2002 gibbs 2000) some psycholinguistic theorists (e.g. gibbs 2000) suggest that sarcasm ("great idea! i hear they do fine work.") hyperbole ("that's the best idea i have heard in years!") understatement ("sure what the hell it's only cancer...") rhetorical questions ("what does your spirit have cancer?") double entendre ("i'll bet if you do that you'll be communing with spirits in no time...") and jocularity ("get them to fix your bad back while you're at it.") should all be considered forms of verbal irony the differences between these rhetorical devices (tropes) can be quite subtle and relate to typical emotional reactions of listeners and the rhetorical goals of the speakers regardless of the various ways theorists categorize figurative language types people in conversation who are attempting to interpret speaker intentions and discourse goals do not generally identify by name the kinds of tropes used (leggitt & gibbs 2000)
=== dramatic ironyedit ===
this type of irony is the device of giving the spectator an item of information that at least one of the characters in the narrative is unaware of (at least consciously) thus placing the spectator a step ahead of at least one of the characters the oed defines this as
the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned the literary device so used orig in greek tragedy
according to stanton dramatic irony has three stagesinstallation exploitation and resolution (often also called preparation suspension and resolution) producing dramatic conflict in what one character relies or appears to rely upon the contrary of which is known by observers (especially the audience sometimes to other characters within the drama) to be true in summary it means that the reader/watcher/listener knows something that one or more of the characters in the piece is not aware of
for example
in city lights the audience knows that charlie chaplin's character is not a millionaire but the blind flower girl (virginia cherrill) believes him to be rich
in north by northwest the audience knows that roger thornhill (cary grant) is not kaplan vandamm (james mason) and his accomplices do not the audience also knows that kaplan is a fictitious agent invented by the cia roger (initially) and vandamm (throughout) do not
in oedipus the king the audience knows that oedipus himself is the murderer that he is seeking oedipus creon and jocasta do not
in othello the audience knows that desdemona has been faithful to othello but othello does not the audience also knows that iago is scheming to bring about othello's downfall a fact hidden from othello desdemona cassio and roderigo
in the cask of amontillado the reader knows that montresor is planning on murdering fortunato while fortunato believes they are friends
in the truman show the viewer is aware that truman is on a television show but truman himself only gradually learns this
in romeo and juliet the audience knows that juliet is already married to romeo but her family does not also in the crypt most of the other characters in the cast think juliet is dead but the audience knows she only took a sleeping potion romeo is also under the same misapprehension when he kills himself
==== tragic ironyedit ====
tragic irony is a special category of dramatic irony in tragic irony the words and actions of the characters contradict the real situation which the spectators fully realize the oxford english dictionary defines this as
the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned the literary device so used orig in greek tragedy
ancient greek drama was especially characterized by tragic irony because the audiences were so familiar with the legends that most of the plays dramatized sophocles oedipus the king provides a classic example of tragic irony at its fullest colebrook writes
tragic irony is exemplified in ancient drama  the audience watched a drama unfold already knowing its destined outcome  in sophocles oedipus the king for example we (the audience) can see what oedipus is blind to the man he murders is his father but he does not know it
further oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him for the plague that he has caused not knowing that the murderer he has cursed and vowed to find is himself
irony has some of its foundation in the onlooker's perception of paradox that arises from insoluble problems for example in the william shakespeare play romeo and juliet when romeo finds juliet in a drugged deathlike sleep he assumes her to be dead and kills himself upon awakening to find her dead lover beside her juliet stabs herself with a dagger thus killing herself
=== situational ironyedit ===
this is a relatively modern use of the term and describes a sharp discrepancy between the expected result and actual results in a certain situation
lars ellestrm writes
situational irony  is most broadly defined as a situation where the outcome is incongruous with what was expected but it is also more generally understood as a situation that includes contradictions or sharp contrasts
for example
when john hinckley attempted to assassinate ronald reagan all of his shots initially missed the president however a bullet ricocheted off the bullet-proof presidential limousine and struck reagan in the chest thus a vehicle made to protect the president from gunfire instead directed gunfire to the president
the wonderful wizard of oz is a story whose plot revolves around situational irony dorothy travels to a wizard and fulfills his challenging demands to go home before discovering she had the ability to go back home all the time the scarecrow longs for intelligence only to discover he is already a genius and the tin woodsman longs to be capable of love only to discover he already has a heart the lion who at first appears to be a whimpering coward turns out to be bold and fearless the people in emerald city believed the wizard to be a powerful deity only to discover that he is a bumbling eccentric old man with no special powers at all
in o henry's story the gift of the magi a young couple are too poor to buy each other christmas gifts the wife cuts off her treasured hair to sell it to a wig-maker for money to buy her husband a chain for his heirloom pocket watch she's shocked when she learns he had pawned his watch to buy her a set of combs for her long beautiful prized hair the double irony lies in the particular way their expectations were foiled.
in the ancient indian story of krishna king kamsa is told in a prophecy that a child of his sister devaki would kill him to prevent this he imprisons both devaki and her husband vasudeva allowing them to live only if they hand over their children as soon as they are born he murders nearly all of them one by one but the seventh and eighth children balarama and krishna are saved and raised by a royal couple nanda and yashoda after the boys grow up krishna eventually kills kamsa as the prophecy foretold kamsa's attempt to prevent the prophecy led to it becoming a reality
this story is similar to those in greek mythology cronus prevents his wife from raising any children but the one who ends up defeating him is zeus the later king of the gods other similar tales in greek mythology include perseus (who killed his grandfather acrisius by accident with a discus despite acrisius attempt to avert his fate) and more famously oedipus who killed his father and married his mother not knowing their relationship due to being left to die by his father to prevent that very prophecy from occurring
==== cosmic irony (irony of fate)edit ====
the expression cosmic irony or irony of fate stems from the notion that the gods (or the fates) are amusing themselves by toying with the minds of mortals with deliberate ironic intent closely connected with situational irony it arises from sharp contrasts between reality and human ideals or between human intentions and actual results the resulting situation is poignantly contrary to what was expected or intended
according to sudhir dixit cosmic irony is a term that is usually associated with [thomas] hardy  there is a strong feeling of a hostile deus ex machina in hardy's novels. in tess of the d'urbervilles there are several instances of this type of irony.
justice was done and the president of the immortals (in schylean phrase) had ended his sport with tess
==== historical ironyedit ====
when history is seen through modern eyes there often appear sharp contrasts between the way historical figures see their world's future and what actually transpires for example during the 1920s the new york times repeatedly scorned crossword puzzles in 1924 it lamented the sinful waste in the utterly futile finding of words the letters of which will fit into a prearranged pattern. in 1925 it said the question of whether the puzzles are beneficial or harmful is in no urgent need of an answer the craze evidently is dying out fast. today no u.s newspaper is more closely identified with the crossword than the new york times
in a more tragic example of historical irony what people now refer to as the first world war was called by h.g wells the war that will end war which soon became the war to end war and the war to end all wars and this became a widespread truism almost a clich historical irony is therefore a subset of cosmic irony but one in which the element of time is bound to play a role another example could be that of the vietnam war where in the 1960s the u.s attempted to stop the viet cong (viet minh) taking over south vietnam however it is an often ignored fact that in 1941 the u.s originally supported the viet minh in its fight against japanese occupation
in the introduction to the irony of american history andrew bacevich writes
after 9/11 the bush administration announced its intention of bringing freedom and democracy to the people of the middle east ideologues within the bush administration persuaded themselves that american power adroitly employed could transform that region  the results speak for themselves
gunpowder was according to prevailing academic consensus discovered in the 9th century by chinese alchemists searching for an elixir of immortality
historical irony also includes inventors killed by their own creations such as william bullockunless due to the nature of the invention the risk of death was always known and accepted as in the case of otto lilienthal who was killed by flying a glider of his own devising
in certain kinds of situational or historical irony a factual truth is highlighted by some person's complete ignorance of it or his belief in its opposite however this state of affairs does not occur by human design in some religious contexts such situations have been seen as the deliberate work of divine providence to emphasize truths and to taunt humans for not being aware of them when they could easily have been enlightened (this is similar to human use of irony) such ironies are often more evident or more striking when viewed retrospectively in the light of later developments which make the truth of past situations obvious to all
other prominent examples of outcomes now seen as poignantly contrary to expectation include
in the dred scott v sandford ruling in 1856 the united states supreme court held that the fifth amendment barred any law that would deprive a slaveholder of his property such as his slaves upon the incidence of migration into free territory so in a sense the supreme court used the bill of rights to deny rights to slaves also chief justice taney hoped that the decision would resolve the slavery issue but instead it helped cause the american civil war
in the kalgoorlie (australia) gold rush of the 1890s large amounts of the little-known mineral calaverite (gold telluride) were ironically identified as fool's gold these mineral deposits were used as a cheap building material and for the filling of potholes and ruts when several years later the mineral was identified there was a minor gold rush to excavate the streets
john f kennedy's last conversation was ironic in light of events which followed seconds later during the motorcade in dallas in response to mrs connolly's comment mr president you can't say that dallas doesn't love you, kennedy replied that's very obvious. immediately after he was mortally wounded
in 1974 the u.s consumer product safety commission had to recall 80,000 of its own lapel buttons promoting toy safety because the buttons had sharp edges used lead paint and had small clips that could be broken off and subsequently swallowed
introducing cane toads to australia to control the cane beetle not only failed to control the pest but introduced in the toads themselves a very much worse pest this irony is exemplified by the song there was an old lady who swallowed a fly in which the lady swallows a fly and then swallows a spider to catch the fly and so on with larger and larger animals until she dies
== useedit ==
=== comic ironyedit ===
irony is often used in literature to produce a comic effect this may also be combined with satire for instance an author may facetiously state something as a well-known fact and then demonstrate through the narrative that the fact is untrue
jane austen's pride and prejudice begins with the proposition it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. in fact it soon becomes clear that austen means the opposite women (or their mothers) are always in search of and desperately on the lookout for a rich single man to make a husband the irony deepens as the story promotes this romance and ends in a double marriage proposal austen's comic irony emerges out of the disjunction between elizabeth's overconfidence (or pride) in her perceptions of darcy and the narrator's indications that her views are in fact partial and prejudicial.
the third man is a film that features any number of eccentricities each of which contributes to the film's perspective of comic irony as well as its overall cinematic self-consciousness.
writing about performances of shakespeare's othello in apartheid south africa robert gordon suggests could it be that black people in the audience  may have viewed as a comic irony his audacity and navety in thinking he could pass for white.
=== romantic irony and metafictionedit ===
romantic irony is an attitude of detached scepticism adopted by an author towards his or her work typically manifesting in literary self-consciousness and self-reflection this conception of irony originated with the german romantic writer and critic karl wilhelm friedrich schlegel
joseph dane writes from a twentieth-century perspective the most crucial area in the history of irony is that described by the term romantic irony. he discusses the difficulty of defining romantic irony but what is romantic irony a universal type of irony the irony used by romantics or an irony envisioned by the romantics and romanticists? he also describes the arguments for and against its use
referring to earlier self-conscious works such as don quixote and tristram shandy douglas muecke points particularly to peter weiss's 1964 play marat/sade this work is a play within a play set in a lunatic asylum in which it is difficult to tell whether the players are speaking only to other players or also directly to the audience when the herald says the regrettable incident you've just seen was unavoidable indeed foreseen by our playwright there is confusion as to who is being addressed the audience on the stage or the audience in the theatre also since the play within the play is performed by the inmates of a lunatic asylum the theatre audience cannot tell whether the paranoia displayed before them is that of the players or the people they are portraying muecke notes that in america romantic irony has had a bad press while in england  [it] is almost unknown.
however in a book entitled english romantic irony anne mellor referring to byron keats carlyle coleridge and lewis carroll writes romantic irony is both a philosophical conception of the universe and an artistic program ontologically it sees the world as fundamentally chaotic no order no far goal of time ordained by god or right reason determines the progression of human or natural events. furthermore
of course romantic irony itself has more than one mode the style of romantic irony varies from writer to writer  but however distinctive the voice a writer is a romantic ironist if and when his or her work commits itself enthusiastically both in content and form to a hovering or unresolved debate between a world of merely man-made being and a world of ontological becoming
similarly metafiction is fiction in which the author self-consciously alludes to the artificiality or literariness of a work by parodying or departing from novelistic conventions (esp naturalism) and narrative techniques. it is a type of fiction that self-consciously addresses the devices of fiction thereby exposing the fictional illusion
gesa giesing writes that the most common form of metafiction is particularly frequent in romantic literature the phenomenon is then referred to as romantic irony. giesing notes that there has obviously been an increased interest in metafiction again after world war ii.
for examples patricia waugh quotes from several works at the top of her chapter headed what is metafiction? these include
the thing is this./ that of all the several ways of beginning a book  i am confident my own way of doing it is best - tristram shandy
fuck all this lying look what i am trying to write about is writing - albert angelo
since i've started this story i've gotten boils  - the death of the novel and other stories by ronald sukenick
additionally the cambridge introduction to postmodern fiction refers to john fowles's the french lieutenant's woman
for the first twelve chapters  the reader has been able to immerse him or herself in the story enjoying the kind of suspension of disbelief  required of realist novels  what follows is a remarkable act of metafictional frame-breaking chapter 13 notoriously begins
i do not know this story i am telling is all imagination these characters i create never existed outside my own mind  if this is a novel it cannot be a novel in the modern sense
=== socratic ironyedit ===
this is the dissimulation of ignorance practised by socrates as a means of confuting an adversary socrates would pretend to be ignorant of the topic under discussion to draw out the inherent nonsense in the arguments of his interlocutors the chambers dictionary defines it as a means by which a questioner pretends to know less than a respondent when actually he knows more
zoe williams of the guardian wrote the technique [of socratic irony] demonstrated in the platonic dialogues was to pretend ignorance and more sneakily to feign credence in your opponent's power of thought in order to tie him in knots.
a more modern example of socratic irony can be seen on the american crime fiction television film series columbo the character lt columbo is seemingly nave and incompetent his untidy appearance adds to this fumbling illusion as a result he is underestimated by the suspects in murder cases he is investigating with their guard down and their false sense of confidence lt columbo is able to solve the cases leaving the murderers feeling duped and outwitted
=== irony as infinite absolute negativityedit ===
danish philosopher sren kierkegaard and others see irony such as that used by socrates as a disruptive force with the power to undo texts and readers alike the phrase itself is taken from hegel's lectures on aesthetics and is applied by kierkegaard to the irony of socrates this tradition includes 19th-century german critic and novelist friedrich schlegel ("on incomprehensibility") charles baudelaire stendhal and the 20th century deconstructionist paul de man ("the concept of irony") in kierkegaard's words from on the concept of irony with continual reference to socrates
[socratic] irony [is] the infinite absolute negativity it is negativity because it only negates it is infinite because it does not negate this or that phenomenon it is absolute because that by virtue of which it negates is a higher something that still is not the irony established nothing because that which is to be established lies behind it
where much of philosophy attempts to reconcile opposites into a larger positive project kierkegaard and others insist that ironywhether expressed in complex games of authorship or simple litotesmust in kierkegaard's words swallow its own stomach irony entails endless reflection and violent reversals and ensures incomprehensibility at the moment it compels speech similarly among other literary critics writer david foster wallace viewed the pervasiveness of ironic and other postmodern tropes as the cause of great despair and stasis in u.s culture and that for aspiring fictionists [ironies] pose terrifically vexing problems.
=== irony and awkwardnessedit ===
the 90s saw an expansion of the definition of irony from saying what one doesn't mean into a general stance of detachment from life in general this detachment served as a shield against the awkwardness of everyday life humor from that era (most notably seinfeld) relies on the audience watching the show with some detachment from the show's typical signature awkward situations
the generation of people in the united states who grew up in the 90s (millennials) are seen as having this same sort of detachment from serious or awkward situations in life as well hipsters are thought of as using irony as a shield against those same serious or genuine confrontations
== misuseedit ==
some speakers of english complain that the words irony and ironic are often misused though the more general casual usage of a contradiction between circumstance and expectation originates in the 1640s
dan shaughnessy wrote
we were always kidding about the use of irony i maintained that it was best never to use the word because it was too often substituted for coincidence (alanis morissette's song isn't it ironic? cites multiple examples of things that are patently not ironic)
tim conley cites the following philip howard assembled a list of seven implied meanings for the word ironically as it opens a sentence
by a tragic coincidence
by an exceptional coincidence
by a coincidence of no importance
you and i know of course though other less intelligent mortals walk benighted under the midday sun
oddly enough or it's a rum thing that
oh hell i've run out of words to start a sentence with.
== punctuationedit ==
no agreed method for indicating irony exists though many ideas have been suggested for instance an irony punctuation mark was proposed in the 1580s when henry denham introduced a rhetorical question mark or percontation point which resembles a reversed question mark this mark was also advocated by the french poet marcel bernhardt at the end of the 19th century to indicate irony or sarcasm french writer herv bazin suggested another pointe d'ironie the greek letter psi with a dot below it while tom driberg recommended that ironic statements should be printed in italics that lean the other way to conventional italics
