sprouting is the practice of germinating seeds to be eaten raw or cooked sprouts can be germinated at home or produced industrially they are a prominent ingredient of the raw food diet and common in eastern asian cuisine
sprouting like cooking reduces anti-nutritional compounds in raw legumes raw lentils for example contain lectins antinutrional proteins which can be reduced by sprouting or cooking sprouting is also applied on a large scale to barley as a part of the malting process a downside to consuming raw sprouts is that the process of germinating seeds can also be conducive to harmful bacterial growth
== seeds suitable for sproutingedit ==
all viable seeds can be sprouted but some sprouts should not be eaten raw the most common food sprouts include
pulses (legumes pea family)
alfalfa clover fenugreek lentil pea chickpea mung bean and soybean (bean sprouts)
cereals
oat wheat maize (corn) rice barley and rye
pseudocereals
quinoa amaranth and buckwheat
oilseeds
sesame sunflower almond hazelnut linseed peanut
brassica (cabbage family)
broccoli cabbage watercress mustard mizuna radish and daikon (kaiware sprouts) rocket (arugula) tatsoi turnip
umbelliferous vegetables (parsley family) - these may be used more as microgreens than sprouts
carrot celery fennel parsley
allium (onions) - cannot really distinguish between microgreens
onion leek green onion (me-negi in japanese cuisine)
other vegetables and herbs
spinach lettuce milk thistle lemon grass
although whole oats can be sprouted oat groats sold in food stores which are dehulled and require steaming or roasting to prevent rancidity will not sprout whole oats may have an indigestible hull which makes them difficult or even unfit for human consumption
in the case of rice the husk of the paddy is removed before sprouting brown rice is widely used for germination (gbr - germinated brown rice) in japan and other countries
all the sprouts of the solanaceae (tomato potato paprika aubergine or eggplant) and rhubarb cannot be eaten as sprouts either cooked or raw as they can be poisonous some sprouts can be cooked to remove the toxin while others cannot
with all seeds care should be taken that they are intended for sprouting or human consumption rather than sowing seeds intended for sowing may be treated with chemical dressings several countries such as new zealand also require that some varieties of imported edible seed be heat-treated thus making them impossible to sprout quinoa in its natural state is very easy to sprout but when polished or pre-cleaned of its saponin coating (becoming whiter) loses its power to germinate
== the germination processedit ==
the germination process takes a few days and can be done at home manually as a semi-automated process or industrially on a large scale for commercial use
typically the seeds are first rinsed to remove soil and dirt and the mucilaginous substances produced by some seeds when they come in contact with water then they are soaked for 20 minutes to 12 hours depending on the type and size of seed the soaking increases the water content in the seeds and brings them out of quiescence after draining and then rinsing seeds at regular intervals they germinate or sprout
for home sprouting the seeds are soaked (big seeds) or moistened (small) then left at room temperature (13 to 21 c or 55 to 70 f) in a sprouting vessel many different types of vessels can be used one type is a simple glass jar with a piece of cloth or nylon window screen secured over its rim tiered clear plastic sprouters are commercially available allowing a number of crops to be grown simultaneously by staggering sowings a constant supply of young sprouts can be ensured any vessel used for sprouting must allow water to drain from it because sprouts that sit in water will rot quickly the seeds swell may stick to the sides of the jar and begin germinating within a day or two
another sprouting technique is to use a pulse drip method the photo below on the right shows crimson clover sprouts grown on 1/8 urethane foam mats it's a one-way watering system with micro sprinklers providing intermittent pulses of fresh water to reduce the risk of bacterial cross-contamination with salmonella and e coli during the sprouting process
sprouts are rinsed two to four times a day depending on the climate and the type of seed to provide them with moisture and prevent them from souring each seed has its own ideal sprouting time after three to five days the sprouts will have grown to 5 to 8 centimetres (23 in) in length and will be suitable for consumption if left longer they will begin to develop leaves and are then known as baby greens a popular baby green is sunflower after 710 days refrigeration can be used as needed to slow or halt the growth process of any sprout
common causes for sprouts to become inedible
seeds are not rinsed well enough before soaking
seeds are left in standing water after the initial soaking
seeds are allowed to dry out
temperature is too high or too low
dirty equipment
insufficient air flow
contaminated water source
poor germination rate
mung beans can be sprouted either in light or dark conditions those sprouted in the dark will be crisper in texture and whiter as in the case of commercially available chinese bean sprouts but these have less nutritional content than those grown in partial sunlight growing in full sunlight is not recommended because it can cause the beans to overheat or dry out subjecting the sprouts to pressure for example by placing a weight on top of them in their sprouting container will result in larger crunchier sprouts similar to those sold in grocery stores
a very effective way to sprout beans like lentils or azuki is in colanders soak the beans in water for about 8 hours then place in the colander wash twice a day the sprouted beans can be eaten raw or cooked
sprouting is also applied on a large scale to barley as a part of the malting process malted barley is an important ingredient in beer and is used in huge quantities most malted barley is distributed among wide retail sellers in north american regions
many varieties of nuts such as almonds and peanuts can also be started in their growth cycle by soaking and sprouting although because the sprouts are generally still very small when eaten they are usually called soaks
== nutritional informationedit ==
sprouts are said to be rich in digestible energy bioavailable vitamins minerals amino acids proteins and phytochemicals as these are necessary for a germinating plant to grow these nutrients are essential for human health the nutritional changes upon germination & sprouting are summarised below
chavan and kadam (1989) concluded that
the desirable nutritional changes that occur during sprouting are mainly due to the breakdown of complex compounds into a more simple form transformation into essential constituents and breakdown of nutritionally undesirable constituents.
the metabolic activity of resting seeds increases as soon as they are hydrated during soaking complex biochemical changes occur during hydration and subsequent sprouting the reserve chemical constituents such as protein starch and lipids are broken down by enzymes into simple compounds that are used to make new compounds.
sprouting grains causes increased activities of hydrolytic enzymes improvements in the contents of total proteins fat certain essential amino acids total sugars b-group vitamins and a decrease in dry matter starch and anti-nutrients the increased contents of protein fat fibre and total ash are only apparent and attributable to the disappearance of starch however improvements in amino acid composition b-group vitamins sugars protein and starch digestibilities and decrease in phytates and protease inhibitors are the metabolic effects of the sprouting process.
increases in protein quality chavan and kadam (1989) stated that very complex qualitative changes are reported to occur during soaking and sprouting of seeds the conversion of storage proteins of cereal grains into albumins and globulins during sprouting may improve the quality of cereal proteins many studies have shown an increase in the content of the amino acid lysine with sprouting.
an increase in proteolytic activity during sprouting is desirable for nutritional improvement of cereals because it leads to hydrolysis of prolamins and the liberated amino acids such as glutamic and proline are converted to limiting amino acids such as lysine.
increases in crude fibre content cuddeford (1989) based on data obtained by peer and leeson (1985) stated that in sprouted barley crude fibre a major constituent of cell walls increases both in percentage and real terms with the synthesis of structural carbohydrates such as cellulose and hemicellulose chung et al (1989) found that the fibre content increased from 3.75% in unsprouted barley seed to 6% in 5-day sprouts.
crude protein and crude fibre changes in barley sprouted over a 7-day period
source cuddeford (1989) based on data obtained by peer and leeson (1985)
increase of protein is not due to new protein being manufactured by the germination process but by the washing out of starch and conversion to fiberincreasing the relative proportion of protein
increases in essential fatty acids
an increase in lipase activity has been reported in barley by macleod and white (1962) as cited by chavan and kadam (1989) increased lipolytic activity during germination and sprouting causes hydrolysis of triacylglycerols to glycerol and constituent fatty acids
increases in vitamin content according to chavan and kadam (1989) most reports agree that sprouting treatment of cereal grains generally improves their vitamin value especially the b-group vitamins certain vitamins such as -tocopherol (vitamin-e) and -carotene (vitamin-a precursor) are produced during the growth process (cuddeford 1989)
according to shipard (2005) sprouts provide a good supply of vitamins a e & c plus b complex like enzymes vitamins serve as bioactive catalysts to assist in the digestion and metabolism of feeds and the release of energy they are also essential for the healing and repair of cells however vitamins are very perishable and in general the fresher the feeds eaten the higher the vitamin content the vitamin content of some seeds can increase by up to 20 times their original value within several days of sprouting mung bean sprouts have b vitamin increases compared to the dry seeds of - b1 up 285% b2 up 515% b3 up 256% even soaking seeds overnight in water yields greatly increased amounts of b vitamins as well as vitamin c compared with mature plants sprouts can yield vitamin contents 30 times higher.
chelation of minerals shipard (2005) claims that - when seeds are sprouted minerals chelate or merge with protein in a way that increases their function
it is important to note that while these changes may sound impressive the comparisons are between dormant non-sprouted seed to sprouted seed rather than comparisons of sprouts to mature vegetables compared to dry seeds there are very large increases in nutrients whereas compared with mature vegetables the increase is less however a sprout just starting out in life is likely to need and thus have more nutrients (percentage wise) than a mature vegetable
following table lists selected nutrients in kidney beans to show the effect of sprouting nutrients are calculated for 100 gms of non-water components to take the water out of equation since after sprouting beans absorb lot of water

=== bacterial infectionedit ===
commercially grown sprouts have been associated with multiple outbreaks of harmful bacteria including salmonella and toxic forms of escherichia coli such infections may be a result of contaminated seeds or of unhygienic production with high microbial counts sprout seeds can become contaminated in the fields where they are grown and sanitizing steps may be unable to kill bacteria hidden in damaged seeds a single surviving bacterium in a kilogram of seed can be enough to contaminate a whole batch of sprouts according to the fda
to minimize the impact of the incidents and maintain public health both the u.s food and drug administration (fda) and health canada issued industry guidance on the safe manufacturing of edible sprouts and public education on their safe consumption there are also publications for hobby farmers on safely growing and consuming sprouts at home the recommendations include development and implementation of good agricultural practices and good manufacturing practices in the production and handling of seeds and sprouts seed disinfection treatments and microbial testing before the product enters the food supply
in june 2011 contaminated fenugreek sprouts (grown from seed from egypt) in germany was identified as the source of the 2011 e coli o104:h4 outbreak which the german officials had blamed wrongly first on cucumbers from spain and then on mung bean sprouts in addition to germany where 3,785 cases and 45 deaths had been reported by the end of the outbreak a handful of cases were reported in several countries including switzerland poland the netherlands sweden denmark the uk canada and the usa virtually all affected people had been in germany shortly before becoming ill
=== antinutritional factorsedit ===
some legumes including sprouts can contain toxins or antinutritional factors which can be reduced by soaking sprouting and cooking (e.g. stir frying) joy larkcom advises that to be on the safe side one shouldnt eat large quantities of raw legume sprouts on a regular basis no more than about 550g (20oz) daily
phytic acid an antinutritional factor occurs primarily in the seed coats and germ tissue of plant seeds it forms insoluble or nearly insoluble compounds with many metal ions including those of calcium iron magnesium and zinc reducing their dietary availability diets high in phytic acid content and poor in these minerals produce mineral deficiency in experimental animals (gontzea and sutzescu 1968 as cited in chavan and kadam 1989) the latter authors state that the sprouting of cereals has been reported to decrease levels of phytic acid similarly shipard (2005) states that enzymes of germination and sprouting can help eliminate detrimental substances such as phytic acid however the amount of phytic acid reduction from soaking is only marginal and not enough to counteract its antinutrient effects
=== standards and regulationsedit ===
==== eu regulationedit ====
in order to prevent incidents like the 2011 ehec epidemic the european commission has issued three new tightened regulations on march 11 2013
regulation (eu) no 208/2013*
the origin of the seeds has to be traceable always at all stages of processing production and distribution therefore a full description of the seeds or sprouts needs to be kept on record.(see also article 18 of regulation (ec) no 178/2002)
regulation (eu) no 209/2013*
this regulation amends regulation (ec) no 2073/2005 in respect of microbiological criteria for sprouts and the sampling rules for poultry carcases and fresh poultry meat
regulation (eu) no 211/2013*
imported sprouts or seeds intended for the production of sprouts need a certificate according to the model declared in the annex of this regulation the certificate serves as proof that the production process complies with the general hygiene provisions in part a of annex i to regulation (ec) no 852/2004 and the traceability requirements of implementing regulation (eu) no 208/2013
