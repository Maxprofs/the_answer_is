infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents their multiplication and the reaction of host tissues to these organisms and the toxins they produce infectious disease also known as transmissible disease or communicable disease is illness resulting from an infection
infections are caused by infectious agents including viruses viroids prions bacteria nematodes such as parasitic roundworms and pinworms arthropods such as ticks mites fleas and lice fungi such as ringworm and other macroparasites such as tapeworms and other helminths
hosts can fight infections using their immune system mammalian hosts react to infections with an innate response often involving inflammation followed by an adaptive response
specific medications used to treat infections include antibiotics antivirals antifungals antiprotozoals and antihelminthics infectious diseases resulted in 9.2 million deaths in 2013 (about 17% of all deaths) the branch of medicine that focuses on infections is referred to as infectious disease
== classificationedit ==
bacterial infections are classified by the causative agent as well as the symptoms and medical signs produced
symptomatic infections are apparent whereas an infection that is active but does not produce noticeable symptoms may be called inapparent silent subclinical or occult an infection that is inactive or dormant is called a latent infection
a short-term infection is an acute infection a long-term infection is a chronic infection
=== primary versus opportunisticedit ===
among the vast varieties of microorganisms relatively few cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals infectious disease results from the interplay between those few pathogens and the defenses of the hosts they infect the appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen depends upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen however a host's immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to control the infection clinicians therefore classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses - either as primary pathogens or as opportunistic pathogens
primary pathogens cause disease as a result of their presence or activity within the normal healthy host and their intrinsic virulence (the severity of the disease they cause) is in part a necessary consequence of their need to reproduce and spread many of the most common primary pathogens of humans only infect humans however many serious diseases are caused by organisms acquired from the environment or which infect non-human hosts
opportunistic pathogens can cause an infectious disease in a host with depressed resistance opportunistic infection may be caused by microbes ordinarily in contact with the host such as pathogenic bacteria or fungi in the gastrointestinal or the upper respiratory tract and they may also result from (otherwise innocuous) microbes acquired from other hosts (as in clostridium difficile colitis) or from the environment as a result of traumatic introduction (as in surgical wound infections or compound fractures) an opportunistic disease requires impairment of host defenses which may occur as a result of genetic defects (such as chronic granulomatous disease) exposure to antimicrobial drugs or immunosuppressive chemicals (as might occur following poisoning or cancer chemotherapy) exposure to ionizing radiation or as a result of an infectious disease with immunosuppressive activity (such as with measles malaria or hiv disease) primary pathogens may also cause more severe disease in a host with depressed resistance than would normally occur in an immunosufficient host
=== occult infectionedit ===
occult infection is a hidden infection first recognized by secondary manifestations
=== infectious or notedit ===
one way of proving that a given disease is infectious is to satisfy koch's postulates (first proposed by robert koch) which demands that the infectious agent be identified only in patients and not in healthy controls and that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease these postulates were first used in the discovery that mycobacteria species cause tuberculosis koch's postulates can not be applied ethically for many human diseases because they require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a pathogen produced as a pure culture often even clearly infectious diseases do not meet the infectious criteria for example treponema pallidum the causative spirochete of syphilis cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes it is less clear that a pure culture comes from an animal source serving as host than it is when derived from microbes derived from plate culture epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population for infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic (occasional occurrence) endemic (regular cases often occurring in a region) epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region) or pandemic (a global epidemic)
=== contagiousnessedit ===
infectious diseases are sometimes called contagious disease when they are easily transmitted by contact with an ill person or their secretions (e.g. influenza) thus a contagious disease is a subset of infectious disease that is especially infective or easily transmitted other types of infectious/transmissible/communicable diseases with more specialized routes of infection such as vector transmission or sexual transmission are usually not regarded as contagious, and often do not require medical isolation (sometimes loosely called quarantine) of victims however this specialized connotation of the word contagious and contagious disease (easy transmissibility) is not always respected in popular use
=== by anatomic locationedit ===
infections can be classified by the anatomic location or organ system infected including
urinary tract infection
skin infection
respiratory tract infection
odontogenic infection (an infection that originates within a tooth or in the closely surrounding tissues)
vaginal infections
intra-amniotic infection
in addition locations of inflammation where infection is the most common cause include pneumonia meningitis and salpingitis
== signs and symptomsedit ==
the symptoms of an infection depend on the type of disease some signs of infection affect the whole body generally such as fatigue loss of appetite weight loss fevers night sweats chills aches and pains others are specific to individual body parts such as skin rashes coughing or a runny nose
in certain cases infectious diseases may be asymptomatic for much or even all of their course in a given host in the latter case the disease may only be defined as a disease (which by definition means an illness) in hosts who secondarily become ill after contact with an asymptomatic carrier an infection is not synonymous with an infectious disease as some infections do not cause illness in a host
=== bacterial or viraledit ===
bacterial and viral infections can both cause the same kinds of symptoms it can be difficult to distinguish which is the cause of a specific infection it's important to distinguish because viral infections cannot be cured by antibiotics
== pathophysiologyedit ==
there is a general chain of events that applies to infections the chain of events involves several stepswhich include the infectious agent reservoir entering a susceptible host exit and transmission to new hosts each of the links must be present in a chronological order for an infection to develop understanding these steps helps health care workers target the infection and prevent it from occurring in the first place
=== colonizationedit ===
infection begins when an organism successfully enters the body grows and multiplies referred to as colonization most humans are not easily infected those who are weak sick malnourished have cancer or are diabetic have increased susceptibility to chronic or persistent infections individuals who have a suppressed immune system are particularly susceptible to opportunistic infections entrance to the host at host-pathogen interface generally occurs through the mucosa in orifices like the oral cavity nose eyes genitalia anus or the microbe can enter through open wounds while a few organisms can grow at the initial site of entry many migrate and cause systemic infection in different organs some pathogens grow within the host cells (intracellular) whereas others grow freely in bodily fluids
wound colonization refers to nonreplicating microorganisms within the wound while in infected wounds replicating organisms exist and tissue is injured all multicellular organisms are colonized to some degree by extrinsic organisms and the vast majority of these exist in either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with the host an example of the former is the anaerobic bacteria species which colonizes the mammalian colon and an example of the latter is various species of staphylococcus that exist on human skin neither of these colonizations are considered infections the difference between an infection and a colonization is often only a matter of circumstance non-pathogenic organisms can become pathogenic given specific conditions and even the most virulent organism requires certain circumstances to cause a compromising infection some colonizing bacteria such as corynebacteria sp and viridans streptococci prevent the adhesion and colonization of pathogenic bacteria and thus have a symbiotic relationship with the host preventing infection and speeding wound healing
the variables involved in the outcome of a host becoming inoculated by a pathogen and the ultimate outcome include
the route of entry of the pathogen and the access to host regions that it gains
the intrinsic virulence of the particular organism
the quantity or load of the initial inoculant
the immune status of the host being colonized
as an example the staphylococcus species remains harmless on the skin but when present in a normally sterile space such as in the capsule of a joint or the peritoneum multiplies without resistance and causes harm
because it is normal to have bacterial colonization it is difficult to know which chronic wounds are infected despite the huge number of wounds seen in clinical practice there are limited quality data for evaluated symptoms and signs a review of chronic wounds in the journal of the american medical association's rational clinical examination series quantified the importance of increased pain as an indicator of infection the review showed that the most useful finding is an increase in the level of pain [likelihood ratio (lr) range 11-20] makes infection much more likely but the absence of pain (negative likelihood ratio range 0.64-0.88) does not rule out infection (summary lr 0.64-0.88)
=== diseaseedit ===
disease can arise if the host's protective immune mechanisms are compromised and the organism inflicts damage on the host microorganisms can cause tissue damage by releasing a variety of toxins or destructive enzymes for example clostridium tetani releases a toxin that paralyzes muscles and staphylococcus releases toxins that produce shock and sepsis not all infectious agents cause disease in all hosts for example less than 5% of individuals infected with polio develop disease on the other hand some infectious agents are highly virulent the prion causing mad cow disease and creutzfeldtjakob disease invariably kills all animals and people that are infected
persistent infections occur because the body is unable to clear the organism after the initial infection persistent infections are characterized by the continual presence of the infectious organism often as latent infection with occasional recurrent relapses of active infection there are some viruses that can maintain a persistent infection by infecting different cells of the body some viruses once acquired never leave the body a typical example is the herpes virus which tends to hide in nerves and become reactivated when specific circumstances arise
persistent infections cause millions of deaths globally each year chronic infections by parasites account for a high morbidity and mortality in many underdeveloped countries
=== transmissionedit ===
for infecting organisms to survive and repeat the infection cycle in other hosts they (or their progeny) must leave an existing reservoir and cause infection elsewhere infection transmission can take place via many potential routes
droplet contact also known as the respiratory route and the resultant infection can be termed airborne disease if an infected person coughs or sneezes on another person the microorganisms suspended in warm moist droplets may enter the body through the nose mouth or eye surfaces
fecal-oral transmission wherein foodstuffs or water become contaminated (by people not washing their hands before preparing food or untreated sewage being released into a drinking water supply) and the people who eat and drink them become infected common fecal-oral transmitted pathogens include vibrio cholerae giardia species rotaviruses entameba histolytica escherichia coli and tape worms most of these pathogens cause gastroenteritis
sexual transmission with the resulting disease being called sexually transmitted disease
oral transmission diseases that are transmitted primarily by oral means may be caught through direct oral contact such as kissing or by indirect contact such as by sharing a drinking glass or a cigarette
transmission by direct contact some diseases that are transmissible by direct contact include athlete's foot impetigo and warts
vertical transmission directly from the mother to an embryo fetus or baby during pregnancy or childbirth it can occur when the mother gets an infection as an intercurrent disease in pregnancy
iatrogenic transmission due to medical procedures such as injection or transplantation of infected material
vector-borne transmission transmitted by a vector which is an organism that does not cause disease itself but that transmits infection by conveying pathogens from one host to another
the relationship between virulence versus transmissibility is complex if a disease is rapidly fatal the host may die before the microbe can be passed along to another host
== diagnosisedit ==
diagnosis of infectious disease sometimes involves identifying an infectious agent either directly or indirectly in practice most minor infectious diseases such as warts cutaneous abscesses respiratory system infections and diarrheal diseases are diagnosed by their clinical presentation and treated without knowledge of the specific causative agent conclusions about the cause of the disease are based upon the likelihood that a patient came in contact with a particular agent the presence of a microbe in a community and other epidemiological considerations given sufficient effort all known infectious agents can be specifically identified the benefits of identification however are often greatly outweighed by the cost as often there is no specific treatment the cause is obvious or the outcome of an infection is benign
diagnosis of infectious disease is nearly always initiated by medical history and physical examination more detailed identification techniques involve the culture of infectious agents isolated from a patient culture allows identification of infectious organisms by examining their microscopic features by detecting the presence of substances produced by pathogens and by directly identifying an organism by its genotype other techniques (such as x-rays cat scans pet scans or nmr) are used to produce images of internal abnormalities resulting from the growth of an infectious agent the images are useful in detection of for example a bone abscess or a spongiform encephalopathy produced by a prion
=== symptomatic diagnosticsedit ===
the diagnosis is aided by the presenting symptoms in any individual with an infectious disease yet it usually needs additional diagnostic techniques to confirm the suspicion some signs are specifically characteristic and indicative of a disease and are called pathognomonic signs but these are rare not all infections are symptomatic
in children the presence of cyanosis rapid breathing poor peripheral perfusion or a petechial rash increases the risk of a serious infection by greater than 5 fold other important indicators include parental concern clinical instinct and temperature greater than 40 c
=== microbial cultureedit ===
microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease in a microbial culture a growth medium is provided for a specific agent a sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium along with copious amounts of water a single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a lawn the size color shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species its specific genetic makeup (its strain) and the environment which supports its growth other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect and then alter or kill in the case of viral identification a region of dead cells results from viral growth and is called a plaque eukaryotic parasites may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent
in the absence of suitable plate culture techniques some microbes require culture within live animals bacteria such as mycobacterium leprae and treponema pallidum can be grown in animals although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs another useful identification method is xenodiagnosis or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent chagas disease is the most significant example because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent trypanosoma cruzi in a patient which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis in this case xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the chagas agent t cruzi an uninfected triatomine bug which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected the bug is later inspected for growth of t cruzi within its gut
=== microscopyedit ===
another principal tool in the diagnosis of infectious disease is microscopy virtually all of the culture techniques discussed above rely at some point on microscopic examination for definitive identification of the infectious agent microscopy may be carried out with simple instruments such as the compound light microscope or with instruments as complex as an electron microscope samples obtained from patients may be viewed directly under the light microscope and can often rapidly lead to identification microscopy is often also used in conjunction with biochemical staining techniques and can be made exquisitely specific when used in combination with antibody based techniques for example the use of antibodies made artificially fluorescent (fluorescently labeled antibodies) can be directed to bind to and identify a specific antigens present on a pathogen a fluorescence microscope is then used to detect fluorescently labeled antibodies bound to internalized antigens within clinical samples or cultured cells this technique is especially useful in the diagnosis of viral diseases where the light microscope is incapable of identifying a virus directly
other microscopic procedures may also aid in identifying infectious agents almost all cells readily stain with a number of basic dyes due to the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged cellular molecules and the positive charge on the dye a cell is normally transparent under a microscope and using a stain increases the contrast of a cell with its background staining a cell with a dye such as giemsa stain or crystal violet allows a microscopist to describe its size shape internal and external components and its associations with other cells the response of bacteria to different staining procedures is used in the taxonomic classification of microbes as well two methods the gram stain and the acid-fast stain are the standard approaches used to classify bacteria and to diagnosis of disease the gram stain identifies the bacterial groups firmicutes and actinobacteria both of which contain many significant human pathogens the acid-fast staining procedure identifies the actinobacterial genera mycobacterium and nocardia
=== biochemical testsedit ===
biochemical tests used in the identification of infectious agents include the detection of metabolic or enzymatic products characteristic of a particular infectious agent since bacteria ferment carbohydrates in patterns characteristic of their genus and species the detection of fermentation products is commonly used in bacterial identification acids alcohols and gases are usually detected in these tests when bacteria are grown in selective liquid or solid media
the isolation of enzymes from infected tissue can also provide the basis of a biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease for example humans can make neither rna replicases nor reverse transcriptase and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic of specific types of viral infections the ability of the viral protein hemagglutinin to bind red blood cells together into a detectable matrix may also be characterized as a biochemical test for viral infection although strictly speaking hemagglutinin is not an enzyme and has no metabolic function
serological methods are highly sensitive specific and often extremely rapid tests used to identify microorganisms these tests are based upon the ability of an antibody to bind specifically to an antigen the antigen usually a protein or carbohydrate made by an infectious agent is bound by the antibody this binding then sets off a chain of events that can be visibly obvious in various ways dependent upon the test for example strep throat is often diagnosed within minutes and is based on the appearance of antigens made by the causative agent s pyogenes that is retrieved from a patients throat with a cotton swab serological tests if available are usually the preferred route of identification however the tests are costly to develop and the reagents used in the test often require refrigeration some serological methods are extremely costly although when commonly used such as with the strep test they can be inexpensive
complex serological techniques have been developed into what are known as immunoassays immunoassays can use the basic antibody antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal which can be detected by some form of instrumentation signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen to aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent for example immunoassay a may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle immunoassay b on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organisms immune system which are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus
instrumentation can be used to read extremely small signals created by secondary reactions linked to the antibody antigen binding instrumentation can control sampling reagent use reaction times signal detection calculation of results and data management to yield a cost effective automated process for diagnosis of infectious disease
=== molecular diagnosticsedit ===
technologies based upon the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method will become nearly ubiquitous gold standards of diagnostics of the near future for several reasons first the catalog of infectious agents has grown to the point that virtually all of the significant infectious agents of the human population have been identified second an infectious agent must grow within the human body to cause disease essentially it must amplify its own nucleic acids in order to cause a disease this amplification of nucleic acid in infected tissue offers an opportunity to detect the infectious agent by using pcr third the essential tools for directing pcr primers are derived from the genomes of infectious agents and with time those genomes will be known if they are not already
thus the technological ability to detect any infectious agent rapidly and specifically are currently available the only remaining blockades to the use of pcr as a standard tool of diagnosis are in its cost and application neither of which is insurmountable the diagnosis of a few diseases will not benefit from the development of pcr methods such as some of the clostridial diseases (tetanus and botulism) these diseases are fundamentally biological poisonings by relatively small numbers of infectious bacteria that produce extremely potent neurotoxins a significant proliferation of the infectious agent does not occur this limits the ability of pcr to detect the presence of any bacteria
=== indication of testsedit ===
there is usually an indication for a specific identification of an infectious agent only when such identification can aid in the treatment or prevention of the disease or to advance knowledge of the course of an illness prior to the development of effective therapeutic or preventative measures for example in the early 1980s prior to the appearance of azt for the treatment of aids the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options in part these studies on the appearance of hiv in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus by understanding how the disease was transmitted resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections the specific serological diagnostic identification and later genotypic or molecular identification of hiv also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins of the virus as well as a myriad of other hypothesis the development of molecular diagnostic tools have enabled physicians and researchers to monitor the efficacy of treatment with anti-retroviral drugs molecular diagnostics are now commonly used to identify hiv in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to hiv infection thus while there still is no cure for aids there is great therapeutic and predictive benefit to identifying the virus and monitoring the virus levels within the blood of infected individuals both for the patient and for the community at large
== preventionedit ==
techniques like hand washing wearing gowns and wearing face masks can help prevent infections from being passed from one person to another frequent hand washing remains the most important defense against the spread of unwanted organisms there are other forms of prevention such as avoiding the use of illicit drugs using a condom and having a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise cooking foods well and avoiding foods that have been left outside for a long time is also important
antimicrobial substances used to prevent transmission of infections include
antiseptics which are applied to living tissue/skin
disinfectants which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects
antibiotics called prophylactic when given as prevention rather as treatment of infection however long term use of antibiotics leads to resistance and chances of developing opportunistic infections like clostridium difficile colitis thus avoiding using antibiotics longer than necessary helps preventing such infectious diseases
one of the ways to prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases is to recognize the different characteristics of various diseases some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence distance traveled by victims and level of contagiousness the human strains of ebola virus for example incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after as a result the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone also this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye thus the initial stage of ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging as a result of the above features the spread of ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area in contrast the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system as a result many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease also the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances increasing the likelihood of an epidemic
another effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of small-world networks in epidemics there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals despite the low interaction between discrete hubs the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub thus infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated (figure 1) however infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs the use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with hiv is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method [6] another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in 2001
a general method to prevent transmission of vector-borne pathogens is pest control
=== immunityedit ===
infection with most pathogens does not result in death of the host and the offending organism is ultimately cleared after the symptoms of the disease have waned this process requires immune mechanisms to kill or inactivate the inoculum of the pathogen specific acquired immunity against infectious diseases may be mediated by antibodies and/or t lymphocytes immunity mediated by these two factors may be manifested by
a direct effect upon a pathogen such as antibody-initiated complement-dependent bacteriolysis opsonoization phagocytosis and killing as occurs for some bacteria
neutralization of viruses so that these organisms cannot enter cells
or by t lymphocytes which will kill a cell parasitized by a microorganism
the immune system response to a microorganism often causes symptoms such as a high fever and inflammation and has the potential to be more devastating than direct damage caused by a microbe
resistance to infection (immunity) may be acquired following a disease by asymptomatic carriage of the pathogen by harboring an organism with a similar structure (crossreacting) or by vaccination knowledge of the protective antigens and specific acquired host immune factors is more complete for primary pathogens than for opportunistic pathogens
immune resistance to an infectious disease requires a critical level of either antigen-specific antibodies and/or t cells when the host encounters the pathogen some individuals develop natural serum antibodies to the surface polysaccharides of some agents although they have had little or no contact with the agent these natural antibodies confer specific protection to adults and are passively transmitted to newborns
==== host genetic factorsedit ====
the clearance of the pathogens either treatment-induced or spontaneous it can be influenced by the genetic variants carried by the individual patients for instance for genotype 1 hepatitis c treated with pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or pegylated interferon-alpha-2b (brand names pegasys or peg-intron) combined with ribavirin it has been shown that genetic polymorphisms near the human il28b gene encoding interferon lambda 3 are associated with significant differences in the treatment-induced clearance of the virus this finding originally reported in nature showed that genotype 1 hepatitis c patients carrying certain genetic variant alleles near the il28b gene are more possibly to achieve sustained virological response after the treatment than others later report from nature demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis c virus
== treatmentsedit ==
when infection attacks the body anti-infective drugs can suppress the infection four types of anti-infective or drugs exist antibacterial (antibiotic) antiviral antitubercular and antifungal depending on the severity and the type of infection the antibiotic may be given by mouth injection or may be applied topically severe infections of the brain are usually treated with intravenous antibiotics sometimes multiple antibiotics are used in case there is resistance to one antibiotic antibiotics only work for bacteria and do not affect viruses antibiotics work by slowing down the multiplication of bacteria or killing the bacteria the most common classes of antibiotics used in medicine include penicillin cephalosporins aminoglycosides macrolides quinolones and tetracyclines
antibiotics have ways of working with your body to fight bacteria and differentiating between the bacteria and healthy human cells still due to the fact that there is little difference in the construction of healthy and bad bacteria antibiotics sometimes kill the healthy bacteria in your body
antimicrobial stewardship is the concept that healthcare providers should treat an infection with an antimicrobial specifically works well for the target pathogen for the shortest amount of time and to only treat when there is a known or highly suspected pathogen that will respond the to the medicationn
== epidemiologyedit ==
in 2010 about 10 million people died of an infectious disease
the world health organization collects information on global deaths by international classification of disease (icd) code categories the following table lists the top infectious disease by number of deaths in 2002 1993 data is included for comparison
the top three single agent/disease killers are hiv/aids tb and malaria while the number of deaths due to nearly every disease have decreased deaths due to hiv/aids have increased fourfold childhood diseases include pertussis poliomyelitis diphtheria measles and tetanus children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory and diarrheal deaths in 2012 approximately 3.1 million people have died due to lower respiratory infections making it the number 4 leading cause of death in the world
=== historic pandemicsedit ===
a pandemic (or global epidemic) is a disease that affects people over an extensive geographical area
plague of justinian from 541 to 750 killed between 50% and 60% of europe's population
the black death of 1347 to 1352 killed 25 million in europe over 5 years the plague reduced the world population from an estimated 450 million to between 350 and 375 million in the 14th century
the introduction of smallpox measles and typhus to the areas of central and south america by european explorers during the 15th and 16th centuries caused pandemics among the native inhabitants between 1518 and 1568 disease pandemics are said to have caused the population of mexico to fall from 20 million to 3 million
the first european influenza epidemic occurred between 1556 and 1560 with an estimated mortality rate of 20%
smallpox killed an estimated 60 million europeans during the 18th century (approximately 400,000 per year) up to 30% of those infected including 80% of the children under 5 years of age died from the disease and one-third of the survivors went blind
in the 19th century tuberculosis killed an estimated one-quarter of the adult population of europe by 1918 one in six deaths in france were still caused by tb
the influenza pandemic of 1918 (or the spanish flu) killed 25-50 million people (about 2% of world population of 1.7 billion) today influenza kills about 250,000 to 500,000 worldwide each year
=== emerging diseasesedit ===
in most cases microorganisms live in harmony with their hosts via mutual or commensal interactions diseases can emerge when existing parasites become pathogenic or when new pathogenic parasites enter a new host
coevolution between parasite and host can lead to hosts becoming resistant to the parasites or the parasites may evolve greater virulence leading to immunopathological disease
human activity is involved with many emerging infectious diseases such as environmental change enabling a parasite to occupy new niches when that happens a pathogen that had been confined to a remote habitat has a wider distribution and possibly a new host organism parasites jumping from nonhuman to human hosts are known as zoonoses under disease invasion when a parasite invades a new host species it may become pathogenic in the new host
several human activities have led to the emergence of zoonotic human pathogens including viruses bacteria protozoa and rickettsia and spread of vector-borne diseases see also globalization and disease and wildlife disease
encroachment on wildlife habitats the construction of new villages and housing developments in rural areas force animals to live in dense populations creating opportunities for microbes to mutate and emerge
changes in agriculture the introduction of new crops attracts new crop pests and the microbes they carry to farming communities exposing people to unfamiliar diseases
the destruction of rain forests as countries make use of their rain forests by building roads through forests and clearing areas for settlement or commercial ventures people encounter insects and other animals harboring previously unknown microorganisms
uncontrolled urbanization the rapid growth of cities in many developing countries tends to concentrate large numbers of people into crowded areas with poor sanitation these conditions foster transmission of contagious diseases
modern transport ships and other cargo carriers often harbor unintended passengers that can spread diseases to faraway destinations while with international jet-airplane travel people infected with a disease can carry it to distant lands or home to their families before their first symptoms appear
== historyedit ==
ideas of contagion became more popular in europe during the renaissance particularly through the writing of the italian physician girolamo fracastoro
anton van leeuwenhoek (16321723) advanced the science of microscopy by being the first to observe microorganisms allowing for easy visualization of bacteria
in the mid-19th century john snow and william budd did important work demonstrating the contagiousness of typhoid and cholera through contaminated water both are credited with decreasing epidemics of cholera in their towns by implementing measures to prevent contamination of water
louis pasteur proved beyond doubt that certain diseases are caused by infectious agents and developed a vaccine for rabies
robert koch provided the study of infectious diseases with a scientific basis known as koch's postulates
edward jenner jonas salk and albert sabin developed effective vaccines for smallpox and polio which would later result in the eradication and near-eradication of these diseases respectively
alexander fleming discovered the world's first antibiotic penicillin which florey and chain then developed
gerhard domagk developed sulphonamides the first broad spectrum synthetic antibacterial drugs
=== medical specialistsedit ===
the medical treatment of infectious diseases falls into the medical field of infectious disease and in some cases the study of propagation pertains to the field of epidemiology generally infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists for example an uncomplicated pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist (lung physician).the work of the infectious diseases specialist therefore entails working with both patients and general practitioners as well as laboratory scientists immunologists bacteriologists and other specialists
an infectious disease team may be alerted when
the disease has not been definitively diagnosed after an initial workup
the patient is immunocompromised (for example in aids or after chemotherapy)
the infectious agent is of an uncommon nature (e.g tropical diseases)
the disease has not responded to first line antibiotics
the disease might be dangerous to other patients and the patient might have to be isolated
== society and cultureedit ==
a number of studies have reported associations between pathogen load in an area and human behavior higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area this may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance other groups which may reduce pathogen transmission or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies which enforce a common culture higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior which may reduce pathogen transmission it also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates higher fertility rates and shorter or less parental care per child is another association which may be a compensation for the higher mortality rate there is also an association with polygyny which may be due to higher pathogen load making selecting males with a high genetic resistance increasingly important higher pathogen load is also associated with more collectivism and less individualism which may limit contacts with outside groups and infections there are alternative explanations for at least some of the associations although some of these explanations may in turn ultimately be due to pathogen load thus polygny may also be due to a lower male:female ratio in these areas but this may ultimately be due to male infants having increased mortality from infectious diseases another example is that poor socioeconomic factors may ultimately in part be due to high pathogen load preventing economic development
== fossil recordedit ==
evidence of infection in fossil remains is a subject of interest for paleopathologists scientists who study occurrences of injuries and illness in extinct life forms signs of infection have been discovered in the bones of carnivorous dinosaurs when present however these infections seem to tend to be confined to only small regions of the body a skull attributed to the early carnivorous dinosaur herrerasaurus ischigualastensis exhibits pit-like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous bone the unusual texture of the bone around the wounds suggests they were afflicted by a short-lived non-lethal infection scientists who studied the skull speculated that the bite marks were received in a fight with another herrerasaurus other carnivorous dinosaurs with documented evidence of infection include acrocanthosaurus allosaurus tyrannosaurus and a tyrannosaur from the kirtland formation the infections from both tyrannosaurs were received by being bitten during a fight like the herrerasaurus specimen
