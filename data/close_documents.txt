invertebrates animals neither possess develop vertebral columnspinal cord derived notochord includes animals apart subphylum vertebrata familiar examples invertebrates include insects crabs lobsters kin snails clams octopuses kin starfish seaurchins kin worms
majority animal species invertebrates one estimate puts figure many invertebrate taxa greater number variety species entire subphylum vertebrata
socalled invertebrates chaetognatha hemichordata tunicata cephalochordata closely related vertebrates invertebrates makes term invertebrate almost meaningless taxonomic purposes
etymology
word invertebrate comes form latin word vertebra means joint general sometimes specifically joint spinal column vertebrate turn jointed aspect vertebra derived concept turning expressed root verto vorto turn coupled prefix meaning without
taxonomic significance
term invertebrates always precise among nonbiologists since accurately describe taxon way arthropoda vertebrata manidae terms describes valid taxon phylum subphylum family invertebrata term convenience taxon little circumscriptional significance except within chordata vertebrata subphylum comprises small proportion metazoa speak kingdom animalia terms vertebrata invertebrata limited practicality formal taxonomy animalia attributes logically precede presence absence vertebral column constructing cladogram example presence notochord would least circumscribe chordata however even notochord would less fundamental criterion aspects embryological development symmetry perhaps bauplan
invertebrates dont skeleton bone either internal external include hugely varied body plans many fluidfilled hydrostatic skeletons like jellyfish worms others hard exoskeletons outer shells like insects crustaceans familiar invertebrates include protozoa porifera coelenterata platyhelminthes nematoda annelida echinodermata mollusca arthropoda arthropoda include insects crustaceans arachnids
number extant species
far largest number described invertebrate species insects following table lists number described extant species major invertebrate group estimated iucn red list threatened species
iucn estimates extant vertebrate species described means described animal species world invertebrates
characteristics
trait common invertebrates absence vertebral column creates distinction invertebrates vertebrates distinction one convenience based clear biologically homologous trait common trait wings functionally unites insects bats birds wings unites tortoises snails sponges animals invertebrates heterotrophs require sustenance form consumption organisms exceptions porifera invertebrates generally bodies composed differentiated tissues also typically digestive chamber one two openings exterior
morphology
gastropods asymmetrical easily seen snails sea snails helical shells first glance slugs appear externally symmetrical pneumostome breathing hole always right side origin asymmetry gastropods subject scientific debate gastropods develop external asymmetry glaucus atlanticus develops asymmetrical cerata mature
fiddler crabs hermit crabs one claw much larger male fiddler loses large claw grow another opposite side moulting sessile animals sponges asymmetrical
corals build colonies symmetrical individual polyps exhibit radial symmetry
alpheidae feature asymmetrical claws lack pincers
certain polyopisthocotylean monogeneans asymmetrical adaptation attachment gill fish hosts certain parasitic copepods live inside gill chamber fish hosts asymmetrical
nervous system
neurons differ invertebrates mammalian cells invertebrates cells fire response similar stimuli mammals tissue trauma high temperature changes ph first invertebrate neuron cell identified medicinal leech hirudo medicinalis
learning memory using nociceptors sea hare aplysia described mollusk neurons able detect increasing pressures tissue trauma
neurons identified wide range invertebrate species including annelids molluscs nematodes arthropods
respiratory system
one type invertebrate respiriatory system open respiratory system composed spiracles tracheae tracheoles terrestrial arthropods transport metabolic gases tissues distribution spiracles vary greatly among many orders insects general segment body one pair spiracles connects atrium relatively large tracheal tube behind tracheae invaginations cuticular exoskeleton branch anastomose throughout body diameters micrometres mm smallest tubes tracheoles penetrate cells serve sites diffusion water oxygen carbon dioxide gas may conducted respiratory system means active ventilation passive diffusion unlike vertebrates insects generally carry oxygen haemolymph
tracheal tube may contain ridgelike circumferential rings taenidia various geometries loops helices head thorax abdomen tracheae may also connected air sacs many insects grasshoppers bees actively pump air sacs abdomen able control flow air body aquatic insects tracheae exchange gas body wall directly form gill function essentially normal via plastron note despite internal tracheae arthropods shed moulting ecdysis
reproduction
like vertebrates invertebrates reproduce least partly sexual reproduction produce specialized reproductive cells undergo meiosis produce smaller motile spermatozoa larger nonmotile ova fuse form zygotes develop new individuals others capable asexual reproduction sometimes methods reproduction
social interaction
social behavior widespread invertebrates including cockroaches termites aphids thrips ants bees passalidae acari spiders social interaction particularly salient eusocial species applies invertebrates well
insects recognize information transmitted insects
phyla
term invertebrates covers several phyla one sponges porifera long thought diverged animals early lack complex organization found phyla cells differentiated cases organized distinct tissues sponges typically feed drawing water pores speculate sponges primitive may instead secondarily simplified ctenophora cnidaria includes sea anemones corals jellyfish radially symmetric digestive chambers single opening serves mouth anus distinct tissues organized organs two main germ layers ectoderm endoderm scattered cells sometimes called diploblastic
echinodermata radially symmetric exclusively marine including starfish asteroidea sea urchins echinoidea brittle stars ophiuroidea sea cucumbers holothuroidea feather stars crinoidea
largest animal phylum also included within invertebrates arthropoda including insects spiders crabs kin organisms body divided repeating segments typically paired appendages addition possess hardened exoskeleton periodically shed growth two smaller phyla onychophora tardigrada close relatives arthropods share traits nematoda roundworms perhaps second largest animal phylum also invertebrates roundworms typically microscopic occur nearly every environment water number important parasites smaller phyla related kinorhyncha priapulida loricifera groups reduced coelom called pseudocoelom invertebrates include nemertea ribbon worms sipuncula
another phylum platyhelminthes flatworms originally considered primitive appears developed complex ancestors flatworms acoelomates lacking body cavity closest relatives microscopic gastrotricha rotifera rotifers common aqueous environments invertebrates also include acanthocephala spinyheaded worms gnathostomulida micrognathozoa cycliophora
also included two successful animal phyla mollusca annelida former secondlargest animal phylum number described species includes animals snails clams squids latter comprises segmented worms earthworms leeches two groups long considered close relatives common presence trochophore larvae annelids considered closer arthropods segmented generally considered convergent evolution owing many morphological genetic differences two phyla
among lesser phyla invertebrates hemichordata acorn worms chaetognatha arrow worms phyla include acoelomorpha brachiopoda bryozoa entoprocta phoronida xenoturbellida

word organic historical dating st century many centuries western alchemists believed vitalism theory certain compounds could synthesized classical elementsearth water air fireby action lifeforce vis vitalis organisms possessed vitalism taught organic compounds fundamentally different inorganic compounds could obtained elements chemical manipulation
vitalism survived even rise modern atomic theory replacement aristotelian elements know today first came question friedrich whler synthesized oxalic acid compound known occur living organisms cyanogen decisive experiment whlers synthesis urea inorganic salts potassium cyanate ammonium sulfate urea long considered organic compound known occur urine living organisms whlers experiments followed many others increasingly complex organic substances produced inorganic ones without involvement living organism
modern classificationedit
even though vitalism discredited scientific nomenclature retains distinction organic inorganic compounds modern meaning organic compound compound contains significant amount carboneven though many organic compounds known today connection substance found living organisms
single official definition organic compound textbooks define organic compound one contains one ch bonds others include cc bonds definition others state molecule contains carbonit organic
even broader definition carboncontaining molecules requires exclusion carboncontaining alloys including steel relatively small number carboncontaining compounds metal carbonates carbonyls simple oxides carbon cyanides well allotropes carbon simple carbon halides sulfides usually considered inorganic
ch definition excludes compounds historically practically considered organic neither urea oxalic acid organic definition yet two key compounds vitalism debate iupac blue book organic nomenclature specifically mentions urea oxalic acid compounds lacking ch bonds also traditionally considered organic include benzenehexol mesoxalic acid carbon tetrachloride mellitic acid contains ch bonds considered possible organic substance martian soil cc bonds found organic compounds except small molecules like methane methanol one carbon atom structure
ch bondonly rule also leads somewhat arbitrary divisions sets carbonfluorine compounds example teflon considered rule inorganic whereas tefzel considered organic likewise many halons considered inorganic whereas rest considered organic reasons sources believe ch compounds subset organic compounds
summary carboncontaining compounds organic almost organic compounds contain least ch bond cc bond compound need contain ch bonds considered organic eg urea many organic compounds
