adenosine (usan ban) (brand names adenocard adenocor adenic adenoco adeno-jec adenoscan adenosin adrekar krenosin former developmental code name sr-96225) is a purine nucleoside which is found endogenously composed of a molecule of adenine attached to a ribose sugar molecule (ribofuranose) moiety via a -n9-glycosidic bond adenosine plays an important role in biochemical processes such as energy transfer as adenosine triphosphate (atp) and adenosine diphosphate (adp) as well as in signal transduction as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) it is also a neuromodulator believed to play a role in promoting sleep and suppressing arousal adenosine also plays a role in regulation of blood flow to various organs through vasodilation
adenosine is used as a medication specifically as an antiarrhythmic agent to treat a number of supraventricular tachycardia that do not improve with vagal maneuvers common side effects include chest pain feeling faint shortness of breath and tingling serious side effects include a worsening dysrhythmia and low blood pressure it appears to be safe in pregnancy
== medical usesedit ==
=== diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardiaedit ===
when it is administered intravenously adenosine causes transient heart block in the atrioventricular (av) node this is mediated via the a1 receptor inhibiting adenylyl cyclase reducing camp and so causing cell hyperpolarization by increasing inward k+ flux via inward rectifier k+ channels subsequently inhibiting ca2+ current it also causes endothelial-dependent relaxation of smooth muscle as is found inside the artery walls this causes dilation of the normal segments of arteries i.e where the endothelium is not separated from the tunica media by atherosclerotic plaque this feature allows physicians to use adenosine to test for blockages in the coronary arteries by exaggerating the difference between the normal and abnormal segments
in individuals suspected of suffering from a supraventricular tachycardia (svt) adenosine is used to help identify the rhythm
=== antiarrhythmic agentedit ===
certain svts can be successfully terminated with adenosine this includes any re-entrant arrhythmias that require the av node for the re-entry e.g. av reentrant tachycardia (avrt) av nodal reentrant tachycardia (avnrt) in addition atrial tachycardia can sometimes be terminated with adenosine
fast rhythms of the heart that are confined to the atria (e.g. atrial fibrillation atrial flutter) or ventricles (e.g. monomorphic ventricular tachycardia) and do not involve the av node as part of the re-entrant circuit are not typically converted by adenosine however the ventricular response rate is temporarily slowed with adenosine in such cases
because of the effects of adenosine on av node-dependent svts adenosine is considered a class v antiarrhythmic agent when adenosine is used to cardiovert an abnormal rhythm it is normal for the heart to enter ventricular asystole for a few seconds this can be disconcerting to a normally conscious patient and is associated with angina-like sensations in the chest
=== thallium stress testedit ===
adenosine is used an adjunct to thallous (thallium) chloride ti 201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (thallium stress test) in patients unable to undergo adequate stress testing with exercise
=== dosageedit ===
when given for the evaluation or treatment of a supraventricular tachycardia (svt) the initial dose is 6 mg given as a rapid parenteral infusion due to adenosine's extremely short half-life the iv line is started as proximal (near) to the heart as possible such as the antecubital fossa the iv push is often followed with an immediate flush of 10-20 ccs of saline if this has no effect (i.e. no evidence of transient av block) a dose of 12 mg can be given 12 minutes after the first dose some clinicians may prefer to administer a higher dose (typically 18 mg) rather than repeat a dose that apparently had no effect when given to dilate the arteries such as in a stress test the dosage is typically 0.14 mg/kg/min administered for 4 or 6 minutes depending on the protocol
the recommended dose may be increased in patients on theophylline since methylxanthines prevent binding of adenosine at receptor sites the dose is often decreased in patients on dipyridamole (persantine) and diazepam (valium) because adenosine potentiates the effects of these drugs the recommended dose is also reduced by half in patients presenting congestive heart failure myocardial infarction shock hypoxia and/or hepatic or renal insufficiency and in elderly patients
== drug interactionsedit ==
dopamine may precipitate toxicity in the patient carbamazepine may increase heart block dipyridamole potentiates the action of adenosine requiring the use of lower doses
theophylline and caffeine (methylxanthines) competitively antagonize adenosine's effects an increased dose of adenosine may be required by nature of caffeine's purine structure it binds to some of the same receptors as adenosine with the proviso that theophylline and theobromine cross the blood-brain barrier very poorly (thus a low cns effects on the heart) the pharmacological effects of adenosine may therefore be blunted in individuals taking large quantities of methylxanthines (e.g. caffeine found in coffee or theophylline in tea or theobromine as found in chocolate)
== contraindicationsedit ==
common contraindications for adenosine are
second- or third-degree heart block (without a pacemaker)
sick sinus syndrome (without a pacemaker)
long qt syndrome
severe hypotension
decompensated heart failure
asthma traditionally considered an absolute ci this is being contended and it is now considered a relative ci (however selective adenosine antagonists are being investigated for use in treatment of asthma)
poison/drug-induced tachycardia
when administered via a central lumen catheter adenosine has been shown to initiate atrial fibrillation because of its effect on atrial tissue in individuals with accessory pathways the onset of atrial fibrillation can lead to a life-threatening ventricular fibrillation however adenosine may be administered if equipment for cardioversion is immediately available as a backup
== side-effectsedit ==
many individuals experience facial flushing a temporary rash on the chest lightheadedness diaphoresis or nausea after administration of adenosine due to its vasodilatory effects metallic taste is a hallmark side-effect of adenosine administration these symptoms are transitory usually lasting less than one minute it is classically associated with a sense of impending doom more prosaically described as apprehension this lasts a few seconds after administration of a bolus dose during transient asystole induced by intravenous administration in some cases adenosine can make patients limbs feel numb for about 25 minutes after administration intravenously depending on the dosage (usually above 12 mg)
== pharmacological effectsedit ==
adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that modulates many physiological processes cellular signaling by adenosine occurs through four known adenosine receptor subtypes (a1 a2a a2b and a3)
extracellular adenosine concentrations from normal cells are approximately 300 nm however in response to cellular damage (e.g in inflammatory or ischemic tissue) these concentrations are quickly elevated (6001,200 nm) thus in regard to stress or injury the function of adenosine is primarily that of cytoprotection preventing tissue damage during instances of hypoxia ischemia and seizure activity activation of a2a receptors produces a constellation of responses that in general can be classified as anti-inflammatory
in the us adenosine is marketed as adenocard in india adenosine is sold as adenoscan (cipla)
=== adenosine receptorsedit ===
all adenosine receptor subtypes (a1 a2a a2b and a3) are g-protein-coupled receptors the four receptor subtypes are further classified based on their ability to either stimulate or inhibit adenylate cyclase activity the a1 receptors couple to gi/o and decreases camp levels while the a2 adenosine receptors couple to gs which stimulates adenylate cyclase activity in addition a1 receptors couple to go which has been reported to mediate adenosine inhibition of ca2+ conductance whereas a2b and a3 receptors also couple to gq and stimulate phospholipase activity researchers at cornell university have recently shown adenosine receptors to be key in opening the blood-brain barrier (bbb) mice dosed with adenosine have shown increased transport across the bbb of amyloid plaque antibodies and prodrugs associated with parkinson's disease alzheimer's multiple sclerosis and cancers of the central nervous system
=== ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptoredit ===
adenosine is an endogenous agonist of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor however while it is able to increase appetite unlike other agonists of this receptor adenosine is unable to induce the secretion of growth hormone and increase its plasma levels
== metabolismedit ==
adenosine used as a second messenger can be the result of de novo purine biosynthesis via adenosine monophosphate (amp) though it is possible other pathways exist
when adenosine enters the circulation it is broken down by adenosine deaminase which is present in red cells and the vessel wall
dipyridamole an inhibitor of adenosine nucleotide transporter allows adenosine to accumulate in the blood stream this causes an increase in coronary vasodilatation
adenosine deaminase deficiency is a known cause of immunodeficiency

=== virusesedit ===
the adenosine analog nitd008 has been reported to directly inhibit the recombinant rna-dependent rna polymerase of the dengue virus by terminating its rna chain synthesis this suppresses peak viremia and rise in cytokines and prevented infected animal from death raising the possibility of a new treatment for this flavivirus the 7-deaza-adenosine analog has been shown to inhibit the replication of the hepatitis c virus bcx4430 is protective against ebola and marburg viruses such adenosine analogs are potentially clinically useful since they can be taken orally
=== anti-inflammatory propertiesedit ===
adenosine is believed to be an anti-inflammatory agent at the a2a receptor topical treatment of adenosine to foot wounds in diabetes mellitus has been shown in lab animals to drastically increase tissue repair and reconstruction topical administration of adenosine for use in wound-healing deficiencies and diabetes mellitus in humans is currently under clinical investigation
methotrexate's anti-inflammatory effect may be due to its stimulation of adenosine release
=== central nervous systemedit ===
in general adenosine has an inhibitory effect in the central nervous system (cns) caffeine's stimulatory effects are credited primarily (although not entirely) to its capacity to block adenosine receptors thereby reducing the inhibitory tonus of adenosine in the cns this reduction in adenosine activity leads to increased activity of the neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate experimental evidence suggests that adenosine and adenosine agonists can activate trk receptor phosphorylation through a mechanism that requires the adenosine a2a receptor
=== hairedit ===
adenosine has been shown to promote thickening of hair on people with thinning hair a 2013 study compared topical adenosine to minoxidil for in male androgenetic alopecia finding it was not superior to minoxidil and further trials were needed
