== injury risksedit ==
in addition to injuries from falling and from back strains (some of which may be serious) catastrophic injuries may occur such as finger hand or even arm amputations amputations or avulsions may result from two causes looping or wrapping the rope around a hand or wrist and impact from elastic recoil if the rope breaks amateur organizers of tugs of war may underestimate the forces generated or overestimate the breaking strength of common ropes and may thus be unaware of the possible consequences if a rope snaps under extreme tension the broken ends of a rope made with a somewhat elastic polymer such as common nylon can reach high speeds and can easily sever fingers for this reason specially engineered tug of war ropes exist that can safely withstand the forces generated
