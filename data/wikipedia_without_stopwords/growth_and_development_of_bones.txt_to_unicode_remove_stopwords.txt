pseudoachondroplasia also known psach pseudoachondroplastic dysplasia pseudoachondroplastic spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia syndrome osteochondrodysplasia results mild severely short stature due inhibition skeletal growth primarily limbs comp though similarities nomenclature may cause confusion pseudoachondroplasia confused achondroplasia clinically genetically distinct skeletal dysplasia francomano allele involved disorder identified comp inherited autosomal dominant omim
phenotype
disorder characterized notably short stature average height adult males condition around centimeters ft adult females typically around cm ft affected individuals noticeably short birth though two years age growth rate typically falls standard growth curve affected disorder normal facial features head size intelligence briggs et al
characteristic features pseudoachondroplasia include short limbs waddling gait earlyonset joint pain caused osteoarthritis limited range motion elbows hips affected individuals also display short fingers loose joints loose ligaments deformity legs bowing radiography skeletons patients disorder reveal abnormal growth development long bones delayed bone formation long bones vertebral column results deformation vertebrae individuals may even develop abnormal curvatures spine scoliosis lordosis childhood briggs et al
inheritance
pseudoachondroplasia inherited autosomal dominant manner though one case rare autosomal recessive form documented offspring affected individuals risk inheriting mutant allele prenatal testing molecular genetic examination available diseasecausing mutation identified affected family member hecht et al
molecular biology
comp gene located chromosome p precise locus p comp contains exons cartilage oligomeric matrix protein aa omim comp protein found extracellular matrix complex web proteins molecules form spaces cells make ligaments tendons also found near chondrocytes cartilageforming cells chondrocytes play vital role osteogenesis formation bone particularly spine hips limbs osteogenesis begins formation cartilage calcified transformed bone yet fully understand normal function comp protein though believed play part cellular growth division apoptosis selfdestruction cells well participating regulation cell movement attachment omim
nearly mutations comp gene identified individuals pseudoachondroplasia however mutation responsible common allele deletion one codon within short triplet repeat gac th amino acid aspartic acid deleted omim
diagnosis
plasma comp levels significantly reduced patients comp mutations pseudoachondroplasia measuring plasma comp levels become reliable means diagnosing pathopysiologically similar disorders measuring level circulating comp proven efficient effective method diagnosing pseudoachondroplasia suri et al
pathophysiology
comp extracellular calcium binding protein directly involved chondrocyte migration proliferation observed high frequency chondrocytes developing bone tendon pseudochondroplasia comp secreted instead collects chondrocytes ultimately poisoning killing though chondrocytes manage survive growth significantly reduced resulting characteristically short limbs seemingly unaffected face torso inflicted disorder omim mutations comp result phenotypic spectrum varies pseudochondroplasia extreme end multiple epiphyseal dysplasia med genetically similar though milder skeletal dysplasia omim
studies conducted hetch et al suggest type ix collagen collagen active specifically construction cartilage plays key role pseudoachondroplasia researchers found ix collagen amassed within pseudoachondroplasia chondrocytes discovery suggests pathogenesis pseudoachondroplasia involves interactions mutant comp gene products specific cartilage components type ix collagen solely result effects mutant molecules production secretion comp omim
treatment
currently cure pseudoachondroplasia however management various health problems result disorder includes medications analgesics painkillers joint discomfort osteotomy lower limb deformities surgical treatment scoliosis prevention related health problems includes physical therapy preserve joint flexibility regular examinations detect degenerative joint disease neurological manifestations particularly spinal cord compression additionally healthcare providers recommend treatment psychosocial issues related short stature physical deformities affected individuals families omim
epidemiology
pseudoachondroplasia one common skeletal dysplasias affecting racial groups however precise incidence figures currently available suri et al
history
gene responsible pseudoachondroplasia identified research team led dr jacqueline hecht university texashouston health science center discovery additionally shed light comp protein team recognized somehow involved skeletal growth height determination hetch et al
hetch colleagues research department shriners hospital children portland oregon conducted research led discovery intracellular fate mutant comp determined environment individual chondrocytes contrary previous notion comp activities leading pseudoachondroplasia determined structural effects mutation comp meant comp activities cellspecific hetch et al
hetch et al also discovered type ix collagen accumulated within pseudoachondroplasia chondrocytes discovery indicated pathogenesis pseudoachondroplasia results interactions products mutant comp allele certain cartilage components particularly type ix collagen hetch et al
