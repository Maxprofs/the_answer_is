lethality
electrocution
term electrocution coined time first use electric chair originally referred electrical execution accidental suicidal electrical deaths however since english word available nonjudicial deaths due electric shock word electrocution eventually took description circumstances electrical death
factors lethality electric shock
lethality electric shock dependent several variables
current higher current likely lethal since current proportional voltage resistance fixed ohms law high voltage indirect risk producing higher currents
duration longer duration likely lethalsafety switches may limit time current flow
pathway current flows heart muscle likely lethal
high voltage volts addition greater current flow high voltage may cause dielectric breakdown skin thus lowering skin resistance allowing increased current flow
issues affecting lethality frequency issue causing cardiac arrest muscular spasms high frequency electric current causes tissue burning penetrate body far enough cause cardiac arrest see electrosurgery also important pathway current passes chest head increased chance death main circuit power distribution panel damage likely internal leading cardiac arrest another factor cardiac tissue chronaxie response time milliseconds electricity frequencies higher hz requires current cause fibrillation required lower frequencies
comparison dangers alternating current typical power transmission frequences ie hz direct current subject debate ever since war currents animal experiments conducted time suggested alternating current twice dangerous direct current per unit current flow per unit applied voltage
sometimes suggested human lethality common alternating current volts however death occurred range supplies low volts assuming steady current flow opposed shock capacitor static electricity shocks volts often fatal volts usually fatal shocks voltages volts almost invariably fatal however harry f mcgrew came direct contact volt transmission line huntington canyon utah survived according guinness book world records largest known electric shock survived brian latasa also survived volt shock griffith park los angeles according guinness
