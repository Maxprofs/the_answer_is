=== perception ===
the perception of darkness differs from the mere absence of light due to the effects of after images on perception in perceiving the eye is active and that part of the retina that is unstimulated produces a complementary afterimage
=== physics ===
in terms of physics an object is said to be dark when it absorbs photons causing it to appear dim compared to other objects for example a matte black paint does not reflect much visible light and appears dark whereas white paint reflects much light and appears bright for more information see color
light cannot be absorbed without limit according to the principle of the conservation of energy energy cannot be created or destroyed it can only be converted from one type to another consequently most objects that absorb visible light reemit it as heat so although an object may appear dark it is likely bright at a frequency that humans cannot perceive for more information see thermodynamics
a dark area has limited light sources making things hard to see exposure to alternating light and darkness (night and day) has caused several evolutionary adaptations to darkness when a vertebrate like a human enters a dark area its pupils dilate allowing more light to enter the eye and improving night vision also the light detecting cells in the human eye (rods and cones) will regenerate more unbleached rhodopsin when adapting to darkness
one scientific measure of darkness is the bortle dark-sky scale which indicates the night sky's and stars brightness at a particular location and the observability of celestial objects at that location (see also sky brightness)
=== technical ===

artists use darkness to emphasize and contrast the presence of light darkness can be used as a counterpoint to areas of lightness to create leading lines and voids such shapes draw the eye around areas of the painting shadows add depth and perspective to a painting see chiaroscuro for a discussion of the uses of such contrasts in visual media
color paints are mixed together to create darkness because each color absorbs certain frequencies of light theoretically mixing together the three primary colors or the three secondary colors will absorb all visible light and create black in practice it is difficult to prevent the mixture from taking on a brown tint
