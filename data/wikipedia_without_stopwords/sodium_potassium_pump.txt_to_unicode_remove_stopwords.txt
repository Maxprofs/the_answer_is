nakatpase helps maintain resting potential effect transport regulate cellular volume also functions signal transducerintegrator regulate mapk pathway ros well intracellular calcium animal cells nakatpase responsible cells energy expenditure neurons nakatpase responsible cells energy expenditure
resting potential

mechanism
pump binding atp binds intracellular na ions
atp hydrolyzed leading phosphorylation pump highly conserved aspartate residue subsequent release adp
conformational change pump exposes na ions outside phosphorylated form pump low affinity na ions released
pump binds extracellular k ions causes dephosphorylation pump reverting previous conformational state transporting k ions cell
unphosphorylated form pump higher affinity na ions k ions two bound k ions released atp binds process starts
regulation
endogenous

note early studies indicated opposite effect later found inaccurate due additional complicating factors
exogenous
nakatpase pharmacologically modified administrating drugs exogenously
instance nakatpase found membrane heart cells important target cardiac glycosides example digoxin ouabain inotropic drugs used improve heart performance increasing force contraction
muscle contraction dependent timeshigherthanresting intracellular ca concentration caused ca release muscle cells sarcoplasmic reticulum immediately muscle contraction intracellular ca quickly returned normal concentration carrier enzyme plasma membrane calcium pump sarcoplasmic reticulum causing muscle relax
since carrier enzyme naca translocator uses na gradient generated nak pump remove ca intracellular space slowing nak pump results permanently elevated ca level muscle may mechanism longterm inotropic effect cardiac glycosides digoxin
