human skeleton internal framework body composed bones birth total decreases bones adulthood bones fused together bone mass skeleton reaches maximum density around age human skeleton divided axial skeleton appendicular skeleton axial skeleton formed vertebral column rib cage skull associated bones appendicular skeleton attached axial skeleton formed pectoral girdle pelvic girdle bones upper lower limbs
human skeleton serves six major functions support movement protection production blood cells storage ions endocrine regulation
human skeleton sexually dimorphic many primate species subtle differences sexes morphology skull dentition long bones pelves exist general female skeletal elements tend smaller less robust corresponding male elements within given population human female pelvis also different males order facilitate child birth unlike primates human males penile bones
divisionsedit
axial skeletonedit
axial skeleton bones formed vertebral column bones number vertebrae differs human human lower parts sacral coccygeal bone may vary length part rib cage pairs ribs sternum skull bones associated bones
upright posture humans maintained axial skeleton transmits weight head trunk upper extremities lower extremities hip joints bones spine supported many ligaments erector spinae muscles also supporting useful balance
human able survive axial portion skeleton
appendicular skeletonedit
appendicular skeleton bones formed pectoral girdles upper limbs pelvic girdle pelvis lower limbs functions make locomotion possible protect major organs digestion excretion reproduction
functionsedit
skeleton serves six major functions support movement protection production blood cells storage minerals endocrine regulation
supportedit
skeleton provides framework supports body maintains shape pelvis associated ligaments muscles provide floor pelvic structures without rib cages costal cartilages intercostal muscles lungs would collapse
movementedit
joints bones allow movement allowing wider range movement others eg ball socket joint allows greater range movement pivot joint neck movement powered skeletal muscles attached skeleton various sites bones muscles bones joints provide principal mechanics movement coordinated nervous system
believed reduction human bone density prehistoric times reduced agility dexterity human movement shifting hunting agriculture caused human bone density reduce significantly
protectionedit
skeleton helps protect many vital internal organs damaged
skull protects brain
vertebrae protect spinal cord
rib cage spine sternum protect lungs heart major blood vessels
blood cell productionedit
skeleton site haematopoiesis development blood cells takes place bone marrow children haematopoiesis occurs primarily marrow long bones femur tibia adults occurs mainly pelvis cranium vertebrae sternum
storageedit
bone matrix store calcium involved calcium metabolism bone marrow store iron ferritin involved iron metabolism however bones entirely made calcium mixture chondroitin sulfate hydroxyapatite latter making bone hydroxyapatite turn composed calcium oxygen phosphorus hydrogen mass chondroitin sulfate sugar made primarily oxygen carbon
endocrine regulationedit
bone cells release hormone called osteocalcin contributes regulation blood sugar glucose fat deposition osteocalcin increases insulin secretion sensitivity addition boosting number insulinproducing cells reducing stores fat
sex differencesedit
anatomical differences human males females highly pronounced soft tissue areas tend limited skeleton human skeleton sexually dimorphic many primate species subtle differences sexes morphology skull dentition long bones pelves sing pelvis exhibited across human populations general female skeletal elements tend smaller less robust corresponding male elements within given population
skulledit
variety gross morphological traits human skull demonstrate sexual dimorphism nuchal crest mastoid processes supraorbital margin supraorbital ridge mental eminence
dentitionedit
human intersex dental dimorphism centers canines nearly pronounced great apes
long bonesedit
long bones generally larger males females within given population muscle attachment sites long bones often robust males females reflecting difference overall muscle mass development sexes sexual dimorphism long bones commonly characterized morphometric gross morphological analyses
pelvisedit
human pelves exhibit greater sexual dimorphism bones specifically size shape pelvic cavity ilia greater sciatic notches subpubic angle phenice method commonly used determine sex unidentified human skeleton anthropologists accuracy populations
disordersedit
many classified skeletal disorders one common osteoporosis also common scoliosis sidetoside curve back spine often creating pronounced c shape viewed xray spine condition apparent adolescence common females
arthritisedit
arthritis disorder joints involves inflammation one joints affected arthritis joint joints affected may painful move may move unusual directions may immobile completely symptoms arthritis vary differently types arthritis common form arthritis osteoarthritis affect larger smaller joints human skeleton cartilage affected joints degrade soften wear away decreases mobility joints decreases space bones cartilage
osteoporosisedit
osteoporosis disease bone reduced bone mineral density increasing likelihood fractures osteoporosis defined world health organization women bone mineral density standard deviations peak bone mass relative age sexmatched average measured dual energy xray absorptiometry term established osteoporosis including presence fragility fracture osteoporosis common women menopause called postmenopausal osteoporosis may develop men premenopausal women presence particular hormonal disorders chronic diseases result smoking medications specifically glucocorticoids osteoporosis usually symptoms fracture occurs reason dexa scans often done people one risk factors developed osteoporosis risk fracture
osteoporosis treatment includes advice stop smoking decrease alcohol consumption exercise regularly healthy diet calcium supplements may also advised may vitamin d medication used may include bisphosphonates strontium ranelate osteoporosis may one factor considered commencing hormone replacement therapy
