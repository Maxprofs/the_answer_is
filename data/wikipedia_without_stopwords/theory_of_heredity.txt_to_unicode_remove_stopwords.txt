backgroundedit
chromosome theory inheritance credited papers walter sutton well independent work theodor boveri roughly period boveri studying sea urchins found chromosomes present proper embryonic development take place suttons work grasshoppers showed chromosomes occur matched pairs maternal paternal chromosomes separate meiosis may constitute physical basis mendelian law heredity

verificationedit
proposal chromosomes carried factors mendelian inheritance initially controversial gained strong support eleanor carothers documented definitive evidence independent assortment chromosomes species grasshopper debate continued however thomas hunt morgans work inheritance genetic linkage fruit fly drosophila melanogaster provided incontrovertible evidence proposal unifying theory stated inheritance patterns may generally explained assuming genes located specific sites chromosomes
