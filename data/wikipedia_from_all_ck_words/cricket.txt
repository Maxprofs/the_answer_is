cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players each on a field at the centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch the game is played by 120 million players in many countries making it the world's second most popular sport each team takes its turn to bat attempting to score runs while the other team fields each turn is known as an innings (used for both singular and plural)
the bowler delivers the ball to the batsman who attempts to hit the ball with his bat away from the fielders so he can run to the other end of the pitch and score a run each batsman continues batting until he is out the batting team continues batting until ten batsmen are out or a specified number of overs of six balls have been bowled at which point the teams switch roles and the fielding team comes in to bat
in professional cricket the length of a game ranges from 20 overs per side to test cricket played over five days the laws of cricket are maintained by the international cricket council (icc) and the marylebone cricket club (mcc) with additional standard playing conditions for test matches and one day internationals
cricket is generally believed to have been first played in southern england in the 16th century by the end of the 18th century it had become the national sport of england the expansion of the british empire led to cricket being played overseas and by the mid-19th century the first international match was held icc the game's governing body has 10 full members the game is most popular in australasia england the indian subcontinent the west indies and southern africa
== etymology ==
a number of words have been suggested as sources for the term cricket in the earliest definite reference to the sport in 1598 it is called creckett
one possible source for the name is the old english cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff in samuel johnson's dictionary he derived cricket from cryce saxon a stick in old french the word criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick
given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east england and the county of flanders when the latter belonged to the duchy of burgundy the name may have been derived from the middle dutch krick(-e) meaning a stick (crook)
another possible source is the middle dutch word krickstoel meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket
according to heiner gillmeister a european language expert of bonn university cricket derives from the middle dutch phrase for hockey met de (krik ket)sen (i.e. with the stick chase") dr gillmeister believes that not only the name but the sport itself is of flemish origin
== history ==
early cricket was at some time or another described as a club striking a ball (like) the ancient games of club-ball stool-ball trap-ball stob-ball cricket can definitely be traced back to tudor times in early 16th-century england
written evidence exists of a game known as creag being played by prince edward the son of edward i (longshanks) at newenden kent in 1301 and there has been speculation but no evidence that this was a form of cricket
the earliest written evidence of the game of cricket may date back to france in a letter written to king louis xi in 1478 by a man named estiavannet he described a game being played by the villagers of liettres (french flanders) involving boules (balls) and croquet (a wooden post) however this could have been a different game entirely such as croquet the earliest definite reference to cricket being played dates back to evidence given at a 1598 court case which mentions that creckett was played on common land in guildford surrey around 1550 the court in guildford heard on monday 17 january 1597 (julian date equating to the year 1598 in the gregorian calendar) from a 59-year-old coroner john derrick who gave witness that when he was a scholar at the free school at guildford fifty years earlier hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play [on the common land] at creckett and other plaies.
it is believed that it was originally a children's game but references around 1610 indicate that adults had started playing it and the earliest reference to inter-parish or village cricket occurs soon afterwards in 1624 a player called jasper vinall was killed when he was struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in sussex
during the 17th century numerous references indicate the growth of cricket in the south-east of england by the end of the century it had become an organised activity being played for high stakes and it is believed that the first professionals appeared in the years following the restoration in 1660 a newspaper report survives of a great cricket match with eleven players a side that was played for high stakes in sussex in 1697 and this is the earliest known reference to a cricket match of such importance
the game underwent major development in the 18th century and became the national sport of england betting played a major part in that development with rich patrons forming their own select xis cricket was prominent in london as early as 1707 and large crowds flocked to matches on the artillery ground in finsbury the single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match
in the 1730s frederick prince of wales played a major role in developing the sport bowling evolved around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman this caused a revolution in bat design because to deal with the bouncing ball it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old hockey stick shape
the hambledon club was founded in the 1760s and for the next 20 years until the formation of mcc and the opening of lord's old ground in 1787 hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point mcc quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the laws of cricket new laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw) the 19th century saw underarm bowling replaced by first roundarm and then overarm bowling both developments were controversial
organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs starting with sussex ccc in 1839 which ultimately formed the official county championship in 1890 meanwhile the british empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in india north america the caribbean south africa australia and new zealand in 1844 the first international cricket match took place between the united states and canada (although neither has ever been ranked as a test-playing nation)
in 1859 a team of england players went on the first overseas tour (to north america) the first australian team to tour overseas was a team of aboriginal stockmen who travelled to england in 1868 to play matches against county teams in 1862 an english team made the first tour of australia and in 187677 an england team took part in the first-ever test match at the melbourne cricket ground against australia w.g grace started his long career in 1865 his career is often said to have revolutionised the sport the rivalry between england and australia gave birth to the ashes in 1882 and this has remained test cricket's most famous contest
test cricket began to expand in 188889 when south africa played england the last two decades before the first world war have been called the golden age of cricket it is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches especially as organised competition at county and test level developed
the inter-war years were dominated by one player australia's don bradman statistically the greatest batsman of all time it was the determination of the england team to overcome his skill that brought about the infamous bodyline series in 193233 particularly from the accurate short-pitched bowling of harold larwood
test cricket continued to expand during the 20th century with the addition of the west indies india and new zealand before the second world war and then pakistan sri lanka and bangladesh in the post-war period however south africa was banned from international cricket from 1970 to 1992 because of its government's apartheid policy
cricket entered a new era in 1963 when english counties introduced the limited overs variant as it was sure to produce a result limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased the first limited overs international was played in 1971 the governing international cricket council (icc) saw its potential and staged the first limited overs cricket world cup in 1975 in the 21st century a new limited overs form twenty20 has made an immediate impact
== rules and game-play ==
cricket is a bat and ball game played between two teams of eleven players each one team bats attempting to score runs while the other bowls and fields the ball attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen the objective of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent in some forms of cricket it may also be necessary to dismiss the opposition in order to win the match which would otherwise be drawn
there are separate leagues for women's cricket though informal matches may have mixed teams
=== format of the game ===
a cricket match is divided into periods called innings (which ends with s in both singular and plural form) it is decided before the match whether the teams will have one innings or two innings each during an innings one team fields and the other bats the two teams switch between fielding and batting after each innings all eleven members of the fielding team take the field but only two members of the batting team (two batsmen) are on the field at any given time the order of batsmen is usually announced just before the match but it can be varied
a coin toss is held by the team captains (who are also players) just before the match starts the winner decides whether to bat or field first
the cricket field is usually oval in shape with a rectangular pitch at the center the edge of the playing field is marked with a boundary which could be a fence part of the stands a rope or a painted line
at each end of the pitch is a wooden target called a wicket placed 22 yards apart the pitch is marked with painted lines a bowling crease in line with the wicket and a batting or popping crease four feet in front of it the wicket is made of three vertical stumps supporting two small horizontal bails a wicket is put down if at least one bail is dislodged or one stump is knocked down (usually by the ball but also if the batsman does it with his body clothing or equipment) this is also described as breaking knocking down or hitting the wicket though if the ball hits the wicket but does not dislodge a bail or stump then it is not down
at any instant each batsman owns a particular wicket (usually the one closer to him) and except when actually batting is safe when he is in his ground this means that at least one part of his body or bat is touching the ground behind the popping crease if his wicket is put down while the ball is live and he is out of his ground then he is dismissed but the other batsman is safe
the two batsmen take positions at opposite ends of the pitch one designated member of the fielding team called the bowler bowls the ball from one end of the pitch to the striking batsman at the other end the batsman at the bowling end is called the non-striker and stands to the side of his wicket behind his crease the batsman are allowed to step forward of their creases though at some risk another member of the fielding team the wicket keeper is positioned behind the striker's wicket
the fielding team's other nine members stand outside the pitch spread out across the field the fielding captain often strategically changes their position between balls
there is always an umpire at each end of the pitch
the bowler usually retreats a few yards (metres) behind the wicket runs towards it (his run-up) and then releases the ball over-hand as he reaches the bowling crease (if he crosses the crease before he releases the ball or if he flexes his elbow too much in a throw then it is a no ball and the batting team gets a penalty or extra run if the ball passes the far wicket out of reach of the batsman then it is called a wide also with an extra run.) the ball can be bowled so that it bounces on the pitch lands exactly on the crease (a yorker) or crosses the crease without bouncing (a full toss)
the batsman tries to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket by striking the ball with his bat (this includes the handle of the bat and his gloves.) if the bowler succeeds in putting down the wicket the batsman is dismissed and is said to be bowled out if the batsman misses the ball but any part of his body prevents it from reaching the wicket then he is out leg before wicket or lbw
if the batsman hits the ball but it is caught by a fielder without bouncing then he is caught out if it is caught by the bowler then he is caught and bowled by the wicket keeper caught behind
if the batsman is successful in striking the ball and it is not caught without bouncing then the two batsmen may try to score points (runs) for their team both batsmen run the length of the pitch exchanging positions and grounding their bats behind the opposite crease each crossing and grounding by both batsmen is worth one run the batsmen may attempt one run multiple runs or elect not to run at all by attempting runs the batsmen risk dismissal this happens if the fielding team retrieves the ball and hits either wicket with the ball (either by throwing it or while holding it) before the batsman who owns that wicket reaches his ground behind the crease the dismissed batsman is run out batsmen will sometimes start to run change their mind and return to their original positions
if the batsman hits the ball over the field boundary without the ball touching the field the batting team scores six runs if the ball touches the ground and then reaches the boundary the batting team scores four runs the batsmen might start running before the ball reaches the boundary but those runs don't count
if the batsman misses the ball they can still attempt extra runs  these are called byes if the ball bounces off his body then it is called a leg bye
if the striking batsman leaves his ground and misses the ball then the wicket keeper can catch it and put down the wicket stumped
in case of a no ball or a wide the batsman can choose to strike the ball earning runs in addition to the fixed penalty if he does so he can only be dismissed by being run out
when the batsmen have finished attempting their runs the ball is dead and is returned to the bowler to be bowled again the ball becomes live when he starts his run up the bowler continues to bowl toward the same wicket regardless of any switch of the batsmen's positions
a batsman may retire from an innings without being dismissed usually after reaching a milestone like a hundred runs (a century)
a dismissed batsman leaves the field to be replaced by another batsman from the batting team however even though the wicket may have been put down or the ball caught the batsman is not actually dismissed until the fielding team appeal to the umpires for a decision traditionally using the expression how's that (or howzat") in some matches particularly test matches either team may request a review by a third umpire who can use a decision review system (drs) which includes tv replays and other electronic equipment such as hawk eye hotspot and the snickometer
after a bowler has bowled six times (an over) another member of the fielding team is designated as the new bowler the old bowler taking up a fielding position the batsmen stay in place and the new bowler bowls to the opposite wicket so the role of striker and non-striker reverse the wicket keeper and the two umpires always change positions as do many of the fielders and play continues fielding team members may bowl multiple times during an innings but may not bowl two overs in succession
the innings is complete when 10 of the 11 members of the batting team have been dismissed (all out although one always remaining not out") when a set number of overs has been played or when the batting team declares that they have enough runs
the number of innings and the number of overs per innings vary depending on the format of the match in a match which is not a limited overs format the umpires will usually specify that the last session of the last innings will have a specified number of overs
the match always ends when all innings have been completed the umpires can also call an end to the match in case of bad light or weather but in many cases the match ends immediately when the first team to bat has played all of its innings and the last team to bat has more runs in four-innings games the last team may not even need to play its second innings this team is said to win by an innings if this winning team has not completed its last innings and still has for example five batsmen who are not out or have not even batted then they are said to win by five wickets if the last team to bat is losing is all out and has 10 fewer runs than the other team then the winning team wins by 10 runs if the two teams both play all their innings and they have the same number of runs then it is a tie
in four-innings matches there is also the possibility of a draw the team with fewer runs still has batsmen on the field when the game ends this has a major effect on strategy a team will often declare an innings when they have accumulated enough runs in the hope that they will have enough time left to dismiss the other team and thus avoid a draw but risking a loss if the other team scores enough runs
=== pitch wickets and creases ===
==== playing surface ====
cricket is played on a grassy field the laws of cricket do not specify the size or shape of the field but it is often oval in the centre of the field is a rectangular strip known as the pitch
the pitch is a flat surface 10 feet (3.0 m) wide with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses at either end of the pitch 22 yards (20 m) apart are placed wooden targets known as the wickets these serve as a target for the bowling (also known as the fielding) side and are defended by the batting side which seeks to accumulate runs
==== stumps bails and creases ====
each wicket on the pitch consists of three wooden stumps placed vertically in line with one another they are surmounted by two wooden crosspieces called bails the total height of the wicket including bails is 28.5 inches (720 mm) and the combined width of the three stumps including small gaps between them is 9 inches (230 mm)
four lines known as creases are painted onto the pitch around the wicket areas to define the batsman's safe territory and to determine the limit of the bowler's approach these are called the popping (or batting) crease the bowling crease and two return creases
the stumps are placed in line on the bowling creases and so these creases must be 22 yards (20 m) apart a bowling crease is 8 feet 8 inches (2.64 m) long with the middle stump placed dead centre the popping crease has the same length is parallel to the bowling crease and is 4 feet (1.2 m) in front of the wicket the return creases are perpendicular to the other two they are adjoined to the ends of the popping crease and are drawn through the ends of the bowling crease to a length of at least 8 feet (2.4 m)
when bowling the ball the bowler's back foot in his delivery stride must land within the two return creases while at least some part of his front foot must land on or behind the popping crease if the bowler breaks this rule the umpire calls no ball
the importance of the popping crease to the batsman is that it marks the limit of his safe territory he can be dismissed stumped or run out (see dismissals below) if the wicket is broken while he is out of his ground
=== bat and ball ===
the essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers the ball from his end of the pitch towards the batsman who armed with a bat is on strike at the other end
the bat is made of wood (usually white willow) and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle the blade must not be more than 4.25 inches (108 mm) wide and the total length of the bat not more than 38 inches (970 mm)
the ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid with a circumference of 9 inches (230 mm) the hardness of the ball which can be delivered at speeds of more than 90 miles per hour (140 km/h) is a matter for concern and batsmen wear protective clothing including pads (designed to protect the knees and shins) batting gloves for the hands a helmet for the head and a box inside the trousers (to protect the crotch area) some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads arm pads rib protectors and shoulder pads the ball has a seam six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior the seam on a new ball is prominent and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner during cricket matches the quality of the ball changes to a point where it is no longer usable and during this decline its properties alter and thus influence the match
=== umpires and scorers ===
the game on the field is regulated by two umpires one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler's end the other in a position called square leg a position 1520 metres to the side of the on strike batsman the main role of the umpires is to adjudicate on whether a ball is correctly bowled (not a no ball or a wide) when a run is scored and whether a batsman is out (the fielding side must appeal to the umpire usually with the phrase how's that?) umpires also determine when intervals start and end decide on the suitability of the playing conditions and can interrupt or even abandon the match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light
off the field and in televised matches there is often a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence the third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for test matches and limited overs internationals played between two icc full members these matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the laws of cricket and the spirit of the game
the match details including runs and dismissals are recorded by two official scorers one representing each team the scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire for example the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out (has been dismissed) he raises both arms above his head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs the scorers are required by the laws of cricket to record all runs scored wickets taken and overs bowled in practice they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game
=== innings ===
the innings (ending with s in both singular and plural form) is the term used for the collective performance of the batting side in theory all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but for various reasons an innings can end before they all do so depending on the type of match being played each team has one or two innings apiece
the main aim of the bowler supported by his fielders is to dismiss the batsman a batsman when dismissed is said to be out and that means he must leave the field of play and be replaced by the next batsman on his team when ten batsmen have been dismissed (i.e. are out) then the whole team is dismissed and the innings is over the last batsman the one who has not been dismissed is not allowed to continue alone as there must always be two batsmen in this batsman is termed not out
an innings can end early for three reasons because the batting side's captain has chosen to declare the innings closed (which is a tactical decision) or because the batting side has achieved its target and won the game or because the game has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time in each of these cases the team's innings ends with two not out batsmen unless the innings is declared closed at the fall of a wicket and the next batsman has not joined in the play
in limited overs cricket there might be two batsmen still not out when the last of the allotted overs has been bowled
=== overs ===
the bowler bowls the ball in sets of six deliveries (or balls") and each set of six balls is called an over this name came about because the umpire calls over! when six balls have been bowled at this point another bowler is deployed at the other end and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not a bowler cannot bowl two successive overs although a bowler can bowl unchanged at the same end for several overs the batsmen do not change ends and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa the umpires also change positions so that the one who was at square leg now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice versa
=== team structure ===
a team consists of eleven players depending on his or her primary skills a player may be classified as a specialist batsman or bowler a well-balanced team usually has five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers teams nearly always include a specialist wicket-keeper because of the importance of this fielding position each team is headed by a captain who is responsible for making tactical decisions such as determining the batting order the placement of fielders and the rotation of bowlers
a player who excels in both batting and bowling is known as an all-rounder one who excels as a batsman and wicket-keeper is known as a wicket-keeper/batsman sometimes regarded as a type of all-rounder true all-rounders are rare as most players focus on either batting or bowling skills
=== bowling ===
the bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a run-up although some bowlers with a very slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling a fast bowler needs momentum and takes quite a long run-up running very fast as he does so
the fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 90 miles per hour (140 km/h) and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try and defeat the batsman who is forced to react very quickly other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile some fast bowlers make use of the seam of the ball so that it curves or swings in flight this type of delivery can deceive a batsman into mistiming his shot so that the ball touches the edge of the bat and can then be caught behind by the wicketkeeper or a slip fielder
at the other end of the bowling scale is the spinner who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman a spinner will often buy his wicket by tossing one up (in a slower higher parabolic path) to lure the batsman into making a poor shot the batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often flighted or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be trapped into getting himself out
in between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium pacers who rely on persistent accuracy to try and contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman's concentration
all bowlers are classified according to their looks or style the classifications as with much cricket terminology can be very confusing hence a bowler could be classified as lf meaning he is a left arm fast bowler or as lbg meaning he is a right arm spin bowler who bowls deliveries that are called a leg break and a googly
during the bowling action the elbow may be held at any angle and may bend further but may not straighten out if the elbow straightens illegally then the square-leg umpire may call no-ball this is known as throwing or chucking and can be difficult to detect the current laws allow a bowler to straighten his arm 15 degrees or less
=== fielding ===
all eleven players on the fielding side take the field together one of them is the wicket-keeper aka keeper who operates behind the wicket being defended by the batsman on strike wicket-keeping is normally a specialist occupation and his primary job is to gather deliveries that the batsman does not hit so that the batsmen cannot run byes he wears special gloves (he is the only fielder allowed to do so) a box over the groin and pads to cover his lower legs owing to his position directly behind the striker the wicket-keeper has a good chance of getting a batsman out caught off a fine edge from the bat he is the only player who can get a batsman out stumped
apart from the one currently bowling the other nine fielders are tactically deployed by the team captain in chosen positions around the field these positions are not fixed but they are known by specific and sometimes colourful names such as slip third man silly mid on and long leg there are always many unprotected areas
the captain is the most important member of the fielding side as he determines all the tactics including who should bowl (and how) and he is responsible for setting the field though usually in consultation with the bowler
in all forms of cricket if a fielder gets injured or becomes ill during a match a substitute is allowed to field instead of him the substitute cannot bowl act as a captain or keep wicket the substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return
=== batting ===
at any one time there are two batsmen in the playing area one takes station at the striker's end to defend the wicket as above and to score runs if possible his partner the non-striker is at the end where the bowler is operating
batsmen come in to bat in a batting order decided by the team captain the first two batsmen the openers usually face the hostile bowling from fresh fast bowlers with a new ball the top batting positions are usually given to the most competent batsmen in the team and the team's bowlers who are typically but not always less skilled as batsmen typically bat last the pre-announced batting order is not mandatory when a wicket falls any player who has not yet batted may be sent in next
if a batsman retires (usually due to injury) and cannot return he is actually not out and his retirement does not count as a dismissal though in effect he has been dismissed because his innings is over substitute batsmen are not allowed
a skilled batsman can use a wide array of shots or strokes in both defensive and attacking mode the idea is to hit the ball to best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade if the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an edge batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply blocking the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run
there is a wide variety of shots played in cricket the batsman's repertoire includes strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed e.g. cut drive hook pull
a batsman is not required to play a shot in the event that he believes the ball will not hit his wicket and there is no opportunity to score runs he can leave the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper equally he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat he can deliberately use his leg to block the ball and thereby pad it away but this is risky because of the leg before wicket rule
in the event of an injured batsman being fit to bat but not to run the umpires and the fielding captain were previously able to allow another member of the batting side to be a runner the runner's only task was to run between the wickets instead of the incapacitated batsman and he was required to wear and carry exactly the same equipment as the batsman as of 2011 the icc outlawed the use of runners as they felt this was being abused
=== runs ===
the primary concern of the batsman on strike (i.e. the striker") is to prevent the ball hitting the wicket and secondarily to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball to register a run both runners must touch the ground behind the crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batsmen carry their bats as they run) each completed run increments the score
more than one run can be scored from a single hit but while hits worth one to three runs are common the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more to compensate for this hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary the batsmen do not need to run if the ball reaches or crosses the boundary
hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of overthrows by a fielder returning the ball if an odd number of runs is scored by the striker the two batsmen have changed ends and the one who was non-striker is now the striker only the striker can score individual runs but all runs are added to the team's total
the decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball's progress and this is communicated by calling yes no and wait are often heard
running is a calculated risk because if a fielder breaks the wicket with the ball while the nearest batsman is out of his ground (i.e. he does not have part of his body or bat in contact with the ground behind the popping crease) the batsman is run out
a team's score is reported in terms of the number of runs scored and the number of batsmen that have been dismissed for example if five batsmen are out and the team has scored 224 runs they are said to have scored 224 for the loss of 5 wickets (commonly shortened to 224 for five and written 224/5 or in australia five for 224 and 5/224)
=== extras ===
additional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras (called sundries in australia) due to errors made by the fielding side this is achieved in four ways
no ball a penalty of one extra that is conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules of bowling either by (a) using an inappropriate arm action (b) overstepping the popping crease (c) having a foot outside the return crease in addition the bowler has to re-bowl the ball in limited overs matches a no ball is called if the bowling team's field setting fails to comply with the restrictions in shorter formats of the game (2020 odi) the free hit rule has been introduced the ball following a front foot no-ball will be a free-hit for the batsman whereby he is safe from losing his wicket except for being run-out
wide a penalty of one extra that is conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman's reach as with a no ball a wide must be re-bowled if a wide ball crosses the boundary five runs are awarded to the batting side (one run for the wide and four for the boundary)
bye extra(s) awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicketkeeper to give the batsmen time to run in the conventional way (note that one mark of a good wicketkeeper is one who restricts the tally of byes to a minimum)
leg bye extra(s) awarded if the ball hits the batsman's body but not his bat while attempting a legitimate shot and it goes away from the fielders to give the batsmen time to run in the conventional way
when the bowler has bowled a no ball or a wide his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e. delivery) has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball the batsmen have to run (i.e. unless the ball goes to the boundary for four) to claim byes and leg byes but these only count towards the team total not to the striker's individual total for which runs must be scored off the bat
=== dismissals ===
there are eleven ways in which a batsman can be dismissed five relatively common and six extremely rare the common forms of dismissal are bowled caught leg before wicket (lbw) run out and stumped less common methods are hit wicket hit the ball twice obstructed the field handled the ball and timed out these are almost unknown in the professional game the eleventh retired out is not treated as an on-field dismissal but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited
if the dismissal is obvious (for example when bowled and in most cases of caught") the batsman will voluntarily leave the field without the umpire needing to dismiss them otherwise before the umpire will award a dismissal and declare the batsman to be out a member of the fielding side (generally the bowler) must appeal this is invariably done by asking (or shouting) how's that? normally reduced to howzat if the umpire agrees with the appeal he will raise a forefinger and say out! otherwise he will shake his head and say not out appeals are particularly loud when the circumstances of the claimed dismissal are unclear as is always the case with lbw and often with run outs and stumpings
bowled the bowler has hit the wicket with the delivery and the wicket has broken with at least one bail being dislodged (note that if the ball hits the wicket without dislodging a bail it is not out)
caught the batsman has hit the ball with his bat or with his hand which was holding the bat and the ball has been caught before it has touched the ground by a member of the fielding side
leg before wicket (lbw) the ball has hit the batsman's body (including his clothing pads etc but not the bat or a hand holding the bat) when it would have gone on to hit the stumps this rule exists mainly to prevent the batsman from guarding his wicket with his legs instead of the bat to be given out lbw the ball must not bounce outside leg stump or strike the batsmen outside the line of leg-stump it may bounce outside off-stump the batsman may only be dismissed lbw by a ball striking him outside the line of off-stump if he has not made a genuine attempt to play the ball with his bat
run out a member of the fielding side has broken or put down the wicket with the ball while the nearest batsman was out of his ground this usually occurs by means of an accurate throw to the wicket while the batsmen are attempting a run although a batsman can be given out run out even when he is not attempting a run he merely needs to be out of his ground
stumped is similar except that it is done by the wicketkeeper after the batsman has missed the bowled ball and has stepped out of his ground and is not attempting a run
hit wicket a batsman is out hit wicket if he dislodges one or both bails with his bat person clothing or equipment in the act of receiving a ball or in setting off for a run having just received a ball
hit the ball twice is very unusual and was introduced as a safety measure to counter dangerous play and protect the fielders the batsman may legally play the ball a second time only to stop the ball hitting the wicket after he has already played it hit does not necessarily refer to the batsman's bat
obstructing the field another unusual dismissal which tends to involve a batsman deliberately getting in the way (physically and/or verbally) of a fielder
handled the ball a batsman must not deliberately touch the ball with his hand for example to protect his wicket note that the batsman's hand or glove counts as part of the bat while the hand is holding the bat so batsmen are frequently caught off their gloves (i.e the ball hits and is deflected by the glove and can then be caught)
timed out means that the next batsman was not ready to receive a delivery within three minutes of the previous one being dismissed
retired out a batsman retires without the umpire's permission and does not have the permission of the opposition captain to resume their innings
in the vast majority of cases it is the striker who is out when a dismissal occurs if the non-striker is dismissed it is usually by being run out but he could also be dismissed for obstructing the field handling the ball or being timed out
a batsman may leave the field without being dismissed if injured or taken ill the batsman may temporarily retire and be replaced by the next batsman this is recorded as retired hurt or retired ill the retiring batsman is not out and may resume the innings later an unimpaired batsman may retire and this is treated as being dismissed retired out no player is credited with the dismissal batsmen cannot be out bowled caught leg before wicket stumped or hit wicket off a no ball they cannot be out bowled caught leg before wicket or hit the ball twice off a wide some of these modes of dismissal can occur without the bowler bowling a delivery the batsman who is not on strike may be run out by the bowler if he leaves his crease before the bowler bowls and a batsman can be out obstructing the field or retired out at any time timed out is by its nature a dismissal without a delivery with all other modes of dismissal only one batsman can be dismissed per ball bowled
=== innings closed ===
an innings is closed when
ten of the eleven batsmen are out (have been dismissed) in this case the team is said to be all out
the team has only one batsman left who can bat one or more of the remaining players being unavailable owing to injury illness or absence again the team is said to be all out
the team batting last reaches the score required to win the match
the predetermined number of overs has been bowled (in a one-day match only commonly 50 overs or 20 in twenty20)
a captain declares his team's innings closed while at least two of his batsmen are not out (this does not apply in one-day limited over matches)
=== results ===
if the team that bats last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents the team is said to have lost by n runs (where n is the difference between the number of runs scored by the teams) if the team that bats last scores enough runs to win it is said to have won by n wickets where n is the number of wickets left to fall for instance a team that passes its opponents score having only lost six wickets would have won by four wickets
in a two-innings-a-side match one team's combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side's first innings total the team with the greater score is then said to have won by an innings and n runs and does not need to bat again n is the difference between the two teams aggregate scores
if the team batting last is all out and both sides have scored the same number of runs then the match is a tie this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side in the traditional form of the game if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win then the game is declared a draw
if the match has only a single innings per side then a maximum number of deliveries for each innings is often imposed such a match is called a limited overs or one-day match and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost so that a draw cannot occur if this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather then a complex mathematical formula known as the duckworth-lewis method after its developers is often used to recalculate a new target score a one-day match can also be declared a no-result if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible for example wet weather
== distinctive elements ==
=== individual focus ===
for a team sport cricket places individual players under unusual scrutiny and pressure bowler batsman and fielder all act essentially independently of each other while team managements can signal bowler or batsman to pursue certain tactics the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard while the individual focus in cricket is slightly mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of running it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for a long time
=== spirit of the game ===
cricket is a unique game where in addition to the laws the players must abide by the spirit of the game the standard of sportsmanship has historically been considered so high that the phrase it's just not cricket was coined in the 19th century to describe unfair or underhanded behaviour in any walk of life in the last few decades though cricket has become increasingly fast-paced and competitive increasing the use of appealing and sledging although players are still expected to abide by the umpires rulings without argument and for the most part they do beginning in 2001 the mcc has held an annual lecture named after colin cowdrey on the spirit of the game even in the modern game fielders are known to signal to the umpire that a boundary was hit despite what could have been considered a spectacular save (though they might be found out by the tv replays anyway) in addition to this some batsmen have been known to walk when they think they are out even if the umpire does not declare them out this is a high level of sportsmanship as a batsman can easily take advantage of incorrect umpiring decisions
=== influence of weather ===
cricket is a sport played predominantly in the drier periods of the year but even so the weather is a major factor in all cricket matches
a scheduled game of cricket cannot be played in wet weather dampness affects the bounce of the ball on the wicket and is a risk to all players involved in the game many grounds have facilities to cover the cricket pitch (or the wicket) covers can be in the form of tarpaulins being laid over the wicket to elevated covers on wheels (using the same concept as an umbrella) to even hover covers which form an airtight seal around the wicket however most grounds do not have the facilities to cover the outfield this means that in the event of heavy bouts of bad weather games may be cancelled abandoned or suspended due to an unsafe outfield
another factor in cricket is the amount of light available at grounds without floodlights (or in game formats which disallow the use of floodlights) umpires can stop play in the event of bad light as it becomes too difficult for the batsmen to be able to see the ball coming at them (and in extreme cases members of the fielding team)
on the other hand in instances of good light batsmen can utilise sight-screens which enable batsmen to have a white background against which they can pick out the red ball (or black background for white ball) with greater ease
the umpires always have the final decision on weather-related issues
=== uniqueness of each field ===
unlike those of most sports cricket playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape while the dimensions of the pitch and infield are specifically regulated the laws of cricket do not specify the size or shape of the field the field boundaries are sometimes painted and sometimes marked by a rope pitch and outfield variations can have a significant effect on how balls behave and are fielded as well as on batting pitches vary in consistency and thus in the amount of bounce spin and seam movement available to the bowler hard pitches are usually good to bat on because of high but even bounce dry pitches tend to deteriorate for batting as cracks often appear and when this happens to the pitch spinners can play a major role damp pitches or pitches covered in grass (termed green pitches) allow good fast bowlers to extract extra bounce such pitches tend to offer help to fast bowlers throughout the match but become better for batting as the game goes on while players of other outdoor sports deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering the size and shape of their fields are much more standardised other local factors such as altitude and climate can also significantly affect play these physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ground a given ground may acquire a reputation as batsman friendly or bowler friendly if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements the absence of a standardised field affects not only how particular games play out but the nature of team makeup and players statistical records
== types of matches ==
cricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple formats varying playing standard and level of formality and the desired time that the match should last a pertinent division in terms of professional cricket is between matches limited by time in which the teams have two innings apiece and those limited by number of overs in which they have a single innings each the former known as first-class cricket has a duration of three to five days (there have been examples of timeless matches too) the latter known as limited overs cricket because each team bowls a limit of typically 50 or 20 overs has a planned duration of one day only (a match can be extended if necessary due to bad weather etc.)
typically two-innings matches have at least six hours of playing time each day limited overs matches often last six hours or more there are usually formal intervals on each day for lunch and tea with brief informal breaks for drinks there is also a short interval between innings
amateur cricketers rarely play matches that last longer than a single day these may loosely be divided into declaration matches in which a specified maximum time or number of overs is assigned to the game in total and the teams swap roles only when the batting team is either completely dismissed or declares and limited overs matches in which a specified maximum number of overs is assigned for each team's innings individually these will vary in length between 30 and 60 overs per side at the weekend and the ever popular 20 over format during the evenings other forms of cricket such as indoor cricket and garden cricket remain popular
historically a form of cricket known as single wicket had been extremely successful and many of these contests in the 18th and 19th centuries qualify as major cricket matches in this form although each team may have from one to six players there is only one batsman at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began
=== test cricket ===
test cricket is the highest standard of first-class cricket a test match is an international fixture between teams representing those countries that are full members of the icc
although the term test match was not coined until much later test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between australia and england in the 187677 australian season subsequently eight other national teams have achieved test status south africa (1889) west indies (1928) new zealand (1929) india (1932) pakistan (1952) sri lanka (1982) zimbabwe (1992) and bangladesh (2000) zimbabwe suspended its test status in 2006 due to its inability to compete against other test teams and returned in 2011
welsh players are eligible to play for england which is in effect an england and wales team the west indies team comprises players from numerous states in the caribbean notably barbados guyana jamaica trinidad & tobago the leeward islands and the windward islands
test matches between two teams are usually played in a group of matches called a series matches last up to five days and a series normally consists of three to five matches test matches that are not finished within the allotted time are drawn in the case of test and first-class cricket the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss
since 1882 most test series between england and australia have been played for a trophy known as the ashes some other bilateral series have individual trophies too for example the wisden trophy is contested by england and west indies the frank worrell trophy by australia and west indies and the border-gavaskar trophy between india and australia
=== limited overs ===
standard limited overs cricket was introduced in england in the 1963 season in the form of a knockout cup contested by the first-class county clubs in 1969 a national league competition was established the concept was gradually introduced to the other major cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971 in 1975 the first cricket world cup took place in england limited overs cricket has seen various innovations including the use of multi-coloured kit and floodlit matches using a white ball a one day match named so because each match is scheduled for completion in a single day is the common form of limited overs cricket played on an international level in practice matches sometimes continue on a second day if they have been interrupted or postponed by bad weather the main objective of a limited overs match is to produce a definite result and so a conventional draw is not possible but matches can be undecided if the scores are tied or if bad weather prevents a result each team plays one innings only and faces a limited number of overs usually a maximum of 50 the cricket world cup is held in one day format and the last world cup in 2015 was won by the co-hosts australia the next world cup will be hosted by england and wales in 2019
twenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three hours usually in an evening session the original idea when the concept was introduced in england in 2003 was to provide workers with an evening entertainment it was commercially successful and has been adopted internationally the inaugural twenty20 world championship was held in 2007 and won by india three subsequent events have been held which were won by pakistan england west indies and sri lanka respectively the next tournament is scheduled to be held in 2016 after the inaugural icc world twenty20 many domestic twenty20 leagues were born first of them was indian cricket league which was a rebel league since it was not authorized by bcci bcci then formed its official league called the indian premier league the official league went on to become a successful annual affair that attracted players and audience around the globe while the indian cricket league has been disbanded after the success of indian premier league many other domestic leagues were formed in all major cricketing nations recently twenty20 champions league was formed as a tournament for domestic clubs of various countries.in this league competition played between the top domestic teams from major cricketing nations
=== national championships ===
first-class cricket includes test cricket but the term is generally used to refer to the highest level of domestic cricket in those countries with full icc membership although there are exceptions to this first-class cricket in england is played for the most part by the 18 county clubs which contest the county championship the concept of a champion county has existed since the 18th century but the official competition was not established until 1890 the most successful club has been yorkshire county cricket club with 30 official titles
australia established its national first-class championship in 189293 when the sheffield shield was introduced in australia the first-class teams represent the various states new south wales has won the maximum number of titles with 45 to 2008
national championship trophies to be established elsewhere included the ranji trophy (india) plunket shield (new zealand) currie cup (south africa) and shell shield (west indies) some of these competitions have been updated and renamed in recent years
domestic limited overs competitions began with england's gillette cup knockout in 1963 countries usually stage seasonal limited overs competitions in both knockout and league format in recent years national twenty20 competitions have been introduced usually in knockout form though some incorporate mini-leagues
=== club cricket ===
club cricket is a mainly amateur but still formal form of the sport of cricket usually involving teams playing in competitions at weekends or in the evening there is a great deal of variation in game format although the laws of cricket are always observed
club cricket is frequently organised in a league or cup format games are limited by either time or overs limited overs games usually last between 20 and 60 overs per innings a less common but more traditional format is limiting the game by time only games can range from a few hours in the evening to two days long a modern innovation is the introduction of twenty20 competitions both as a format in the existing leagues and new leagues solely based on twenty20 such as lastmanstanding
standards of play can vary from semi-professional to occasional recreational level and club cricket is often enjoyed as much for the social element as for the competition most clubs have their own ground to play on regularly often including a field and pavilion or club house an exception being wandering sides who use other's grounds
many leagues have been formed around the world of varying degrees of professionalism the oldest being the birmingham & district premier league in the birmingham area of england founded in 1888
=== other types of matches ===
there are numerous variations of the sport played throughout the world that include indoor cricket french cricket beach cricket kwik cricket and all sorts of card games and board games that have been inspired by cricket in these variants the rules are often changed to make the game playable with limited resources or to render it more convenient and enjoyable for the participants
indoor cricket was first invented in 1970 it is similar to outdoor cricket except that is played in an indoor sports hall with 6 players per team it is extremely popular in the uk with national championships and multiple independent leagues another less formal version of indoor cricket is played in a smaller arena with a soft ball and without pads was invented some years later and is commonly played in the southern hemisphere and even has its own nominal international championships including world cups
in the uk garden cricket is a popular version of the sport played in gardens and on recreation grounds around the country by adults and children alike although a cricket bat and ball are generally used other equipment such as pads and gloves are not the exact rules will vary based on the number of participants and the available space
families and teenagers play backyard cricket or tennis ball cricket in suburban yards or driveways and the cities of india and pakistan play host to countless games of gully cricket or tape ball in their long narrow streets sometimes the rules are improvised e.g it may be agreed that fielders can catch the ball with one hand after one bounce and claim a wicket or if only a few people are available then everyone may field while the players take it in turns to bat and bowl tennis balls and homemade bats are often used and a variety of objects may serve as wickets for example the batter's legs as in french cricket which did not in fact originate in france and is usually played by small children
in kwik cricket the bowler does not have to wait for the batsman to be ready before a delivery leading to a faster more exhausting game designed to appeal to children which is often used in physical education lessons at uk schools another modification to increase the pace of the game is the tip and run tipity run tipsy run or tippy-go rule in which the batter must run when the ball touches the bat even if it the contact is unintentional or minor this rule seen only in impromptu games speeds the match up by removing the batsman's right to block the ball
in samoa a form of cricket called kilikiti is played in which hockey stick-shaped bats are used in original english cricket the hockey stick shape was replaced by the modern straight bat in the 1760s after bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it in estonia teams gather over the winter for the annual ice cricket tournament the game juxtaposes the normal summer pursuit with harsh wintry conditions rules are otherwise similar to those for the six-a-side game
== international structure ==
the international cricket council (icc) which has its headquarters in dubai is the international governing body of cricket it was founded as the imperial cricket conference in 1909 by representatives from england australia and south africa renamed the international cricket conference in 1965 and took up its current name in 1989
the icc has 104 members 10 full members that play official test matches 34 associate members and 60 affiliate members the icc is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments notably the cricket world cup it also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned test matches one day international and twenty20 internationals each nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country the cricket board also selects the national squad and organises home and away tours for the national team in the west indies these matters are addressed by the west indies cricket board which consists of members appointed by four national boards and two multi-national boards
=== members ===
==== full members ====
full members are the governing bodies for cricket in a country or associated countries full members may also represent a geographical area all full members have a right to send one representative team to play official test matches also all full member nations are automatically qualified to play odis and twenty20 internationals west indies cricket team does not represent one country instead an amalgamation of over 20 countries from the caribbean the english cricket team represents both england and wales
*last updated 8 march 2015 | aresigned may 1961 readmitted 10 july 1991
==== top associate and affiliate members ====
all the associate and affiliate members are not qualified to play test cricket however icc grants one day international status to its associate and affiliate members based on their success in the world cricket league the top six teams will be awarded one day international and twenty20 international status which will allow the associate and affiliate teams to be eligible to play the full members and play official odi cricket
the associate and affiliate teams who currently hold odi and t20i status
== statistics ==
organized cricket lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes at the professional level statistics for test cricket one-day internationals and first-class cricket are recorded separately however since test matches are a form of first-class cricket a player's first-class statistics will include his test match statistics but not vice versa the guide to cricketers was a cricket annual edited by fred lillywhite between 1849 and his death in 1866 wisden cricketers almanack was founded in 1864 by the english cricketer john wisden (18261884) as a competitor to the guide to cricketers its annual publication has continued uninterrupted to the present day making it the longest running sports annual in history
certain traditional statistics are familiar to most cricket fans the basic batting statistics include
innings (i) the number of innings in which the batsman actually batted
not outs (no) the number of times the batsman was not out at the conclusion of an innings they batted in
runs (r) the number of runs scored
highest score (hs/best) the highest score ever made by the batsman
batting average (ave) the total number of runs divided by the total number of innings in which the batsman was out ave = runs/[i no] (also avge or avg.)
centuries (100) the number of innings in which the batsman scored one hundred runs or more
half-centuries (50) the number of innings in which the batsman scored fifty to ninety-nine runs (centuries do not count as half-centuries as well)
balls faced (bf) the total number of balls received including no balls but not including wides
strike rate (sr) the number of runs scored per 100 balls faced (sr = [100 * runs]/bf)
run rate (rr) is the number of runs a batsman (or the batting side) scores in an over of six balls
the basic bowling statistics include
overs (o) the number of overs bowled
balls (b) the number of balls bowled overs is more traditional but balls is a more useful statistic because the number of balls per over has varied historically
maiden overs (m) the number of maiden overs (overs in which the bowler conceded zero runs) bowled
runs (r) the number of runs conceded
wickets (w) the number of wickets taken
no balls (nb) the number of no balls bowled
wides (wd) the number of wides bowled
bowling average (ave) the average number of runs conceded per wicket (ave = runs/w)
strike rate (sr) the average number of balls bowled per wicket (sr = balls/w)
economy rate (econ) the average number of runs conceded per over (econ = runs/overs bowled)
=== scorecards ===
a match's statistics are summarised on a scorecard prior to the popularisation of scorecards most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks the earliest known scorecards were printed in 1776 by pratt scorer to the sevenoaks vine cricket club but it was many years before his invention was widely adopted scorecards were printed and sold at lord's for the first time in 1846
the introduction of scoreboards revolutionised cricket by allowing spectators to keep track of the day's play in 1848 fred lillywhite used a portable printing press at grounds to print updated scorecards in 1858 the kennington oval introduced the first mobile scorebox a house on rollers with figures for telegraphing on each side in 1881 the melbourne cricket ground erected the first cricket scoreboard the scoreboard located at the western end of the ground gave the batsman's name and method of dismissal
== in popular culture ==
=== influence on everyday life ===
cricket has had a broad impact on popular culture both in the commonwealth of nations and elsewhere cricket has had an influence on the lexicon of these nations especially the english language with such phrases as that's not cricket (unfair) had a good innings sticky wicket and bowled over there have been many cricket films the term bradmanesque from don bradman's name has become a generic term for outstanding excellence both within cricket and in the wider world
the amateur game has also been spread further afield by expatriates from the test-playing nations
=== books and games ===
c.l.r james's beyond a boundary is a popular book about the sport in fiction there is english author p g wodehouse's 1909 novel mike
cricket is a popular motif in sports-related video games examples include cricket life 1 for the pc see also list of cricket video games
=== influence on other sports ===
cricket has a close relationship with australian rules football and many players have competed at top levels in both sports in 1858 prominent australian cricketer tom wills called for the formation of a foot-ball club with a code of laws to keep cricketers fit during the off-season the following year wills and other victorian cricketers founded the melbourne football club and codified the first laws of the game it is typically played on modified cricket fields and borrows terminology from cricket such as umpire and sledging
in the late 19th century a former cricket player english-born henry chadwick of brooklyn new york was responsible for the development of the box score tabular standings the annual baseball guide the batting average and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball the statistical record is so central to the game's historical essence that chadwick came to be known as father of baseball
