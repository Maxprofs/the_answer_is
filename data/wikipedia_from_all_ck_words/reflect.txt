in chinese culture there is not much participation in physical contact especially when doing business because this can be seen as too casual thus disrespectful it is considered rude to slap pat or put one's arm around the shoulders of another however affection in same-sex friendships in east asia is much more pronounced than in the west same-sex friends will often be seen with their arms around one another holding hands and other signs of physical affection
it is uncommon to see very many hand gestures being used in chinese culture because this is often considered to be excessive the chinese sometimes do not smile or exchange greetings with strangers smiling or being friendly to someone you do not know well can be considered rude and too familiar it is also common to see chinese women covering their mouths when they laugh traditionally a woman who laughed too loudly was considered to be uncouth and ill bred
traditionally there was not much hand-shaking in chinese culture however this gesture is now widely practiced among men especially when greeting westerners or other foreigners many westerners may find chinese handshakes to be too long or too weak but this is because a weaker handshake is a gesture of humility and respect
