hearts is an evasion-type trick-taking playing card game for four players although variations can accommodate 36 players the game is also known as black lady the dirty dark lady slippery anne chase the lady crubs black queen and black maria though any of these may refer to the similar but differently-scored game black lady the game is a member of the whist family of trick-taking games (which also includes bridge and spades) but the game is unique among whist variants in that it is an evasion-type game players avoid winning certain penalty cards in tricks usually by avoiding winning tricks altogether
== history ==
the game of hearts as currently known originated with a family of related games called reversis which became popular around 1750 in spain in this game a penalty point was awarded for trick won plus additional points for capturing the jack of hearts or the queen of hearts a similar game called four jacks centered around avoiding any trick containing a jack which were worth one penalty point and the jack of spades worth two
over time additional penalty cards were added to reversis and around 1850 the game gave way to a simple variant of hearts where each heart was worth 1 point the queen of spades (sometimes referred to as calamity jane") was introduced in a variant called black maria which then became known as the standard hearts game and soon thereafter the idea of shooting the moon was introduced to the game to add depth to the gameplay in the 1920s the jack of diamonds variation (ten positive points) was introduced and some time later the scoring was reversed so that penalty points were expressed as positive instead of negative passing cards breaking hearts leading the two of clubs and shooting the foot, whereby a player attempts to shoot the moon but succeeds in taking the queen and all but one heart are more recent additions
the game has become popular in live play among grade school students in canada and has increased in popularity through internet gaming sites it also became known through the microsoft version of the game packaged with most 1990s workstation versions of its windows operating system beginning in version 3.1
== method ==
the overall objective is to be the player with the fewest points by the end of the game
=== dealing the cards ===
thirteen cards are dealt to each player
when there are only three players the 2 is removed from the deck before play commences and each player receives 17 cards in another alternative a randomly chosen card is set aside face down at the beginning of play (the kitty") this card goes to whoever takes the first heart or alternatively the first trick
when there are five players the 2 is removed as well as the 2 and each player receives 10 cards alternatively three jokers (usually the two from one deck plus one from a similar deck) can be added and each player receives 11 in another alternative two randomly chosen cards are set aside face down at the beginning of play these cards go to whoever takes the first heart
when there are six players two jokers are inserted and each player receives eight cards
when there are more than six players two decks may be used with cards removed or jokers added to ensure an even deal
=== passing cards ===
the basic game of hearts does not include card passing but the most common variants do before each hand begins each player chooses three cards and passes them to another player the main objectives of passing are to try to become short or void in a suit and thus able to play off-suit when that suit is led or to rid one's hand of dangerous cards that will likely force that player to take a trick containing penalty points such as the ace king or queen of any suit (especially spades and hearts) there are many variations on passing the most common (popularized by computer versions) rotates passing through four deals on the first deal players pass to the left the second deal to the right the third across the table on the fourth deal no cards are passed the cycle of four deals is then repeated
other variations on the passing rules include
subsets of the four-deal passing sequence may occur such as only passing in one direction or passing alternately left and right
when playing with an odd number of players passing across is not possible with five players the players may choose only two cards and pass one each to the two players situated closest to the exact opposite side of the table this system is called star-passing because the pattern of passing routes forms a five-point star
alternatively with an odd number of players players choose three cards and discard them to a central pile the dealer then gathers shuffles and re-deals these cards this method is known as a center mixer
passing the a k and/or q may be prohibited
when there are more than four players only two cards can be passed
the dealer chooses the number of cards to be passed and the direction of passing
=== game play ===
the game is played like most other trick-taking games the first trick is led by the player to the left of the dealer each other player in clockwise order then plays a card from their hand players must follow suit that is play a card of the same suit as the lead card if they are able if they are not able to do so they can play any card (an action known as sloughing or discarding") including a penalty heart or the queen of spades the trick and any penalty points it contains are won by the player who played the highest-value card of the suit that was led that player then becomes the lead player for the next trick and play continues until all players have exhausted their hands
there are some common variants to this play
the player holding the 2 must lead it to begin the first trick in variations with the 2 removed play starts with the 3
no penalty card may be played on the first trick ("no bleeding on the first trick") the chance of being dealt a hand composed entirely of standard penalty cards and thus being forced to break this rule is
(roughly 1 in 45 billion) this becomes more likely when other penalty cards are introduced as part of a variant
hearts cannot be led until they have been broken (discarded on the lead of another suit) unless the player who must lead has nothing but hearts remaining in hand in some variations any penalty card including the q can break hearts
in a sub-variation of the above if a player's hand contains nothing but hearts and other penalty cards even if hearts have not been broken the player can lead a heart hearts are of course broken by this play
if jokers are used rules must be defined concerning their play common conventions include
two distinct jokers are designated as the zero of clubs and the zero of diamonds and behave just like ordinary clubs and diamonds
non-distinct jokers are valueless cards that cannot win tricks they may be played at all times (except to lead tricks) or perhaps only when following suit is not possible
jokers may also be considered as penalty cards they may behave as normal penalty cards or they might only score if played to a heart trick
jokers may be allowed to lead if they are the leading player calls a suit which must be followed or the lead suit may be determined by the next card played
if the game uses multiple decks and two identical cards tie for taking the trick the most recently played card takes precedence cancellation hearts (see the variations section) defines different behavior involving identical cards
=== scoring ===
each heart taken in a trick scores one penalty point against the player winning the trick and taking the q costs 13 penalty points there are thus 26 penalty points in each deal the game usually ends when one player reaches or exceeds 100 points or in some variations after a predetermined number of deals or period of time in any of these cases the winning player is the one with the fewest penalty points
it is also possible to score with chips all players contribute one chip to a central pool of chips the pool is divided equally among those players taking no penalty cards on a deal if all players take penalty cards the pool remains on the table and is added to the next pool once one player has won all available chips or once another player has run out the game ends
==== scoring variants ====
there are many scoring variants including
the j is a bonus card subtracting 10 penalty points from the player who captures it this is called the omnibus variant the bonus may or may not be allowed to carry that is the bonus may not be allowed to produce a hand score and/or a running total of less than zero for the player capturing it
there are several ways to reallocate the points in penalty cards for example
higher penalties may be assigned for the high hearts e.g j = 2 points q = 3 points k = 4 points and a = 5 points
2 = 2 points 3 = 3 points 4 = 4 points etc. the jack queen king and ace are worth 10 points each and q = 25 points the penalty cards then total to 119 similar to schwarze katze
same as above but j = 11 points q = 12 points k = 13 points and a = 14 points q has no value this variant is called pip hearts
additional penalty cards may include a k and 10 the 7 is worth seven points in a variant called hooligan hearts
players reaching exactly 50 or 100 points at the end of a round may subtract 50 points from their scores
players who take no tricks in a deal may subtract five points from their scores
before the first trick in a round a player may predict that he or she will not take any hearts on the upcoming hand if the pledge is successful 10 penalty points are deducted but 10 points are added if it fails
=== shooting the moon ===
shooting the moon also known as getting control capmangoe or running is a very common scoring variant if one player takes all the penalty cards on one deal that player's score remains unchanged while 26 penalty points are added to the scores of each of the other players this is known as playing by old moon rules in the new moon rules the player subtracts 26 points from his or her own score instead of adding 26 to the others attempting to shoot the moon is often a risky strategy as failure to capture every single penalty card will result in the remaining penalty points (as many as 25) being added to one's score
there are several sub-variations to these rules
a player who shoots the moon may have a choice between old moon or new moon
a player who shoots the moon may be required to use the old moon rules unless doing so would end the game with the shooter losing (e.g. in a 100-point game if the shooter has 90 another player 95 and the leader 63 adding on a moon would sink the shooter) in such a case the player may use new moon instead
a player who shoots the moon may only use new moon after he or she or perhaps another player has reached a predetermined score
a player who takes all thirteen tricks thus shooting the moon may add 52 points to the other players scores subject to the other variations listed above this is known as shooting pluto shooting the sun or shooting the blue moon
a player who takes all thirteen tricks may add 52 points to the player who passed to him or her at the beginning of the round while the others each receive 26 this is known as the punishment rule
a player who takes all thirteen tricks reverts their score from the entire game to 0 this is known as cleaning the slate
a player who takes all of the penalty cards but fails to shoot the sun scores normally instead of shooting the moon
the first trick of a hand does not count for shooting the sun only the following twelve tricks are required this allows a player who holds the two of clubs to shoot the sun
if a player receives 260 points (26 points every round) over ten rounds all other players may receive 260 points and the player finishes with a score of 0 or all other players receive 100 in a normal game this variant is called shooting the big moon
== variations ==
booster nines if a nine is played the trick is extended by one round
complex hearts a variant by game designer richard garfield using the complex number system hearts are worth one point each q = 13i j = -10 and 10 multiplies the score for the given hand by 2i the first player to reach an absolute value of 100 is the loser
danger hearts ten rounds are played using standard scoring and each player has three lives if a player receives 15 or more points in a round he or she loses a life
cancellation hearts for 5 to 11 players using two decks shuffled together if exactly the same card is played twice in one trick the cards cancel each other and neither can win the trick if two of such pairs appear in the same trick the whole trick is canceled and the cards are given to the winner of the next trick
gong zhu or chinese hearts () (pinyin gng zh literally chase the pig") cards have negative values instead of positive penalties 5 through 10 = -10 j = -20 q = -30 k = -40 a = -50 q = -100 j = +100 and 10 doubles the score for the round
joker hearts one or more jokers are added which can be played any time (regardless if following suit is possible) they cannot win tricks or score any penalty points
likha a middle eastern variant it is played with partners who sit across from each other strategically playing to feed their opponents points both the q and the 10 are referred to as the likha q is worth 13 points 10 is worth 10 points and every heart is worth only 1 point the game is played up to 101 each player's points are scored individually whichever player reaches this score first that team loses if two or more players from opposite teams go over then the one with the higher score loses shooting the moon inflicts a 37-point penalty instead of an award
partnership hearts players seated opposite each other form two-person teams team members combine their scores a team that successfully shoots the moon causes the other to earn 52 penalty points
queens all queens are worth 13 points the game ends when a player reaches 108 hearts can be led at any time and penalty cards can be played on the first trick shooting the moon inflicts the normal penalty instead of an award the dealer of each round is the player who received the q in the previous round
rickety kate exactly the same as hearts minus shooting the moon as named in australia
royal hearts a game produced by parker brothers the q is worth 26 points instead of 13 q doubles the point value of all hearts taken by that player q is worth 10 points and q negates the q's point value if both are captured by the same player
small hearts the 2s through 7s of each suit are taken out forming a piquet pack the 8 leads each heart is worth one point the q is worth seven points and j is optionally worth 5 points shooting the moon awards 14 points
== strategy ==
with the exception of trying to shoot the moon in hearts players attempt to discard high cards without winning points this can either be accomplished by creating a void or playing the last card in a trick that has no points in general it is advantageous to play the highest card possible without winning the trick players particularly concentrate on getting rid of high cards in suits that they do not have padding low cards in for example if a player had the 2,3,4,5 and ace of spades the ace would not be much of an issue because they can play the 4 lower cards before they will be forced to play the ace in contrast if they only had the ace of spades then they would be forced to play the ace the first time spades were led
=== voids ===
a void is when a player does not have any cards of a certain suit generally this is a highly advantageous situation because it prevents the player from winning any points in that suit and provides a means to dispose of poor cards these can be intentionally created with good passing strategy or appear by themselves
=== bleeding spades ===
if a player does not have the ace king or queen of spades it is to that player's advantage to play spades to try to force the queen of spades onto another player
=== shooting the moon ===
shooting the moon can rapidly change the direction of a game in a player's favor however it is also very risky a good hand for shooting the moon should contain significant high cards in addition to a long run of a single suit that can be used to keep the lead once the other players have run out of that suit
=== passing strategy ===
in general when passing the player is trying to both get rid of bad cards and create voids to get rid of bad cards they may receive the ace and king of spades are two of the most important cards to get rid of because they are higher than the queen of spades in addition high hearts can be dangerous when creating voids it is best to do that in either clubs or diamonds because players want to avoid receiving high hearts or spades without having any padding
