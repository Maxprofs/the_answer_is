in soil science humus (coined 17901800 from the latin humus earth ground) refers to the fraction of soil organic matter that is amorphous and without the cellular structure characteristic of plants micro-organisms or animals. humus significantly influences the bulk density of soil and contributes to moisture and nutrient retention soil formation begins with the weathering of humus in agriculture humus is sometimes also used to describe mature or natural compost extracted from a forest or other spontaneous source for use to amend soil it is also used to describe a topsoil horizon that contains organic matter (humus type humus form humus profile)
== humification ==
=== transformation of organic matter into humus ===
the process of humification can occur naturally in soil or in the production of compost the importance of chemically stable humus is thought by some to be the fertility it provides to soils in both a physical and chemical sense though some agricultural experts put a greater focus on other features of it such as its ability to suppress disease it helps the soil retain moisture by increasing microporosity and encourages the formation of good soil structure the incorporation of oxygen into large organic molecular assemblages generates many active negatively charged sites that bind to positively charged ions (cations) of plant nutrients making them more available to the plant by way of ion exchange humus allows soil organisms to feed and reproduce and is often described as the life-force of the soil
it is difficult to define humus precisely it is a highly complex substance which is still not fully understood humus should be differentiated from decomposing organic matter the latter is rough-looking material and remains of the original plant are still visible fully humified organic matter on the other hand has a uniform dark spongy jelly-like appearance and is amorphous it may remain like this for millennia or more it has no determinate shape structure or character however humified organic matter when examined under the microscope may reveal tiny plant animal or microbial remains that have been mechanically but not chemically degraded this suggests a fuzzy boundary between humus and organic matter in most literature humus is considered an integral part of soil organic matter
plant remains (including those that passed through an animal gut and were excreted as feces) contain organic compounds sugars starches proteins carbohydrates lignins waxes resins and organic acids the process of organic matter decay in the soil begins with the decomposition of sugars and starches from carbohydrates which break down easily as detritivores initially invade the dead plant organs while the remaining cellulose and lignin break down more slowly simple proteins organic acids starches and sugars break down rapidly while crude proteins fats waxes and resins remain relatively unchanged for longer periods of time lignin which is quickly transformed by white-rot fungi is one of the main precursors of humus together with by-products of microbial and animal activity the end-product of this process the humus is thus a mixture of compounds and complex life chemicals of plant animal or microbial origin that has many functions and benefits in the soil earthworm humus (vermicompost) is considered by some to be the best organic manure there is
=== stability ===
much of the humus in most soils has persisted for more than a hundred years (rather than having been decomposed to co2) and can be regarded as stable this is organic matter that has been protected from decomposition by microbial or enzyme action because it is hidden (occluded) inside small aggregates of soil particles or tightly attached (sorbed or complexed) to clays most humus that is not protected in this way is decomposed within ten years and can be regarded as less stable or more labile thus stable humus contributes little to the pool of plant-available nutrients in the soil but it does play a part in maintaining its physical structure a very stable form of humus is that formed from the slow oxidation of black carbon after the incorporation of finely powdered charcoal into the topsoil this process is thought to have been important in the formation of the fertile amazonian dark earths or terra preta do indio
=== horizons ===
humus has a characteristic black or dark brown color and is organic due to an accumulation of organic carbon soil scientists use the capital letters o a b c and e to identify the master horizons and lowercase letters for distinctions of these horizons most soils have three major horizonsthe surface horizon (a) the subsoil (b) and the substratum (c) some soils have an organic horizon (o) on the surface but this horizon can also be buried the master horizon e is used for subsurface horizons that have a significant loss of minerals (eluviation) hard bedrock which is not soil uses the letter r
== benefits of soil organic matter and humus ==
the process that converts raw organic matter into humus feeds the soil population of microorganisms and other creatures thus maintains high and healthy levels of soil life
the rate at which raw organic matter is converted into humus promotes (when fast) or limits (when slow) the coexistence of plants animals and microbes in soil
effective humus and stable humus are further sources of nutrients to microbes the former provides a readily available supply and the latter acts as a longer-term storage reservoir
decomposition of dead plant material causes complex organic compounds to be slowly oxidized (lignin-like humus) or to break down into simpler forms (sugars and amino sugars aliphatic and phenolic organic acids) which are further transformed into microbial biomass (microbial humus) or are reorganized and further oxidized into humic assemblages (fulvic and humic acids) which bind to clay minerals and metal hydroxides there has been a long debate about the ability of plants to uptake humic substances from their root systems and to metabolize them there is now a consensus about how humus plays a hormonal role rather than simply a nutritional role in plant physiology
humus is a colloidal substance and increases the soil's cation exchange capacity hence its ability to store nutrients by chelation while these nutrient cations are accessible to plants they are held in the soil safe from being leached by rain or irrigation
humus can hold the equivalent of 8090% of its weight in moisture and therefore increases the soil's capacity to withstand drought conditions
the biochemical structure of humus enables it to moderate or buffer excessive acid or alkaline soil conditions
during the humification process microbes secrete sticky gum-like mucilages these contribute to the crumb structure (tilth) of the soil by holding particles together and allowing greater aeration of the soil toxic substances such as heavy metals as well as excess nutrients can be chelated (that is bound to the complex organic molecules of humus) and so prevented from entering the wider ecosystem
the dark color of humus (usually black or dark brown) helps to warm up cold soils in the spring
