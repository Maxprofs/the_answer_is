hormone synthesis may occur specific tissues endocrine glands specialized cells hormone synthesis occurs response specific biochemical signals induced wide range regulatory systems instance ionized calcium concentration affects pth synthesis whereas glucose concentration affects insulin synthesis regulation hormone synthesis gonadal adrenal thyroid hormones often dependent complex sets direct influence feedback interactions involving hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal hpa gonadal hpg thyroid hpt axes
upon secretion certain hormones including protein hormones catecholamines watersoluble thus readily transported circulatory system hormones including steroid thyroid hormones lipidsoluble allow widespread distribution hormones must bond carrier plasma glycoproteins eg thyroxinebinding globulin tbg form ligandprotein complexes hormones completely active released bloodstream case insulin growth hormones others prohormones must activated specific cells series activation steps commonly highly regulated endocrine system secretes hormones directly bloodstream typically fenestrated capillaries whereas exocrine system secretes hormones indirectly using ducts hormones paracrine function diffuse interstitial spaces nearby target tissue
overview
hormonal signaling involves following steps
biosynthesis particular hormone particular tissue
storage secretion hormone
transport hormone target cells
recognition hormone associated cell membrane intracellular receptor protein
relay amplification received hormonal signal via signal transduction process leads cellular response reaction target cells may recognized original hormoneproducing cells leading downregulation hormone production example homeostatic negative feedback loop
breakdown hormone
hormone cells typically specialized cell type residing within particular endocrine gland thyroid gland ovaries testes hormones exit cell origin via exocytosis another means membrane transport hierarchical model oversimplification hormonal signaling process cellular recipients particular hormonal signal may one several cell types reside within number different tissues case insulin triggers diverse range systemic physiological effects different tissue types may also respond differently hormonal signal
regulation
rate hormone biosynthesis secretion often regulated homeostatic negative feedback control mechanism mechanism depends factors influence metabolism excretion hormones thus higher hormone concentration alone cannot trigger negative feedback mechanism negative feedback must triggered overproduction effect hormone

environmental changes eg light temperature
one special group hormones tropic hormones stimulate hormone production endocrine glands example thyroidstimulating hormone tsh causes growth increased activity another endocrine gland thyroid increases output thyroid hormones
release active hormones quickly circulation hormone biosynthetic cells may produce store biologically inactive hormones form pre prohormones quickly converted active hormone form response particular stimulus
eicosanoids considered act local hormones
receptors
hormones initiate cellular response initially binding either cell membrane associated intracellular receptors cell may several different receptor types recognize hormone activate different signal transduction pathways cell may several different receptors recognize different hormones activate biochemical pathway
receptors peptide well many eicosanoid hormones embedded plasma membrane surface cell majority receptors belong g proteincoupled receptor gpcr class seven alpha helix transmembrane proteins interaction hormone receptor typically triggers cascade secondary effects within cytoplasm cell often involving phosphorylation dephosphorylation various cytoplasmic proteins changes ion channel permeability increased concentrations intracellular molecules may act secondary messengers eg cyclic amp protein hormones also interact intracellular receptors located cytoplasm nucleus intracrine mechanism
steroid thyroid hormones receptors located inside cell within cytoplasm target cell receptors belong nuclear receptor family ligandactivated transcription factors bind receptors hormones must first cross cell membrane lipidsoluble combined hormonereceptor complex moves across nuclear membrane nucleus cell binds specific dna sequences regulating expression certain genes thereby increasing levels proteins encoded genes however shown steroid receptors located inside cell associated plasma membrane

chemical classes
hormones defined functionally structurally may diverse chemical structures hormones occur multicellular organisms plants animals fungi brown algae red algae compounds occur also unicellular organisms may act signaling molecules consensus case called hormones
animal
vertebrate hormones fall four main chemical classes
amino acid derived examples include melatonin thyroxine
peptides polypeptides proteins small peptide hormones include trh vasopressin peptides composed scores hundreds amino acids referred proteins examples protein hormones include insulin growth hormone complex protein hormones bear carbohydrate sidechains called glycoprotein hormones luteinizing hormone folliclestimulating hormone thyroidstimulating hormone examples glycoprotein hormones
eicosanoids hormones derive lipids arachidonic acid lipoxins prostaglandins
steroid examples steroid hormones include sex hormones estradiol testosterone well stress hormone cortisol
compared vertebrate insects crustaceans possess number structurally unusual hormones juvenile hormone sesquiterpenoid
plant
plant hormones include abscisic acid auxin cytokinin ethylene gibberellin
therapeutic use
many hormones analogues used medication commonly prescribed hormones estrogens progestogens methods hormonal contraception hrt thyroxine levothyroxine hypothyroidism steroids autoimmune diseases several respiratory disorders insulin used many diabetics local preparations use otolaryngology often contain pharmacologic equivalents adrenaline steroid vitamin d creams used extensively dermatological practice
pharmacologic dose supraphysiological dose hormone medical usage referring amount hormone far greater naturally occurs healthy body effects pharmacologic doses hormones may different responses naturally occurring amounts may therapeutically useful though without potentially adverse side effects example ability pharmacologic doses glucocorticoids suppress inflammation
hormonebehavior interactions
neurological level behavior inferred based hormone concentrations hormonerelease patterns numbers locations hormone receptors efficiency hormone receptors involved gene transcription hormones influence behavior also behavior environment influence hormones thus feedback loop formed example behavior affect hormones turn affect behavior turn affect hormones
three broad stages reasoning may used determining hormonebehavior interactions
frequency occurrence hormonally dependent behavior correspond hormonal source
hormonally dependent behavior expected hormonal source types action nonexistent
reintroduction missing behaviorally dependent hormonal source types action expected bring back absent behavior
comparison neurotransmitters
various clear distinctions hormones neurotransmitters
hormone perform functions larger spatial temporal scale neurotransmitter
hormonal signals travel virtually anywhere circulatory system whereas neural signals restricted preexisting nerve tracts
assuming travel distance equivalent neural signals transmitted much quickly range milliseconds hormonal signals range seconds minutes hours neural signals sent speeds meters per second
neural signalling allornothing digital action whereas hormonal signalling action continuously variable dependent upon hormone concentration
