first reptiles
rise water
reptiles first arose amphibians swamps late carboniferous increasing evolutionary pressure vast untouched niches land powered evolutionary changes amphibians gradually become land based environmental selection propelled development certain traits stronger skeletal structure muscles protective coating scales became favorable basic foundation reptiles founded evolution lungs legs main transitional steps towards reptiles development hardshelled external eggs replacing amphibious water bound eggs defining feature class reptilia allowed amphibians fully leave water another major difference amphibians increased brain size specifically enlarged cerebrum cerebellum although brain size small compared birds mammals enhancements prove vital hunting strategies reptiles increased size two regions brain allowed improved motor skills increase sensory development
early reptiles
origin reptiles lies million years ago swamps late carboniferous period first reptiles evolved advanced reptiliomorph labyrinthodonts oldest known animal may amniote reptile rather amphibian casineria though also argued temnospondyl amphibian
series footprints fossil strata nova scotia dated million years show typical reptilian toes imprints scales tracks attributed hylonomus oldest unquestionable reptile known small lizardlike animal cm long numerous sharp teeth indicating insectivorous diet
examples include westlothiana sometimes considered reptiliomorph amphibian rather true amniote paleothyris similar build presumably similar habit one best known early reptiles mesosaurus genus early permian returned water feeding fish
earliest reptiles largely overshadowed bigger labyrinthodont amphibians cochleosaurus remained small inconspicuous part fauna small ice age end carboniferous
anapsids synapsids diapsids sauropsids
traditionally assumed first reptiles anapsids solid skull holes nose eyes spinal cord etc discoveries synapsidlike openings skull roof skulls several members parareptilia including lanthanosuchoids millerettids bolosaurids nycteroleterids procolophonoids least mesosaurs made ambiguous currently uncertain whether ancestral reptile anapsidlike synapsidlike skull soon first reptiles appeared split two branches one branch synapsida including mammallike reptiles modern extant mammals one opening skull roof behind eye branch sauropsida divided two main groups one aforementioned parareptilia contained taxa anapsidlike skull well taxa one opening behind eye see members group diapsida possessed hole skulls behind eye along second hole located higher skull function holes synapsids diapsids lighten skull give room jaw muscles move allowing powerful bite
turtles traditionally believed surviving anapsids basis skull structure rationale classification disputed arguing turtles diapsids reverted primitive state order improve armor see parareptilia later morphological phylogenetic studies mind placed turtles firmly within diapsida molecular studies strongly upheld placement turtles within diapsids commonly sister group extant archosaurs

permian reptiles
near end carboniferous terrestrial reptiliomorph labyrinthodonts still present synapsids evolved first fully terrestrial large vertebrates pelycosaurs edaphosaurus midpermian period climate turned dryer resulting change fauna primitive pelycosaurs replaced advanced therapsids
anapsid reptiles whose massive skull roofs postorbital holes continued flourished throughout permian pareiasaurs reached giant proportions late permian eventually disappearing close period
late period diapsid reptiles split two main lineages archosaurs ancestors crocodiles dinosaurs lepidosaurs predecessors modern tuataras lizards snakes groups remained lizardlike relatively small inconspicuous permian

demise dinosaurs
close cretaceous period saw demise mesozoic era reptilian megafauna along massive amount volcanic activity time meteor impact created cretaceouspaleogene boundary accepted main cause mass extinction event large marine reptiles sea turtles left dinosaurs small feathered theropods survived form birds end age reptiles led age mammals despite change phrasing reptile diversification continued throughout cenozoic today squamates make majority extant reptiles today approximately extant species reptiles compared species mammals number reptilian species without birds nearly twice number mammals
role reversal
cretaceouspaleogene extinction event wiped nonavian dinosaurs birds generally regarded surviving dinosaurs several mammalian groups placental marsupial mammals diversified many new forms ecological niches throughout paleogene neogene eras reached enormous sizes almost wide variation dinosaurs nevertheless mammalian megafauna never quite reached skyscraper heights sauropods
nonetheless large reptiles still composed important megafaunal components giant tortoises large crocodilians locally large varanids
four orders reptilia
testudines
testudines turtles may evolved anaspids exact origin unknown heavily debated fossils date back around million years ago share remarkably similar characteristics first turtles retain body plan modern testudines mostly herbivorous feeding exclusively small marine organisms trademark shell believed evolved extensions backbone widened ribs fused together supported fossil odontochelys semitestacea incomplete shell originating ribs back bone species also teeth beak giving support transitional fossil although claim still controversial shell evolved protect predators also slows land based species great amount caused many species go extinct recent times alien species outcompeting food inability escape humans many endangered species order
sphenodontia
sphenodontians arose mid triassic consists single genus tuatara comprises two endangered species live new zealand minor surrounding islands evolutionary history filled many species recent paleogenetic discoveries show tuataras prone quick speciation
squamata
