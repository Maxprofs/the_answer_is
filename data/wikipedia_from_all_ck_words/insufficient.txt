hasty generalization is an informal fallacy of faulty generalization by reaching an inductive generalization based on insufficient evidenceessentially making a hasty conclusion without considering all of the variables in statistics it may involve basing broad conclusions regarding the statistics of a survey from a small sample group that fails to sufficiently represent an entire population its opposite fallacy is called slothful induction or denying a reasonable conclusion of an inductive argument (e.g it was just a coincidence")
== examplesedit ==
hasty generalization usually shows this pattern
x is true for a
x is true for b
x is true for c
x is true for d
therefore x is true for e f g etc
for example if a person travels through a town for the first time and sees 10 people all of them children he may erroneously conclude that there are no adult residents in the town
or a person is looking at a number line the number 1 is a square number 3 is a prime number 5 is a prime number and 7 is a prime number 9 is a square number 11 is a prime number and 13 is a prime number therefore the person says all odd numbers are either prime or square in reality 15 is a counterexample
