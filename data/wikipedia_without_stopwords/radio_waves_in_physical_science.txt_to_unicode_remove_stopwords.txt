etymologyedit
term radio derived latin word radius meaning spoke wheel beam light ray first applied communications suggestion french scientist ernest mercadier alexander graham bell adopted radiophone meaning radiated sound alternate name photophone optical transmission system however invention would widely adopted
following heinrich hertzs establishment existence electromagnetic radiation late variety terms initially used phenomenon early descriptions radiation including hertzian waves electric waves ether waves phrases describing use communications included spark telegraphy space telegraphy aerography eventually commonly wireless telegraphy however wireless included broad variety related electronic technologies including electrostatic induction electromagnetic induction aquatic earth conduction need precise term referring exclusively electromagnetic radiation
first use radio conjunction electromagnetic radiation appears french physicist douard branly developed version coherer receiver called radioconducteur radio prefix later used form additional descriptive compound hyphenated words especially europe example early british publication practical engineer included reference radiotelegraph radiotelegraphy french text berlin radiotelegraphic conventions includes phrases radiotlgraphique radiotlgrammes
use radio standalone word dates back least december instructions issued british post office transmitting telegrams specified word radio sent service instructions practice universally adopted word radio introduced internationally berlin radiotelegraphic convention included service regulation specifying radiotelegrams shall show preamble service radio
