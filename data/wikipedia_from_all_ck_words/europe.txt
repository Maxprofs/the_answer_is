europe (/jrp/ or /jrp/) is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of eurasia europe is bordered by the arctic ocean to the north the atlantic ocean to the west and the mediterranean sea to the south to the east and southeast europe is generally considered as separated from asia by the watershed divides of the ural and caucasus mountains the ural river the caspian and black seas and the waterways of the turkish straits yet the borders of europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary as the primarily physiographic term continent also incorporates cultural and political elements
europe is the world's second-smallest continent by surface area covering about 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000 sq mi) or 2% of the earth's surface and about 6.8% of its land area of europe's approximately 50 countries russia is by far the largest by both area and population taking up 40% of the continent (although the country has territory in both europe and asia) while vatican city is the smallest europe is the third-most populous continent after asia and africa with a population of 739743 million or about 11% of the world's population europe has a climate heavily affected by warm atlantic currents tempering winters and enabling warm summers on most of the continent even on latitudes that have severe climates in north america and asia further from the atlantic seasonal differences increase but the mildness of the climate remains
europe in particular ancient greece is the birthplace of western culture the fall of the western roman empire during the migration period marked the end of ancient history and the beginning of an era known as the middle ages the renaissance humanism exploration art and science led the old continent and eventually the rest of the world to the modern era from this period onwards europe played a predominant role in global affairs between the 16th and 20th centuries european nations controlled at various times the americas most of africa oceania and the majority of asia
the industrial revolution which began in great britain around the end of the 18th century gave rise to radical economic cultural and social change in western europe and eventually the wider world demographic growth meant that by 1900 europe's share of the world's population was 25% both world wars were largely focused upon europe greatly contributing to a decline in western european dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the united states and soviet union took prominence during the cold war europe was divided along the iron curtain between nato in the west and the warsaw pact in the east until the revolutions of 1989 and fall of the berlin wall
european integration led to the formation of the european union a political entity that lies between a confederation and a federation the eu originated in western europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the soviet union in 1991 the currency of the european union the euro is the most commonly used among europeans and the eu's schengen area abolishes border and immigration controls among most of its member states
== definition ==
the use of the term europe has developed gradually throughout history in antiquity the greek historian herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts europe asia and libya (africa) with the nile and the river phasis forming their boundariesthough he also states that some considered the river don rather than the phasis as the boundary between europe and asia europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer strabo at the river don the book of jubilees described the continents as the lands given by noah to his three sons europe was defined as stretching from the pillars of hercules at the strait of gibraltar separating it from north africa to the don separating it from asia
a cultural definition of europe as the lands of latin christendom coalesced in the 8th century signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of germanic traditions and christian-latin culture defined partly in contrast with byzantium and islam and limited to northern iberia the british isles france christianized western germany the alpine regions and northern and central italy the concept is one of the lasting legacies of the carolingian renaissance europa often figures in the letters of charlemagne's court scholar alcuin this divisionas much cultural as geographicalwas used until the late middle ages when it was challenged by the age of discovery the problem of redefining europe was finally resolved in 1730 when instead of waterways the swedish geographer and cartographer von strahlenberg proposed the ural mountains as the most significant eastern boundary a suggestion that found favour in russia and throughout europe
europe is now generally defined by geographers as the western part of eurasia with its boundaries marked by large bodies of water to the north west and south europe's limits to the far east are usually taken to be the urals the ural river and the caspian sea to the southeast including the caucasus mountains the black sea and the waterways connecting the black sea to the mediterranean sea
islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass hence iceland is generally considered to be part of europe while the nearby island of greenland is usually assigned to north america nevertheless there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences cyprus is closest to anatolia (or asia minor) but is usually considered part of europe both culturally and politically and currently is a member state of the eu malta was considered an island of north africa for centuries
the geographic boundary drawn between europe and asia in 1730 follows no international boundaries as a result attempts to organize europe along political or economic lines have resulted in uses of the name in a geopolitically limiting way to refer only to the 28 member states of the european union conversely europe has also been used in a very expansive way by the council of europe which has 47 member countries some of which territorially over-reach the ural and bosphorus lines to include all of russia and turkey in addition people in the british isles may refer to continental or mainland europe as europe
== etymology ==
in ancient greek mythology europa was a phoenician princess whom zeus abducted after assuming the form of a dazzling white bull he took her to the island of crete where she gave birth to minos rhadamanthus and sarpedon for homer europe (ancient greek  eurp see also list of greek place names) was a mythological queen of crete not a geographical designation
the etymology of europe is uncertain one theory suggests that it is derived from the greek (eurus) meaning wide broad and /-/- (ps/p-/opt-) meaning eye face countenance hence eurp wide-gazing broad of aspect (compare with glaukpis ( grey-eyed') athena or bopis ( ox-eyed') hera) broad has been an epithet of earth itself in the reconstructed proto-indo-european religion another theory suggests that it is based on a semitic word such as the akkadian erebu meaning to go down set (in reference to the sun) cognate to phoenician ereb evening west and arabic maghreb hebrew ma'arav (see also erebus pie *h1regos darkness") martin litchfield west states that phonologically the match between europa's name and any form of the semitic word is very poor however michael a barry professor in princeton university's near eastern studies department finds the mention of the word ereb on an assyrian stele with the meaning of night [the country of] sunset in opposition to asu [the country of] sunrise i.e asia (anatolia coming equally from  (sun)rise east") in the homeric hymns written in the seventh century bc eurp still represents as ereb the western shore of the aegean sea
whatever the origin of the name of the mythological figure is first used as a geographical term in the 6th century bc by greek geographers such as anaximander and hecataeus anaximander placed the boundary between asia and europe along the phasis river (the modern rioni) in the caucasus a convention still followed by herodotus in the 5th century bc but the convention received by the middle ages and surviving into modern usage is that of the roman era used by roman era authors such as posidonius strabo and ptolemy who took the tanais (the modern don river) as the boundary the term europe is first used for a cultural sphere in the carolingian renaissance of the 9th century from that time the term designated the sphere of influence of the western church as opposed to both the eastern orthodox churches and to the islamic world the modern convention enlarging the area of europe somewhat to the east and the southeast develops in the 19th century
most major world languages use words derived from europa to refer to the continent chinese for example uses the word uzhu (/) a similar chinese-derived term sh () is also sometimes used in japanese such as in the japanese name of the european union sh reng () despite the katakana yroppa () being more commonly used however in some turkic languages the originally persian name frangistan (land of the franks) is used casually in referring to much of europe besides official names such as avrupa or evropa
== history ==
=== prehistory ===
homo erectus georgicus which lived roughly 1.8 million years ago in georgia is the earliest hominid to have been discovered in europe other hominid remains dating back roughly 1 million years have been discovered in atapuerca spain neanderthal man (named after the neandertal valley in germany) appeared in europe 150,000 years ago and disappeared from the fossil record about 28,000 bc with this extinction probably due to climate change and their final refuge being present-day portugal the neanderthals were supplanted by modern humans (cro-magnons) who appeared in europe around 43 to 40 thousand years ago
the european neolithic periodmarked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of potterybegan around 7000 bc in greece and the balkans probably influenced by earlier farming practices in anatolia and the near east it spread from the balkans along the valleys of the danube and the rhine (linear pottery culture) and along the mediterranean coast (cardial culture) between 4500 and 3000 bc these central european neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artefacts in western europe the neolithic period was characterised not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments such as causewayed enclosures burial mounds and megalithic tombs the corded ware cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the neolithic to the chalcolithic during this period giant megalithic monuments such as the megalithic temples of malta and stonehenge were constructed throughout western and southern europe the european bronze age began c 3200 bc in greece
the european iron age began around 1200 bc iron age colonisation by the greeks and phoenicians gave rise to early mediterranean cities early iron age italy and greece from around the 8th century bc gradually gave rise to historical classical antiquity
=== classical antiquity ===
ancient greece was the founding culture of western civilisation western democratic and individualistic culture are often attributed to ancient greece the greeks invented the polis or city-state which played a fundamental role in their concept of identity these greek political ideals were rediscovered in the late 18th century by european philosophers and idealists greece also generated many cultural contributions in philosophy humanism and rationalism under aristotle socrates and plato in history with herodotus and thucydides in dramatic and narrative verse starting with the epic poems of homer in drama with sophocles and euripides in medicine with hippocrates and galen and in science with pythagoras euclid and archimedes
another major influence came on europe that would impact western civilisation from the roman empire which left its mark on law politics language engineering architecture government and many more aspects in western civilisation during the pax romana the roman empire expanded to encompass the entire mediterranean basin and much of europe
stoicism influenced roman emperors such as hadrian antoninus pius and marcus aurelius who all spent time on the empire's northern border fighting germanic pictish and scottish tribes christianity was eventually legitimised by constantine i after three centuries of imperial persecution
=== early middle ages ===
during the decline of the roman empire europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the age of migrations there were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the ostrogoths visigoths goths vandals huns franks angles saxons slavs avars bulgars and later on the vikings pechenegs cumans and magyars renaissance thinkers such as petrarch would later refer to this as the dark ages isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously apart from this very few written records survive and much literature philosophy mathematics and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from western europe though they were preserved in the east in the byzantine empire
from the 7th century onwards muslim arabs started to encroach on historically roman territory over the next centuries muslim forces took cyprus malta crete sicily and parts of southern italy in the east volga bulgaria became an islamic state in the 10th century between 711 and 720 most of the iberian peninsula was brought under muslim rule save for small areas in the northwest (asturias) and largely basque regions in the pyrenees this territory under the arabic name al-andalus became part of the expanding umayyad caliphate
the unsuccessful second siege of constantinople (717) weakened the umayyad dynasty and reduced their prestige the umayyads were then defeated by the frankish leader charles martel at the battle of poitiers in 732 which ended their northward advance
during the dark ages the western roman empire fell under the control of various tribes the germanic and slav tribes established their domains over western and eastern europe respectively eventually the frankish tribes were united under clovis i charlemagne a frankish king of the carolingian dynasty who had conquered most of western europe was anointed holy roman emperor by the pope in 800 this led in 962 to the founding of the holy roman empire which eventually became centred in the german principalities of central europe
east central europe saw the creation of slavic states and the adoption of christianity (circa 1000 ad) powerful west slavic state of great moravia spread its territory all the way south to the balkan slavs moravia reached its largest territorial extent under svatopluk i and caused a series of armed conflicts with east francia further south placed between the frankish empire byzantium and slavicized bulgarian empire first south slavic states emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted christianity serbian principality (later kingdom and empire) and duchy of croatia (later kingdom of croatia) to the east the kievan rus expanded from its capital in kiev to become the largest state in europe by the 10th century in 988 vladimir the great adopted orthodox christianity as the religion of state
the predominantly greek speaking eastern roman empire retroactively became known in the west as the byzantine empire its capital was constantinople emperor justinian i presided over constantinople's first golden age he established a legal code funded the construction of the hagia sophia and brought the christian church under state control during most of its existence the byzantine empire was the most powerful economic cultural and military force in europe fatally weakened by the sack of constantinople in 1204 during the fourth crusade byzantium fell in 1453 when it was conquered by the ottoman empire
=== middle ages ===
the economic growth of europe around the year 1000 together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the mediterranean sea in this context the growing independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the maritime republics a leading role in the european scene
the middle ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure the nobility and the clergy feudalism developed in france in the early middle ages and soon spread throughout europe a struggle for influence between the nobility and the monarchy in england led to the writing of the magna carta and the establishment of a parliament the primary source of culture in this period came from the roman catholic church through monasteries and cathedral schools the church was responsible for education in much of europe
the papacy reached the height of its power during the high middle ages an east-west schism in 1054 split the former roman empire religiously with the eastern orthodox church in the byzantine empire and the roman catholic church in the former western roman empire in 1095 pope urban ii called for a crusade against muslims occupying jerusalem and the holy land in europe itself the church organised the inquisition against heretics in spain the reconquista concluded with the fall of granada in 1492 ending over seven centuries of islamic rule in the iberian peninsula
in the 11th and 12th centuries constant incursions by nomadic turkic tribes such as the pechenegs and the cuman-kipchaks caused a massive migration of slavic populations to the safer heavily forested regions of the north and temporarily halted the expansion of the rus state to the south and east like many other parts of eurasia these territories were overrun by the mongols the invaders who became known as tatars were mostly turkic-speaking peoples under mongol suzerainty they established the state of the golden horde with headquarters in crimea which later adopted islam as a religion and ruled over modern-day southern and central russia for more than three centuries after the collapse of mongol dominions the first romanian states (principalities) emerged in the 14th century moldova and walachia previously these territories were under the successive control of pechenegs and cumans from the 12th to the 15th centuries the grand duchy of moscow grew from a small principality under mongol rule to the largest state in europe overthrowing the mongols in 1480 and eventually becoming the tsardom of russia the state was consolidated under ivan iii the great and ivan the terrible steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries
the great famine of 13151317 was the first crisis that would strike europe in the late middle ages the period between 1348 and 1420 witnessed the heaviest loss the population of france was reduced by half medieval britain was afflicted by 95 famines and france suffered the effects of 75 or more in the same period europe was devastated in the mid-14th century by the black death one of the most deadly pandemics in human history which killed an estimated 25 million people in europe alonea third of the european population at the time
the plague had a devastating effect on europe's social structure it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by giovanni boccaccio in the decameron (1353) it was a serious blow to the roman catholic church and led to increased persecution of jews foreigners beggars and lepers the plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying virulence and mortalities until the 18th century during this period more than 100 plague epidemics swept across europe
=== early modern period ===
the renaissance was a period of cultural change originating in florence and later spreading to the rest of europe the rise of a new humanism was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten classical greek and arabic knowledge from monastic libraries often translated from arabic into latin the renaissance spread across europe between the 14th and 16th centuries it saw the flowering of art philosophy music and the sciences under the joint patronage of royalty the nobility the roman catholic church and an emerging merchant class patrons in italy including the medici family of florentine bankers and the popes in rome funded prolific quattrocento and cinquecento artists such as raphael michelangelo and leonardo da vinci
political intrigue within the church in the mid-14th century caused the western schism during this forty-year period two popesone in avignon and one in romeclaimed rulership over the church although the schism was eventually healed in 1417 the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly
the church's power was further weakened by the protestant reformation (15171648) initially sparked by the works of german theologian martin luther an attempt to start a reform within the church the reformation also damaged the holy roman emperor's influence as german princes became divided between protestant and roman catholic faiths this eventually led to the thirty years war (16181648) which crippled the holy roman empire and devastated much of germany killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population in the aftermath of the peace of westphalia france rose to predominance within europe
the 17th century in southern central and eastern europe was a period of general decline central and eastern europe experienced more than 150 famines in a 200-year period between 1501 to 1700 from the 15th to 18th centuries when the disintegrating khanates of the golden horde were conquered by russia tatars from the crimean khanate frequently raided eastern slavic lands to capture slaves the battle of vienna in 1683 broke the advance of the ottoman turks into europe and marked the political hegemony of the habsburg dynasty in central europe the nogai horde and kazakh khanate had frequently raided the slavic-speaking areas of russia ukraine and poland for at least a hundred years until the russian expansion and conquest of most of northern eurasia (i.e eastern europe central asia and siberia)
the renaissance and the new monarchs marked the start of an age of discovery a period of exploration invention and scientific development among the great figures of the western scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries were copernicus kepler galileo and isaac newton according to peter barrett it is widely accepted that modern science arose in the europe of the 17th century (towards the end of the renaissance) introducing a new understanding of the natural world. in the 15th century portugal and spain two of the greatest naval powers of the time took the lead in exploring the world christopher columbus reached the new world in 1492 and vasco da gama opened the ocean route to the east in 1498 and soon after the spanish and portuguese began establishing colonial empires in the americas and asia france the netherlands and england soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in africa the americas and asia
=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
the age of enlightenment was a powerful intellectual movement during the 18th century promoting scientific and reason-based thoughts discontent with the aristocracy and clergy's monopoly on political power in france resulted in the french revolution and the establishment of the first republic as a result of which the monarchy and many of the nobility perished during the initial reign of terror napoleon bonaparte rose to power in the aftermath of the french revolution and established the first french empire that during the napoleonic wars grew to encompass large parts of europe before collapsing in 1815 with the battle of waterloo napoleonic rule resulted in the further dissemination of the ideals of the french revolution including that of the nation-state as well as the widespread adoption of the french models of administration law and education the congress of vienna convened after napoleon's downfall established a new balance of power in europe centred on the five great powers the uk france prussia austria and russia this balance would remain in place until the revolutions of 1848 during which liberal uprisings affected all of europe except for russia and the uk these revolutions were eventually put down by conservative elements and few reforms resulted the year 1859 saw the unification of romania as a nation-state from smaller principalities in 1867 the austro-hungarian empire was formed and 1871 saw the unifications of both italy and germany as nation-states from smaller principalities
in parallel the eastern question grew more complex ever since the ottoman defeat in the russo-turkish war (17681774) as the dissolution of the ottoman empire seemed imminent the great powers struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the ottoman domains the russian empire stood to benefit from the decline whereas the habsburg empire and britain perceived the preservation of the ottoman empire to be in their best interests meanwhile the serbian revolution and greek war of independence marked the birth of nationalism in the balkans formal recognition of the de facto independent principalities of montenegro serbia and romania ensued at the congress of berlin in 1878
the industrial revolution started in great britain in the last part of the 18th century and spread throughout europe the invention and implementation of new technologies resulted in rapid urban growth mass employment and the rise of a new working class reforms in social and economic spheres followed including the first laws on child labour the legalisation of trade unions and the abolition of slavery in britain the public health act of 1875 was passed which significantly improved living conditions in many british cities europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900 the last major famine recorded in western europe the irish potato famine caused death and mass emigration of millions of irish people in the 19th century 70 million people left europe in migrations to various european colonies abroad and to the united states
=== 20th century to the present ===
two world wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century world war i was fought between 1914 and 1918 it started when archduke franz ferdinand of austria was assassinated by the yugoslav nationalist gavrilo princip most european nations were drawn into the war which was fought between the entente powers (france belgium serbia portugal russia the united kingdom and later italy greece romania and the united states) and the central powers (austria-hungary germany bulgaria and the ottoman empire) the war left more than 16 million civilians and military dead over 60 million european soldiers were mobilised from 1914 to 1918
russia was plunged into the russian revolution which threw down the tsarist monarchy and replaced it with the communist soviet union austria-hungary and the ottoman empire collapsed and broke up into separate nations and many other nations had their borders redrawn the treaty of versailles which officially ended world war i in 1919 was harsh towards germany upon whom it placed full responsibility for the war and imposed heavy sanctions
excess deaths in russia over the course of world war i and the russian civil war (including the postwar famine) amounted to a combined total of 18 million in 19321933 under stalin's leadership confiscations of grain by the soviet authorities contributed to the second soviet famine which caused millions of deaths surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent to gulags to do forced labour stalin was also responsible for the great purge of 193738 in which the nkvd executed 681,692 people millions of people were deported and exiled to remote areas of the soviet union
economic instability caused in part by debts incurred in the first world war and loans to germany played havoc in europe in the late 1920s and 1930s this and the wall street crash of 1929 brought about the worldwide great depression helped by the economic crisis social instability and the threat of communism fascist movements developed throughout europe placing adolf hitler of nazi germany francisco franco of spain and benito mussolini of italy in power
in 1933 hitler became the leader of germany and began to work towards his goal of building greater germany germany re-expanded and took back the saarland and rhineland in 1935 and 1936 in 1938 austria became a part of germany following the anschluss later that year following the munich agreement signed by germany france the united kingdom and italy germany annexed the sudetenland which was a part of czechoslovakia inhabited by ethnic germans and in early 1939 the remainder of czechoslovakia was split into the protectorate of bohemia and moravia controlled by germany and the slovak republic at the time britain and france preferred a policy of appeasement
with tensions mounting between germany and poland over the future of danzig the germans turned to the soviets and signed the molotovribbentrop pact which allowed the soviets to invade the baltic states and parts of poland and romania germany invaded poland on 1 september 1939 prompting france and the united kingdom to declare war on germany on 3 september opening the european theatre of world war ii the soviet invasion of poland started on 17 september and poland fell soon thereafter on 24 september the soviet union attacked the baltic countries and later finland the british hoped to land at narvik and send troops to aid finland but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle germany and cut the germans off from scandinavian resources around the same time germany moved troops into denmark the phoney war continued
in may 1940 germany attacked france through the low countries france capitulated in june 1940 by august germany began a bombing offensive on britain but failed to convince the britons to give up in 1941 germany invaded the soviet union in the operation barbarossa on 7 december 1941 japan's attack on pearl harbor drew the united states into the conflict as allies of the british empire and other allied forces
after the staggering battle of stalingrad in 1943 the german offensive in the soviet union turned into a continual fallback the battle of kursk which involved the largest tank battle in history was the last major german offensive on the eastern front in 1944 british and american forces invaded france in the d-day landings opening a new front against germany berlin finally fell in 1945 ending world war ii in europe the war was the largest and most destructive in human history with 60 million dead across the world more than 40 million people in europe had died as a result of world war ii including between 11 and 17 million people who perished during the holocaust the soviet union lost around 27 million people (mostly civilians) during the war about half of all world war ii casualties by the end of world war ii europe had more than 40 million refugees several post-war expulsions in central and eastern europe displaced a total of about 20 million people
world war i and especially world war ii diminished the eminence of western europe in world affairs after world war ii the map of europe was redrawn at the yalta conference and divided into two blocs the western countries and the communist eastern bloc separated by what was later called by winston churchill an iron curtain the united states and western europe established the nato alliance and later the soviet union and central europe established the warsaw pact
the two new superpowers the united states and the soviet union became locked in a fifty-year-long cold war centred on nuclear proliferation at the same time decolonisation which had already started after world war i gradually resulted in the independence of most of the european colonies in asia and africa in the 1980s the reforms of mikhail gorbachev and the solidarity movement in poland accelerated the collapse of the eastern bloc and the end of the cold war germany was reunited after the symbolic fall of the berlin wall in 1989 and the maps of central and eastern europe were redrawn once more
european integration also grew after world war ii the treaty of rome in 1957 established the european economic community between six western european states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market in 1967 the eec european coal and steel community and euratom formed the european community which in 1993 became the european union the eu established a parliament court and central bank and introduced the euro as a unified currency in 2004 and 2007 more central and eastern european countries began joining expanding the eu to its current size of 28 european countries and once more making europe a major economical and political centre of power
european development
== geography ==
europe makes up the western fifth of the eurasian landmass it has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent its maritime borders consist of the arctic ocean to the north the atlantic ocean to the west and the mediterranean black and caspian seas to the south land relief in europe shows great variation within relatively small areas the southern regions are more mountainous while moving north the terrain descends from the high alps pyrenees and carpathians through hilly uplands into broad low northern plains which are vast in the east this extended lowland is known as the great european plain and at its heart lies the north german plain an arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard which begins in the western parts of the islands of britain and ireland and then continues along the mountainous fjord-cut spine of norway
this description is simplified sub-regions such as the iberian peninsula and the italian peninsula contain their own complex features as does mainland central europe itself where the relief contains many plateaus river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend sub-regions like iceland britain and ireland are special cases the former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of europe while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off
=== climate ===
europe lies mainly in the temperate climate zones being subjected to prevailing westerlies
the climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the gulf stream the gulf stream is nicknamed europe's central heating because it makes europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be the gulf stream not only carries warm water to europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the atlantic ocean
therefore the average temperature throughout the year of naples is 16 c (60.8 f) while it is only 12 c (53.6 f) in new york city which is almost on the same latitude berlin germany calgary canada and irkutsk in the asian part of russia lie on around the same latitude january temperatures in berlin average around 8 c (15 f) higher than those in calgary and they are almost 22 c (40 f) higher than average temperatures in irkutsk similarly northern parts of scotland have a tempertate marine climate the yearly average temperature in city of inverness is 9.05 degrees celsius (48.3 degrees fahrenheit) however churchill manitoba canada is on roughly the same latitude and has an average temperature of -6.5 degrees celsius (20.3 degrees fahrenheit) giving it a nearly subarctic climate
=== geology ===
the geology of europe is hugely varied and complex and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent from the scottish highlands to the rolling plains of hungary
europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous southern europe and a vast partially underwater northern plain ranging from ireland in the west to the ural mountains in the east these two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the pyrenees and alps/carpathians the northern plains are delimited in the west by the scandinavian mountains and the mountainous parts of the british isles major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the celtic sea the north sea the baltic sea complex and barents sea
the northern plain contains the old geological continent of baltica and so may be regarded geologically as the main continent while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents most of the older geology of western europe existed as part of the ancient microcontinent avalonia
==== geological history ====
the geological history of europe traces back to the formation of the baltic shield (fennoscandia) and the sarmatian craton both around 2.25 billion years ago followed by the volgo-uralia shield the three together leading to the east european craton ( baltica) which became a part of the supercontinent columbia around 1.1 billion years ago baltica and arctica (as part of the laurentia block) became joined to rodinia later resplitting around 550 million years ago to reform as baltica around 440 million years ago euramerica was formed from baltica and laurentia a further joining with gondwana then leading to the formation of pangea around 190 million years ago gondwana and laurasia split apart due to the widening of the atlantic ocean finally and very soon afterwards laurasia itself split up again into laurentia (north america) and the eurasian continent the land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time via greenland leading to interchange of animal species from around 50 million years ago rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of europe and its connections with continents such as asia europe's present shape dates to the late tertiary period about five million years ago
=== biodiversity ===
having lived side-by-side with agricultural peoples for millennia europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man with the exception of fennoscandia and northern russia few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in europe except for various national parks
the main natural vegetation cover in europe is mixed forest the conditions for growth are very favourable in the north the gulf stream and north atlantic drift warm the continent southern europe could be described as having a warm but mild climate there are frequent summer droughts in this region mountain ridges also affect the conditions some of these (alps pyrenees) are oriented east-west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior others are oriented south-north (scandinavian mountains dinarides carpathians apennines) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea forests grow well on this side while on the other side the conditions are much less favourable few corners of mainland europe have not been grazed by livestock at some point in time and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems
probably 80 to 90 percent of europe was once covered by forest it stretched from the mediterranean sea to the arctic ocean though over half of europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of deforestation europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest such as the taiga of scandinavia and russia mixed rainforests of the caucasus and the cork oak forests in the western mediterranean during recent times deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted however in many cases monoculture plantations of conifers have replaced the original mixed natural forest because these grow quicker the plantations now cover vast areas of land but offer poorer habitats for many european forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure the amount of natural forest in western europe is just 23% or less in european russia 510% the country with the smallest percentage of forested area is iceland (1%) while the most forested country is finland (77%)
in temperate europe mixed forest with both broadleaf and coniferous trees dominate the most important species in central and western europe are beech and oak in the north the taiga is a mixed sprucepinebirch forest further north within russia and extreme northern scandinavia the taiga gives way to tundra as the arctic is approached in the mediterranean many olive trees have been planted which are very well adapted to its arid climate mediterranean cypress is also widely planted in southern europe the semi-arid mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest a narrow east-west tongue of eurasian grassland (the steppe) extends eastwards from ukraine and southern russia and ends in hungary and traverses into taiga to the north
glaciation during the most recent ice age and the presence of man affected the distribution of european fauna as for the animals in many parts of europe most large animals and top predator species have been hunted to extinction the woolly mammoth was extinct before the end of the neolithic period today wolves (carnivores) and bears (omnivores) are endangered once they were found in most parts of europe however deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further by the middle ages the bears habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover today the brown bear lives primarily in the balkan peninsula scandinavia and russia a small number also persist in other countries across europe (austria pyrenees etc.) but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat in addition polar bears may be found on svalbard a norwegian archipelago far north of scandinavia the wolf the second largest predator in europe after the brown bear can be found primarily in central and eastern europe and in the balkans with a handful of packs in pockets of western europe (scandinavia spain etc.)
european wild cat foxes (especially the red fox) jackal and different species of martens hedgehogs different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians different birds (owls hawks and other birds of prey)
important european herbivores are snails larvae fish different birds and mammals like rodents deer and roe deer boars and living in the mountains marmots steinbocks chamois among others a number of insects such as the small tortoiseshell butterfly add to the biodiversity
the extinction of the dwarf hippos and dwarf elephants has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the mediterranean
sea creatures are also an important part of european flora and fauna the sea flora is mainly phytoplankton important animals that live in european seas are zooplankton molluscs echinoderms different crustaceans squids and octopuses fish dolphins and whales
biodiversity is protected in europe through the council of europe's bern convention which has also been signed by the european community as well as non-european states
== political geography ==
the list below includes all entities falling even partially under any of the various common definitions of europe geographic or political the data displayed are per sources in cross-referenced articles
within the above-mentioned states are several de facto independent countries with limited to no international recognition none of them are members of the un
several dependencies and similar territories with broad autonomy are also found in europe note that the list does not include the constituent countries of the united kingdom federal states of germany and austria and autonomous territories of spain and the post-soviet republics as well as the republic of serbia
== integration ==
european integration is the process of political legal economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of states wholly or partially in europe in the present day european integration has primarily come about through the council of europe and european union in western and central europe and commonwealth of independent states in central and eastern europe and most of former soviet countries
== economy ==
as a continent the economy of europe is currently the largest on earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7 trillion compared to north america's $27.1 trillion in 2008 in 2009 europe remained the wealthiest region its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world's wealth it was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak as with other continents europe has a large variation of wealth among its countries the richer states tend to be in the west some of the central and eastern european economies are still emerging from the collapse of the soviet union and yugoslavia
the european union a political entity composed of 28 european states comprises the largest single economic area in the world 18 eu countries share the euro as a common currency five european countries rank in the top ten of the world's largest national economies in gdp (ppp) this includes (ranks according to the cia) germany (5) the uk (6) russia (7) france (8) and italy (10)
there is huge disparity between many european countries in terms of their income the richest in terms of gdp per capita is monaco with its us$172,676 per capita (2009) and the poorest is moldova with its gdp per capita of us$1,631 (2010) monaco is the richest country in terms of gdp per capita in the world according to the world bank report
=== table ===
=== pre1945 industrial growth ===
capitalism has been dominant in the western world since the end of feudalism from britain it gradually spread throughout europe the industrial revolution started in europe specifically the united kingdom in the late 18th century and the 19th century saw western europe industrialise economies were disrupted by world war i but by the beginning of world war ii they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the united states world war ii again damaged much of europe's industries
=== 19451990 the cold war ===
after world war ii the economy of the uk was in a state of ruin and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s west germany recovered quickly and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s france also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation later on spain under the leadership of franco also recovered and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the spanish miracle the majority of central and eastern european states came under the control of the soviet union and thus were members of the council for mutual economic assistance (comecon)
the states which retained a free-market system were given a large amount of aid by the united states under the marshall plan the western states moved to link their economies together providing the basis for the eu and increasing cross border trade this helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies while those states in comecon were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the cold war until 1990 the european community was expanded from 6 founding members to 12 the emphasis placed on resurrecting the west german economy led to it overtaking the uk as europe's largest economy
=== 19912007 integration and reunification ===
with the fall of communism in central and eastern europe in 1991 the post-socialist states began free market reforms poland hungary and slovenia adopted them reasonably quickly while ukraine and russia are still in the process of doing so
after east and west germany were reunited in 1990 the economy of west germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of east germany
by the millennium change the eu dominated the economy of europe comprising the five largest european economies of the time namely germany the united kingdom france italy and spain in 1999 12 of the 15 members of the eu joined the eurozone replacing their former national currencies by the common euro the three who chose to remain outside the eurozone were the united kingdom denmark and sweden the european union is now the largest economy in the world
=== 20082010 recession ===
figures released by eurostat in january 2009 confirmed that the eurozone had gone into recession in the third quarter of 2008 it impacted much of the region in early 2010 fears of a sovereign debt crisis developed concerning some countries in europe especially greece ireland spain and portugal as a result measures were taken especially for greece by the leading countries of the eurozone
the eu-27 unemployment rate was 10.3% in april 2012 recent university graduates have been unable to find work in april 2012 the unemployment rate in the eu27 for those aged 1524 was 22.4%
== demographics ==
since the renaissance europe has had a major influence in culture economics and social movements in the world the most significant inventions had their origins in the western world primarily europe and the united states approximately 70 million europeans died through war violence and famine between 1914 and 1945 some current and past issues in european demographics have included religious emigration race relations economic immigration a declining birth rate and an ageing population
in some countries such as ireland and poland access to abortion is limited it remains illegal on the island of malta furthermore three european countries (the netherlands belgium and switzerland) and the autonomous community of andalusia (spain) have allowed a limited form of voluntary euthanasia for some terminally ill people
in 2005 the population of europe was estimated to be 731 million according to the united nations which is slightly more than one-ninth of the world's population a century ago europe had nearly a quarter of the world's population the population of europe has grown in the past century but in other areas of the world (in particular africa and asia) the population has grown far more quickly among the continents europe has a relatively high population density second only to asia the most densely populated country in europe (and in the world) is monaco pan and pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct peoples of europe of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities according to un population projection europe's population may fall to about 7% of world population by 2050 or 653 million people (medium variant 556 to 777 million in low and high variants respectively) within this context significant disparities exist between regions in relation to fertility rates the average number of children per female of child bearing age is 1.52 according to some sources this rate is higher among muslims in europe the un predicts a steady population decline in central and eastern europe as a result of emigration and low birth rates
europe is home to the highest number of migrants of all global regions at 70.6 million people the iom's report said in 2005 the eu had an overall net gain from immigration of 1.8 million people this accounted for almost 85% of europe's total population growth the european union plans to open the job centres for legal migrant workers from africa in 2008 696,000 persons were given citizenship of an eu27 member state a decrease from 707,000 the previous year
emigration from europe began with spanish and portuguese settlers in the 16th century and french and english settlers in the 17th century but numbers remained relatively small until waves of mass emigration in the 19th century when millions of poor families left europe
today large populations of european descent are found on every continent european ancestry predominates in north america and to a lesser degree in south america (particularly in uruguay argentina chile and brazil while most of the other latin american countries also have a considerable population of european origins) australia and new zealand have large european derived populations africa has no countries with european-derived majorities (or with the exception of cape verde and probably so tom and prncipe depending on context) but there are significant minorities such as the white south africans in asia european-derived populations predominate in northern asia (specifically russians) some parts of northern kazakhstan and israel additionally transcontinental or geographically asian countries such as georgia armenia azerbaijan cyprus and turkey have populations historically closely related to europeans with considerable genetic and cultural affinity
=== language ===
european languages mostly fall within three indo-european language groups the romance languages derived from the latin of the roman empire the germanic languages whose ancestor language came from southern scandinavia and the slavic languages
slavic languages are most spoken by the number of native speakers in europe they are spoken in central eastern and southeastern europe romance languages are spoken primarily in south-western europe as well as in romania and moldova in central or eastern europe germanic languages are spoken in northern europe the british isles and some parts of central europe
many other languages outside the three main groups exist in europe other indo-european languages include the baltic group (that is latvian and lithuanian) the celtic group (that is irish scottish gaelic manx welsh cornish and breton) greek armenian and albanian in addition a distinct group of uralic languages (estonian finnish and hungarian) is spoken mainly in estonia finland and hungary while kartvelian languages (georgian mingrelian and svan) are spoken primarily in georgia and two other language families reside in the north caucasus (termed northeast caucasian most notably including chechen avar and lezgin and northwest caucasian notably including adyghe) maltese is the only semitic language that is official within the eu while basque is the only european language isolate turkic languages include azerbaijani and turkish in addition to the languages of minority nations in russia
multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in europe today the council of europe framework convention for the protection of national minorities and the council of europe's european charter for regional or minority languages set up a legal framework for language rights in europe
=== religion ===
historically religion in europe has been a major influence on european art culture philosophy and law the largest religion in europe is christianity with 76.2% of europeans considering themselves christians including catholic eastern orthodox and various protestant denominations (especially historically state-supported european ones such as lutheranism anglicanism and the reformed faith) the notion of europe and the western world has been intimately connected with the concept of christianity and christendom many even attribute christianity for being the link that created a unified european identity
the second most popular religion is islam (6%) concentrated mainly in the balkans and eastern europe (bosnia and herzegovina albania kosovo kazakhstan north cyprus turkey azerbaijan north caucasus and the volga-ural region) other religions including judaism hinduism and buddhism are minority religions (though tibetan buddhism is the majority religion of russia's republic of kalmykia) the 20th century saw the revival of neopaganism through movements such as wicca and druidry
europe has become a relatively secular continent with an increasing number and proportion of irreligious atheist and agnostic people which make up about 18.2% of europeans population actually the largest secular in the western world there are a particularly high number of self-described non-religious people in the czech republic estonia sweden former east germany and france
== culture ==
the culture of europe can be described as a series of overlapping cultures cultural mixes exist across the continent scholar andreas kaplan describes europe as embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances there are cultural innovations and movements sometimes at odds with each other thus the question of common culture or common values is complex
according to historian hilaire belloc for several centuries the peoples of europe based their self-identification on the remaining traces of the roman culture and on the concept of christendom because many european-wide military alliances were of religious nature the crusades (10951291) the reconquista (7111492) the battle of lepanto (1571)
