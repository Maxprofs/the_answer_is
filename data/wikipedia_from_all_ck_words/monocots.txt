monocotyledons (/mnktlidn/) also known as monocots are plants whose seeds typically contain only one embryonic leaf or cotyledon they constitute one of the major groups into which flowering plants (or angiosperms) have traditionally been divided the rest of the flowering plants having two cotyledons and being classed as dicotyledons or dicots however molecular phylogenetic research has shown that the monocots form a monophyletic group a clade since they comprise all the descendants of a common ancestor but that dicots do not form a monophyletic group monocots have almost always been recognized as a group but with various taxonomic ranks and under several different names the apg iii system of 2009 recognises a clade called monocots but does not assign it to a taxonomic rank
the monocots include about 60,000 species the largest family in this group (and in the flowering plants as a whole) by number of species are the orchids (family orchidaceae) with more than 20,000 species about half as many species belong to the true grasses poaceae who are economically the most important family of monocots in agriculture the majority of the biomass produced comes from monocots these include not only major grains (rice wheat maize etc.) but also forage grasses sugar cane and the bamboos other economically important monocot cultures include various palms (arecaceae) bananas (musaceae) gingers and their relatives turmeric and cardamom (zingiberaceae) and onions (amaryllidaceae) which includes such ubiquitously used vegetables as onions and garlic additionally plants cultivated for their blooms are also from the monocot group notably lilies daffodils irises amaryllis cannas bluebells and tulips
== description ==
the monocots or monocotyledons have a single cotyledon or embryonic leaf in their seeds historically this feature was used to contrast the monocots with the dicotyledons or dicots which typically have two cotyledons however modern research has shown that the dicots are not a natural group from a diagnostic point of view the number of cotyledons is neither a particularly useful characteristic (as they are only present for a very short period in a plant's life) nor is it completely reliable
additionally one of the most noticeable traits is that a monocot's flower is trimerous with the flower parts in threes or in multiples of threehaving three six or nine petals many monocots also have leaves with parallel veins
=== morphology compared to the (broadly defined) dicotyledons ===
the traditionally listed differences between monocotyledons and dicotyledons are as follows this is a broad sketch only not invariably applicable as there are a number of exceptions the differences indicated are more true for monocots versus eudicots
the vast majority of monocots lack a petiole in their leaves
a number of these differences are not unique to the monocots for example trimerous flowers and monosulcate pollen are also found in magnoliids exclusively adventitious roots are found also in nymphaeaceae and some of the piperaceae similarly at least one of these traits parallel leaf veins is far from universal among the monocots monocots with reticulate leaf veins are found in a wide variety of monocot families for example trillium smilax (greenbriar) and pogonia (an orchid) and the dioscoreales nevertheless this list of traits is a generally valid set of contrasts especially when contrasting monocots with eudicots rather than non-monocot flowering plants in general
=== emergence ===
some monocots such as grasses have hypogeal emergence where the mesocotyl elongates and pushes the coleoptile (which encloses and protects the shoot tip) toward the soil surface since elongation occurs above the cotyledon it is left in place in the soil where it was planted many dicots have epigeal emergence in which the hypocotyl elongates and becomes arched in the soil as the hypocotyl continues to elongate it pulls the cotyledons upward above the soil surface
=== vascular system ===
monocots have a distinctive arrangement of vascular tissue known as an atactostele in which the vascular tissue is scattered rather than arranged in concentric rings collenchyma is absent in monocot stems roots and leaves many monocots are herbaceous and do not have the ability to increase the width of a stem (secondary growth) via the same kind of vascular cambium found in non-monocot woody plants however some monocots do have secondary growth and because it does not arise from a single vascular cambium producing xylem inwards and phloem outwards it is termed anomalous secondary growth examples of large monocots which either exhibit secondary growth or can reach large sizes without it are palms (arecaceae) screwpines (pandanaceae) bananas (musaceae) yucca aloe dracaena and cordyline
== taxonomy ==
the monocots are one of the major divisions of the flowering plants or angiosperms they have been recognized as a natural group since at least the work of the english botanist john ray in the 17th century modern research based on dna has confirmed the status of the monocots as a monophyletic group or clade in contrast to the other historical divisions of the flowering plants which have had to be substantially reorganized the monocots form about a quarter of all flowering plants of some 60,000 species by far the largest number (65%) are found in two families the orchids and grasses the orchids (orchidaceae asparagales) contain about 25,000 species and the grasses (poaceae poales) about 11,000 other well known groups within the poales order include the cyperaceae (sedges) and juncaceae (rushes) and the monocots also include familiar families such as the palms (arecaceae arecales) and lilies (liliaceae liliales)
taxonomists have considerable latitude in naming this group as the monocots are a group above the rank of family article 16 of the icbn allows either a descriptive name or a name formed from the name of an included family
historically the monocotyledons were named
monocotyledoneae in the de candolle system and the engler system
monocotyledones in the bentham & hooker system and the wettstein system
class liliopsida in the takhtajan system and the cronquist system
subclass liliidae in the dahlgren system and the thorne system (1992)
clade monocots in the angiosperm phylogeny group (apg) systems the apg system the apg ii system and the apg iii system
until the rise of the phylogenetic apg systems it was widely accepted that angiosperms were neatly split between monocots and dicots a state reflected in virtually all the systems it is now understood that various groups notably the magnoliids and ancient lineages known as the basal angiosperms fall outside of this dichotomy each of these systems uses its own internal taxonomy for the group the monocotyledons are famous as a group that is extremely stable in its outer borders (it is a well-defined coherent group) while in its internal taxonomy is extremely unstable (historically no two authoritative systems have agreed with each other on how the monocotyledons are related to each other)
molecular studies have both confirmed the monophyly of the monocots and helped elucidate relationships within this group the apg iii system does not assign the monocots to a taxonomic rank instead recognizing a monocots clade
=== subdivisions ===
historically bentham (1877) considered the monocots to consist of four alliances epigynae coronariae nudiflorae and glumales based on floral characteristics like most subsequent classification systems it failed to distinguish between two major orders liliales and asparagales now recognised as quite separate the modern apg system establishes ten orders of monocots and two families of monocots (petrosaviaceae and dasypogonaceae) not yet assigned to any order more recently the petrosaviaceae has been included in the petrosaviales and placed near the lilioid orders the family hydatellaceae assigned to order poales in the apg ii system has since been recognized as being misplaced in the monocots and instead proves to be most closely related to the water lilies family nymphaeaceae
=== evolution ===
the monocots form a monophyletic group arising early in the history of the flowering plants the earliest fossils presumed to be monocot remains date from the early cretaceous period for a very long time fossils of palm trees were believed to be the oldest monocots first appearing 90 million years ago but this estimate may not be entirely true at least some putative monocot fossils have been found in strata as old as the eudicots the oldest fossils that are unequivocally monocots are pollen from the late barremianaptian early cretaceous period about 120-110 million years ago and are assignable to clade-pothoideae-monstereae araceae being araceae sister to other alismatales they have also found flower fossils of triuridaceae (pandanales) in upper cretaceous rocks in new jersey becoming the oldest known sighting of saprophytic/mycotrophic habits in angiosperm plants and among the oldest known fossils of monocotyledons
topology of the angiosperm phylogenetic tree could infer that the monocots would be among the oldest lineages of angiosperms which would support the theory that they are just as old as the eudicots the pollen of the eudicots dates back 125 million years so the lineage of monocots should be that old too
==== molecular clock estimates for the age of extant monocots ====
kre bremer using rbcl sequences and the mean path length method ("mean-path lengths method") estimated the age of the monocot crown group (i.e the time at which the ancestor of today's acorus diverged from the rest of the group) as 134 million years similarly wikstrm et al. using sanderson's non-parametric rate smoothing approach ("nonparametric rate smoothing approach") obtained ages of 158 or 141 million years for the crown group of monocots all these estimates have large error ranges (usually 15-20%) and wikstrm et al used only a single calibration point namely the split between fagales and cucurbitales which was set to 84 ma in the late santonian period) early molecular clock studies using strict clock models had estimated the monocot crown age to 200 20 million years ago or 160 16 million years while studies using relaxed clocks have obtained 135-131 million years or 133.8 to 124 million years bremer's estimate of 134 million years has been used as a secondary calibration point in other analyses
==== core group ====
the age of the core group of so-called nuclear monocot or core monocots by the angiosperm phylogeny website ("core monocots in english) which correspond to all orders except acorales and alismatales is about 131 million years to present and crown group age is about 126 million years to the present the subsequent branching in this part of the tree (i.e petrosaviaceae dioscoreales + pandanales and liliales clades appeared) including the crown petrosaviaceae group may be in the period around 125120 million years bc (about 111 million years so far) and stem groups of all other orders including commelinidae would have diverged about or shortly after 115 million years these and many clades within these orders may have originated in southern gondwana i.e antarctica australasia and southern south america
==== aquatic monocots ====
the aquatic monocots of alismatales have commonly been regarded as primitive they have also been considered to have the most primitive foliage which were cross-linked as dioscoreales and melanthiales keep in mind that the most primitive monocot is not necessarily the sister of everyone else this is because the ancestral or primitive characters are inferred by means of the reconstruction of characteristic states with the help of the phylogenetic tree so primitive characters of monocots may be present in some derived groups on the other hand the basal taxa may exhibit many morphological autapomorphies so although acoraceae is the sister group to the remaining monocotyledons the result does not imply that acoraceae is the most primitive monocot in terms of its characteristics in fact acoraceae is highly derived in most morphological characteristics which is precisely why so many alismatales acoraceae occupied relatively imitative positions in trees produced by chase et al (1995b) and stevenson & loconte (1995)
some authors support the idea of an aquatic phase as the origin of monocots the phylogenetic position of alismatales (many water) which occupy a relationship with the rest except the acoraceae do not rule out the idea because it could be the most primitive monocots but not the most basal the atactostele stem the long and linear leaves the absence of secondary growth (see the biomechanics of living in the water) roots in groups instead of a single root branching (related to the nature of the substrate) including sympodial use are consistent with a water source however while monocots were sisters of the aquatic ceratophyllales or their origin is related to the adoption of some form of aquatic habit it would not help much to the understanding of how it evolved to develop their distinctive anatomical features the monocots seem so different from the rest of angiosperms and it's difficult to relate their morphology anatomy and development and those of broad-leaved angiosperms
==== other taxa ====
in the past taxa which had petiolate leaves with reticulate venation were considered primitive within the monocots because of its superficial resemblance to the leaves of dicotyledons recent work suggests that these taxa are sparse in the phylogenetic tree of monocots such as fleshy fruited taxa (excluding taxa with aril seeds dispersed by ants) the two features would be adapted to conditions that evolved together regardless among the taxa involved were smilax trillium (liliales) dioscorea (dioscoreales) etc a number of these plants are vines that tend to live in shaded habitats for at least part of their lives and may also have a relationship with their shapeless stomata reticulate venation seems to have appeared at least 26 times in monocots in fleshy fruits 21 times (sometimes lost later) and the two characteristics though different showed strong signs of a tendency to be good or bad in tandem a phenomenon described as concerted convergence ("coordinated convergence")
=== etymology ===
the name monocotyledons is derived from the traditional botanical name monocotyledones which refers to the fact that most members of this group have one cotyledon or embryonic leaf in their seeds
== uses ==
of the monocots the grasses are of enormous economic importance as a source of animal and human food
