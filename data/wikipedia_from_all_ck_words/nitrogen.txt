nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol n and atomic number 7 it is the lightest pnictogen and at room temperature it is a transparent odorless diatomic gas nitrogen is a common element in the universe estimated at about seventh in total abundance in the milky way and the solar system on earth the element forms about 78% of earth's atmosphere and as such is the most abundant uncombined element the element nitrogen was discovered as a separable component of air by scottish physician daniel rutherford in 1772
many industrially important compounds such as ammonia nitric acid organic nitrates (propellants and explosives) and cyanides contain nitrogen the extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (nn) dominates nitrogen chemistry causing difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting the n2 into useful compounds but at the same time causing release of large amounts of often useful energy when the compounds burn explode or decay back into nitrogen gas synthetically-produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilizers and fertilizer nitrates are key pollutants in causing the eutrophication of water systems
outside the major uses of nitrogen compounds as fertilizers and energy-stores nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as kevlar fabric and cyanoacrylate super glue nitrogen is a constituent of molecules in every major pharmacological drug class including antibiotics many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules for example the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by being metabolized to nitric oxide plant alkaloids (often defense chemicals) contain nitrogen by definition and thus many notable nitrogen-containing drugs such as caffeine and morphine are either alkaloids or synthetic mimics that act (as many plant alkaloids do) on receptors of animal neurotransmitters (for example synthetic amphetamines)
nitrogen occurs in all organisms primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins) in the nucleic acids (dna and rna) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate the human body contains about 3% by mass of nitrogen the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen carbon and hydrogen the nitrogen cycle describes movement of the element from the air into the biosphere and organic compounds then back into the atmosphere
== history and etymologyedit ==
nitrogen is formally considered to have been discovered by scottish physician daniel rutherford in 1772 who called it noxious air though he did not recognize it as an entirely different chemical substance he clearly distinguished it from joseph black's fixed air or carbon dioxide the fact that there was a component of air that does not support combustion was clear to rutherford nitrogen was also studied at about the same time by carl wilhelm scheele henry cavendish and joseph priestley who referred to it as burnt air or phlogisticated air nitrogen gas was inert enough that antoine lavoisier referred to it as mephitic air or azote from the greek word azotos lifeless in it animals died and flames were extinguished this mephitic air consisted mostly of n2 but might also have included more than 1% argon
lavoisier's name for nitrogen is used in many languages (french italian polish russian albanian turkish etc.) and still remains in english in the common names of many compounds such as hydrazine and compounds of the azide ion the english word nitrogen (1794) entered the language from the french nitrogne coined in 1790 by french chemist jean-antoine chaptal (17561832) from the greek nitron sodium carbonate and the french -gne producing from greek - -genes producer begetter the gas had been found in nitric acid chaptal's meaning was that nitrogen gas is the essential part of nitric acid in turn formed from saltpeter (potassium nitrate) then known as niter
nitrogen compounds were well known by the middle ages alchemists knew nitric acid as aqua fortis (strong water) the mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids was known as aqua regia (royal water) celebrated for its ability to dissolve gold (the king of metals) the earliest military industrial and agricultural applications of nitrogen compounds used saltpeter (sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate) most notably in gunpowder and later as fertilizer in 1910 lord rayleigh discovered that an electrical discharge in nitrogen gas produced active nitrogen a monatomic allotrope of nitrogen the whirling cloud of brilliant yellow light produced by his apparatus reacted with quicksilver to produce explosive mercury nitride
for a long time sources of nitrogen compounds were limited natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions nitrogen fixation by industrial processes like the frankcaro process (18951899) and haberbosch process (19081913) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds to the extent that half of global food production (see applications) now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers at the same time use of the ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock in the manufacture of explosives in the world wars of the 20th century
== productionedit ==
nitrogen gas is an industrial gas produced by the fractional distillation of liquid air or by mechanical means using gaseous air (i.e. pressurized reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption) commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes when supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called ofn (oxygen-free nitrogen)
in a chemical laboratory it is prepared by treating an aqueous solution of ammonium chloride with sodium nitrite
nh4cl(aq) + nano2(aq) n2(g) + nacl(aq) + 2 h2o (l)
small amounts of impurities no and hno3 are also formed in this reaction the impurities can be removed by passing the gas through aqueous sulfuric acid containing potassium dichromate very pure nitrogen can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of barium azide or sodium azide
2 nan3 2 na + 3 n2
== propertiesedit ==
nitrogen is a nonmetal with an electronegativity of 3.04 it has five electrons in its outer shell and is therefore trivalent in most compounds the triple bond in molecular nitrogen (n
2) is one of the strongest the resulting difficulty of converting n
2 into other compounds and the ease (and associated high energy release) of converting nitrogen compounds into elemental n
2 have dominated the role of nitrogen in both nature and human economic activities
at atmospheric pressure molecular nitrogen condenses (liquefies) at 77 k (195.79 c) and freezes at 63 k (210.01 c) into the beta hexagonal close-packed crystal allotropic form below 35.4 k (237.6 c) nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form (called the alpha phase) liquid nitrogen a fluid resembling water in appearance but with 80.8% of the density (the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 0.808 g/ml) is a common cryogen
unstable allotropes of nitrogen consisting of more than two nitrogen atoms have been produced in the laboratory like n
3 and n
4 under extremely high pressures (1.1 million atm) and high temperatures (2000 k) as produced using a diamond anvil cell nitrogen polymerizes into the single-bonded cubic gauche crystal structure this structure is similar to that of diamond and both have extremely strong covalent bonds n
4 is nicknamed nitrogen diamond
other (as yet unsynthesized) allotropes include hexazine (n
6 a benzene analog) and octaazacubane (n
8 a cubane analog) the former is predicted to be highly unstable while the latter is predicted to be kinetically stable for reasons of orbital symmetry
=== isotopesedit ===
there are two stable isotopes of nitrogen 14n and 15n by far the most common is 14n (99.634%) which is produced in the cno cycle in stars of the ten isotopes produced synthetically 13n has a half-life of ten minutes and the remaining isotopes have half-lives on the order of seconds or less
biologically mediated reactions (e.g. assimilation nitrification and denitrification) strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil these reactions typically result in 15n enrichment of the substrate and depletion of the product
a small part (0.73%) of the molecular nitrogen in earth's atmosphere is the isotopologue 14n15n and almost all the rest is 14n2
the radioisotope 16n is the dominant radionuclide in the coolant of pressurized water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation it is produced from 16o (in water) via (n,p) reaction it has a short half-life of about 7.1 s but during its decay back to 16o produces high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7 mev)
because of this the access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurized water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation 16n is one of the main means used to immediately detect even small leaks from the primary coolant to the secondary steam cycle
in similar fashion access to any of the steam cycle components in a boiling water reactor nuclear power plant must be restricted during operation condensate from the condenser is typically retained for 10 minutes to allow for decay of the 16n this eliminates the need to shield and restrict access to any of the feed water piping or pumps
=== electromagnetic spectrumedit ===
molecular nitrogen (14n2) is largely transparent to infrared and visible radiation because it is a homonuclear molecule and thus has no dipole moment to couple to electromagnetic radiation at these wavelengths significant absorption occurs at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths beginning around 100 nanometers this is associated with electronic transitions in the molecule to states in which charge is not distributed evenly between nitrogen atoms nitrogen absorption leads to significant absorption of ultraviolet radiation in the earth's upper atmosphere and the atmospheres of other planetary bodies for similar reasons pure molecular nitrogen lasers typically emit light in the ultraviolet range
nitrogen also makes a contribution to visible air glow from the earth's upper atmosphere through electron impact excitation followed by emission this visible blue air glow (seen in the polar aurora and in the re-entry glow of returning spacecraft) typically results not from molecular nitrogen but rather from free nitrogen atoms combining with oxygen to form nitric oxide (no)
nitrogen gas also exhibits scintillation
=== reactionsedit ===
in general nitrogen is unreactive at standard temperature and pressure n2 reacts spontaneously with few reagents being resilient to acids and bases as well as oxidants and most reductants when nitrogen reacts spontaneously with a reagent the net transformation is often called nitrogen fixation
nitrogen reacts with elemental lithium lithium burns in an atmosphere of n2 to give lithium nitride
6 li + n2 2 li3n
magnesium also burns in nitrogen forming magnesium nitride
3 mg + n2 mg3n2
n2 forms a variety of adducts with transition metals the first example of a dinitrogen complex is [ru(nh3)5(n2)]2+ (see figure at right) however it is interesting to note that the n2 ligand was obtained by the decomposition of hydrazine and not coordination of free dinitrogen such compounds are now numerous other examples include ircl(n2)(pph3)2 w(n2)2(ph2pch2ch2pph2)2 and [(5-c5me4h)2zr]2(2 2,2-n2) these complexes illustrate how n2 might bind to the metal(s) in nitrogenase and the catalyst for the haber process a catalytic process to reduce n2 to ammonia with the use of a molybdenum complex in the presence of a proton source was published in 2005
the beginning point for industrial production of nitrogen compounds is the haber process in which nitrogen is fixed by reacting n

2 over an iron(ii iii) oxide (fe
3o
4) catalyst at about 500 c and 200 atmospheres pressure biological nitrogen fixation in free-living cyanobacteria and in the root nodules of plants also produces ammonia from molecular nitrogen the reaction which is the source of the bulk of nitrogen in the biosphere is catalyzed by the nitrogenase enzyme complex that contains fe and mo atoms using energy derived from hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (atp) into adenosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate (20.5 kj/mol)

nitrogen gas (n2) is the largest constituent of earth's atmosphere (78.082% by volume of dry air 75.3% by weight in dry air) however this high concentration does not reflect nitrogen's overall low abundance in the makeup of the earth from which most of the element escaped by solar evaporation early in the planet's formation
nitrogen is a common element in the universe and is estimated to be approximately the seventh most abundant chemical element by mass in the universe the milky way and the solar system in these places it was originally created by fusion processes from carbon and hydrogen in supernovas molecular nitrogen and nitrogen compounds have been detected in interstellar space by astronomers using the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer
due to the volatility of elemental nitrogen and also its common compounds with hydrogen and oxygen nitrogen and its compounds were driven out of the planetesimals in the early solar system by the heat of the sun and in the form of gases were lost to the rocky planets of the inner solar system nitrogen is therefore a relatively rare element on these inner planets including earth as a whole in this nitrogen resembles neon which has a similar high abundance in the universe but is also rare in the inner solar system nitrogen is estimated at 31st element in crustal abundance there exist some relatively uncommon nitrogen minerals such as saltpeter (potassium nitrate) chile saltpeter (sodium nitrate) and sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride) even these are known mainly as concentrated from evaporative ocean beds due to their ready solubility of most naturally-occurring nitrogen compounds in water a similar pattern occurs with the water solubility of the uncommon light element boron
however nitrogen and its compounds occur far more commonly as gases in the atmospheres of planets and moons that are large enough to have atmospheres for example molecular nitrogen is a major constituent of not only earth's atmosphere but also the saturnian moon titan's thick atmosphere also due to retention by gravity at colder temperatures nitrogen and its compounds occur in trace to appreciable amounts in planetary atmospheres of the gas giant planets
nitrogen is present in all known living organisms in proteins nucleic acids and other molecules it typically makes up around 4% of the dry weight of plant matter and around 3% of the weight of the human body it is a large component of animal waste (for example guano) usually in the form of urea uric acid ammonium compounds and derivatives of these nitrogenous products which are essential nutrients for all plants that cannot fix atmospheric nitrogen

the main neutral hydride of nitrogen is ammonia (nh

2h
4) is also commonly used ammonia is more basic than water by 6 orders of magnitude in solution ammonia forms the ammonium ion (nh+
4) liquid ammonia (boiling point 240 k) is amphiprotic (displaying either brnstedlowry acidic or basic character) and forms ammonium and the less common amide ions (nh
2) both amides and nitride (n3) salts are known but decompose in water singly doubly triply and quadruply substituted alkyl compounds of ammonia are called amines (four substitutions to form commercially and biologically important quaternary amines results in a positively charged nitrogen and thus a water-soluble or at least amphiphilic compound) larger chains rings and structures of nitrogen hydrides are also known but are generally unstable
other classes of nitrogen anions (negatively charged ions) are the poisonous azides (n
3) which are linear and isoelectronic to carbon dioxide but which bind to important iron-containing enzymes in the body in a manner more resembling cyanide another molecule of the same structure is the colorless and relatively inert anesthetic gas nitrous oxide (dinitrogen monoxide n
2o) also known as laughing gas this is one of a variety of nitrogen oxides that form a family often abbreviated as nox nitric oxide (nitrogen monoxide no) is a natural free radical used in signal transduction in both plants and animals for example in vasodilation by causing the smooth muscle of blood vessels to relax the reddish and poisonous nitrogen dioxide no

nitrogen can also be found in many organic compounds common nitrogen functional groups include amines amides nitro groups imines and enamines the amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the kjeldahl method

=== nitrogen gasedit ===
nitrogen gas has a variety of applications including serving as an inert replacement for air where oxidation is undesirable
as a modified atmosphere pure or mixed with carbon dioxide to nitrogenate and preserve the freshness of packaged or bulk foods (by delaying rancidity and other forms of oxidative damage) pure nitrogen as food additive is labeled in the european union with the e number e941
in incandescent light bulbs as an inexpensive alternative to argon
fire suppression systems for it equipment
in photolithography in deep ultraviolet nitrogen is used to avoid the strong oxygen absorption of uv at these wavelengths
dried and pressurized it is used as an dielectric gas for hv equipment
the manufacturing of stainless steel
used in some aircraft fuel systems to reduce fire hazard (see inerting system)
on top of liquid explosives as a safety measure
filling race cars and aircraft tires due to its lower thermal expansion and lack of moisture or oxidative qualities as opposed to air
nitrogen is commonly used during sample preparation procedures for chemical analysis it is used to concentrate and reduce the volume of liquid samples directing a pressurized stream of nitrogen gas perpendicular to the surface of the liquid allows the solvent to evaporate while leaving the solute(s) and un-evaporated solvent behind
nitrogen can be used as a replacement or in combination with carbon dioxide to pressurize kegs of some beers particularly stouts and british ales due to the smaller bubbles it produces which makes the dispensed beer smoother and headier a pressure-sensitive nitrogen capsule known commonly as a widget allows nitrogen-charged beers to be packaged in cans and bottles
nitrogen tanks are also replacing carbon dioxide as the main power source for paintball guns nitrogen must be kept at higher pressure than co2 making n2 tanks heavier and more expensive
nitrogen gas has become the inert gas of choice for inert gas asphyxiation and is under consideration as a replacement for lethal injection in oklahoma nitrogen is promoted by euthanasia advocate philip nitschke to end life in a peaceful reliable [and] totally legal manner
=== liquid nitrogenedit ===
liquid nitrogen is a cryogenic liquid at atmospheric pressure it boils at 195.8 c (320.4 f) when insulated in proper containers such as dewar flasks it can be transported without much evaporative loss
like dry ice the main use of liquid nitrogen is as a refrigerant among other things it is used in the cryopreservation of blood reproductive cells (sperm and egg) and other biological samples and materials it is used in the clinical setting in cryotherapy to remove cysts and warts on the skin it is used in cold traps for certain laboratory equipment and to cool infrared detectors or x-ray detectors it has also been used to cool central processing units and other devices in computers that are overclocked and that produce more heat than during normal operation

molecular nitrogen (n2) in the atmosphere is relatively non-reactive due to its strong triple bond nn and molecular nitrogen plays an inert role in the human body being neither produced nor destroyed in nature nitrogen is converted into biologically (and industrially) useful compounds by lightning and by some living organisms notably certain bacteria (i.e. nitrogen-fixing bacteriasee biological role below) molecular nitrogen is released into the atmosphere in the process of decay in dead plant and animal tissues
the ability to combine or fix molecular nitrogen is a key feature of modern industrial chemistry previously to the 20th century access to nitrogen compounds for fertilizers and gunpowder had been through deposits of natural nitrates such as chilean saltpeter however first the frankcaro process for producing cyanamide and then the haberbosch process for producing ammonia from air and natural gas (developed just before the first world war) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds to the extent that half of global food production now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers
the ostwald process developed a few years before the haber process allowed large-scale production of nitric acid and nitrate from ammonia thus freeing large-scale industrial production of nitrate explosives and weapons propellants from the need to mine nitrate salt deposits the organic and inorganic salts of nitric acid have been important historically as convenient stores of chemical energy for warfare and rocket fuels historically such compounds included important compounds such as potassium nitrate used in gunpowder which was often produced by biological means (bacterial fermentation) before natural mineral sources were discovered later all such sources were displaced by industrial production in the early 1900s
ammonium nitrate has been used as both fertilizer and explosive (see anfo) various other nitrated organic compounds such as nitroglycerin trinitrotoluene and nitrocellulose are used as explosives and propellants for modern firearms nitric acid is used as an oxidizing agent in liquid fueled rockets hydrazine and hydrazine derivatives find use as rocket fuels and monopropellants in most of these compounds the basic instability and tendency to burn or explode is derived from the fact that nitrogen is present as an oxide and not as the far more stable nitrogen molecule (n2) which is a product of the compounds thermal decomposition when nitrates burn or explode the formation of the powerful triple bond in the n2 produces most of the energy of the reaction
nitrogen is a constituent of molecules in every major drug class in pharmacology and medicine nitrous oxide (n2o) was discovered early in the 19th century to be a partial anesthetic though it was not used as a surgical anesthetic until later called laughing gas it was found capable of inducing a state of social disinhibition resembling drunkenness other notable nitrogen-containing drugs are drugs derived from plant alkaloids such as morphine (there exist many alkaloids known to have pharmacological effects in some cases they appear as natural chemical defenses of plants against predation) drugs that contain nitrogen include all major classes of antibiotics and organic nitrate drugs like nitroglycerin and nitroprusside that regulate blood pressure and heart action by mimicking the action of nitric oxide
== biological roleedit ==
nitrogen is an essential building block of amino and nucleic acids essential to life on earth
elemental nitrogen in the atmosphere cannot be used directly by either plants or animals and must be converted to a reduced (or fixed') state to be useful for higher plants and animals precipitation often contains substantial quantities of ammonium and nitrate thought to result from nitrogen fixation by lightning and other atmospheric electric phenomena this was first proposed by liebig in 1827 and later confirmed however because ammonium is preferentially retained by the forest canopy relative to atmospheric nitrate most fixed nitrogen reaches the soil surface under trees as nitrate soil nitrate is preferentially assimilated by tree roots relative to soil ammonium however this is not the case for all species
specific bacteria (e.g. rhizobium trifolium) possess nitrogenase enzymes that can fix atmospheric nitrogen (see nitrogen fixation) into a form (ammonium ion) that is chemically useful to higher organisms this process requires a large amount of energy and anoxic conditions such bacteria may live freely in soil (e.g. azotobacter) but normally exist in a symbiotic relationship in the root nodules of leguminous plants (e.g clover trifolium or soybean plant glycine max) and fertilizer trees nitrogen-fixing bacteria are also symbiotic with a number of unrelated plant species such as alders (alnus) spp. lichens casuarina myrica liverworts and gunnera
as part of the symbiotic relationship the plant converts the fixed ammonium ion to nitrogen oxides and amino acids to form proteins and other molecules (e.g. alkaloids) in return for the fixed nitrogen the plant secretes sugars to the symbiotic bacteria legumes maintain an anaerobic (oxygen free) environment for their nitrogen-fixing bacteria
plants are able to assimilate nitrogen directly in the form of nitrates that may be present in soil from natural mineral deposits artificial fertilizers animal waste or organic decay (as the product of bacteria but not bacteria specifically associated with the plant) nitrates absorbed in this fashion are converted to nitrites by the enzyme nitrate reductase and then converted to ammonia by another enzyme called nitrite reductase
nitrogen compounds are basic building blocks in animal biology as well animals use nitrogen-containing amino acids from plant sources as starting materials for all nitrogen-compound animal biochemistry including the manufacture of proteins and nucleic acids plant-feeding insects are dependent on nitrogen in their diet such that varying the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied to a plant can affect the reproduction rate of insects feeding on fertilized plants
soluble nitrate is an important limiting factor in the growth of certain bacteria in ocean waters in many places in the world artificial fertilizers applied to crop-lands to increase yields result in run-off delivery of soluble nitrogen to oceans at river mouths this process can result in eutrophication of the water as nitrogen-driven bacterial growth depletes water oxygen to the point that all higher organisms die well-known dead zone areas in the u.s gulf coast and the black sea are due to this important polluting process
many saltwater fish manufacture large amounts of trimethylamine oxide to protect them from the high osmotic effects of their environment conversion of this compound to dimethylamine is responsible for the early odor in unfresh saltwater fish in animals free radical nitric oxide (no) (derived from an amino acid) serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation
nitric oxide's rapid reaction with water in animals results in production of its metabolite nitrite animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins in general results in excretion of urea while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in excretion of urea and uric acid the characteristic odor of animal flesh decay is caused by the creation of long-chain nitrogen-containing amines such as putrescine and cadaverine which are breakdown products of the amino acids ornithine and lysine respectively in decaying proteins
decay of organisms and their waste products may produce small amounts of nitrate but most decay eventually returns nitrogen content to the atmosphere as molecular nitrogen the circulation of nitrogen from atmosphere to organic compounds then back to the atmosphere is referred to as the nitrogen cycle
== safetyedit ==
although nitrogen is non-toxic when released into an enclosed space it can displace oxygen and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard this may happen with few warning symptoms since the human carotid body is a relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system an example occurred shortly before the launch of the first space shuttle mission in 1981 when two technicians lost consciousness (and one of them died) after they walked into a space located in the shuttle's mobile launcher platform that was pressurized with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire the technicians would have been able to exit the room if they had experienced any early symptoms from nitrogen-breathing
when inhaled at high partial pressures (more than about 4 bar encountered at depths below about 30 m in scuba diving) nitrogen begins to act as an anesthetic agent it can cause nitrogen narcosis a temporary semi-anesthetized state of mental impairment similar to that caused by nitrous oxide
nitrogen dissolves in the blood and body fats rapid decompression (in particular when divers ascend too quickly or astronauts decompress too quickly from cabin pressure to spacesuit pressure) can lead to a potentially fatal condition called decompression sickness (formerly known as caisson sickness or the bends) when nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream nerves joints and other sensitive or vital areas bubbles from other inert gases (those gases other than carbon dioxide and oxygen) cause the same effects so replacement of nitrogen in breathing gases may prevent nitrogen narcosis but does not prevent decompression sickness
direct skin contact with liquid nitrogen will cause severe frostbite (cryogenic burns") this may happen almost instantly on contact or after a second or more depending on the form of liquid nitrogen bulk liquid nitrogen causes less rapid freezing than a spray of nitrogen mist (such as is used to freeze certain skin growths in the practice of dermatology) the extra surface area provided by nitrogen-soaked materials is also important with soaked clothing or cotton causing far more rapid damage than a spill of direct liquid to skin full contact between naked skin and large collected-droplets or pools of liquid nitrogen may be prevented for a second or two by a layer of insulating gas from the leidenfrost effect this may give the skin a second of protection from nitrogen bulk liquid however liquid nitrogen applied to skin in mists and on fabrics bypasses this effect and causes local frostbite immediately
oxygen sensors are sometimes used as a safety precaution when working with liquid nitrogen to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space nitrogen which evaporates from liquid is still colder and heavier than (oxygenated) air therefore any spill from a liquid nitrogen apparatus has tendency to stay at bottom in closed spaces expelling oxygen
