== interface ==
lives has two main interfaces the clip editor which serves as a repository of video and audio material and the multitrack window where multiple clips can be positioned on the timeline
the clip editor allows free playback at variable play rates applying of multiple realtime effects and mixing of clips this mode is mainly used by vjs video editors can also use this interface to prepare the clips before entering into multitrack mode
in multitrack mode the individual clips can be arranged in layers on the timeline further effects and transitions can be applied here and the audio can be mixed down the entire timeline can then be rendered creating a new clip
rendering previews are shown in real time
