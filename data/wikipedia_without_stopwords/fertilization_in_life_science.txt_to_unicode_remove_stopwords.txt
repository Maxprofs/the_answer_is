fossilization processes
process fossilization varies according tissue type external conditions
permineralization
permineralization process fossilization occurs organism buried empty spaces within organism spaces filled liquid gas life become filled mineralrich groundwater minerals precipitate groundwater occupying empty spaces process occur small spaces within cell wall plant cell small scale permineralization produce detailed fossils permineralization occur organism must become covered sediment soon death soon initial decay process degree remains decayed covered determines later details fossil fossils consist skeletal remains teeth fossils contain traces skin feathers even soft tissues form diagenesis
casts molds
cases original remains organism completely dissolve otherwise destroyed remaining organismshaped hole rock called external mold hole later filled minerals cast endocast internal mold formed sediments minerals fill internal cavity organism inside bivalve snail hollow skull
authigenic mineralisation
special form cast mold formation chemistry right organism fragment organism act nucleus precipitation minerals siderite resulting nodule forming around happens rapidly significant decay organic tissue fine threedimensional morphological detail preserved nodules carboniferous mazon creek fossil beds illinois usa among best documented examples mineralisation
replacement recrystallization
replacement occurs shell bone tissue replaced another mineral cases mineral replacement original shell occurs gradually fine scales microstructural features preserved despite total loss original material shell said recrystallized original skeletal compounds still present different crystal form aragonite calcite
adpression compressionimpression
compression fossils fossil ferns result chemical reduction complex organic molecules composing organisms tissues case fossil consists original material albeit geochemically altered state chemical change expression diagenesis often remains carbonaceous film known phytoleim case fossil known compression often however phytoleim lost remains impression organism rockan impression fossil many cases however compressions impressions occur together instance rock broken open phytoleim often attached one part compression whereas counterpart impression reason one term covers two modes preservation adpression
soft tissue cell molecular preservation

carbonization
carbonaceous films thin coatings consist predominantly chemical element carbon soft tissues organisms made largely organic carbon compounds diagenesis reducing conditions thin film carbon residue left forms silhouette original organism
bioimmuration
bioimmuration occurs skeletal organism overgrows otherwise subsumes another organism preserving latter impression within skeleton usually sessile skeletal organism bryozoan oyster grows along substrate covering sessile sclerobionts sometimes bioimmured organism softbodied preserved negative relief kind external mold also cases organism settles top living skeletal organism grows upwards preserving settler skeleton bioimmuration known fossil record ordovician recent
fossil record
estimating dates
paleontology seeks map life evolved across geologic time substantial hurdle difficulty working fossil ages beds preserve fossils typically lack radioactive elements needed radiometric dating technique means giving rocks greater million years old absolute age accurate within better although radiometric dating requires careful laboratory work basic principle simple rates various radioactive elements decay known ratio radioactive element decay products shows long ago radioactive element incorporated rock radioactive elements common rocks volcanic origin fossilbearing rocks dated radiometrically volcanic ash layers may provide termini intervening sediments
stratigraphy
consequently palaeontologists rely stratigraphy date fossils stratigraphy science deciphering layercake sedimentary record rocks normally form relatively horizontal layers layer younger one underneath fossil found two layers whose ages known fossils age claimed lie two known ages rock sequences continuous may broken faults periods erosion difficult match rock beds directly adjacent however fossils species survived relatively short time used match isolated rocks technique called biostratigraphy instance conodont eoplacognathus pseudoplanus short range middle ordovician period rocks unknown age traces e pseudoplanus midordovician age index fossils must distinctive globally distributed occupy short time range useful misleading results produced index fossils incorrectly dated stratigraphy biostratigraphy general provide relative dating b often sufficient studying evolution however difficult time periods problems involved matching rocks age across continents familytree relationships also help narrow date lineages first appeared instance fossils b c date x million years ago calculated family tree says ancestor b c must evolved earlier
also possible estimate long ago two living clades diverged ie approximately long ago last common ancestor must lived assuming dna mutations accumulate constant rate molecular clocks however fallible provide approximate timing example sufficiently precise reliable estimating groups feature cambrian explosion first evolved estimates produced different techniques may vary factor two

stromatolites
stromatolites layered accretionary structures formed shallow water trapping binding cementation sedimentary grains biofilms microorganisms especially cyanobacteria stromatolites provide ancient fossil records life earth dating back billion years ago
stromatolites much abundant precambrian times older archean fossil remains presumed colonies cyanobacteria younger proterozoic fossils may primordial forms eukaryote chlorophytes green algae one genus stromatolite common geologic record collenia earliest stromatolite confirmed microbial origin dates billion years ago
discovery provides strong evidence microbial stromatolites extending far back billion years ago
stromatolites major constituent fossil record lifes first billion years peaking billion years ago subsequently declined abundance diversity start cambrian fallen peak widely supported explanation stromatolite builders fell victims grazing creatures cambrian substrate revolution implying sufficiently complex organisms common billion years ago
connection grazer stromatolite abundance well documented younger ordovician evolutionary radiation stromatolite abundance also increased endordovician endpermian extinctions decimated marine animals falling back earlier levels marine animals recovered fluctuations metazoan population diversity may factor reduction stromatolite abundance factors chemistry environment may responsible changes
prokaryotic cyanobacteria reproduce asexually cell division instrumental priming environment evolutionary development complex eukaryotic organisms cyanobacteria well extremophile gammaproteobacteria thought largely responsible increasing amount oxygen primeval earths atmosphere continuing photosynthesis cyanobacteria use water carbon dioxide sunlight create food layer mucus often forms mats cyanobacterial cells modern microbial mats debris surrounding habitat become trapped within mucus cemented calcium carbonate grow thin laminations limestone laminations accrete time resulting banded pattern common stromatolites domal morphology biological stromatolites result vertical growth necessary continued infiltration sunlight organisms photosynthesis layered spherical growth structures termed oncolites similar stromatolites also known fossil record thrombolites poorly laminated nonlaminated clotted structures formed cyanobacteria common fossil record modern sediments
