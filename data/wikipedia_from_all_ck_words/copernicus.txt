nicolaus copernicus (/kprnks/ polish mikoaj kopernik [mikwaj kprik] german nikolaus kopernikus 19 february 1473 24 may 1543) was a renaissance mathematician and astronomer who formulated a model of the universe that placed the sun rather than the earth at the center of the universe the publication of this model in his book de revolutionibus orbium coelestium (on the revolutions of the celestial spheres) just before his death in 1543 is considered a major event in the history of science triggering the copernican revolution and making an important contribution to the scientific revolution
copernicus was born and died in royal prussia a region that had been a part of the kingdom of poland since 1466 he was a polyglot and polymath who obtained a doctorate in canon law and also practiced as a physician classics scholar translator governor diplomat and economist like the rest of his family he was a third order dominican in 1517 he derived a quantity theory of money a key concept in economics and in 1519 he formulated a version of what later became known as gresham's law
== life ==
nicolaus copernicus was born on 19 february 1473 in the city of toru (thorn) in the province of royal prussia in the crown of the kingdom of poland his father was a merchant from krakw and his mother was the daughter of a wealthy toru merchant nicolaus was the youngest of four children his brother andreas (andrew) became an augustinian canon at frombork (frauenburg) his sister barbara named after her mother became a benedictine nun and in her final years prioress of a convent in chemno (kulm) she died after 1517 his sister katharina married the businessman and toru city councilor barthel gertner and left five children whom copernicus looked after to the end of his life copernicus never married or had children
=== father's family ===
the father's family can be traced to a village in silesia near nysa (neie) the village's name has been variously spelled kopernik copernik copernic kopernic coprirnik and today koperniki in the 14th century members of the family began moving to various other silesian cities to the polish capital krakw (1367) and to toru (1400) the father mikoaj the elder likely the son of jan came from the krakw line
nicolaus was named after his father who appears in records for the first time as a well-to-do merchant who dealt in copper selling it mostly in danzig (gdask) he moved from krakw to toru around 1458 toru situated on the vistula river was at that time embroiled in the thirteen years war in which the kingdom of poland and the prussian confederation an alliance of prussian cities gentry and clergy fought the teutonic order over control of the region in this war hanseatic cities like danzig and toru nicolaus copernicus hometown chose to support the polish king casimir iv jagiellon who promised to respect the cities traditional vast independence which the teutonic order had challenged nicolaus father was actively engaged in the politics of the day and supported poland and the cities against the teutonic order in 1454 he mediated negotiations between poland's cardinal zbigniew olenicki and the prussian cities for repayment of war loans in the second peace of thorn the teutonic order formally relinquished all claims to its western provinces which as royal prussia remained a region of poland for the next 300 years
copernicus father married barbara watzenrode the astronomer's mother between 1461 and 1464 he died about 1483
=== mother's family ===
nicolaus mother barbara watzenrode was the daughter of a wealthy toru patrician and city councillor lucas watzenrode the elder (deceased 1462) and katarzyna (widow of jan peckau) mentioned in other sources as katarzyna rdiger gente modlibog (deceased 1476) the watzenrode family like the kopernik family had come from silesia from near widnica (schweidnitz) and after 1360 had settled in toru they soon became one of the wealthiest and most influential patrician families through the watzenrodes extensive family relationships by marriage copernicus was related to wealthy families of toru danzig and elblg (elbing) and to prominent noble families of prussia the czapskis dziayskis konopackis and kocieleckis the modlibgs (the polish name means pray god") were a prominent polish family who had been well known in poland's history since 1271 lucas and katherine had three children lucas watzenrode the younger (14471512) who would become bishop of warmia and copernicus patron barbara the astronomer's mother (deceased after 1495) and christina (deceased before 1502) who in 1459 married the toru merchant and mayor tiedeman von allen
lucas watzenrode the elder a wealthy merchant and in 143962 president of the judicial bench was a decided opponent of the teutonic knights in 1453 he was the delegate from toru at the grudzidz (graudenz) conference that planned the uprising against them during the ensuing thirteen years war (145466) he actively supported the prussian cities war effort with substantial monetary subsidies (only part of which he later re-claimed) with political activity in toru and danzig and by personally fighting in battles at asin (lessen) and malbork (marienburg) he died in 1462
lucas watzenrode the younger the astronomer's maternal uncle and patron was educated at the university of krakw (now jagiellonian university) and at the universities of cologne and bologna he was a bitter opponent of the teutonic order and its grand master once referred to him as the devil incarnate in 1489 watzenrode was elected bishop of warmia (ermeland ermland) against the preference of king casimir iv who had hoped to install his own son in that seat as a result watzenrode quarreled with the king until casimir iv's death three years later watzenrode was then able to form close relations with three successive polish monarchs john i albert alexander jagiellon and sigismund i the old he was a friend and key advisor to each ruler and his influence greatly strengthened the ties between warmia and poland proper watzenrode came to be considered the most powerful man in warmia and his wealth connections and influence allowed him to secure copernicus education and career as a canon at frombork cathedral
=== languages ===
copernicus is postulated to have spoken latin and german with equal fluency he also spoke polish greek and italian the vast majority of copernicus surviving works are in latin which in his lifetime was the language of academia in europe latin was also the official language of the roman catholic church and of poland's royal court and thus all of copernicus correspondence with the church and with polish leaders was in latin
there survive a few documents written by copernicus in german the german philosophy professor martin carrier mentions this as a reason to consider copernicus native language to have been german other arguments for german being copernicus native tongue are that he was born in a predominantly german-speaking city and that while studying canon law at bologna in 1496 he signed into the german natio (natio germanorum)a student organization which according to its 1497 by-laws was open to students of all kingdoms and states whose mother-tongue was german however according to french philosopher alexandre koyr copernicus registration with the natio germanorum does not in itself imply that copernicus considered himself german since students from prussia and silesia were routinely so categorized which carried certain privileges that made it a natural choice for german-speaking students regardless of their ethnicity or self-identification
=== name ===
in copernicus time people were often called after the places where they lived like the silesian village that inspired it copernicus surname has been spelled variously the surname likely had something to do with the local silesian copper-mining industry though some scholars assert that it may have been inspired by the dill plant (in polish koperek or kopernik") that grows wild in silesia
as was to be the case with william shakespeare a century later numerous spelling variants of the name are documented for the astronomer and his relatives the name first appeared as a place name in silesia in the 13th century where it was spelled variously in latin documents copernicus was rather indifferent about orthography during his childhood about 1480 the name of his father (and thus of the future astronomer) was recorded in thorn as niclas koppernigk at krakw he signed himself in latin nicolaus nicolai de torunia (nicolaus son of nicolaus of toru) at bologna in 1496 he registered in the matricula nobilissimi germanorum collegii resp annales clarissimae nacionis germanorum of the natio germanica bononiae as dominus nicolaus kopperlingk de thorn ix grosseti at padua he signed himself nicolaus copernik later coppernicus the astronomer thus latinized his name to coppernicus generally with two p"s (in 23 of 31 documents studied) but later in life he used a single p on the title page of de revolutionibus rheticus published the name as (in the genitive or possessive case) nicolai copernici
=== education ===
==== in poland ====
upon the father's death young nicolaus maternal uncle lucas watzenrode the younger (14471512) took the boy under his wing and saw to his education and career watzenrode maintained contacts with leading intellectual figures in poland and was a friend of the influential italian-born humanist and krakw courtier filippo buonaccorsi there are no surviving primary documents on the early years of copernicus childhood and education copernicus biographers assume that watzenrode first sent young copernicus to st john's school at toru where he himself had been a master later according to armitage the boy attended the cathedral school at wocawek up the vistula river from toru which prepared pupils for entrance to the university of krakw watzenrode's alma mater in poland's capital
in the winter semester of 149192 copernicus as nicolaus nicolai de thuronia matriculated together with his brother andrew at the university of krakw (now jagiellonian university) copernicus began his studies in the department of arts (from the fall of 1491 presumably until the summer or fall of 1495) in the heyday of the krakw astronomical-mathematical school acquiring the foundations for his subsequent mathematical achievements according to a later but credible tradition (jan broek) copernicus was a pupil of albert brudzewski who by then (from 1491) was a professor of aristotelian philosophy but taught astronomy privately outside the university copernicus became familiar with brudzewski's widely read commentary to georg von peuerbach's theoric nov planetarum and almost certainly attended the lectures of bernard of biskupie and wojciech krypa of szamotuy and probably other astronomical lectures by jan of gogw micha of wrocaw (breslau) wojciech of pniewy and marcin bylica of olkusz
copernicus krakw studies gave him a thorough grounding in the mathematical-astronomical knowledge taught at the university (arithmetic geometry geometric optics cosmography theoretical and computational astronomy) a good knowledge of the philosophical and natural-science writings of aristotle (de coelo metaphysics) stimulated his interest in learning and made him conversant with humanistic culture copernicus broadened the knowledge that he took from the university lecture halls with independent reading of books that he acquired during his krakw years (euclid haly abenragel the alfonsine tables johannes regiomontanus tabulae directionum) to this period probably also date his earliest scientific notes now preserved partly at uppsala university at krakw copernicus began collecting a large library on astronomy it would later be carried off as war booty by the swedes during the deluge in the 1650s and is now at the uppsala university library
copernicus four years at krakw played an important role in the development of his critical faculties and initiated his analysis of the logical contradictions in the two most popular systems of astronomyaristotle's theory of homocentric spheres and ptolemy's mechanism of eccentrics and epicyclesthe surmounting and discarding of which constituted the first step toward the creation of copernicus own doctrine of the structure of the universe
without taking a degree probably in the fall of 1495 copernicus left krakw for the court of his uncle watzenrode who in 1489 had been elevated to prince-bishop of warmia and soon (before november 1495) sought to place his nephew in the warmia canonry vacated by 26 august 1495 death of its previous tenant jan czanow for unclear reasonsprobably due to opposition from part of the chapter who appealed to romecopernicus installation was delayed inclining watzenrode to send both his nephews to study canon law in italy seemingly with a view to furthering their ecclesiastic careers and thereby also strengthening his own influence in the warmia chapter
leaving warmia in mid-1496possibly with the retinue of the chapter's chancellor jerzy pranghe who was going to italyin the fall possibly the october of that year copernicus arrived in bologna and a few months later (after 6 january 1497) signed himself into the register of the bologna university of jurists german nation which also included young poles from silesia prussia and pomerania as well as students of other nationalities
==== in italy ====
it was only on 20 october 1497 that copernicus by proxy formally succeeded to the warmia canonry which had been granted to him two years earlier to this by a document dated 10 january 1503 at padua he would add a sinecure at the collegiate church of the holy cross in wrocaw silesia bohemia despite having been granted a papal indult on 29 november 1508 to receive further benefices through his ecclesiastic career copernicus not only did not acquire further prebends and higher stations (prelacies) at the chapter but in 1538 he relinquished the wrocaw sinecure it is unclear whether he was ever ordained a priest author ed rosen asserts that he was not he did take minor orders which sufficed for assuming a chapter canonry the catholic encyclopedia proposes that his ordination was probable as he was one of four candidates for the episcopal seat of ermland a position which requires ordination
during his three-year stay at bologna between fall 1496 and spring 1501 copernicus seems to have devoted himself less keenly to studying canon law (he received his doctorate in law only after seven years following a second return to italy in 1503) than to studying the humanitiesprobably attending lectures by filippo beroaldo antonio urceo called codro giovanni garzoni and alessandro achilliniand to studying astronomy he met the famous astronomer domenico maria novara da ferrara and became his disciple and assistant copernicus was developing new ideas inspired by reading the epitome of the almagest (epitome in almagestum ptolemei) by george von peuerbach and johannes regiomontanus (venice 1496) he verified its observations about certain peculiarities in ptolemy's theory of the moon's motion by conducting on 9 march 1497 at bologna a memorable observation of the occultation of aldebaran the brightest star in the taurus constellation by the moon copernicus the humanist sought confirmation for his growing doubts through close reading of greek and latin authors (pythagoras aristarchos of samos cleomedes cicero pliny the elder plutarch philolaus heraclides ecphantos plato) gathering especially while at padua fragmentary historic information about ancient astronomical cosmological and calendar systems
copernicus spent the jubilee year 1500 in rome where he arrived with his brother andrew that spring doubtless to perform an apprenticeship at the papal curia here too however he continued his astronomical work begun at bologna observing for example a lunar eclipse on the night of 56 november 1500 according to a later account by rheticus copernicus alsoprobably privately rather than at the roman sapienzaas a professor mathematum (professor of astronomy) delivered to numerous students and leading masters of the science public lectures devoted probably to a critique of the mathematical solutions of contemporary astronomy
on his return journey doubtless stopping briefly at bologna in mid-1501 copernicus arrived back in warmia after on 28 july receiving from the chapter a two-year extension of leave in order to study medicine (since he may in future be a useful medical advisor to our reverend superior [bishop lucas watzenrode] and the gentlemen of the chapter") in late summer or in the fall he returned again to italy probably accompanied by his brother andrew and by canon b sculteti this time he studied at the university of padua famous as a seat of medical learning andexcept for a brief visit to ferrara in mayjune 1503 to pass examinations for and receive his doctorate in canon lawhe remained at padua from fall 1501 to summer 1503
copernicus studied medicine probably under the direction of leading padua professorsbartolomeo da montagnana girolamo fracastoro gabriele zerbi alessandro benedettiand read medical treatises that he acquired at this time by valescus de taranta jan mesue hugo senensis jan ketham arnold de villa nova and michele savonarola which would form the embryo of his later medical library
one of the subjects that copernicus must have studied was astrology since it was considered an important part of a medical education however unlike most other prominent renaissance astronomers he appears never to have practiced or expressed any interest in astrology
as at bologna copernicus did not limit himself to his official studies it was probably the padua years that saw the beginning of his hellenistic interests he familiarized himself with greek language and culture with the aid of theodorus gaza's grammar (1495) and j.b chrestonius dictionary (1499) expanding his studies of antiquity begun at bologna to the writings of basilius bessarion lorenzo valla and others there also seems to be evidence that it was during his padua stay that the idea finally crystallized of basing a new system of the world on the movement of the earth as the time approached for copernicus to return home in spring 1503 he journeyed to ferrara where on 31 may 1503 having passed the obligatory examinations he was granted the degree of doctor of canon law (nicolaus copernich de prusia jure canonico  et doctoratus) no doubt it was soon after (at latest in fall 1503) that he left italy for good to return to warmia
=== work ===
having completed all his studies in italy 30-year-old copernicus returned to warmia where he would live out the remaining 40 years of his life apart from brief journeys to krakw and to nearby prussian cities toru (thorn) gdask (danzig) elblg (elbing) grudzidz (graudenz) malbork (marienburg) knigsberg (krlewiec)
the prince-bishopric of warmia enjoyed substantial autonomy with its own diet (parliament) and monetary unit (the same as in the other parts of royal prussia) and treasury
copernicus was his uncle's secretary and physician from 1503 to 1510 (or perhaps till his uncle's death on 29 march 1512) and resided in the bishop's castle at lidzbark (heilsberg) where he began work on his heliocentric theory in his official capacity he took part in nearly all his uncle's political ecclesiastic and administrative-economic duties from the beginning of 1504 copernicus accompanied watzenrode to sessions of the royal prussian diet held at malbork and elblg and write dobrzycki and hajdukiewicz participated in all the more important events in the complex diplomatic game that ambitious politician and statesman played in defense of the particular interests of prussia and warmia between hostility to the [teutonic] order and loyalty to the polish crown.
in 150412 copernicus made numerous journeys as part of his uncle's retinuein 1504 to toru and gdask to a session of the royal prussian council in the presence of poland's king alexander jagiellon to sessions of the prussian diet at malbork (1506) elblg (1507) and sztum (stuhm) (1512) and he may have attended a pozna (posen) session (1510) and the coronation of poland's king sigismund i the old in krakw (1507) watzenrode's itinerary suggests that in spring 1509 copernicus may have attended the krakw sejm
it was probably on the latter occasion in krakw that copernicus submitted for printing at jan haller's press his translation from greek to latin of a collection by the 7th-century byzantine historian theophylact simocatta of 85 brief poems called epistles or letters supposed to have passed between various characters in a greek story they are of three kinds"moral, offering advice on how people should live pastoral giving little pictures of shepherd life and amorous comprising love poems they are arranged to follow one another in a regular rotation of subjects copernicus had translated the greek verses into latin prose and he now published his version as theophilacti scolastici simocati epistolae morales rurales et amatoriae interpretatione latina which he dedicated to his uncle in gratitude for all the benefits he had received from him with this translation copernicus declared himself on the side of the humanists in the struggle over the question whether greek literature should be revived copernicus first poetic work was a greek epigram composed probably during a visit to krakw for johannes dantiscus epithalamium for barbara zapolya's 1512 wedding to king zygmunt i the old
some time before 1514 copernicus wrote an initial outline of his heliocentric theory known only from later transcripts by the title (perhaps given to it by a copyist) nicolai copernici de hypothesibus motuum coelestium a se constitutis commentarioluscommonly referred to as the commentariolus it was a succinct theoretical description of the world's heliocentric mechanism without mathematical apparatus and differed in some important details of geometric construction from de revolutionibus but it was already based on the same assumptions regarding earth's triple motions the commentariolus which copernicus consciously saw as merely a first sketch for his planned book was not intended for printed distribution he made only a very few manuscript copies available to his closest acquaintances including it seems several krakw astronomers with whom he collaborated in 151530 in observing eclipses tycho brahe would include a fragment from the commentariolus in his own treatise astronomiae instauratae progymnasmata published in prague in 1602 based on a manuscript that he had received from the bohemian physician and astronomer tade hjek a friend of rheticus the commentariolus would appear complete in print for the first time only in 1878
in 1510 or 1512 copernicus moved to frombork a town to the northwest at the vistula lagoon on the baltic sea coast there in april 1512 he participated in the election of fabian of lossainen as prince-bishop of warmia it was only in early june 1512 that the chapter gave copernicus an external curia"a house outside the defensive walls of the cathedral mount in 1514 he purchased the northwestern tower within the walls of the frombork stronghold he would maintain both these residences to the end of his life despite the devastation of the chapter's buildings by a raid against frauenburg carried out by the teutonic order in january 1520 during which copernicus astronomical instruments were probably destroyed copernicus conducted astronomical observations in 151316 presumably from his external curia and in 152243 from an unidentified small tower (turricula) using primitive instruments modeled on ancient onesthe quadrant triquetrum armillary sphere at frombork copernicus conducted over half of his more than 60 registered astronomical observations
having settled permanently at frombork where he would reside to the end of his life with interruptions in 151619 and 152021 copernicus found himself at the warmia chapter's economic and administrative center which was also one of warmia's two chief centers of political life in the difficult politically complex situation of warmia threatened externally by the teutonic order's aggressions (attacks by teutonic bands the polish-teutonic war of 151921 albert's plans to annex warmia) internally subject to strong separatist pressures (the selection of the prince-bishops of warmia currency reform) he together with part of the chapter represented a program of strict cooperation with the polish crown and demonstrated in all his public activities (the defense of his country against the order's plans of conquest proposals to unify its monetary system with the polish crown's support for poland's interests in the warmia dominion's ecclesiastic administration) that he was consciously a citizen of the polish-lithuanian republic soon after the death of uncle bishop watzenrode he participated in the signing of the second treaty of piotrkw trybunalski (7 december 1512) governing the appointment of the bishop of warmia declaring despite opposition from part of the chapter for loyal cooperation with the polish crown
that same year (before 8 november 1512) copernicus assumed responsibility as magister pistoriae for administering the chapter's economic enterprises (he would hold this office again in 1530) having already since 1511 fulfilled the duties of chancellor and visitor of the chapter's estates
his administrative and economic dutes did not distract copernicus in 151215 from intensive observational activity the results of his observations of mars and saturn in this period and especially a series of four observations of the sun made in 1515 led to discovery of the variability of earth's eccentricity and of the movement of the solar apogee in relation to the fixed stars which in 151519 prompted his first revisions of certain assumptions of his system some of the observations that he made in this period may have had a connection with a proposed reform of the julian calendar made in the first half of 1513 at the request of the bishop of fossombrone paul of middelburg their contacts in this matter in the period of the fifth lateran council were later memorialized in a complimentary mention in copernicus dedicatory epistle in d revolutionibus orbium coelestium and in a treatise by paul of middelburg secundum compendium correctionis calendarii (1516) which mentions copernicus among the learned men who had sent the council proposals for the calendar's emendation
during 151621 copernicus resided at olsztyn (allenstein) castle as economic administrator of warmia including olsztyn (allenstein) and pienino (mehlsack) while there he wrote a manuscript locationes mansorum desertorum (locations of deserted fiefs) with a view to populating those fiefs with industrious farmers and so bolstering the economy of warmia when olsztyn was besieged by the teutonic knights during the polishteutonic war copernicus directed the defense of olsztyn and warmia by royal polish forces he also represented the polish side in the ensuing peace negotiations
copernicus for years advised the royal prussian sejmik on monetary reform particularly in the 1520s when that was a major question in regional prussian politics in 1526 he wrote a study on the value of money monetae cudendae ratio in it he formulated an early iteration of the theory now called gresham's law that bad (debased) coinage drives good (un-debased) coinage out of circulationseveral decades before thomas gresham he also in 1517 set down a quantity theory of money a principal concept in economics to the present day copernicus recommendations on monetary reform were widely read by leaders of both prussia and poland in their attempts to stabilize currency
in 1533 johann widmanstetter secretary to pope clement vii explained copernicus heliocentric system to the pope and two cardinals the pope was so pleased that he gave widmanstetter a valuable gift in 1535 bernard wapowski wrote a letter to a gentleman in vienna urging him to publish an enclosed almanac which he claimed had been written by copernicus this is the only mention of a copernicus almanac in the historical records the almanac was likely copernicus tables of planetary positions wapowski's letter mentions copernicus theory about the motions of the earth nothing came of wapowski's request because he died a couple of weeks later
following the death of prince-bishop of warmia mauritius ferber (1 july 1537) copernicus participated in the election of his successor johannes dantiscus (20 september 1537) copernicus was one of four candidates for the post written in at the initiative of tiedemann giese but his candidacy was actually pro forma since dantiscus had earlier been named coadjutor bishop to ferber at first copernicus maintained friendly relations with the new prince-bishop assisting him medically in spring 1538 and accompanying him that summer on an inspection tour of chapter holdings but that autumn their friendship was strained by suspicions over copernicus housekeeper anna schilling whom dantiscus removed from frombork in 1539
in his younger days copernicus the physician had treated his uncle brother and other chapter members in later years he was called upon to attend the elderly bishops who in turn occupied the see of warmiamauritius ferber and johannes dantiscus and in 1539 his old friend tiedemann giese bishop of chemno (kulm) in treating such important patients he sometimes sought consultations from other physicians including the physician to duke albert and by letter the polish royal physician
in the spring of 1541 duke albert summoned copernicus to knigsberg to attend the duke's counselor george von kunheim who had fallen seriously ill and for whom the prussian doctors seemed unable to do anything copernicus went willingly he had met von kunheim during negotiations over reform of the coinage and copernicus had come to feel that albert himself was not such a bad person the two had many intellectual interests in common the chapter readily gave copernicus permission to go as it wished to remain on good terms with the duke despite his lutheran faith in about a month the patient recovered and copernicus returned to frombork for a time he continued to receive reports on von kunheim's condition and to send him medical advice by letter throughout this period of his life copernicus continued making astronomical observations and calculations but only as his other responsibilities permitted and never in a professional capacity
some of copernicus close friends turned protestant but copernicus never showed a tendency in that direction the first attacks on him came from protestants wilhelm gnapheus a dutch refugee settled in elblg wrote a comedy in latin morosophus (the foolish sage) and staged it at the latin school that he had established there in the play copernicus was caricatured as a haughty cold aloof man who dabbled in astrology considered himself inspired by god and was rumored to have written a large work that was moldering in a chest
elsewhere protestants were the first to react to news of copernicus theory melanchthon wrote
some people believe that it is excellent and correct to work out a thing as absurd as did that sarmatian [i.e. polish] astronomer who moves the earth and stops the sun indeed wise rulers should have curbed such light-mindedness
nevertheless in 1551 eight years after copernicus death astronomer erasmus reinhold published under the sponsorship of copernicus former military adversary the protestant duke albert the prussian tables a set of astronomical tables based on copernicus work astronomers and astrologers quickly adopted it in place of its predecessors
=== heliocentrism ===
some time before 1514 copernicus made available to friends his commentariolus ("little commentary") a forty-page manuscript describing his ideas about the heliocentric hypothesis it contained seven basic assumptions (detailed below) thereafter he continued gathering data for a more detailed work
about 1532 copernicus had basically completed his work on the manuscript of d revolutionibus orbium coelestium but despite urging by his closest friends he resisted openly publishing his views not wishingas he confessedto risk the scorn to which he would expose himself on account of the novelty and incomprehensibility of his theses.
in 1533 johann albrecht widmannstetter delivered a series of lectures in rome outlining copernicus theory pope clement vii and several catholic cardinals heard the lectures and were interested in the theory on 1 november 1536 cardinal nikolaus von schnberg archbishop of capua wrote to copernicus from rome
some years ago word reached me concerning your proficiency of which everybody constantly spoke at that time i began to have a very high regard for you for i had learned that you had not merely mastered the discoveries of the ancient astronomers uncommonly well but had also formulated a new cosmology in it you maintain that the earth moves that the sun occupies the lowest and thus the central place in the universe therefore with the utmost earnestness i entreat you most learned sir unless i inconvenience you to communicate this discovery of yours to scholars and at the earliest possible moment to send me your writings on the sphere of the universe together with the tables and whatever else you have that is relevant to this subject 
by then copernicus work was nearing its definitive form and rumors about his theory had reached educated people all over europe despite urgings from many quarters copernicus delayed publication of his book perhaps from fear of criticisma fear delicately expressed in the subsequent dedication of his masterpiece to pope paul iii scholars disagree on whether copernicus concern was limited to possible astronomical and philosophical objections or whether he was also concerned about religious objections
=== the book ===
copernicus was still working on de revolutionibus orbium coelestium (even if not certain that he wanted to publish it) when in 1539 georg joachim rheticus a wittenberg mathematician arrived in frombork philipp melanchthon a close theological ally of martin luther had arranged for rheticus to visit several astronomers and study with them rheticus became copernicus pupil staying with him for two years and writing a book narratio prima (first account) outlining the essence of copernicus theory in 1542 rheticus published a treatise on trigonometry by copernicus (later included in the second book of de revolutionibus)
under strong pressure from rheticus and having seen the favorable first general reception of his work copernicus finally agreed to give de revolutionibus to his close friend tiedemann giese bishop of chemno (kulm) to be delivered to rheticus for printing by the german printer johannes petreius at nuremberg (nrnberg) germany while rheticus initially supervised the printing he had to leave nuremberg before it was completed and he handed over the task of supervising the rest of the printing to a lutheran theologian andreas osiander
osiander added an unauthorised and unsigned preface defending the work against those who might be offended by the novel hypotheses he explained that astronomers may find different causes for observed motions and choose whatever is easier to grasp as long as a hypothesis allows reliable computation it does not have to match what a philosopher might seek as the truth
=== death ===
toward the close of 1542 copernicus was seized with apoplexy and paralysis and he died at age 70 on 24 may 1543 legend has it that he was presented with the final printed pages of his d revolutionibus orbium coelestium on the very day that he died allowing him to take farewell of his life's work he is reputed to have awoken from a stroke-induced coma looked at his book and then died peacefully
copernicus was reportedly buried in frombork cathedral where archaeologists for over two centuries searched in vain for his remains efforts to locate the remains in 1802 1909 1939 and 2004 had come to nought in august 2005 however a team led by jerzy gssowski head of an archaeology and anthropology institute in putusk after scanning beneath the cathedral floor discovered what they believed to be copernicus remains
the find came after a year of searching and the discovery was announced only after further research on 3 november 2008 gssowski said he was almost 100 percent sure it is copernicus forensic expert capt dariusz zajdel of the polish police central forensic laboratory used the skull to reconstruct a face that closely resembled the featuresincluding a broken nose and a scar above the left eyeon a copernicus self-portrait the expert also determined that the skull belonged to a man who had died around age 70copernicus age at the time of his death
the grave was in poor condition and not all the remains of the skeleton were found missing among other things was the lower jaw the dna from the bones found in the grave matched hair samples taken from a book owned by copernicus which was kept at the library of the university of uppsala in sweden
on 22 may 2010 copernicus was given a second funeral in a mass led by jzef kowalczyk the former papal nuncio to poland and newly named primate of poland copernicus remains were reburied in the same spot in frombork cathedral where part of his skull and other bones had been found a black granite tombstone now identifies him as the founder of the heliocentric theory and also a church canon the tombstone bears a representation of copernicus model of the solar systema golden sun encircled by six of the planets

=== predecessors ===
philolaus (c 480385 bce) described an astronomical system in which a central fire (different from the sun) occupied the centre of the universe and a counter-earth the earth moon the sun itself planets and stars all revolved around it in that order outward from the centre heraclides ponticus (387312 bce) proposed that the earth rotates on its axis aristarchus of samos (310 bce c 230 bce) was the first to advance a theory that the earth orbited the sun further mathematical details of aristarchus heliocentric system were worked out around 150 bc by the hellenistic astronomer seleucus of seleucia though aristarchus original text has been lost a reference in archimedes book the sand reckoner (archimedis syracusani arenarius & dimensio circuli) describes a work by aristarchus in which he advanced the heliocentric model archimedes wrote
you (king gelon) are aware the universe is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the earth while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the sun and the center of the earth this is the common account as you have heard from astronomers but aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses wherein it appears as a consequence of the assumptions made that the universe is many times greater than the universe just mentioned his hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the sun remain unmoved that the earth revolves about the sun on the circumference of a circle the sun lying in the middle of the floor and that the sphere of the fixed stars situated about the same center as the sun is so great that the circle in which he supposes the earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface
copernicus cited aristarchus of samos in an early (unpublished) manuscript of de revolutionibus (which still survives) though he removed the reference from his final published manuscript
some technical details of copernicus's system closely resembled those developed earlier by the islamic astronomers nar al-dn al-s and ibn al-shir both of whom retained a geocentric model aryabhata (476550) in his magnum opus aryabhatiya (499) propounded a planetary model in which the earth was taken to be spinning on its axis and the periods of the planets were given with respect to the sun he accurately calculated many astronomical constants such as the periods of the planets times of the solar and lunar eclipses and the instantaneous motion of the moon
at the maragha observatory najm al-dn al-qazwn al-ktib (died 1277) in his hikmat al-'ain wrote an argument for a heliocentric model but later abandoned the model qutb al-din shirazi (born 1236) also discussed the possibility of heliocentrism but rejected it.[41] ibn al-shatir (born 1304) developed a geocentric system that employed mathematical techniques such as the tusi couple and urdi lemma that were almost identical to those nicolaus copernicus later employed in his heliocentric system implying that its mathematical model was influenced by the maragha school
nilakantha somayaji (14441544) in his aryabhatiyabhasya a commentary on aryabhata's aryabhatiya developed a computational system for a partially heliocentric planetary model in which the planets orbit the sun which in turn orbits the earth similar to the tychonic system later proposed by tycho brahe in the late 16th century in the tantrasangraha (1500) he further revised his planetary system which was mathematically more accurate at predicting the heliocentric orbits of the interior planets than both the tychonic and copernican models
the prevailing theory in europe during copernicus lifetime was the one that ptolemy published in his almagest circa 150 ce the earth was the stationary center of the universe stars were embedded in a large outer sphere which rotated rapidly approximately daily while each of the planets the sun and the moon were embedded in their own smaller spheres ptolemy's system employed devices including epicycles deferents and equants to account for observations that the paths of these bodies differed from simple circular orbits centered on the earth
=== copernicus ===
copernicus major theory was published in d revolutionibus orbium coelestium (on the revolutions of the celestial spheres) in the year of his death 1543 though he had formulated the theory several decades earlier
copernicus commentariolus summarized his heliocentric theory it listed the assumptions upon which the theory was based as follows
1 there is no one center of all the celestial circles or spheres
2 the center of the earth is not the center of the universe but only of gravity and of the lunar sphere
3 all the spheres revolve about the sun as their midpoint and therefore the sun is the center of the universe
4 the ratio of the earth's distance from the sun to the height of the firmament (outermost celestial sphere containing the stars) is so much smaller than the ratio of the earth's radius to its distance from the sun that the distance from the earth to the sun is imperceptible in comparison with the height of the firmament
5 whatever motion appears in the firmament arises not from any motion of the firmament but from the earth's motion the earth together with its circumjacent elements performs a complete rotation on its fixed poles in a daily motion while the firmament and highest heaven abide unchanged
6 what appear to us as motions of the sun arise not from its motion but from the motion of the earth and our sphere with which we revolve about the sun like any other planet the earth has then more than one motion
7 the apparent retrograde and direct motion of the planets arises not from their motion but from the earth's the motion of the earth alone therefore suffices to explain so many apparent inequalities in the heavens
de revolutionibus itself was divided into six parts called books
general vision of the heliocentric theory and a summarized exposition of his idea of the world
mainly theoretical presents the principles of spherical astronomy and a list of stars (as a basis for the arguments developed in the subsequent books)
mainly dedicated to the apparent motions of the sun and to related phenomena
description of the moon and its orbital motions
exposition of the motions in longitude of the non-terrestrial planets
exposition of the motions in latitude of the non-terrestrial planets
=== successors ===
georg joachim rheticus could have been copernicus successor but did not rise to the occasion erasmus reinhold could have been his successor but died prematurely the first of the great successors was tycho brahe (though he did not think the earth orbited the sun) followed by johannes kepler who had worked as tycho's assistant in prague
despite the near universal acceptance later of the heliocentric idea (though not the epicycles or the circular orbits) copernicus theory was originally slow to catch on scholars hold that sixty years after the publication of the revolutions there were only around 15 astronomers espousing copernicanism in all of europe thomas digges and thomas harriot in england giordano bruno and galileo galilei in italy diego zuniga in spain simon stevin in the low countries and in germany the largest group georg joachim rheticus michael maestlin christoph rothmann (who may have later recanted) and johannes kepler. additional possibilities are englishman william gilbert along with achilles gasser georg vogelin valentin otto and tiedemann giese
arthur koestler in his popular book the sleepwalkers asserted that copernicus book had not been widely read on its first publication this claim was trenchantly criticised by edward rosen and has been decisively disproved by owen gingerich who examined nearly every surviving copy of the first two editions and found copious marginal notes by their owners throughout many of them gingerich published his conclusions in 2004 in the book nobody read
the intellectual climate of the time remained dominated by aristotelian philosophy and the corresponding ptolemaic astronomy at that time there was no reason to accept the copernican theory except for its mathematical simplicity [by avoiding using the equant in determining planetary positions]. tycho brahe's system ("that the earth is stationary the sun revolves about the earth and the other planets revolve about the sun") also directly competed with copernicus it was only a half century later with the work of kepler and galileo that any substantial evidence defending copernicanism appeared starting from the time when galileo formulated the principle of inertia...[which] helped to explain why everything would not fall off the earth if it were in motion. it was not until after isaac newton formulated the universal law of gravitation and the laws of mechanics [in his 1687 principia] which unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics was the heliocentric view generally accepted.
== controversy ==
only mild controversy (and no fierce sermons) was the immediate result of the 1543 publication of copernicus book at the council of trent (154563) neither copernicus theory nor calendar reform (which would later use tables deduced from copernicus calculations) were discussed it has been much debated why it was not until six decades after the publication of de revolutionibus that the catholic church took any official action against it even the efforts of tolosani going unheeded catholic side opposition only commenced seventy-three years later when it was occasioned by galileo
the first notable to move against copernicanism was the magister of the holy palace (i.e. the catholic church's chief censor) dominican bartolomeo spina who expressed a desire to stamp out the copernican doctrine but with spina's death in 1546 his cause fell to his friend the well known theologian-astronomer the dominican giovanni maria tolosani of the convent of st mark in florence tolosani had written a treatise on reforming the calendar (in which astronomy would play a large role) and had attended the fifth lateran council (151217) to discuss the matter he had obtained a copy of de revolutionibus in 1544 his denunciation of copernicanism was written a year later in 1545 in an appendix to his unpublished work on the truth of sacred scripture
emulating the rationalistic style of thomas aquinas tolosani sought to refute copernicanism by philosophical argument while still invoking christian scripture and tradition tolosani strove to show that copernicanism was absurd because it was unproven and unfounded first copernicus had assumed the motion of the earth but offered no physical theory whereby one would deduce this motion (no one realized that the investigation into copernicanism would result in a rethinking of the entire field of physics.) second tolosani charged that copernicus thought process was backwards he held that copernicus had come up with his idea and then sought phenomena that would support it rather than observing phenomena and deducing from them the idea of what caused them in this tolosani was linking copernicus mathematical equations with the practices of the pythagoreans (whom aristotle had made arguments against which were later picked up by thomas aquinas) it was argued that mathematical numbers were a mere product of the intellect without any physical reality and as such numbers could not provide physical causes in the investigation of nature. (this was basically a denial of the possibility of mathematical physics.)
some astronomical hypotheses at the time (such as epicycles and eccentrics) were seen as mere mathematical devices to adjust calculations of where the heavenly bodies would appear rather than an explanation of the cause of those motions (as copernicus still maintained the idea of perfectly spherical orbits he relied on epicycles.) this saving the phenomena was seen as proof that astronomy and mathematics could not be taken as serious means to determine physical causes tolosani invoked this view in his final critique of copernicus saying that his biggest error was that he had started with inferior fields of science to make pronouncements about superior fields copernicus had used mathematics and astronomy to postulate about physics and cosmology rather than beginning with the accepted principles of physics and cosmology to determine things about astronomy and mathematics thus copernicus seemed to be undermining the whole system of the philosophy of science at the time tolosani held that copernicus had fallen into philosophical error because he had not been versed in physics and logic anyone without such knowledge would make a poor astronomer and be unable to distinguish truth from falsehood because copernicanism had not met the criteria for scientific truth set out by thomas aquinas tolosani held that it could only be viewed as a wild unproven theory
tolosani recognized that the ad lectorem preface to copernicus book was not actually by him its thesis that astronomy as a whole would never be able to make truth claims was rejected by tolosani (though he still held that copernicus attempt to describe physical reality had been faulty) he found it ridiculous that ad lectorem had been included in the book (unaware that copernicus had not authorized its inclusion) tolosani wrote by means of these words [of the ad lectorem] the foolishness of this book's author is rebuked for by a foolish effort he [copernicus] tried to revive the weak pythagorean opinion [that the element of fire was at the center of the universe] long ago deservedly destroyed since it is expressly contrary to human reason and also opposes holy writ from this situation there could easily arise disagreements between catholic expositors of holy scripture and those who might wish to adhere obstinately to this false opinion we have written this little work for the purpose of avoiding this scandal. tolosani declared nicolaus copernicus neither read nor understood the arguments of aristotle the philosopher and ptolemy the astronomer. tolosani wrote that copernicus is very deficient in the sciences of physics and logic moreover it appears that he is unskilled with regard to [the interpretation of] holy scripture since he contradicts several of its principles not without danger of infidelity to himself and the readers of his book his arguments have no force and can very easily be taken apart for it is stupid to contradict an opinion accepted by everyone over a very long time for the strongest reasons unless the impugner uses more powerful and insoluble demonstrations and completely dissolves the opposed reasons but he does not do this in the least. tolosani declared that he had written against copernicus for the purpose of preserving the truth to the common advantage of the holy church. despite the effort that tolosani put into his work it remained unpublished and it was likely shelved in the library of the dominican order at san marco in florence awaiting its use by some new prosecutor (it is believed that dominican tommaso caccini read it before delivering a sermon against galileo in december 1613)
how entwined the pre-copernican theory was in theological circles can be seen in a sample of the works of john calvin in his commentary on genesis he said that we indeed are not ignorant that the circuit of the heavens is finite and that the earth like a little globe is placed in the centre. commenting on job 26:7 calvin wrote it is true that job specifically says the north, and yet he is speaking about the whole heaven and that is because the sky turns around upon the pole that is there for just as in the wheels of a chariot there is an axle that runs through the middle of them and the wheels turn around the axle by reason of the holes that are in the middle of them even so is it in the skies this is manifestly seen that is to say those who are well acquainted with the course of the firmament see that the sky so turns. calvin's commentaries on the psalms also show a reliance on the pre-copernican theory for psalms 93:1 the heavens revolve daily and immense as is their fabric and inconceivable the rapidity of their revolutions we experience no concussion no disturbance in the harmony of their motion the sun though varying its course every diurnal revolution returns annually to the same point the planets in all their wanderings maintain their respective positions how could the earth hang suspended in the air were it not upheld by god's hand by what means could it maintain itself unmoved while the heavens above are in constant rapid motion did not its divine maker fix and establish it. commenting on psalms 19:4 calvin says the firmament by its own revolution draws with it all the fixed stars there is no evidence that calvin was aware of copernicus and claims that after quoting psalm 93:1 he went on to say who will venture to place the authority of copernicus above the holy spirit have been discredited and shown to originate with frederic william farrar's bampton lecture in 1885 unlike calvin many theologians did become aware of copernicus theory which became increasingly controversial
the sharpest point of conflict between copernicus theory and the bible concerned the story of the battle of gibeon in the book of joshua where the hebrew forces were winning but whose opponents were likely to escape once night fell this is averted by joshua's prayers causing the sun and the moon to stand still martin luther once made a remark about copernicus although without mentioning his name according to anthony lauterbach while eating with martin luther the topic of copernicus arose during dinner on 4 june 1539 (in the same year as professor george joachim rheticus of the local university had been granted leave to visit him) luther is said to have remarked so it goes now whoever wants to be clever must agree with nothing others esteem he must do something of his own this is what that fellow does who wishes to turn the whole of astronomy upside down even in these things that are thrown into disorder i believe the holy scriptures for joshua commanded the sun to stand still and not the earth. these remarks were made four years before the publication of on the revolutions of the heavenly spheres and a year before rheticus narratio prima in john aurifaber's account of the conversation luther calls copernicus that fool rather than that fellow this version is viewed by historians as less reliably sourced
luther's collaborator philipp melanchthon also took issue with copernicanism after receiving the first pages of narratio prima from rheticus himself melanchthon wrote to mithobius (physician and mathematician burkard mithob of feldkirch) on 16 october 1541 condemning the theory and calling for it to be repressed by governmental force writing certain people believe it is a marvelous achievement to extol so crazy a thing like that polish astronomer who makes the earth move and the sun stand still really wise governments ought to repress impudence of mind. it had appeared to rheticus that melanchton would understand the theory and would be open to it this was because melanchton had taught ptolemaic astronomy and had even recommended his friend rheticus to an appointment to the deanship of the faculty of arts & sciences at the university of wittenberg after he had returned from studying with copernicus
rheticus hopes were dashed when six years after the publication of de revolutionibus melanchthon published his initia doctrinae physicae presenting three grounds to reject copernicanism these were the evidence of the senses the thousand-year consensus of men of science and the authority of the bible blasting the new theory melanchthon wrote out of love for novelty or in order to make a show of their cleverness some people have argued that the earth moves they maintain that neither the eighth sphere nor the sun moves whereas they attribute motion to the other celestial spheres and also place the earth among the heavenly bodies nor were these jokes invented recently there is still extant archimedes book on the sand-reckoner in which he reports that aristarchus of samos propounded the paradox that the sun stands still and the earth revolves around the sun even though subtle experts institute many investigations for the sake of exercising their ingenuity nevertheless public proclamation of absurd opinions is indecent and sets a harmful example. melanchthon went on to cite bible passages and then declare encouraged by this divine evidence let us cherish the truth and let us not permit ourselves to be alienated from it by the tricks of those who deem it an intellectual honor to introduce confusion into the arts. in the first edition of initia doctrinae physicae melanchthon even questioned copernicus character claiming his motivation was either from love of novelty or from desire to appear clever these more personal attacks were largely removed by the second edition in 1550
another protestant theologian who took issue with copernicus was john owen who declared that the late hypothesis fixing the sun as in the centre of the world was built on fallible phenomena and advanced by many arbitrary presumptions against evident testimonies of scripture.
in roman catholic circles german jesuit nicolaus serarius was one of the first to write against copernicus theory as heretical citing the joshua passage in a work published in 16091610 and again in a book in 1612
in his 12 april 1615 letter to a catholic defender of copernicus paolo antonio foscarini catholic cardinal robert bellarmine condemned copernican theory writing ...not only the holy fathers but also the modern commentaries on genesis the psalms ecclesiastes and joshua you will find all agreeing in the literal interpretation that the sun is in heaven and turns around the earth with great speed and that the earth is very far from heaven and sits motionless at the center of the world...nor can one answer that this is not a matter of faith since if it is not a matter of faith as regards the topic, it is a matter of faith as regards the speaker and so it would be heretical to say that abraham did not have two children and jacob twelve as well as to say that christ was not born of a virgin because both are said by the holy spirit through the mouth of prophets and apostles.
perhaps the strongest opponent to copernican theory was francesco ingoli a catholic priest ingoli wrote a january 1616 essay condemning copernicanism as philosophically untenable and theologically heretical. though it is not certain it is probable that he was commissioned by the inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy (after the congregation of the index's decree against copernicanism on 5 march 1616 ingoli was officially appointed its consultant) two of ingoli's theological issues with copernicus theory were common catholic beliefs not directly traceable to scripture the doctrine that hell is located at the center of earth and is most distant from heaven and the explicit assertion that earth is motionless in a hymn sung on tuesdays as part of the liturgy of the hours of the divine office prayers regularly recited by priests. ingoli also cited genesis 1:14 where yhwh places lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night. like previous commentators ingoli pointed to the passages about the battle of gibeon and dismissed arguments that they should be taken metaphorically saying replies which assert that scripture speaks according to our mode of understanding are not satisfactory both because in explaining the sacred writings the rule is always to preserve the literal sense when it is possible as it is in this case and also because all the [church] fathers unanimously take this passage to mean that the sun which was truly moving stopped at joshua's request an interpretation which is contrary to the unanimous consent of the fathers is condemned by the council of trent session iv in the decree on the edition and use of the sacred books furthermore although the council speaks about matters of faith and morals nevertheless it cannot be denied that the holy fathers would be displeased with an interpretation of sacred scriptures which is contrary to their common agreement.
in march 1616 in connection with the galileo affair the roman catholic church's congregation of the index issued a decree suspending de revolutionibus until it could be corrected on the grounds that the supposedly pythagorean doctrine that the earth moves and the sun does not was false and altogether opposed to holy scripture the same decree also prohibited any work that defended the mobility of the earth or the immobility of the sun or that attempted to reconcile these assertions with scripture
on the orders of pope paul v cardinal robert bellarmine gave galileo prior notice that the decree was about to be issued and warned him that he could not hold or defend the copernican doctrine the corrections to de revolutionibus which omitted or altered nine sentences were issued four years later in 1620
in 1633 galileo galilei was convicted of grave suspicion of heresy for following the position of copernicus which is contrary to the true sense and authority of holy scripture and was placed under house arrest for the rest of his life
at the instance of roger boscovich the catholic church's 1758 index of prohibited books omitted the general prohibition of works defending heliocentrism but retained the specific prohibitions of the original uncensored versions of de revolutionibus and galileo's dialogue concerning the two chief world systems those prohibitions were finally dropped from the 1835 index
== nationality ==
there has been discussion of copernicus nationality and of whether in fact it is meaningful to ascribe to him a nationality in the modern sense but there are some facts that should be considered when talking about copernicus nationality
nicolaus copernicus was born and educated in the kingdom of poland his alma mater was the university of krakw in poland he and his family for several generations considered themselves as subjects of the crown of the kingdom of poland they stood against enemies of polish kingdom and actively supported it during the conflicts father of nicolaus copernicus lent great amount of money to king of poland for the needs of the war with the teutonic knights and securing toru during that war nicolaus copernicus himself directed the defense of olsztyn and warmia by royal polish forces he also represented the polish side in the ensuing peace negotiations
encyclopdia britannica encyclopedia americana the concise columbia encyclopedia the oxford world encyclopedia and world book encyclopedia refer to copernicus as a polish astronomer sheila rabin writing in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy describes copernicus as a child of a german family [who] was a subject of the polish crown while martin weissenbacher writes that copernicus father was a germanized pole
historian michael burleigh describes the nationality debate as a totally insignificant battle between german and polish scholars during the interwar period polish astronomer konrad rudnicki calls the discussion a fierce scholarly quarrel in  times of nationalism and describes copernicus as an inhabitant of a german-speaking territory that belonged to poland himself being of mixed polish-german extraction
poet czesaw miosz describes the debate as an absurd projection of a modern understanding of nationality onto renaissance people who identified with their home territories rather than with a nation
similarly historian norman davies writes that copernicus as was common in his era was largely indifferent to nationality being a local patriot who considered himself prussian
miosz and davies both write that copernicus had a german-language cultural background while his working language was latin in accord with the usage of the time additionally according to davies there is ample evidence that he knew the polish language davies concludes taking everything into consideration there is good reason to regard him both as a german and as a pole and yet in the sense that modern nationalists understand it he was neither.
== commemoration ==
=== copernicium ===
on 14 july 2009 the discoverers from the gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung in darmstadt germany of chemical element 112 (temporarily named ununbium) proposed to the international union of pure and applied chemistry that its permanent name be copernicium (symbol cn) after we had named elements after our city and our state we wanted to make a statement with a name that was known to everyone, said hofmann we didn't want to select someone who was a german we were looking world-wide. on the 537th anniversary of his birthday the official naming was released to the public
=== veneration ===
copernicus is honored together with johannes kepler in the liturgical calendar of the episcopal church (usa) with a feast day on 23 may
