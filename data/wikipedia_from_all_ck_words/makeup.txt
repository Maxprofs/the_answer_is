=== mineral ===
the term mineral makeup applies to a category of face makeup including foundation eye shadow blush and bronzer made with loose dry mineral powders these powders are often mixed with oil-water emulsions lipsticks liquid foundations and other liquid cosmetics as well as compressed makeups such as eye shadow and blush in compacts are often called mineral makeup if they have the same primary ingredients as dry mineral makeups however liquid makeups must contain preservatives and compressed makeups must contain binders which dry mineral makeups do not mineral makeup usually does not contain synthetic fragrances preservatives parabens mineral oil and chemical dyes for this reason dermatologists may consider mineral makeup to be gentler to the skin than makeup that contains those ingredients some minerals are nacreous or pearlescent giving the skin a shining or sparking appearance one example is bismuth oxychloride
==== benefits ====
although the chemical constituent of cosmetics sometimes cause concerns some chemicals are widely seen as beneficial titanium dioxide found in sunscreens and zinc oxide have anti-inflammatory properties mineral makeups with those ingredients can have a calming effect on the skin which is particularly important for those who suffer from inflammatory problems such as rosacea zinc oxide is anti-microbial so mineral makeups can be beneficial for people with acne
mineral makeup is noncomedogenic (as long as it does not contain talc) and offers a mild amount of sun protection (because of the titanium dioxide and zinc oxide)
because they do not contain liquid ingredients mineral makeups have long shelf-lives
== industry ==
the manufacture of cosmetics is dominated by a small number of multinational corporations that originated in the early 20th century but the distribution and sale of cosmetics is spread among a wide range of businesses the worlds largest cosmetic companies are l'oral procter & gamble unilever shiseido and este lauder in 2005 the market volume of the cosmetics industry in the us europe and japan was about eur 70b/y in the united states the cosmetic industry's size was us$42.8 billion in 2008 in germany the cosmetic industry generated 12.6 billion of retail sales in 2008 which makes the german cosmetic industry the third largest in the world after japan and the united states german exports of cosmetics reached 5.8 billion in 2008 whereas imports of cosmetics totaled 3 billion
the worldwide cosmetics and perfume industry currently generates an estimated annual turnover of us$170 billion (according to eurostaf may 2007) europe is the leading market representing approximately 63 billion while sales in france reached 6.5 billion in 2006 according to fipar (fdration des industries de la parfumerie the french federation for the perfume industry) france is another country in which the cosmetic industry plays an important role both nationally and internationally according to data from 2008 the cosmetic industry has grown constantly in france for 40 consecutive years in 2006 this industrial sector reached a record level of 6.5 billion famous cosmetic brands produced in france include vichy yves saint laurent yves rocher and many others

due to the popularity of cosmetics especially fragrances and perfumes many designers who are not necessarily involved in the cosmetic industry came up with perfumes carrying their names moreover some actors and singers (such as celine dion) have their own perfume line designer perfumes are like any other designer products the most expensive in the industry as the consumer pays for the product and the brand famous italian fragrances are produced by giorgio armani dolce and gabbana and others
procter & gamble which sells covergirl and dolce & gabbana makeup funded a study concluding that makeup makes women seem more competent due to the source of funding the quality of this boston university study is questioned
== controversy ==
during the 20th century the popularity of cosmetics increased rapidly cosmetics are increasingly used by girls at a young age especially in the united states due to the fast-decreasing age of make-up users many companies from high-street brands like rimmel to higher-end products like estee lauder cater to this expanding market by introducing flavored lipsticks and glosses cosmetics packaged in glittery sparkly packaging and marketing and advertising using young models the social consequences of younger and younger cosmetics use has had much attention in the media over the last few years
criticism of cosmetics has come from a wide variety of sources including some feminists religious groups animal rights activists authors and public interest groups
=== safety ===
in the united states cosmetic products are regulated by the fda following the fd&c act section 201 according to these regulations it is illegal to sell unsafe cosmetic products the eu and other regulatory agencies around the world have similar regulations the fda does not have to approve or review cosmetics or what goes in them before they are sold to the consumers the fda only regulates against the colors that can be used in the cosmetics and hair dyes the cosmetic companies do not have to report any injuries from the products they also only have voluntary recalls of products
there has been a marketing trend towards the sale of cosmetics lacking controversial ingredients especially those derived from petroleum sodium lauryl sulfate (sls) and parabens numerous reports have raised concern over the safety of a few surfactants including 2-butoxyethanol sls causes a number of skin problems including dermatitis
parabens can cause skin irritation and contact dermatitis in individuals with paraben allergies a small percentage of the general population animal experiments have shown that parabens have a weak estrogenic activity acting as xenoestrogens in 2013 the eu's scientific committee on consumer safety (sccs) reviewed the latest safety data on parabens and declared them to be harmless at the levels used in cosmetics
synthetic fragrances are widely used in consumer products studies concluded from patch testing show synthetic fragrances are made of many ingredients which cause allergic reactions
balsam of peru was the main recommended marker for perfume allergy before 1977 which is still advised the presence of balsam of peru in a cosmetic will be denoted by the inci term myroxylon pereirae in some instances balsam of peru is listed on the ingredient label of a product by one of its various names but it may not be required to be listed by its name by mandatory labeling conventions (in fragrances for example it may simply be covered by an ingredient listing of fragrance")
cosmetics companies have been criticized for making pseudo-scientific claims about their products which are misleading or unsupported by scientific evidence
often though the speculation of safety of cosmetics originates from scare stories and internet hoaxes unsupported by science many ingredients deemed unsafe by the media have been found safe by scientists in the eu where astringent regulations are enforced
=== animal testing ===
cosmetics testing on animals is particularly controversial such tests involve general toxicity eye and skin irritancy phototoxicity (toxicity triggered by ultraviolet light) and mutagenicity
cosmetics testing is banned in the netherlands belgium and the uk and in 2002 after 13 years of discussion the european union (eu) agreed to phase in a near-total ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics throughout the eu from 2009 and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing france which is home to the world's largest cosmetics company l'oreal has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the european court of justice in luxembourg asking that the ban be quashed the ban is also opposed by the european federation for cosmetics ingredients which represents 70 companies in switzerland belgium france germany and italy
== legislation ==

cosmetic regulations in europe are often updated to follow the trends of innovations and new technologies while ensuring product safety for instance all annexes of the regulation 1223/2009 were aimed to address potential risks to human health under the eu cosmetic regulation manufacturers retailers and importers of cosmetics in europe will be designated as responsible person this new status implies that the responsible person has the legal liability to ensure that the cosmetics and brands they manufacture or sell comply with the current cosmetic regulations and norms the responsible person is also responsible of the documents contained in the product information file (pif) a list of product information including data such as cosmetic product safety report product description gmp statement or product function
=== united states ===
in 1938 the u.s passed the food drug and cosmetic act authorizing the food and drug administration (fda) to oversee safety via legislation in the cosmetic industry and its aspects in the united states the fda joined with 13 other federal agencies in forming the interagency coordinating committee on the validation of alternative methods (iccvam) in 1997 which is an attempt to ban animal testing and find other methods to test cosmetic products
=== brazil ===
anvisa (agncia nacional de vigilncia sanitria brazilian health surveillance agency) is the regulatory body responsible for cosmetic legislation and directives in the country the rules apply to manufacturers importers and retailers of cosmetics in brazil and most of them have been harmonized so they can apply to the entire mercosur

more recently a new cosmetic technical regulation (rdc 15/2013) was set up to establish a list of authorized and restricted substances for cosmetic use used in products such as hair dyes nail hardeners or used as product preservatives
most brazilian regulations are optimized harmonized or adapted in order to be applicable and extended to the entire mercosur economic zone
=== international ===
the international organization for standardization (iso) published new guidelines on the safe manufacturing of cosmetic products under a good manufacturing practices (gmp) regime regulators in several countries and regions have adopted this standard iso 22716:2007 effectively replacing existing guidance and standards iso 22716 provides a comprehensive approach for a quality management system for those engaged in the manufacturing packaging testing storage and transportation of cosmetic end products the standard deals with all aspects of the supply chain from the early delivery of raw materials and components until the shipment of the final product to the consumer
the standard is based on other quality management systems ensuring smooth integration with such systems as iso 9001 or the british retail consortium (brc) standard for consumer products therefore it combines the benefits of gmp linking cosmetic product safety with overall business improvement tools that enable organisations to meet global consumer demand for cosmetic product safety certification
in july 2012 since microbial contamination is one of the greatest concerns regarding the quality of cosmetic products the iso has introduced a new standard for evaluating the antimicrobial protection of a cosmetic product by preservation efficacy testing and microbiological risk assessment
