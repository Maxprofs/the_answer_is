trophic level organism position occupies food chain word trophic derives greek troph referring food feeding food chain represents succession organisms eat another organism turn eaten number steps organism start chain measure trophic level food chains start trophic level primary producers plants move herbivores level predators level typically finish carnivores apex predators level path along chain form either oneway flow food web ecological communities higher biodiversity form complex trophic paths
overviewedit
three basic ways organisms get food producers consumers decomposers
producers autotrophs typically plants algae plants algae usually eat organisms pull nutrients soil ocean manufacture food using photosynthesis reason called primary producers way energy sun usually powers base food chain exception occurs deepsea hydrothermal ecosystems sunlight primary producers manufacture food process called chemosynthesis
consumers heterotrophs species cannot manufacture food need consume organisms animals eat primary producers like plants called herbivores animals eat animals called carnivores animals eat plant animals called omnivores
decomposers detritivores break dead plant animal material wastes release energy nutrients ecosystem recycling decomposers bacteria fungi mushrooms feed waste dead matter converting inorganic chemicals recycled mineral nutrients plants use
trophic levels represented numbers starting level plants trophic levels numbered subsequently according far organism along food chain
level plants algae make food called primary producers
level herbivores eat plants called primary consumers
level carnivores eat herbivores called secondary consumers
level carnivores eat carnivores called tertiary consumers
level apex predators predators top food chain
real world ecosystems one food chain organisms since organisms eat one kind food eaten one type predator diagram sets intricate network intersecting overlapping food chains ecosystem called food web decomposers often left food webs included mark end food chain thus food chains start primary producers end decay decomposers since decomposers recycle nutrients leaving reused primary producers sometimes regarded occupying trophic level
biomass transfer efficiencyedit
general trophic level relates one absorbing energy consumes way regarded resting supported next lower trophic level food chains diagrammed illustrate amount energy moves one feeding level next food chain called energy pyramid energy transferred levels also thought approximating transfer biomass energy pyramids also viewed biomass pyramids picturing amount biomass results higher levels biomass consumed lower levels
efficiency energy biomass transferred one trophic level next called ecological efficiency consumers level convert average chemical energy food organic tissue tenpercent law reason food chains rarely extend levels lowest trophic level bottom food chain plants convert sunlight receive chemical energy follows total energy originally present incident sunlight finally embodied tertiary consumer
evolution trophic levelsedit
number trophic levels complexity relationships evolve life diversifies time exception intermittent mass extinction events
fractional trophic levelsedit
food webs largely define ecosystems trophic levels define position organisms within webs trophic levels always simple integers organisms often feed one trophic level example carnivores also eat plants plants carnivores large carnivore may eat smaller carnivores herbivores bobcat eats rabbits mountain lion eats bobcats rabbits animals also eat bullfrog eats crayfish crayfish eat young bullfrogs feeding habits juvenile animal consequence trophic level change grows
fisheries scientist daniel pauly sets values trophic levels one plants detritus two herbivores detritivores primary consumers three secondary consumers definition trophic level tl consumer species
fractional trophic level prey j represents fraction j diet
case marine ecosystems trophic level fish marine consumers takes value upper value unusual even large fish though occurs apex predators marine mammals polar bears killer whales
addition observational studies animal behavior quantification animal stomach contents trophic level quantified stable isotope analysis animal tissues muscle skin hair bone collagen consistent increase nitrogen isotopic composition trophic level caused fractionations occur synthesis biomolecules magnitude increase nitrogen isotopic composition approximately
mean trophic leveledit
fisheries mean trophic level fisheries catch across entire area ecosystem calculated year y
catch species group year y trophic level species defined
fish higher trophic levels usually higher economic value result overfishing higher trophic levels earlier reports found precipitous declines mean trophic level fisheries catch process known fishing food web however recent work finds relation economic value trophic level mean trophic levels catches surveys stock assessments fact declined suggesting fishing food web global phenomenon however pauly et al note trophic levels peaked northwest westcentral atlantic followed subsequent decline report shift away longlived piscivorous hightrophiclevel bottom fishes cod haddock shortlived planktivorous lowtrophiclevel invertebrates eg shrimps small pelagic fish eg herrings shift hightrophiclevel fishes lowtrophiclevel invertebrates fishes response changes relative abundance preferred catch argue part global fishery collapse
fib indexedit
since biomass transfer efficiencies follows rate biological production much greater lower trophic levels higher levels fisheries catches least begin tend increase trophic level declines point fisheries target species lower food web led pauly others construct fisheries balance index usually called fib index fib index defined year y
catch year y mean trophic level catch year y catch mean trophic level catch start series analyzed transfer efficiency biomass energy trophic levels
fib index stable zero periods time changes trophic levels matched appropriate changes catch opposite direction index increases catches increase reason eg higher fish biomass geographic expansion decreases explain backwardbending plots trophic level versus catch originally observed pauly others
tritrophic interactionsedit
one aspect trophic levels called tritrophic interaction ecologists often restrict research two trophic levels way simplifying analysis however misleading tritrophic interactions plantherbivorepredator easily understood simply adding pairwise interactions plantherbivore plus herbivorepredator example significant interactions occur first trophic level plant third trophic level predator determining herbivore population growth example simple genetic changes may yield morphological variants plants differ resistance herbivores effects plant architecture enemies herbivore
examplesedit
depending nature species precise trophic level species may somewhat ambiguous precise value may vary depending source virtually plants well phytoplankton similar organisms classified level worms would typically classified level typical insect jellyfish typical bird typical small mammal
study published national academy sciences estimates average trophic level human beings similar pigs anchovy course average plainly modern ancient human eating habits complex vary greatly example traditional eskimo living diet consisting primary seals would trophic level nearly
