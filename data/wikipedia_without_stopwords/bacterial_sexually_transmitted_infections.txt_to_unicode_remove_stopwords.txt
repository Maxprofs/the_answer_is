chancroid also known soft chancre ulcus molle bacterial sexually transmitted infection characterized painful sores genitalia chancroid known spread one individual another solely sexual contact
causesedit
chancroid bacterial infection caused fastidious gramnegative streptobacillus haemophilus ducreyi disease found primarily developing countries prevalent low socioeconomic groups associated commercial sex workers united states socioeconomic status found factor spread sexually transmitted diseases
chancroid caused h ducreyi infrequently associated cases genital ulcer disease us isolated genital ulcers diagnosed std clinics memphis chicago
infection levels low western world typically around one case per two million population canada france australia uk us individuals diagnosed chancroid visited countries areas disease known occur frequently although outbreaks observed association crack cocaine use prostitution
chancroid risk factor contracting hiv due ecological association shared risk exposure biologically facilitated transmission one infection
pathogenesisedit
h ducreyi enters skin microabrasions incurred sexual intercourse local tissue reaction leads development erythomatous papule progresses pustule days undergoes central necrosis ulcerate
signs symptomsedit
local systemic manifestations present ulcer characteristically
ranges size dramatically mm inch two inches across
painful
sharply defined undermined borders
irregular ragged borders
base covered gray yellowishgray material
base bleeds easily traumatized scraped
painful lymphadenopathy occurs patients
dysuria pain urination dyspareunia pain intercourse females
half infected men single ulcer women frequently four ulcers fewer symptoms
initial ulcer may mistaken hard chancre typical sore primary syphilis opposed soft chancre chancroid
approximately onethird infected individuals develop enlargements inguinal lymph nodes nodes located fold leg lower abdomen
half develop swelling inguinal lymph nodes progress point nodes rupture skin producing draining abscesses swollen lymph nodes abscesses often referred buboes

diagnosisedit
clinical variantsedit
clinical variants follows
laboratory findingsedit
bubo pus ulcer secretions h ducreyi identified pcrbased identification organisms available simple rapid sensitive inexpensive antigen detection methods h ducreyi identification also popular serologic detection h ducreyi uses outer membrane protein lipooligosaccharide
differential diagnosisedit
despite many distinguishing features clinical spectrums following diseases may overlap chancroid
primary syphilis
genital herpes
comparison syphilisedit
many differences similarities conditions syphilitic chancre chancroid
similarities
originate pustules site inoculation progress ulcerated lesions
lesions typically cm diameter
lesions caused sexually transmissible organisms
lesions typically appear genitals infected individuals
lesions present multiple sites multiple lesions
differences
chancre lesion typical infection bacterium causes syphilis treponema pallidum
chancroid lesion typical infection bacterium haemophilus ducreyi
chancres typically painless whereas chancroid typically painful
chancres typically nonexudative whereas chancroid typically grey yellow purulent exudate
chancres hard indurated edge whereas chancroid soft edge
chancres heal spontaneously within three six weeks even absence treatment
chancres occur pharynx well genitals
treatmentedit
cdc recommendation chancroid single oral dose gram azithromycin single im dose ceftriaxone oral erythromycin seven days
abscesses drained
h ducreyi resistant sulfonamides tetracyclines penicillins chloramphenicol ciprofloxacin ofloxacin trimethoprim aminoglycosides recently several erythromycin resistant isolates reported
treatment failure possible hiv coinfection extended therapy sometimes required
complicationsedit
extensive adenitis may develop
large inguinal abscesses may develop rupture form draining sinus giant ulcer
superinfection fusarium bacteroides later require debridement may result disfiguring scars
phimosis develop long standing lesion scarring thickening foreskin may subsequently require circumcision
preventionedit
chancroid spreads populations high sexual activity prostitutes use condom prophylaxis azithromycin syndromic management genital ulcers treating patients reactive syphilis serology strategies successfully tried thailand
prognosisedit
prognosis excellent proper treatment treating sexual contacts affected individual helps break cycle infection
