sunscreen (also commonly known as sun screen sunblock suntan lotion sunburn cream sun cream or block out) is a lotion spray gel or other topical product that absorbs or reflects some of the sun's ultraviolet (uv) radiation and thus helps protect against sunburn skin-lightening products have sunscreen to protect lightened skin because light skin is more susceptible to sun damage than darker skin a number of sunscreens have tanning powder to help the skin to darken or tan however tanning powder does not provide protection from uv rays
depending on the mode of action sunscreens can be classified into physical sunscreens (i.e. those that reflect the sunlight) or chemical sunscreens (i.e. those that absorb the uv light)
medical organizations such as the american cancer society recommend the use of sunscreen because it aids in the prevention of squamous cell carcinomas many sunscreens do not block uva radiation which does not primarily cause sunburn but can increase the rate of melanoma and photodermatitis the use of broad-spectrum (uva/uvb) sunscreens can address this concern diligent use of sunscreen can also slow or temporarily prevent the development of wrinkles and sagging skin

sunscreen use can help prevent melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma two types of skin cancer there is little evidence that it is effective in preventing basal cell carcinoma
a 2013 study concluded that the diligent everyday application of sunscreen can slow or temporarily prevent the development of wrinkles and sagging skin the study involved 900 white people in australia and required some of them to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen every day for four and a half years it found that people who did so had noticeably more resilient and smoother skin than those assigned to continue their usual practices
minimizing uv damage is especially important for children and fair-skinned individuals and those who have sun sensitivity for medical reasons
=== potential risksedit ===
while controversial oxybenzone does provide broad-spectrum uv coverage including uvb and short-wave uva rays ultraviolet rays can cause skin damages which can lead to cancer
in 2006 the therapeutic goods administration of australia carried out a review of sunscreen safety studies and concluded there is evidence from isolated cell experiments that zinc oxide and titanium dioxide can induce free radical formation in the presence of light and that this may damage these cells (photo-mutagenicity with zinc oxide) however this would only be of concern in people using sunscreens if the zinc oxide and titanium dioxide penetrated into viable skin cells the weight of current evidence is that they remain on the surface of the skin and in the outer dead layer (stratum corneum) of the skin.
concerns have also been raised about potential vitamin d deficiency arising from prolonged use of sunscreen typical use of sunscreen does not usually result in vitamin d deficiency however extensive usage may sunscreen prevents ultraviolet light from reaching the skin and even moderate protection can substantially reduce vitamin d synthesis however adequate amounts of vitamin d can be produced with moderate sun exposure to the face arms and legs averaging 530 minutes twice per week without sunscreen (the darker the complexion or the weaker the sunlight the more minutes of exposure are needed approximating 25% of the time for minimal sunburn vitamin d overdose is impossible from uv exposure the skin reaches an equilibrium where the vitamin degrades as fast as it is created.)
== historyedit ==
early civilizations used a variety of plant products to help protect the skin from sun damage for example ancient greeks used olive oil for this purpose and ancient egyptians used extracts of rice jasmine and lupine plants whose products are still used in skin care today zinc oxide paste has also been popular for skin protection for thousands of years
early synthetic sunscreens were first used in 1928 and the first major commercial product was brought to market in 1936 introduced by the founder of l'oreal french chemist eugne schueller during the same period hamilton sunscreen came to the australian market in 1932 developed by chemist h a milton blake
among widely used modern sunscreens one of the earliest was produced in 1944 for the us military by benjamin green an airman and later a pharmacist as the hazards of sun overexposure became apparent to soldiers in the pacific tropics at the height of world war ii the product named red vet pet (for red veterinary petrolatum) had limited effectiveness working as a physical blocker of ultraviolet radiation it was a disagreeable red sticky substance similar to petroleum jelly sales boomed when coppertone improved and commercialized the substance under the coppertone girl and bain de soleil branding in the early 1950s
in 1946 swiss chemist franz greiter introduced what may have been the first effective modern sunscreen the product called gletscher crme (glacier cream) subsequently became the basis for the company piz buin which is still today a marketer of sunscreen products named in honor of the mountain where greiter allegedly obtained the sunburn that inspired his concoction in 1974 greiter adapted earlier calculations from friedrich ellinger and rudolf schulze and introduced the sun protection factor (spf) which has become a worldwide standard for measuring the effectiveness of sunscreen it has been estimated that gletscher crme had an spf of 2
water-resistant sunscreens were introduced in 1977 and recent development efforts have focused on making sunscreen protection both longer-lasting and broader-spectrum as well as more appealing to use
== measurements of protectionedit ==
=== sun protection factor and labeling edit ===
the spf rating is a measure of the fraction of sunburn-producing uv rays that reach the skin for example spf 15 means that 1/15th of the burning radiation will reach the skin assuming sunscreen is applied evenly at a thick dosage of 2 milligrams per square centimeter (mg/cm2) a user can determine the effectiveness of a sunscreen by multiplying the spf factor by the length of time it takes for him or her to suffer a burn without sunscreen. thus if a person develops a sunburn in 10 minutes when not wearing a sunscreen the same person in the same intensity of sunlight will avoid sunburn for 150 minutes if wearing a sunscreen with an spf of 15 it is important to note that sunscreens with higher spf do not last or remain effective on the skin any longer than lower spf and must be continually reapplied as directed usually every two hours
the spf is an imperfect measure of skin damage because invisible damage and skin aging are also caused by ultraviolet type a (uva wavelengths 315400 or 320400 nm) which does not primarily cause reddening or pain conventional sunscreen blocks very little uva radiation relative to the nominal spf broad-spectrum sunscreens are designed to protect against both uvb and uva according to a 2004 study uva also causes dna damage to cells deep within the skin increasing the risk of malignant melanomas even some products labeled broad-spectrum uva/uvb protection have not always provided good protection against uva rays titanium dioxide probably gives good protection but does not completely cover the uva spectrum as early 2000s research suggests that zinc oxide is superior to titanium dioxide at wavelengths 340380 nm
owing to consumer confusion over the real degree and duration of protection offered labeling restrictions are in force in several countries in the eu sunscreen labels can only go up to spf 50+ (initially listed as 30 but soon revised to 50) australia's therapeutic goods administration increased the upper limit to 50+ in 2012 in its 2007 and 2011 draft rules the us food and drug administration (fda) proposed a maximum spf label of 50 to limit unrealistic claims others have proposed restricting the active ingredients to an spf of no more than 50 due to lack of evidence that higher dosages provide more meaningful protection
the spf can be measured by applying sunscreen to the skin of a volunteer and measuring how long it takes before sunburn occurs when exposed to an artificial sunlight source in the us such an in vivo test is required by the fda it can also be measured in vitro with the help of a specially designed spectrometer in this case the actual transmittance of the sunscreen is measured along with the degradation of the product due to being exposed to sunlight in this case the transmittance of the sunscreen must be measured over all wavelengths in sunlight's uvbuva range (290400 nm) along with a table of how effective various wavelengths are in causing sunburn (the erythemal action spectrum) and the standard intensity spectrum of sunlight (see the figure) such in vitro measurements agree very well with in vivo measurements
numerous methods have been devised for evaluation of uva and uvb protection the most-reliable spectrophotochemical methods eliminate the subjective nature of grading erythema
the ultraviolet protection factor (upf) is a similar scale developed for rating fabrics for sun protective clothing according to recent testing by consumer reports upf ~30 is typical for protective fabrics while upf ~6 is typical for standard summer fabrics
mathematically the spf (or the upf) is calculated from measured data as
where is the solar irradiance spectrum the erythemal action spectrum and the monochromatic protection factor all functions of the wavelength  the mpf is roughly the inverse of the transmittance at a given wavelength
the above means that the spf is not simply the inverse of the transmittance in the uvb region if that were true then applying two layers of spf 5 sunscreen would be equivalent to spf 25 (5 times 5) the actual combined spf is always lower than the square of the single-layer spf
=== uva protectionedit ===
==== persistent pigment darkeningedit ====
the persistent pigment darkening (ppd) method is a method of measuring uva protection similar to the spf method of measuring sunburn protection originally developed in japan it is the preferred method used by manufacturers such as l'oral
instead of measuring erythema or reddening of the skin the ppd method uses uva radiation to cause a persistent darkening or tanning of the skin theoretically a sunscreen with a ppd rating of 10 should allow a person 10 times as much uva exposure as would be without protection the ppd method is an in vivo test like spf in addition colipa has introduced a method that it is claimed can measure this in vitro and provide parity with the ppd method
==== spf equivalenceedit ====
as part of revised guidelines for sunscreens in the eu there is a requirement to provide the consumer with a minimum level of uva protection in relation to the spf this should be a uva pf of at least 1/3 of the spf to carry the uva seal
a set of final us fda rules effective from summer 2012 defines the phrase broad spectrum as providing uva protection proportional to the uvb protection using a standardized testing method
==== star rating systemedit ====
in the uk and ireland the boots star rating system is a proprietary in vitro method used to describe the ratio of uva to uvb protection offered by sunscreen creams and sprays based on original work by prof brian diffey at newcastle university the boots company in nottingham uk developed a standard method that has been adopted by most companies marketing these products in the uk the logo and methodology of the test are licensed for a token fee to any manufacturer or brand of sunscreens that are sold in the boots retail chain provided the products to which the logo is applied perform to the standard claimed own label products exclusively sold in other retailers are now excluded from the terms of the license
one-star products provide the lowest ratio of uva protection five-star products the highest the method was recently revised in light of the colipa uva pf test and the revised eu recommendations regarding uva pf the method still uses a spectrophotometer to measure absorption of uva versus uvb the difference stems from a requirement to pre-irradiate samples (where this was not previously required) to give a better indication of uva protection and photostability when the product is used with the current methodology the lowest rating is three stars the highest being five stars
in august 2007 the fda put out for consultation the proposal that a version of this protocol be used to inform users of american product of the protection that it gives against uva but this was not adopted for fear it would be too confusing
==== pa systemedit ====
asian brands particularly japanese ones tend to use the protection grade of uva (pa) system to measure the uva protection that a sunscreen provides the pa system is based on the ppd reaction and is now widely adopted on the labels of sunscreens according to the japan cosmetic industry association pa+ corresponds to a uva protection factor between two and four pa++ between four and eight and pa+++ more than eight
== sunblockedit ==
sunblock typically refers to opaque sunscreen that is effective at blocking both uva and uvb rays and uses a heavy carrier oil to resist being washed off titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are two of the important ingredients in sunblock unlike the organic sun-blocking agents used in many sunscreens these metal oxides do not degrade with exposure to sunlight
the use of the word sunblock in the marketing of sunscreens is controversial since 2013 the fda has banned such use because it can lead consumers to overestimate the effectiveness of products so labeled nonetheless many consumers use the words sunblock and sunscreen synonymously
for total protection against damage from the sun the skin needs to be protected from uva uvb and ira (infrared light) roughly 35% of solar energy is ira
== active ingredientsedit ==
sunscreens contain one or more of the following ingredients
organic chemical compounds that absorb ultraviolet light
inorganic particulates that reflect scatter and absorb uv light (such as titanium dioxide zinc oxide or a combination of both)
organic particulates that mostly absorb light like organic chemical compounds but contain multiple chromophores that may reflect and scatter a fraction of light like inorganic particulates and behave differently in formulations than organic chemical compounds an example is tinosorb m since the uv-attenuating efficacy depends strongly on particle size the material is micronised to particle sizes below 200 nm the mode of action of this photostable filter system is governed to about 90% by absorption and 10% by scattering of uv light
the principal ingredients in sunscreens are usually aromatic molecules conjugated with carbonyl groups this general structure allows the molecule to absorb high-energy ultraviolet rays and release the energy as lower-energy rays thereby preventing the skin-damaging ultraviolet rays from reaching the skin so upon exposure to uv light most of the ingredients (with the notable exception of avobenzone) do not undergo significant chemical change allowing these ingredients to retain the uv-absorbing potency without significant photodegradation a chemical stabilizer is included in some sunscreens containing avobenzone to slow its breakdown examples include formulations containing helioplex and avotriplex the stability of avobenzone can also be improved by bemotrizinol octocrylene and various other photostabilisers most organic compounds in sunscreens slowly degrade and become less effective over the course of several years if stored properly resulting in the expiration dates calculated for the product
sunscreening agents are used in some hair care products such as shampoos conditioners and styling agents to protect against protein degradation and color loss currently benzophenone-4 and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate are the two sunscreens most commonly used in hair products the common sunscreens used on skin are rarely used for hair products due to their texture and weight effects
the following are the fda allowable active ingredients in sunscreens
zinc oxide is not approved as a uv filter under article 14 of the eu's 2009 regulation on cosmetic products however it is approved and widely used as a colorant and the scientific committee on consumer safety has issued favorable opinions for future approval as a uv filter
other ingredients approved within the eu and other parts of the world that have not been included in the current fda monograph
* time and extent application (tea) proposed rule on fda approval originally expected 2009 now expected 2015
many of the ingredients awaiting approval by the fda were relatively new and developed to absorb uva the 2014 sunscreen innovation act was passed to accelerate the fda approval process
== applicationedit ==
a sunscreen study from 2001 suggests that the best protection is achieved by dividing the spf number in half and reapplying that many minutes after sun exposure begins for example if the spf is 30 sunscreen should be reapplied once after 15 minutes of exposure further reapplication is only necessary after activities such as swimming sweating or rubbing/wiping
more-recent research at the university of california riverside indicates that sunscreen must be reapplied within 2 hours in order to remain effective not reapplying could even cause more cell damage than not using sunscreen at all due to the release of extra free radicals from those sunscreen chemicals that were absorbed into the skin
== dosageedit ==
the dose used in fda sunscreen testing is 2 mg/cm2 of exposed skin if one assumes an average adult build of height 5 ft 4 in (163 cm) and weight 150 lb (68 kg) with a 32-inch (82-cm) waist that adult wearing a bathing suit covering the groin area should apply approximately 30 g (or 30 ml approximately 1 oz) evenly to the uncovered body area this can be more easily thought of as a golf ball size amount of product per body or at least six teaspoonfuls larger or smaller individuals should scale these quantities accordingly considering only the face this translates to about 1/4 to 1/3 of a teaspoon for the average adult face
some studies have shown that people commonly apply only 1/2 to 1/4 of the amount recommended for achieving the rated sun protection factor (spf) and in consequence the effective spf should be downgraded to a square root or 4th root of the advertised value a later study found a significant exponential relation between spf and the amount of sunscreen applied and the results are closer to linearity than expected by theory
== other fda labeling regulationsedit ==
sunscreen labeling standards have been evolving in the united states since the fda first adopted the spf calculation in 1978 the fda issued a comprehensive set of rules in june 2011 taking effect in 20122013 designed to help consumers identify and select suitable sunscreen products offering protection from sunburn early skin aging and skin cancer
== environmental effectsedit ==
certain sunscreens in water under ultraviolet light can increase the production of hydrogen peroxide which damages phytoplankton nanoparticles of titanium dioxide a common ingredient of sunscreens can accumulate in coastal waters and be ingested by marine animals
