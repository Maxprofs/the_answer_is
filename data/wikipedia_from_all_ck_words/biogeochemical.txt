biogeochemistry is the scientific discipline that involves the study of the chemical physical geological and biological processes and reactions that govern the composition of the natural environment (including the biosphere the cryosphere the hydrosphere the pedosphere the atmosphere and the lithosphere) in particular biogeochemistry is the study of the cycles of chemical elements such as carbon and nitrogen and their interactions with and incorporation into living things transported through earth scale biological systems in space through time the field focuses on chemical cycles which are either driven by or have an impact on biological activity particular emphasis is placed on the study of carbon nitrogen sulfur and phosphorus cycles biogeochemistry is a systems science closely related to systems ecology
== history ==
the founder of biogeochemistry was ukrainian scientist vladimir ivanovich vernadsky|vladimir vernadsky whose 1926 book the biosphere in the tradition of mendeleev formulated a physics of the earth as a living whole vernadsky distinguished three spheres where a sphere was a concept similar to the concept of a phase-space he observed that each sphere had its own laws of evolution and that the higher spheres modified and dominated the lower
abiotic sphere - all the non-living energy and material processes
biosphere - the life processes that live within the abiotic sphere
nesis or nsphere - the sphere of the cognitive process of man
human activities (e.g. agriculture and industry) modify the biosphere and abiotic sphere in the contemporary environment the amount of influence humans have on the other two spheres is comparable to a geological force (see anthropocene)
== early development ==
the american limnologist and geochemist g evelyn hutchinson is credited with outlining the broad scope and principles of this new field more recently the basic elements of the discipline of biogeochemistry were restated and popularized by the british scientist and writer james lovelock under the label of the gaia hypothesis lovelock emphasizes a concept that life processes regulate the earth through feedback mechanisms to keep it habitable
== research ==
there are biogeochemistry research groups in many universities around the world since this is a highly inter-disciplinary field these are situated within a wide range of host disciplines including atmospheric sciences biology ecology geomicrobiology environmental chemistry geology oceanography and soil science these are often bracketed into larger disciplines such as earth science and environmental science
many researchers investigate the biogeochemical cycles of chemical elements such as carbon oxygen nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur as well as their stable isotopes the cycles of trace elements such as the trace metals and the radionuclides are also studied this research has obvious applications in the exploration for ore deposits and oil and in remediation of environmental pollution
some important research fields for biogeochemistry include
modelling of natural systems
soil and water acidification recovery processes
eutrophication of surface waters
carbon sequestration
soil remediation
global change
climate change
biogeochemical prospecting for ore deposits
