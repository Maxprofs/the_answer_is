david mccomb later said i don't think it's a great record but at least we tried to do a few things that pub bands wouldn't normally do for a lot of the underground scene all across australia we just weren't hard rock enough we used to have a thing against pedals.
== reception ==
an allmusic review claimed treeless plain underscores the triffids knack for blending folk and country with indie rock in a way that anticipated the rise of alt-country in the 90s. david mccomb's commanding and resonant vocals were particularly praised and the songs offered incontrovertible evidence of mccomb's skill as a songwriter with a unique lyrical and musical vision.
clinton walker described the album as a remarkably mature muscular yet sensitive statement and it was probably as broadly successful as any australian indy has ever been but that still didn't mean big figures. elsewhere it was said that the album would endear itself to listeners assuming of course that you can envisage a band that links folksy sounds replete with fiddles with those you might expect of some early velvet underground.
