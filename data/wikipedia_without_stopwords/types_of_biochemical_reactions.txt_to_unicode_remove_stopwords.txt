vascular plants latin vasculum duct also known tracheophytes equivalent greek term trachea also higher plants form large group plants defined land plants lignified tissues xylem conducting water minerals throughout plant also specialized nonlignified tissue phloem conduct products photosynthesis vascular plants include clubmosses horsetails ferns gymnosperms including conifers angiosperms flowering plants scientific names group include tracheophyta tracheobionta
characteristics
vascular plants distinguished two primary characteristics
vascular plants vascular tissues distribute resources plant feature allows vascular plants evolve larger size nonvascular plants lack specialized conducting tissues therefore restricted relatively small sizes
vascular plants principal generation phase sporophyte usually diploid two sets chromosomes per cell germ cells gametophytes haploid contrast principal generation phase nonvascular plants gametophyte haploid one set chromosomes per cell plants spore stalk capsule diploid
one possible mechanism presumed switch emphasis haploid generation emphasis diploid generation greater efficiency spore dispersal complex diploid structures words elaboration spore stalk enabled production spores ability release higher broadcast farther developments may include photosynthetic area sporebearing structure ability grow independent roots woody structure support branching
phylogeny
proposed phylogeny vascular plants kenrick crane follows modification gymnosperms christenhusz et al pteridophyta smith et al lycophytes ferns christenhusz et al b
phylogeny supported several molecular studies researchers state taking fossils account leads different conclusions example ferns pteridophyta monophyletic
nutrient distribution
water nutrients form inorganic solutes drawn soil roots transported throughout plant xylem organic compounds sucrose produced photosynthesis leaves distributed phloem sieve tube elements
xylem consists vessels flowering plants tracheids vascular plants dead hardwalled hollow cells arranged form files tubes function water transport tracheid cell wall usually contains polymer lignin phloem however consists living cells called sievetube members sievetube members sieve plates pores allow molecules pass sievetube members lack organs nuclei ribosomes cells next companion cells function keep sievetube members alive
transpiration
abundant compound plants cellular organisms water serves important structural role vital role plant metabolism transpiration main process water movement within plant tissues water constantly transpired plant stomata atmosphere replaced soil water taken roots movement water leaf stomata creates transpiration pull tension water column xylem vessels tracheids pull result water surface tension within cell walls mesophyll cells surfaces evaporation takes place stomata open hydrogen bonds exist water molecules causing line molecules top plant evaporate pulls next one replace turn pulls next one line draw water upwards may entirely passive assisted movement water roots via osmosis consequently transpiration requires little energy used plant transpiration assists plant absorbing nutrients soil soluble salts
absorption
living root cells passively absorb water absence transpiration pull via osmosis creating root pressure possible evapotranspiration therefore pull water towards shoots leaves usually due high temperatures high humidity darkness drought
conduction
xylem phloem tissues involved conduction processes within plants sugars conducted throughout plant phloem water nutrients xylem conduction occurs source sink separate nutrient sugars produced leaves source photosynthesis transported growing shoots roots sinks use growth cellular respiration storage minerals absorbed roots source transported shoots allow cell division growth
