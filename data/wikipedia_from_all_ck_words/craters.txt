== historyedit ==
the abbreviation lunch in use from 1823 is taken from the more formal northern english word luncheon which the oxford english dictionary (oed) reports from 1580 as describing a meal that was inserted between more substantial meals it may also mean a piece of cheese or bread
in medieval germany there are references to similariar a sir lunchentach according to the oed a noon draught of ale with bread an extra meal between midday dinner and supper especially during the long hours of hard labour during haying or early harvesting in general during the middle ages the main meal for almost everyone took place at midday where there was no need for artificial lighting during the 17th and 18th century dinner was gradually pushed back into the evening leaving a wider gap between it and breakfast that came to be filled in with lunch a formal evening meal artificially lit by candles sometimes with entertainment was a supper party as late as the regency era
up until the early 19th century luncheon was generally reserved for the ladies who would often have lunch with one another when their husbands were out as late as 1945 emily post wrote in the magazine etiquette that luncheon is generally given by and for women but it is not unusual especially in summer places or in town on saturday or sunday to include an equal number of men hence the mildly disparaging phrase the ladies who lunch lunch was a ladies light meal when the prince of wales stopped to eat a dainty luncheon with lady friends he was laughed at for this effeminacy
afternoon tea supplemented this luncheon at four o'clock from the 1840s mrs beeton's book of household management (1861) a guide to all aspects of running a household in victorian britain edited by isabella beeton had much less to explain about luncheon than about dinners or ball suppers
the remains of cold joints nicely garnished a few sweets or a little hashed meat poultry or game are the usual articles placed on the table for luncheon with bread and cheese biscuits butter etc if a substantial meal is desired rump-steaks or mutton chops may be served as also veal cutlets kidneys in families where there is a nursery the mistress of the house often partakes of the meal with the children and makes it her luncheon in the summer a few dishes of fresh fruit should be added to the luncheon or instead of this a compote of fruit or fruit tart or pudding

with the onset of industrialization in the 19th century male workers began to work long shifts at the factory severely disrupting the age-old eating habits of rural life initially workers were sent home for a brief dinner provided by their wives but as the workplace was removed farther from the home working men took to providing themselves with something portable to eat at a break in the schedule during the middle of the day
the lunch meal slowly became institutionalised in england when workers with long and fixed hour jobs at the factory were eventually officially given an hour off of work as a lunch-break to give them strength for the afternoon shift stalls and later chop houses near the factories began to provide mass-produced food for the working class and the meal soon became an established part of the daily routine remaining so to this day
in many countries and regions lunch remains the dinner or main meal (see following section.) prescribed lunchtimes allow workers to return to their homes to eat with their families consequently where lunch is the customary main meal of the day businesses will close during lunchtime lunch also becomes dinner for special days such as holidays or special events such as christmas dinner and harvest dinners such as thanksgiving which are usually served in early afternoon among christians the main meal on sunday is sunday dinner, at a restaurant or home after morning church services whenever dinner is the midday meal the evening meal or supper assumes the function of the light-meal lunch
