the raspberry (/rzbri/) is the edible fruit of a multitude of plant species in the genus rubus of the rose family most of which are in the subgenus idaeobatus the name also applies to these plants themselves
raspberries are perennial with woody stems
== major kinds of cultivated raspberries ==
raspberries are an important commercial fruit crop widely grown in all temperate regions of the world
many of the most important modern commercial red raspberry cultivars derive from hybrids between r idaeus and r strigosus some botanists consider the eurasian and american red raspberries to belong to a single circumboreal species rubus idaeus with the european plants then classified as either r idaeus subsp idaeus or r idaeus var idaeus and the native north american red raspberries classified as either r idaeus subsp strigosus or r idaeus var strigosus recent breeding has resulted in cultivars that are thornless and more strongly upright not needing staking
the black raspberry rubus occidentalis is also cultivated providing both fresh and frozen fruit as well as jams preserves and other products all with that species distinctive flavor
purple raspberries have been produced by horticultural hybridization of red and black raspberries and have also been found in the wild in a few places (for example in vermont) where the american red and the black raspberries both grow naturally commercial production of purple-fruited raspberries is rare
blue raspberry is a local name used in prince edward country ontario canada for the cultivar columbian a hybrid (purple raspberry) of r strigosus and r occidentalis
both the red and the black raspberry species have albino-like pale-yellow natural or horticultural variants resulting from presence of recessive genes that impede production of anthocyanin pigments fruits from such plants are called golden raspberries or yellow raspberries despite their similar appearance they retain the distinctive flavor of their respective species (red or black) most pale-fruited raspberries commercially sold in the eastern united states are derivatives of red raspberries yellow-fruited variants of the black raspberry are sometimes grown in home gardens
red raspberries have also been crossed with various species in other subgenera of the genus rubus resulting in a number of hybrids the first of which was the loganberry later notable hybrids include boysenberry (a multi-generation hybrid) and tayberry hybridization between the familiar cultivated red raspberries and a few asiatic species of rubus has also been achieved
== species ==
examples of raspberry species in rubus subgenus idaeobatus include
rubus crataegifolius (asian raspberry)
rubus gunnianus (tasmanian alpine raspberry)
rubus idaeus (european red raspberry)
rubus leucodermis (whitebark or western raspberry blue raspberry black raspberry)
rubus occidentalis (black raspberry)
rubus parvifolius (australian native raspberry)
rubus phoenicolasius (wine raspberry or wineberry)
rubus rosifolius (west indian raspberry)
rubus strigosus (american red raspberry) (syn r idaeus var strigosus)
rubus ellipticus (yellow himalayan raspberry)
several species of rubus also called raspberries are classified in other subgenera including
rubus arcticus (arctic raspberry subgenus cyclactis)
rubus deliciosus (boulder raspberry subgenus anoplobatus)
rubus nivalis (snow raspberry subgenus chamaebatus)
rubus odoratus (flowering raspberry subgenus anoplobatus)
rubus sieboldii (molucca raspberry subgenus malachobatus)
== uses ==
=== fruit ===
raspberries are grown for the fresh fruit market and for commercial processing into individually quick frozen (iqf) fruit pure juice or as dried fruit used in a variety of grocery products traditionally raspberries were a midsummer crop but with new technology cultivars and transportation they can now be obtained year-round raspberries need ample sun and water for optimal development raspberries thrive in well-drained soil with a ph between 6 and 7 with ample organic matter to assist in retaining water while moisture is essential wet and heavy soils or excess irrigation can bring on phytophthora root rot which is one of the most serious pest problems facing the red raspberry as a cultivated plant in moist temperate regions it is easy to grow and has a tendency to spread unless pruned escaped raspberries frequently appear as garden weeds spread by seeds found in bird droppings
an individual raspberry weighs 35 g (0.110.18 oz) and is made up of around 100 drupelets each of which consists of a juicy pulp and a single central seed a raspberry bush can yield several hundred berries a year unlike blackberries and dewberries a raspberry has a hollow core once it is removed from the receptacle
==== nutrients and phytochemicals ====
the aggregate fruit structure contributes to raspberry's nutritional value as it increases the proportion of dietary fiber which is among the highest known in whole foods up to 6% fiber per total weight raspberries are a rich source of vitamin c with 26 mg per 100 g serving (32% daily value) manganese (32% daily value) and dietary fiber (26% daily value) raspberries are a low-glycemic index food with total sugar content of only 4% and no starch
raspberries contain anthocyanin pigments ellagic acid (from ellagotannins see for instance the polyphenol ellagitannin) quercetin gallic acid cyanidins pelargonidins catechins kaempferol and salicylic acid yellow raspberries and others with pale-colored fruits are lower in anthocyanins both yellow and red raspberries contain carotenoids mostly lutein esters but these are masked by anthocyanins in red raspberries
==== commercial production ====
=== leaves ===
raspberry leaves can be used fresh or dried in herbal teas they have an astringent flavor and in herbal medicine are reputed to be effective in regulating menses
== cultivation ==
various kinds of raspberries can be cultivated from hardiness zones 3 to 9 raspberries are traditionally planted in the winter as dormant canes although planting of tender plug plants produced by tissue culture has become much more common a specialized production system called long cane production involves growing canes for a year in a northern climate such as scotland or oregon or washington where the chilling requirement for proper bud break is attained or attained earlier than the ultimate place of planting these canes are then dug roots and all to be replanted in warmer climates such as spain where they quickly flower and produce a very early season crop plants are typically planted 2-6 per m in fertile well drained soil raspberries are usually planted in raised beds/ridges if there is any question about root rot problems
the flowers can be a major nectar source for honeybees and other pollinators
raspberries are very vigorous and can be locally invasive they propagate using basal shoots (also known as suckers) extended underground shoots that develop roots and individual plants they can sucker new canes some distance from the main plant for this reason raspberries spread well and can take over gardens if left unchecked
raspberries are often propagated using cuttings and will root readily in moist soil conditions using cuttings preserves the genotype of the parent and is the preferred method of propagation when making large plantings
the fruit is harvested when it comes off the receptacle easily and has turned a deep color (red black purple or golden yellow depending on the species and cultivar) this is when the fruits are ripest and sweetest excess fruit can be made into raspberry jam or frozen
high tunnel bramble production offers the opportunity to bridge gaps in availability during late fall and late spring furthermore high tunnels allow less hardy floricane-fruiting raspberries to overwinter in climates where they wouldn't otherwise survive in the tunnel plants are established at close spacing usually prior to tunnel construction
=== selected important cultivars ===
numerous raspberry cultivars have been selected
two types of raspberry are available for commercial and domestic cultivation the summer-bearing type produces an abundance of fruit on second-year canes (floricanes) within a relatively short period in midsummer and double or everbearing plants which also bear some fruit on first-year canes (primocanes) in the late summer and fall as well as the summer crop on second-year canes those marked (agm) have gained the royal horticultural society's award of garden merit
red early summer fruiting
red midsummer
red late summer
red primocane fall autumn fruiting
gold/yellow primocane fall autumn fruiting
purple
black
=== diseases and pests ===
raspberries are sometimes eaten by the larvae of some lepidoptera species (butterflies and moths) botrytis cinerea or gray mold is a common fungal infection of raspberries and other soft fruit under wet conditions it is seen as a gray mold growing on the raspberries and particularly affects fruit which are bruised as it provides an easy entrance point for the spores
raspberry plants should not be planted where potatoes tomatoes peppers eggplants or bulbs have previously been grown without prior fumigation of the soil these crops are hosts for the disease verticillium wilt a fungus that can stay in the soil for many years and can infest the raspberry crop
