the minute is a unit of time or of angle as a unit of time the minute is equal to 160 (the first sexagesimal fraction) of an hour or 60 seconds in the utc time standard a minute on rare occasions has 61 seconds a consequence of leap seconds (there is a provision to insert a negative leap second which would result in a 59-second minute but this has never happened in more than four decades under this system) as a unit of angle the minute of arc is equal to 160 of a degree or 60 seconds (of arc) although not an si unit for either time or angle the minute is accepted for use with si units for both the si symbols for minute or minutes are min for time measurement and the prime symbol after a number e.g 5 for angle measurement the prime is also sometimes used informally to denote minutes of time
by contrast to the hour the minute (and the second) has not a clear historical background what is traceable only is that it started being recorded in the middle ages due to the ability of construction of precision timepieces (mechanical and water clocks) however no consistent records of the origin for the division as 160 part of the hour (and the second 160 of the minute) have ever been found despite many speculations
historically the word minute comes from the latin pars minuta prima meaning first small part this division of the hour can be further refined with a second small part (latin parte minutae secundae) and this is where the word second comes from for even further refinement the term third (160 of a second) remains in some languages for example polish (tercja) and turkish (salise) although most modern usage subdivides seconds by using decimals the symbol notation of the prime for minutes and double prime for seconds can be seen as indicating the first and second cut of the hour (similar to how the foot is the first cut of the yard or perhaps chain with inches as the second cut) in 1267 the medieval scientist roger bacon writing in latin defined the division of time between full moons as a number of hours minutes seconds thirds and fourths (horae minuta secunda tertia and quarta) after noon on specified calendar dates
