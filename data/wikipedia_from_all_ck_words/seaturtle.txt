== history ==
=== founding ===
archaeological excavations suggest that native americans have inhabited the seattle area for at least 4,000 years by the time the first european settlers arrived the people (subsequently called the duwamish tribe) occupied at least seventeen villages in the areas around elliott bay
the first european to visit the seattle area was george vancouver in may 1792 during his 179195 expedition to chart the pacific northwest
in 1851 a large party led by luther collins made a location on land at the mouth of the duwamish river they formally claimed it on september 14 1851 thirteen days later members of the collins party on the way to their claim passed three scouts of the denny party members of the denny party claimed land on alki point on september 28 1851 the rest of the denny party set sail from portland oregon and landed on alki point during a rainstorm on november 13 1851
=== duwamps 18521853 ===
after a difficult winter most of the denny party relocated across elliott bay and claimed land a second time at the site of present-day pioneer square charles terry and john low remained at the original landing location and reestablished their old land claim and called it new york but renamed new york alki in april 1853 from a chinook word meaning roughly by and by or someday for the next few years new york alki and duwamps competed for dominance but in time alki was abandoned and its residents moved across the bay to join the rest of the settlers
david swinson doc maynard one of the founders of duwamps was the primary advocate to name the settlement after chief sealth ("seattle") of the duwamish and suquamish tribes
=== incorporations ===

=== timber town ===
seattle has a history of boom-and-bust cycles like many other cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources seattle has risen several times economically then gone into precipitous decline but it has typically used those periods to rebuild solid infrastructure
the first such boom covering the early years of the city rode on the lumber industry (during this period the road now known as yesler way won the nickname skid road supposedly after the timber skidding down the hill to henry yesler's sawmill the later dereliction of the area may be a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider american lexicon as skid row.) like much of the american west seattle saw numerous conflicts between labor and management as well as ethnic tensions that culminated in the anti-chinese riots of 18851886 this violence originated with unemployed whites who were determined to drive the chinese from seattle (anti-chinese riots also occurred in tacoma) in 1900 asians were 4.2% of the population authorities declared martial law and federal troops arrived to put down the disorder
seattle achieved sufficient economic success that when the great seattle fire of 1889 destroyed the central business district a far grander city-center rapidly emerged in its place finance company washington mutual for example was founded in the immediate wake of the fire however the panic of 1893 hit seattle hard
=== gold rush world war i and the great depression ===
the second and most dramatic boom and bust resulted from the klondike gold rush which ended the depression that had begun with the panic of 1893 in a short time seattle became a major transportation center on july 14 1897 the s.s portland docked with its famed ton of gold and seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in alaska and the yukon few of those working men found lasting wealth however it was seattle's business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long run along with seattle other cities like everett tacoma port townsend bremerton and olympia all in the puget sound region became competitors for exchange rather than mother lodes for extraction of precious metals the boom lasted well into the early part of the 20th century and funded many new seattle companies and products in 1907 19-year-old james e casey borrowed $100 from a friend and founded the american messenger company (later ups) other seattle companies founded during this period include nordstrom and eddie bauer seattle brought in the olmsted brothers landscape architecture firm to design a system of parks and boulevards
the gold rush era culminated in the alaska-yukon-pacific exposition of 1909 which is largely responsible for the layout of today's university of washington campus
a shipbuilding boom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during world war i making seattle somewhat of a company town the subsequent retrenchment led to the seattle general strike of 1919 the first general strike in the country a 1912 city development plan by virgil bogue went largely unused seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the great depression experiencing some of the country's harshest labor strife in that era violence during the maritime strike of 1934 cost seattle much of its maritime traffic which was rerouted to the port of los angeles
seattle was also the home base of impresario alexander pantages who starting in 1902 opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movies his activities soon expanded and the thrifty greek went on and became one of america's greatest theater and movie tycoons between pantages and his rival john considine seattle was for a while the western united states vaudeville mecca b marcus priteca the scottish-born and seattle-based architect built several theaters for pantages including some in seattle the theaters he built for pantages in seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses but many other theaters survive in other cities of the u.s. often retaining the pantages name seattle's surviving paramount theatre on which he collaborated was not a pantages theater
=== post-war years aircraft and software ===
war work again brought local prosperity during world war ii this time centered on boeing aircraft the war dispersed the city's numerous japanese-american businessmen due to the japanese american internment after the war the local economy dipped it rose again with boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the century 21 exposition the 1962 world's fair another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s at a time when boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises loss of government contracts and costs and delays associated with the boeing 747 many people left the area to look for work elsewhere and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading will the last person leaving seattle turn out the lights.
seattle remained the corporate headquarters of boeing until 2001 when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities the headquarters were moved to chicago the seattle area is still home to boeing's renton narrow-body plant (where the 707 720 727 and 757 were assembled and the 737 is assembled today) and everett wide-body plant (assembly plant for the 747 767 777 and 787) the company's credit union for employees becu remains based in the seattle area though it is now open to all residents of washington
as prosperity began to return in the 1980s the city was stunned by the wah mee massacre in 1983 when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the international district seattle's chinatown beginning with microsoft's 1979 move from albuquerque new mexico to nearby bellevue washington seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including amazon.com realnetworks nintendo of america mccaw cellular (now part of at&t mobility) voicestream (now t-mobile) and biomedical corporations such as heartstream (later purchased by philips) heart technologies (later purchased by boston scientific) physio-control (later purchased by medtronic) zymogenetics icos (later purchased by eli lilly and company) and immunex (later purchased by amgen) this success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000 and saw seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country in 1993 the movie sleepless in seattle brought the city further national attention many of the seattle area's tech companies remained relatively strong but the frenzied dot-com boom years ended in early 2001
seattle in this period attracted widespread attention as home to these many companies but also by hosting the 1990 goodwill games and the apec leaders conference in 1993 as well as through the worldwide popularity of grunge a sound that had developed in seattle's independent music scene another bid for worldwide attentionhosting the world trade organization ministerial conference of 1999garnered visibility but not in the way its sponsors desired as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself the city was further shaken by the mardi gras riots in 2001 and then literally shaken the following day by the nisqually earthquake
yet another boom began as the city emerged from the great recession amazon.com moved its headquarters from north beacon hill to south lake union and began a rapid expansion for the five years beginning in 2010 seattle gained an average of 14,511 residents per year with the growth strongly skewed toward the center of the city as unemployment dropped from roughly 9 percent to 3.6 percent the city has found itself bursting at the seams, with over 45,000 households spending more than half their income on housing and at least 2,800 people homeless and with the country's sixth-worst rush hour traffic

seattle is located between the saltwater puget sound (an arm of the pacific ocean) to the west and lake washington to the east the city's chief harbor elliott bay is part of puget sound which makes the city an oceanic port to the west beyond puget sound are the kitsap peninsula and olympic mountains on the olympic peninsula to the east beyond lake washington and the eastside suburbs are lake sammamish and the cascade range lake washington's waters flow to puget sound through the lake washington ship canal (consisting of two man-made canals lake union and the hiram m chittenden locks at salmon bay ending in shilshole bay on puget sound)
the sea rivers forests lakes and fields surrounding seattle were once rich enough to support one of the world's few sedentary hunter-gatherer societies the surrounding area lends itself well to sailing skiing bicycling camping and hiking year-round
the city itself is hilly though not uniformly so like rome the city is said to lie on seven hills the lists vary but typically include capitol hill first hill west seattle beacon hill queen anne magnolia and the former denny hill the wallingford mount baker and crown hill neighborhoods are technically located on hills as well many of the hilliest areas are near the city center with capitol hill first hill and beacon hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between elliott bay and lake washington the break in the ridge between first hill and beacon hill is man-made the result of two of the many regrading projects that reshaped the topography of the city center the topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial harbor island (completed 1909) at the mouth of the city's industrial duwamish waterway the terminus of the green river the highest point within city limits is at high point in west seattle which is roughly located near 35th ave sw and sw myrtle st other notable hills include crown hill view ridge/wedgwood/bryant maple leaf phinney ridge mt baker ridge and highlands/carkeek/bitterlake

=== climate ===
seattle's climate is classified as oceanic or temperate marine with cool wet winters and warm relatively dry summers like much of the pacific northwest according to the kppen climate classification it has a warm-summer mediterranean climate (csb) other climate classification systems such as trewartha place it firmly in the oceanic zone (do) like much of western europe the city and environs are part of usda hardiness zone 8b with isolated coastal pockets falling under 9a
hot temperature extremes are enhanced by dry compressed wind from the west slopes of the cascades while cold temperatures are generated mainly from the fraser valley in british columbia
temperature extremes are moderated by the adjacent puget sound greater pacific ocean and lake washington the region is largely shielded from pacific storms by the olympic mountains and from arctic air by the cascade range despite being on the margin of the rain shadow of the olympic mountains the city has a misleading reputation for frequent rain this reputation stems from the frequency of light precipitation in the fall winter and spring in an average year at least 0.01 inches (0.25 mm) of precipitation falls on 150 days more than nearly all u.s cities east of the rocky mountains it is cloudy 201 days out of the year and partly cloudy 93 days official weather and climatic data is collected at seattletacoma international airport located about 19 km (12 mi) south of downtown in the city of seatac which is at a higher elevation and records more cloudy days and fewer partly cloudy days per year
from 1981 to 2010 the average annual precipitation measured at seattletacoma international airport was 37.49 inches (952 mm) annual precipitation has ranged from 23.78 in (604 mm) in 1952 to 55.14 in (1,401 mm) in 1950 for water year (october 1 september 30) precipitation the range is 23.16 in (588 mm) in 197677 to 51.82 in (1,316 mm) in 199697 due to local variations in microclimate seattle also receives significantly lower precipitation than some other locations west of the cascades around 80 mi (129 km) to the west the hoh rain forest in olympic national park on the western flank of the olympic mountains receives an annual average precipitation of 142 in (3.61 m) sixty miles to the south of seattle the state capital olympia which is out of the olympic mountains rain shadow receives an annual average precipitation of 50 in (1,270 mm) the city of bremerton about 15 mi (24 km) west of downtown seattle receives 56.4 in (1,430 mm) of precipitation annually
in november seattle averages more rainfall than any other u.s city of more than 250,000 people it also ranks highly in winter precipitation conversely the city receives some of the lowest precipitation amounts of any large city from june to september seattle is one of the five rainiest major u.s cities as measured by the number of days with precipitation and it receives some of the lowest amounts of annual sunshine among major cities in the lower 48 states along with some cities in the northeast ohio and michigan thunderstorms are rare as the city reports thunder on just seven days per year by comparison fort myers florida reports thunder on 93 days per year kansas city on 52 and new york city on 25
seattle experiences its heaviest rainfall during the months of november december and january receiving roughly half of its annual rainfall (by volume) during this period in late fall and early winter atmospheric rivers (also known as pineapple express systems) strong frontal systems and pacific low pressure systems are common light rain & drizzle are the predominant forms of precipitation during the remainder of the year for instance on average less than 1.6 in (41 mm) of rain falls in july and august combined when rain is rare on occasion seattle experiences somewhat more significant weather events one such event occurred on december 24 2007 when sustained hurricane-force winds and widespread heavy rainfall associated with a strong pineapple express event occurred in the greater puget sound area and the western parts of washington and oregon precipitation totals exceeded 13.8 in (350 mm) in some areas with winds topping out at 209 km/h (130 mph) along coastal oregon it became the second wettest event in seattle history when a little over 130 mm (5.1 in) of rain fell on seattle in a 24-hour period lack of adaptation to the heavy rain contributed to five deaths and widespread flooding and damage
autumn winter and early spring are frequently characterized by rain winters are cool and wet with december the coolest month averaging 40.6 f (4.8 c) with 28 annual days with lows that reach the freezing mark and 2.0 days where the temperature stays at or below freezing all day the temperature rarely lowers to 20 f (7 c) summers are sunny dry and warm with august the warmest month averaging 66.1 f (18.9 c) and with temperatures reaching 90 f (32 c) on 3.1 days per year although 2011 is the most recent year to not reach 90 f the hottest officially recorded temperature was 103 f (39 c) on july 29 2009 the coldest recorded temperature was 0 f (18 c) on january 31 1950 the record cold daily maximum is 16 f (9 c) on january 14 1950 while conversely the record warm daily minimum is 71 f (22 c) the day the official record high was set the average window for freezing temperatures is november 16 thru march 10 allowing a growing season of 250 days
seattle typically receives some snowfall on an annual basis but heavy snow is rare average annual snowfall as measured at sea-tac airport is 6.8 inches (17.3 cm) single calendar-day snowfall of six inches or greater has occurred on only 15 days since 1948 and only once since february 17 1990 when 6.8 in (17.3 cm) of snow officially fell at sea-tac airport on january 18 2012 this moderate snow event was officially the 12th snowiest calendar day at the airport since 1948 and snowiest since november 1985 much of the city of seattle proper received somewhat lesser snowfall accumulations locations to the south of seattle received more with olympia and chehalis receiving 14 to 18 in (36 to 46 cm) another moderate snow event occurred from december 1225 2008 when over one foot (30 cm) of snow fell and stuck on much of the roads over those two weeks when temperatures remained below 32 f (0 c) causing widespread difficulties in a city not equipped for clearing snow the largest documented snowstorm occurred from january 59 1880 with snow drifting to 6 feet (1.8 m) in places at the end of the snow event from january 31 to february 2 1916 another heavy snow event occurred with 29 in (74 cm) of snow on the ground by the time the event was over with official records dating to 1948 the largest single-day snowfall is 20.0 in (51 cm) on january 13 1950 seasonal snowfall has ranged from zero in 199192 to 67.5 in (171 cm) in 196869 with trace amounts having occurred as recently as 200910 the month of january 1950 was particularly severe bringing 57.2 in (145 cm) of snow the most of any month along with the aforementioned record cold
the puget sound convergence zone is an important feature of seattle's weather in the convergence zone air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south both streams of air originate over the pacific ocean airflow is split by the olympic mountains to seattle's west then reunited to the east when the air currents meet they are forced upward resulting in convection thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur north and south of town but seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers the hanukkah eve wind storm in december 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to 69 mph (111 km/h) an event that was not caused by the puget sound convergence zone and was widespread across the pacific northwest
one of many exceptions to seattle's reputation as a damp location occurs in el nio years when marine weather systems track as far south as california and little precipitation falls in the puget sound area since the region's water comes from mountain snow packs during the dry summer months el nio winters can not only produce substandard skiing but can result in water rationing and a shortage of hydroelectric power the following summer
