== etymology ==
the name malaysia is a combination of the word malay and the latin-greek suffix -sia"/- the word melayu in malay may derive from the tamil words malai and ur meaning mountain and city land respectively malayadvipa was the word used by ancient indian traders when referring to the malay peninsula whether or not it originated from these roots the word melayu or mlayu may have been used in early malay/javanese to mean to steadily accelerate or run this term was applied to describe the strong current of the river melayu in sumatra the name was later adopted by the melayu kingdom that existed in the seventh century on sumatra
before the onset of european colonisation the malay peninsula was known natively as tanah melayu ("malay land") under a racial classification created by a german scholar johann friedrich blumenbach the natives of maritime southeast asia were grouped into a single category the malay race following the expedition of french navigator jules dumont d'urville to oceania in 1826 he later proposed the terms of malaysia micronesia and melanesia to the socit de gographie in 1831 distinguishing these pacific cultures and island groups from the existing term polynesia dumont d'urville described malaysia as an area commonly known as the east indies in 1850 the english ethnologist george samuel windsor earl writing in the journal of the indian archipelago and eastern asia proposed naming the islands of southeast asia as melayunesia or indunesia favouring the former in modern terminology malay remains the name of an ethnoreligious group of austronesian people predominantly inhabiting the malay peninsula and portions of the adjacent islands of southeast asia including the east coast of sumatra the coast of borneo and smaller islands that lie between these areas

in 1511 malacca was conquered by portugal after which it was taken by the dutch in 1641 in 1786 the british empire established a presence in malaya when the sultan of kedah leased penang to the british east india company the british obtained the town of singapore in 1819 and in 1824 took control of malacca following the anglo-dutch treaty by 1826 the british directly controlled penang malacca singapore and the island of labuan which they established as the crown colony of the straits settlements by the 20th century the states of pahang selangor perak and negeri sembilan known together as the federated malay states had british residents appointed to advise the malay rulers to whom the rulers were bound to defer to by treaty the remaining five states in the peninsula known as the unfederated malay states while not directly under british rule also accepted british advisers around the turn of the 20th century development on the peninsula and borneo were generally separate until the 19th century under british rule the immigration of chinese and indians to serve as labourers was encouraged the area that is now sabah came under british control as north borneo when both the sultan of brunei and the sultan of sulu transferred their respective territorial rights of ownership between 1877 and 1878 in 1842 sarawak was ceded by the sultan of brunei to james brooke whose successors ruled as the white rajahs over an independent kingdom until 1946 when it became a crown colony
in the second world war the japanese army invaded and occupied malaya north borneo sarawak and singapore for over three years during this time ethnic tensions were raised and nationalism grew popular support for independence increased after malaya was reconquered by allied forces post-war british plans to unite the administration of malaya under a single crown colony called the malayan union met with strong opposition from the malays who opposed the weakening of the malay rulers and the granting of citizenship to the ethnic chinese the malayan union established in 1946 and consisting of all the british possessions in the malay peninsula with the exception of singapore was quickly dissolved and replaced on 1 february 1948 by the federation of malaya which restored the autonomy of the rulers of the malay states under british protection during this time mostly chinese rebels under the leadership of the malayan communist party launched guerrilla operations designed to force the british out of malaya the malayan emergency lasted from 1948 to 1960 and involved a long anti-insurgency campaign by commonwealth troops in malaya after this a plan was put in place to federate malaya with the crown colonies of north borneo (which joined as sabah) sarawak and singapore the proposed date of federation was 31 august 1963 however the date was delayed until 16 september 1963 due to opposition from indonesia's sukarno and the sarawak united peoples party
federation brought heightened tensions including a conflict with indonesia singapore's eventual exit in 1965 and racial strife this strife culminated in the 13 may race riots in 1969 after the riots the controversial new economic policy was launched by prime minister tun abdul razak trying to increase the share of the economy held by the bumiputera under prime minister mahathir mohamad there was a period of rapid economic growth and urbanisation beginning in the 1980s the economy shifted from being agriculturally based to one based on manufacturing and industry numerous mega-projects were completed such as the petronas towers the north-south expressway the multimedia super corridor and the new federal administrative capital of putrajaya however in the late 1990s the asian financial crisis almost caused the collapse of the currency and the stock and property markets

==== water supply and sanitation ====
universal access to water supply at affordable tariffs is a substantial achievement the government has also shown a commitment to make the sector more efficient to create a sustainable funding mechanism and to improve the customer orientation of service providers through sector reforms enacted in 2006 the reform creates a modern institutional structure for the water sector including an autonomous regulatory agency an asset management company and commercialised state water companies that have to reach certain key performance indicators that will be monitored by the regulatory agency the government has also stated its intention not to embark on new private sector contracts for water provision after a bout of such contracts during the 1990s showed mixed results
despite those achievements a number of challenges remain only some of which have been addressed by the reforms first tariffs are low thus making cost recovery impossible at current levels so that the sector continues to depend on government subsidies second water losses as well as per capita water use remain high despite efforts at water demand management third a large-scale water transfer project from the pahang river to kuala lumpur is controversial because of its negative social and environmental impacts fourth the development of sewerage and wastewater treatment has lagged behind the development of water infrastructure for example much of the collected wastewater is not yet being treated the sanitation sub-sector has been excluded in the 2006 reforms of the water supply sub-sector

== culture ==
malaysia has a multi-ethnic multicultural and multilingual society the original culture of the area stemmed from indigenous tribes that inhabited it along with the malays who later moved there substantial influence exists from chinese and indian culture dating back to when foreign trade began other cultural influences include the persian arabic and british cultures due to the structure of the government coupled with the social contract theory there has been minimal cultural assimilation of ethnic minorities
in 1971 the government created a national cultural policy defining malaysian culture it stated that malaysian culture must be based on the culture of the indigenous peoples of malaysia that it may incorporate suitable elements from other cultures and that islam must play a part in it it also promoted the malay language above others this government intervention into culture has caused resentment among non-malays who feel their cultural freedom was lessened both chinese and indian associations have submitted memorandums to the government accusing it of formulating an undemocratic culture policy
some cultural disputes exist between malaysia and neighbouring countries notably indonesia the two countries have a similar cultural heritage sharing many traditions and items however disputes have arisen over things ranging from culinary dishes to malaysia's national anthem strong feelings exist in indonesia about protecting their national heritage the malaysian government and the indonesian government have met to defuse some of the tensions resulting from the overlaps in culture feelings are not as strong in malaysia where most recognise that many cultural values are shared

sometimes food not found in its original culture is assimilated into another for example chinese restaurants in malaysia often serve malay dishes food from one culture is sometimes also cooked using styles taken from another culture for example shrimp paste (belacan) and sambal are commonly used by chinese restaurant for cooking this means that although much of malaysian food can be traced back to a certain culture they have their own identity rice is popular in many dishes chili is commonly found in local cuisine although this does not necessarily make them spicy
