999,999 divided by 7 is exactly 142,857 therefore when a vulgar fraction with 7 in the denominator is converted to a decimal expansion the result has the same six-digit repeating sequence after the decimal point but the sequence can start with any of those six digits for example 1/7 = 0.142857 142857 and 2/7 = 0.285714 285714
in fact if one sorts the digits in the number 142857 in ascending order 124578 it is possible to know from which of the digits the decimal part of the number is going to begin with the remainder of dividing any number by 7 will give the position in the sequence 124578 that the decimal part of the resulting number will start for example 628/7= 89 + 5/7 here 5 is the remainder and would correspond to number 7 in the ranking of the ascending sequence so in this case 628/7 = 89.714285 another example 5238/7 = 748 + 2/7 hence the remainder is 2 and this corresponds to number 2 in the sequence in this case 5238/7 = 748.285714

== evolution of the glyph ==
in the beginning various hindus wrote 7 more or less in one stroke as a curve that looks like an uppercase j vertically inverted the western ghubar arabs main contribution was to make the longer line diagonal rather than straight though they showed some tendencies to making the character more rectilinear the eastern arabs developed the character from a 6-look-alike into an uppercase v-look-alike both modern arab forms influenced the european form a two-stroke character consisting of a horizontal upper line joined at its right to a line going down to the bottom left corner a line that is slightly curved in some font variants as is the case with the european glyph the cham and khmer glyph for 7 also evolved to look like their glyph for 1 though in a different way so they were also concerned with making their 7 more different for the khmer this often involved adding a horizontal line above the glyph this is analogous to the horizontal stroke through the middle that is sometimes used in handwriting in the western world but which is almost never used in computer fonts this horizontal stroke is however important to distinguish the glyph for seven from the glyph for one in writings that use a long upstroke in the glyph for 1
on the seven-segment displays of pocket calculators and digital watches 7 is the number with the most common glyph variation (1 6 and 9 also have variant glyphs) most calculators use three line segments but on sharp casio and a few other brands of calculators 7 is written with four line segments because in japan and korea 7 is written as in the illustration to the right
while the shape of the 7 character has an ascender in most modern typefaces in typefaces with text figures the character usually has a descender as for example in 
most people in continental europe and increasingly in the uk and ireland as well as latin america write 7 with a line in the middle ("7") sometimes with the top line crooked the line through the middle is useful to clearly differentiate the character from the number one as these can appear similar when written in certain styles of handwriting this glyph is used in official handwriting rules for primary school in russia ukraine romania poland and other slavic countries as well as in france finland and germany
