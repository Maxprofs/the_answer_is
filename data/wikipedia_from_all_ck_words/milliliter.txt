the millimetre (international spelling as used by the international bureau of weights and measures) or millimeter (american spelling) (si unit symbol mm) is a unit of length in the metric system equal to one thousandth of a metre which is the si base unit of length
it is equal to 1,000 micrometres and 1,000,000 nanometres there are 25.4 mm in one inch by definition so a millimetre is exactly equal to 5127 inch
== definitionedit ==
since 1983 the metre has been defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second. a millimetre 1/1000 of a metre is therefore the distance travelled by light in 1/299,792,458,000 of a second

on a metric ruler the smallest measurements are normally millimetres high-quality engineering rules may be graduated in increments of 0.5 mm digital vernier callipers are commonly capable of reading increments as small as 0.01 mm
microwaves with a frequency of 300 ghz have a wavelength of 1 mm using wavelengths between 30 ghz and 300 ghz for data transmission in contrast to the 300 mhz to 3 ghz normally used in mobile devices has the potential to allow data transfer rates of 10 gigabits per second
the smallest distances the human eye can resolve is around 0.02 to 0.04 mm approximately the width of a human hair a sheet of paper is typically between 0.07 mm and 0.18 mm thick with ordinary printer paper or copy paper approximately a tenth of a millimetre thick
