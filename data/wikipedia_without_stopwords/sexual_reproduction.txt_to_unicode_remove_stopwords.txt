sexual reproduction form reproduction two morphologically distinct types specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together involving females large ovum egg males smaller sperm gamete contains half number chromosomes normal cells created specialized type cell division occurs eukaryotic cells known meiosis two gametes fuse fertilization produce dna replication creation singlecelled zygote includes genetic material gametes process called genetic recombination genetic material dna joins homologous chromosome sequences aligned followed exchange genetic information two rounds cell division produce four daughter cells half number chromosomes original parent cell number chromosomes parents though selffertilization occur instance human reproduction human cell contains chromosomes pairs except gamete cells contain chromosomes child chromosomes parent genetically recombined pairs cell division initiates development new individual organism multicellular organisms including animals plants vast majority primary method reproduction species defined taxonomic rank species often defined largest group organisms two hybrids capable reproducing fertile offspring typically using sexual reproduction although species problem encompasses series difficult related questions often come biologists define word species
evolution sexual reproduction major puzzle asexual reproduction able outcompete every young organism created bear young implies asexual population intrinsic capacity grow rapidly generation cost fitness disadvantage sexual reproduction twofold cost sex includes cost fact organism pass genes offspring one definite advantage sexual reproduction prevents accumulation genetic mutations
sexual selection mode natural selection individuals outreproduce others population better securing mates sexual reproduction described powerful evolutionary force exist asexual populations
prokaryotes reproduce asexual reproduction may display processes similar sexual reproduction mechanisms lateral gene transfer bacterial conjugation transformation transduction lead reproduction prokaryotes initial cell additional transformed genetic material
evolution
first fossilized evidence sexual reproduction eukaryotes stenian period billion years ago
biologists studying evolution propose several explanations sexual reproduction developed maintained reasons include fighting accumulation deleterious mutations increasing rate adaptation changing environments dealing competition masking deleterious mutations ideas sexual reproduction maintained generally supported ultimately size population determines sexual reproduction entirely beneficial larger populations appear respond quickly benefits obtained sexual reproduction smaller population sizes
maintenance sexual reproduction explained theories work several levels selection though models remain controversial
new models presented recent years suggest basic advantage sexual reproduction slowly reproducing complex organisms sexual reproduction allows species exhibit characteristics depend specific environment inhabit particular survival strategies employ
sexual selection
order sexually reproduce males females need find mate generally animals mate choice made females males compete chosen lead organisms extreme efforts order reproduce combat display produce extreme features caused positive feedback known fisherian runaway thus sexual reproduction form natural selection effect evolution sexual dimorphism basic phenotypic traits vary males females species dimorphism found sex organs secondary sex characteristics body size physical strength morphology biological ornamentation behavior bodily traits however sexual selection implied extended period time leading sexual dimorphism
sex ratio
apart eusocial wasps organisms reproduce sexually sex ratio male female births english statistician biologist ronald fisher outlined come known fishers principle essentially says following
suppose male births less common female
newborn male better mating prospects newborn female therefore expect offspring
therefore parents genetically disposed produce males tend average numbers grandchildren born
therefore genes maleproducing tendencies spread male births become common
sex ratio approached advantage associated producing males dies away
reasoning holds females substituted males throughout therefore equilibrium ratio
animals
insects
insect species make twothirds extant animal species insect species reproduce sexually though species facultatively parthenogenetic many insects species sexual dimorphism others sexes look nearly identical typically two sexes males producing spermatozoa females ova ova develop eggs covering called chorion forms internal fertilization insects diverse mating reproductive strategies often resulting male depositing spermatophore within female stores ready egg fertilization fertilization formation zygote varying degrees development many species eggs deposited outside female others develop within female born live
birds
mammals
three extant kinds mammals monotremes placentals marsupials internal fertilization placental mammals offspring born juveniles complete animals sex organs present although reproductively functional several months years depending species sex organs develop maturity animal becomes sexually mature female mammals fertile certain periods estrous cycle point ready mate individual male female mammals meet carry copulation mammals males females exchange sexual partners throughout adult lives
fish
vast majority fish species lay eggs fertilized male species lay eggs substrate like rock plants others scatter eggs eggs fertilized drift sink water column
fish species use internal fertilization disperse developing eggs give birth live offspring fish livebearing offspring include guppy mollies poecilia fishes give birth live young ovoviviparous eggs fertilized within female eggs simply hatch within female body seahorses male carries developing young within pouch gives birth live young fishes also viviparous female supplies nourishment internally growing offspring fish hermaphrodites single fish male female produce eggs sperm hermaphroditic fish male female time fish serially hermaphroditic starting one sex changing least one hermaphroditic species selffertilization occurs eggs sperm released together internal selffertilization may occur species one fish species reproduce sexual reproduction uses sex produce offspring poecilia formosa unisex species uses form parthenogenesis called gynogenesis unfertilized eggs develop embryos produce female offspring poecilia formosa mate males fish species use internal fertilization sperm fertilize eggs stimulates growth eggs develops embryos
reptiles
amphibians
mollusks
plants
animals typically produce gametes directly meiosis male gametes called sperm female gametes called eggs ova animals fertilization follows immediately meiosis plants hand mitosis occurring spores produced meiosis spores germinate gametophyte phase gametophytes different groups plants vary size angiosperms three cells pollen mosses called primitive plants may several million cells plants alternation generations sporophyte phase succeeded gametophyte phase sporophyte phase produces spores within sporangium meiosis
flowering plants
flowering plants dominant plant form land reproduce either sexually asexually often distinguishing feature reproductive organs commonly called flowers anther produces pollen grains contain male gametophytes sperm pollination occur pollen grains must attach stigma female reproductive structure carpel female gametophytes ovules located inside ovary pollen tube grows carpels style sex cell nuclei pollen grain migrate ovule fertilize egg cell endosperm nuclei within female gametophyte process termed double fertilization resulting zygote develops embryo triploid endosperm one sperm cell plus two female cells female tissues ovule give rise surrounding tissues developing seed ovary produced female gametophytes grows fruit surrounds seeds plants may either selfpollinate crosspollinate
nonflowering plants like ferns moss liverworts use means sexual reproduction
flowers dating cretaceous million years present found encased amber oldest evidence sexual reproduction flowering plant microscopic images showed tubes growing pollen penetrating flowers stigma pollen sticky suggesting carried insects
ferns
ferns mostly produce large diploid sporophytes rhizomes roots leaves fertile leaves called sporangium spores produced spores released germinate produce short thin gametophytes typically heart shaped small green color gametophytes thallus produce motile sperm antheridia egg cells separate archegonia rains dew deposits film water motile sperm splashed away antheridia normally produced top side thallus swim film water archegonia fertilize egg promote crossing cross fertilization sperm released eggs receptive sperm making likely sperm fertilize eggs different thallus zygote formed fertilization grows new sporophytic plant condition separate sporephyte gametophyte plants called alternation generations plants similar reproductive means include psilotum lycopodium selaginella equisetum
bryophytes
bryophytes include liverworts hornworts mosses reproduce sexually vegetatively small plants found growing moist locations like ferns motile sperm flagella need water facilitate sexual reproduction plants start haploid spore grows dominate form multicellular haploid body leaflike structures photosynthesize haploid gametes produced antherida archegonia mitosis sperm released antherida respond chemicals released ripe archegonia swim film water fertilize egg cells thus producing zygote zygote divides mitotic division grows sporophyte diploid multicellular diploid sporophyte produces structures called spore capsules connected seta archegonia spore capsules produce spores meiosis ripe capsules burst open spores released bryophytes show considerable variation breeding structures basic outline also species plant one sex species produce sexes plant
fungi
fungi classified methods sexual reproduction employ outcome sexual reproduction often production resting spores used survive inclement times spread typically three phases sexual reproduction fungi plasmogamy karyogamy meiosis
bacteria archaea
three distinct processes prokaryotes regarded similar eukaryotic sex bacterial transformation involves incorporation foreign dna bacterial chromosome bacterial conjugation transfer plasmid dna bacteria plasmids rarely incorporated bacterial chromosome gene transfer genetic exchange archaea
bacterial transformation involves recombination genetic material function mainly associated dna repair bacterial transformation complex process encoded numerous bacterial genes bacterial adaptation dna transfer process occurs naturally least bacterial species bacterium bind take recombine exogenous dna chromosome must enter special physiological state referred competence see natural competence sexual reproduction early singlecelled eukaryotes may evolved bacterial transformation similar process archaea see
hand bacterial conjugation type direct transfer dna two bacteria external appendage called conjugation pilus bacterial conjugation controlled plasmid genes adapted spreading copies plasmid bacteria infrequent integration plasmid host bacterial chromosome subsequent transfer part host chromosome another cell appear bacterial adaptations
exposure hyperthermophilic archaeal sulfolobus species dna damaging conditions induces cellular aggregation accompanied high frequency genetic marker exchange ajon et al hypothesized cellular aggregation enhances speciesspecific dna repair homologous recombination dna transfer sulfolobus may early form sexual interaction similar wellstudied bacterial transformation systems also involve speciesspecific dna transfer leading homologous recombinational repair dna damage
