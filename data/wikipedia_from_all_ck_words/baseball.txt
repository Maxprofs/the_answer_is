baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each who take turns batting and fielding
the batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases first second third and home plate a run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate
players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways a player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates turns batting such as on a hit or by other means the teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs one turn batting for both teams beginning with the visiting team constitutes an inning a game comprises nine innings and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins baseball is the only major team sport in america with no game clock although almost all games end in the ninth inning
evolving from older bat-and-ball games an early form of baseball was being played in england by the mid-18th century this game was brought by immigrants to north america where the modern version developed by the late 19th century baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the united states baseball is now popular in north america and parts of central and south america the caribbean and east asia
in the united states and canada professional major league baseball (mlb) teams are divided into the national league (nl) and american league (al) each with three divisions east west and central the major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the world series the top level of play is similarly split in japan between the central and pacific leagues and in cuba between the west league and east league

=== origins of baseball ===
the evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision a french manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game possibly la soule with similarities to baseball other old french games such as thque la balle au bton and la balle empoisonne also appear to be related consensus once held that today's baseball is a north american development from the older game rounders popular in great britain and ireland baseball before we knew it a search for the roots of the game (2005) by david block suggests that the game originated in england recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other and that the game's most direct antecedents are the english games of stoolball and tut-ball it has long been believed that cricket also descended from such games though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to england from flanders
the earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 british publication a little pretty pocket-book by john newbery it contains a rhymed description of base-ball and a woodcut that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern gamethough in a triangular rather than diamond configuration and with posts instead of ground-level bases david block discovered that the first recorded game of bass-ball took place in 1749 in surrey and featured the prince of wales as a player william bray an english lawyer recorded a game of baseball on easter monday 1755 in guildford surrey this early form of the game was apparently brought to canada by english immigrants rounders was also brought to the usa by canadians of both british and irish ancestry the first known american reference to baseball appears in a 1791 pittsfield massachusetts town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town's new meeting house by 1796 a version of the game was well-known enough to earn a mention in a german scholar's book on popular pastimes as described by johann gutsmuths englische base-ball involved a contest between two teams in which the batter has three attempts to hit the ball while at the home plate. only one out was required to retire a side
by the early 1830s there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around north america these games were often referred to locally as town ball though other names such as round-ball and base-ball were also used among the earliest examples to receive a detailed descriptionalbeit five decades after the fact in a letter from an attendee to sporting life magazinetook place in beachville ontario in 1838 there were many similarities to modern baseball and some crucial differences five bases (or byes) first bye just 18 feet (5.5 m) from the home bye batter out if a hit ball was caught after the first bounce the once widely accepted story that abner doubleday invented baseball in cooperstown new york in 1839 has been conclusively debunked by sports historians
in 1845 alexander cartwright a member of new york city's knickerbocker club led the codification of the so-called knickerbocker rules the practice common to bat-and-ball games of the day of soaking or plugging"effecting a putout by hitting a runner with a thrown ballwas barred the rules thus facilitated the use of a smaller harder ball than had been common several other rules also brought the knickerbockers game close to the modern one though a ball caught on the first bounce was again an out and only underhand pitching was allowed while there are reports that the new york knickerbockers played games in 1845 the contest now recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in u.s history took place on june 19 1846 in hoboken new jersey the new york nine defeated the knickerbockers 231 in four innings with the knickerbocker code as the basis the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next half-century

==== the game turns professional ====
in the mid-1850s a baseball craze hit the new york metropolitan area by 1856 local journals were referring to baseball as the national pastime or national game a year later sixteen area clubs formed the sport's first governing body the national association of base ball players in 1858 in corona queens new york at the fashion race course the first games of baseball to charge admission took place the games which took place between the all stars of brooklyn including players from the brooklyn atlantics excelsior of brooklyn putnams and eckford of brooklyn and the all stars of new york (manhattan) including players from the new york knickerbockers gothams (predecessors of the san francisco giants) eagles and empire are commonly believed to be the first all-star baseball games in 1863 the organization disallowed putouts made by catching a fair ball on the first bounce four years later it barred participation by african americans the game's commercial potential was developing in 1869 the first fully professional baseball club the cincinnati red stockings was formed and went undefeated against a schedule of semipro and amateur teams the first professional league the national association of professional base ball players lasted from 1871 to 1875 scholars dispute its status as a major league
the more formally structured national league was founded in 1876 as the oldest surviving major league the national league is sometimes referred to as the senior circuit several other major leagues formed and failed in 1884 african american moses walker (and briefly his brother welday) played in one of these the american association an injury ended walker's major league career and by the early 1890s a gentlemen's agreement in the form of the baseball color line effectively barred black players from the white-owned professional leagues major and minor professional negro leagues formed but quickly folded several independent african american teams succeeded as barnstormers also in 1884 overhand pitching was legalized in 1887 softball under the name of indoor baseball or indoor-outdoor was invented as a winter version of the parent game virtually all of the modern baseball rules were in place by 1893 the last major changecounting foul balls as strikeswas instituted in 1901 the national league's first successful counterpart the american league which evolved from the minor western league was established that year the two leagues each with eight teams were rivals that fought for the best players often disregarding each other's contracts and engaging in bitter legal disputes
a modicum of peace was eventually established leading to the national agreement of 1903 the pact formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the national association of professional base ball leagues representing most of the country's minor professional leagues the world series pitting the two major league champions against each other was inaugurated that fall albeit without express major league sanction the boston americans of the american league defeated the pittsburgh pirates of the national league the next year the series was not held as the national league champion new york giants under manager john mcgraw refused to recognize the major league status of the american league and its champion in 1905 the giants were national league champions again and team management relented leading to the establishment of the world series as the major leagues annual championship event
as professional baseball became increasingly profitable players frequently raised grievances against owners over issues of control and equitable income distribution during the major leagues early decades players on various teams occasionally attempted strikes which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened in general the strict rules of baseball contracts and the reserve clause which bound players to their teams even when their contracts had ended tended to keep the players in check motivated by dislike for particularly stingy owner charles comiskey and gamblers payoffs real and promised members of the chicago white sox conspired to throw the 1919 world series the black sox scandal led to the formation of a new national commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together the first major league baseball commissioner kenesaw mountain landis was elected in 1920 that year also saw the founding of the negro national league the first significant negro league it would operate until 1931 for part of the 1920s it was joined by the eastern colored league
professional baseball was played in northeastern cities with a large immigrant-ethnic population they gave strong support to the new sport the irish catholics dominated in the late 19th century comprising a third or more of the players and many of the top stars and managers historian jerrold casway argues that
baseball for irish kids was a shortcut to the american dream and to self-indulgent glory and fortune by the mid-1880s these young irish men dominated the sport and popularized a style of play that was termed heady daring and spontaneous ed delahanty personified the flamboyant exciting spectator-favorite the casey-at-the-bat irish slugger the handsome masculine athlete who is expected to live as large as he played
==== rise of ruth and racial integration ====
compared with the present professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring and pitchers the likes of walter johnson and christy mathewson were more dominant the inside game which demanded that players scratch for runs was played much more aggressively than it is today the brilliant and often violent ty cobb epitomized this style the so-called dead-ball era ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters strict new regulations governing the ball's size shape and composition along with a new rule officially banning the spitball along with other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign substances after the death of ray chapman who was hit by a pitch in august 1920 coupled with superior materials available after world war i resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit the construction of additional seating to accommodate the rising popularity of the game often had the effect of bringing the outfield fences closer in making home runs more common the rise of the legendary player babe ruth the first great power hitter of the new era helped permanently alter the nature of the game the club with which ruth set most of his slugging records the new york yankees built a reputation as the majors premier team in the late 1920s and early 1930s st louis cardinals general manager branch rickey invested in several minor league clubs and developed the first modern farm system a new negro national league was organized in 1933 four years later it was joined by the negro american league the first elections to the baseball hall of fame took place in 1936 in 1939 little league baseball was founded in pennsylvania by the late 1940s it was the organizing body for children's baseball leagues across the united states
with america's entry into world war ii many professional players had left to serve in the armed forces a large number of minor league teams disbanded as a result and the major league game seemed under threat as well chicago cubs owner philip k wrigley led the formation of a new professional league with women players to help keep the game in the public eye the all-american girls professional baseball league existed from 1943 to 1954 the inaugural college world series was held in 1947 and the babe ruth league youth program was founded this program soon became another important organizing body for children's baseball the first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred the previous year jackie robinson was signed by the national league's brooklyn dodgerswhere branch rickey had become general managerand began playing for their minor league team in montreal in 1947 robinson broke the major leagues color barrier when he debuted with the dodgers larry doby debuted with the american league's cleveland indians the same year latin american players largely overlooked before also started entering the majors in greater numbers in 1951 two chicago white sox venezuelan-born chico carrasquel and black cuban-born minnie mioso became the first hispanic all-stars
facing competition as varied as television and football baseball attendance at all levels declined while the majors rebounded by the mid-1950s the minor leagues were gutted and hundreds of semipro and amateur teams dissolved integration proceeded slowly by 1953 only six of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster that year the major league baseball players association was founded it was the first professional baseball union to survive more than briefly but it remained largely ineffective for years no major league team had been located west of st louis until 1958 when the brooklyn dodgers and new york giants relocated to los angeles and san francisco respectively the majors final all-white bastion the boston red sox added a black player in 1959 with the integration of the majors drying up the available pool of players the last negro league folded the following year in 1961 the american league reached the west coast with the los angeles angels expansion team and the major league season was extended from 154 games to 162 this coincidentally helped roger maris break babe ruth's long-standing single-season home run record one of the most celebrated marks in baseball along with the angels three other new franchises were launched during 196162 with this the first major league expansion in 60 years each league now had ten teams
==== attendance records and the age of steroids ====
the players union became bolder under the leadership of former united steelworkers chief economist and negotiator marvin miller who was elected executive director in 1966 on the playing field major league pitchers were becoming increasingly dominant again after the 1968 season in an effort to restore balance the strike zone was reduced and the height of the pitcher's mound was lowered from 15 to 10 inches in 1969 both the national and american leagues added two more expansion teams the leagues were reorganized into two divisions each and a post-season playoff system leading to the world series was instituted also that same year curt flood of the st louis cardinals made the first serious legal challenge to the reserve clause the major leagues first general players strike took place in 1972 in another effort to add more offense to the game the american league adopted the designated hitter rule the following year in 1975 the union's powerand players salariesbegan to increase greatly when the reserve clause was effectively struck down leading to the free agency system in 1977 two more expansion teams joined the american league significant work stoppages occurred again in 1981 and 1994 the latter forcing the cancellation of the world series for the first time in 90 years attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994 before the stoppage the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance
the addition of two more expansion teams after the 1993 season had facilitated another restructuring of the major leagues this time into three divisions each offensive productionthe number of home runs in particularhad surged that year and again in the abbreviated 1994 season after play resumed in 1995 this trend continued and non-division-winning wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set the next year mark mcgwire and sammy sosa both surpassed maris's decades-old single season home run record and two more expansion franchises were added in 2000 the national and american leagues were dissolved as legal entities while their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction) the regulations and other functionssuch as player discipline and umpire supervisionthey had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of major league baseball (mlb)
in 2001 barry bonds established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season there had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by the abuse of illegal steroids (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion) but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004 in 2007 bonds became mlb's all-time home run leader surpassing hank aaron as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs even though mcgwire sosa and bondsas well as many other players including storied pitcher roger clemenshave been implicated in the steroid abuse scandal their feats and those of other sluggers had become the major leagues defining attraction in contrast to the professional game's resurgence in popularity after the 1994 interruption little league enrollment was in decline after peaking in 1996 it dropped 1 percent a year over the following decade with more rigorous testing and penalties for performance-enhancing drug use a possible factor the balance between bat and ball swung markedly in 2010 which became known as the year of the pitcher runs per game fell to their lowest level in 18 years and the strikeout rate was higher than it had been in half a century
before the start of the 2012 season mlb altered its rules to double the number of wild card teams admitted into the playoffs to two per league the playoff expansion resulted in the addition of annual one-game playoffs between the wild card teams in each league
=== baseball around the world ===
baseball widely known as america's pastime is well established in several other countries as well the history of baseball in canada has remained closely linked with that of the sport in the united states as early as 1877 a professional league the international association featured teams from both countries while baseball is widely played in canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country the american major leagues did not include a canadian club until 1969 when the montreal expos joined the national league as an expansion team in 1977 the expansion toronto blue jays joined the american league the blue jays won the world series in 1992 and 1993 the first and still the only club from outside the united states to do so after the 2004 season major league baseball relocated the expos to washington d.c. where the team is now known as the nationals
in 1847 american soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in mexico at parque los berros in xalapa veracruz a few days after the battle of cerro gordo they used the wooden leg captured (by the fourth illinois regiment) from general santa anna the first formal baseball league outside of the united states and canada was founded in 1878 in cuba which maintains a rich baseball tradition and whose national team has been one of the world's strongest since international play began in the late 1930s (all organized baseball in the country has officially been amateur since the cuban revolution) the dominican republic held its first islandwide championship tournament in 1912 professional baseball tournaments and leagues began to form in other countries between the world wars including the netherlands (formed in 1922) australia (1934) japan (1936) mexico (1937) and puerto rico (1938) the japanese major leaguesthe central league and pacific leaguehave long been considered the highest quality professional circuits outside of the united states japan has a professional minor league system as well though it is much smaller than the american versioneach team has only one farm club in contrast to mlb teams four or five
after world war ii professional leagues were founded in many latin american nations most prominently venezuela (1946) and the dominican republic (1955) since the early 1970s the annual caribbean series has matched the championship clubs from the four leading latin american winter leagues the dominican professional baseball league mexican pacific league puerto rican professional baseball league and venezuelan professional baseball league in asia south korea (1982) taiwan (1990) and china (2003) all have professional leagues
many european countries have professional leagues as well the most successful other than the dutch league being the italian league founded in 1948 compared to those in asia and latin america the various european leagues and the one in australia historically have had no more than niche appeal in 2004 australia won a surprise silver medal at the olympic games the israel baseball league launched in 2007 folded after one season the confdration europene de baseball (european baseball confederation) founded in 1953 organizes a number of competitions between clubs from different countries as well as national squads other competitions between national teams such as the baseball world cup and the olympic baseball tournament were administered by the international baseball federation (ibaf) from its formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger with the international softball federation to create the current joint governing body for both sports the world baseball softball confederation (wbsc) by 2009 the ibaf had 117 member countries women's baseball is played on an organized amateur basis in many of the countries where it is a leading men's sport since 2004 the ibaf and now wbsc have sanctioned the women's baseball world cup featuring national teams
after being admitted to the olympics as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 games baseball was dropped from the 2012 summer olympic games at the 2005 international olympic committee meeting it remained part of the 2008 games the elimination of baseball along with softball from the 2012 olympic program enabled the ioc to consider adding two different sports but none received the votes required for inclusion while the sport's lack of a following in much of the world was a factor more important was major league baseball's reluctance to have a break during the games to allow its players to participate as the national hockey league now does during the winter olympic games such a break is more difficult for mlb to accommodate because it would force the playoffs deeper into cold weather seeking reinstatement for the 2016 summer olympics the ibaf proposed an abbreviated competition designed to facilitate the participation of top players but the effort failed major league baseball initiated the world baseball classic scheduled to precede the major league season partly as a replacement high-profile international tournament the inaugural classic held in march 2006 was the first tournament involving national teams to feature a significant number of mlb participants the baseball world cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded world baseball classic
== rules and gameplay ==
a game is played between two teams each comprising nine players that take turns playing offense (batting and baserunning) and defense (pitching and fielding) a pair of turns one at bat and one in the field by each team constitutes an inning a game consists of nine innings (seven innings at the high school level and in doubleheaders in college and minor leagues) one teamcustomarily the visiting teambats in the top or first half of every inning the other teamcustomarily the home teambats in the bottom or second half of every inning the goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other team the players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by circling or completing a tour of the four bases set at the corners of the square-shaped baseball diamond a player bats at home plate and must proceed counterclockwise to first base second base third base and back home in order to score a run the team in the field attempts both to prevent runs from scoring and to record outs which remove opposing players from offensive action until their turn in their team's batting order comes up again when three outs are recorded the teams switch roles for the next half-inning if the score of the game is tied after nine innings extra innings are played to resolve the contest many amateur games particularly unorganized ones involve different numbers of players and innings
the game is played on a field whose primary boundaries the foul lines extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles the 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory the part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield in the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center the outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence which may be of any material and height (many amateur games are played on unfenced fields) fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play though significant events can take place in foul territory as well
there are three basic tools of baseball the ball the bat and the glove or mitt
the baseball is about the size of an adult's fist around 9 inches (23 centimeters) in circumference it has a rubber or cork center wound in yarn and covered in white cowhide with red stitching
the bat is a hitting tool traditionally made of a single solid piece of wood other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games it is a hard round stick about 2.5 inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob bats used by adults are typically around 34 inches (86 centimeters) long and not longer than 42 inches (106 centimeters)
the glove or mitt is a fielding tool made of padded leather with webbing between the fingers as an aid in catching and holding onto the ball it takes various shapes to meet the specific needs of different fielding positions
protective helmets are also standard equipment for all batters
at the beginning of each half-inning the nine players on the fielding team arrange themselves around the field one of them the pitcher stands on the pitcher's mound the pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate another player the catcher squats on the far side of home plate facing the pitcher the rest of the team faces home plate typically arranged as four infielderswho set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines between first second and third baseand three outfielders in the standard arrangement there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base a second baseman to the right of second base a shortstop to the left of second base and a third baseman to the right of third base the basic outfield positions are left fielder center fielder and right fielder a neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher other umpires will be distributed around the field as well though the number will vary depending on the level of play amateur or children's games may only have an umpire behind the plate while as many as six umpires can be used for important major league baseball games
play starts with a batter standing at home plate holding a bat the batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate and attempts to hit the ball with the bat the catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hitas a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connectand returns them to the pitcher a batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or until the play is over a batter-runner) a batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out (see below) is said to be safe and is now on base a batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyondhowever far the player believes can be reached safely a player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit a player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single if a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit it is a double third base a triple if the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence if there is one) it is a home run the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases each scoring a run this is the most desirable result for the batter a player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hitinstead the responsible fielder is charged with an error
any runners already on base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land or contact the ground in fair territory before or after the ball lands a runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play if a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began if the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began as or after the ball is caught runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home platea successful effort is a stolen base
a pitch that is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball a batter against whom three strikes are recorded strikes out a batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk a free advance to first base (a batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee
a strike is called when one of the following happens
the batter lets a well-pitched ball (one within the strike zone) go through to the catcher
the batter swings at any ball (even one outside the strike zone) and misses or foul tips it directly into the catcher's hands
the batter hits a foul ballone that either initially lands in foul territory or initially lands within the diamond but moves into foul territory before passing first or third base if there are already two strikes on the batter a foul ball is not counted as a third strike thus a foul ball cannot result in the immediate strikeout of the batter (there is an exception to this exception a two-strike foul bunt is recorded as a third strike.)
a ball is called when the pitcher throws a pitch that is outside the strike zone provided the batter has not swung at it
while the team at bat is trying to score runs the team in the field is attempting to record outs among the various ways a member of the batting team may be put out five are most common
the strikeout as described above recorded against a batter who makes three strikes before putting the ball into play or being awarded a free advance to first base (see also uncaught third strike)
the flyout as described above recorded against a batter who hits a ball in the air that is caught by a fielder whether in fair territory or foul territory before it lands whether or not the batter has run
the ground out recorded against a batter (in this case batter-runner) who hits a ball that lands in fair territory which before the batter-runner can reach first base is retrieved by a fielder who touches first base while holding the ball or relays it to another fielder who touches first base while holding the ball
the force out recorded against a runner who is required to attempt to advanceeither because the runner is on first base and a batted ball lands in fair territory or because the runner immediately behind on the basepath is thus required to attempt to advancebut fails to reach the next base before a fielder touches the base while holding the ball the ground out is technically a special case of the force out
the tag out recorded against a runner who is touched by a fielder with the ball or a glove holding the ball while the runner is not touching a base
it is possible to record two outs in the course of the same playa double play even threea triple playis possible though this is very rare players put out or retired must leave the field returning to their team's dugout or bench a runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at batevery half-inning begins with the bases empty of runners
an individual player's turn batting or plate appearance is complete when the player reaches base hits a home run makes an out or hits a ball that results in the team's third out even if it is recorded against a teammate on rare occasions a batter may be at the plate when without the batter's hitting the ball a third out is recorded against a teammatefor instance a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base) a batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased a runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn once a player has completed a plate appearance that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat the batting order is set before the game begins and may not be altered except for substitutions once a player has been removed for a substitute that player may not reenter the game children's games often have more liberal substitution rules
if the designated hitter (dh) rule is in effect each team has a tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run) the dh takes the place of another playeralmost invariably the pitcherin the batting order but does not field thus even with the dh each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players
== personnel ==
=== player rosters ===
roster or squad sizes differ between different leagues and different levels of organized play major league baseball teams maintain 25-player active rosters a typical 25-man roster in a league without the dh rule such as mlb's national league features
eight position playerscatcher four infielders three outfielderswho play on a regular basis
five starting pitchers who constitute the team's pitching rotation or starting rotation
six relief pitchers including one specialist closer who constitute the team's bullpen (named for the off-field area where pitchers warm up)
one backup or substitute catcher
two backup infielders
two backup outfielders
one specialist pinch hitter or a second backup catcher or a seventh reliever
=== other personnel ===
the manager or head coach of a team oversees the team's major strategic decisions such as establishing the starting rotation setting the lineup or batting order before each game and making substitutions during gamesin particular bringing in relief pitchers managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches they may have specialized responsibilities such as working with players on hitting fielding pitching or strength and conditioning at most levels of organized play two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat the first base coach and third base coach occupying designated coaches boxes just outside the foul lines assist in the direction of baserunners when the ball is in play and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners during pauses in play in contrast to many other team sports baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team's uniforms coaches must be in uniform in order to be allowed on the playing field during a game
any baseball game involves one or more umpires who make rulings on the outcome of each play at a minimum one umpire will stand behind the catcher to have a good view of the strike zone and call balls and strikes additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs in major league baseball four umpires are used for each game one near each base in the playoffs six umpires are used one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines
== strategy and tactics ==
many of the pre-game and in-game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around a fundamental fact in general right-handed batters tend to be more successful against left-handed pitchers and to an even greater degree left-handed batters tend to be more successful against right-handed pitchers a manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher may respond by starting one or more of the right-handed backups on the team's roster during the late innings of a game as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups with a team that has the lead in the late innings a manager may remove a starting position playerespecially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up againfor a more skillful fielder

the tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection by gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner and by throwing it at a certain speed pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side or downward as it approaches the batter among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown the four basic types are the fastball the changeup (or off-speed pitch) and two breaking ballsthe curveball and the slider pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing conventionally before each pitch the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw as well as its general vertical and/or horizontal location if there is disagreement on the selection the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch with a runner on base and taking a lead the pitcher may attempt a pickoff a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or optimally effect a tag out pickoff attempts however are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher with the result being runners on base if any advance one base with impunity if an attempted stolen base is anticipated the catcher may call for a pitchout a ball thrown deliberately off the plate allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of the field the fielding team may employ a shift with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions with a runner on third base the infielders may play in moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield
=== batting and baserunning tactics ===
several basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base the hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base creating a gap in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through the sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even at the expense of the batter being thrown out at firsta batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice (a batter particularly one who is a fast runner may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) a sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base aimed at bringing that runner home is known as a squeeze play with a runner on third and fewer than two outs a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that even if it is caught will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and scorea successful batter in this case gets credit for a sacrifice fly the manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e. has more balls than strikes) to take or not swing at the next pitch
== distinctive elements ==
baseball has certain attributes that set it apart from the other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following including but not limited to american and canadian football basketball ice hockey and soccer all of these sports use a clock in all of them play is less individual and more collective and in none of them is the variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important the comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports
=== no clock to kill ===
in clock-limited sports games often end with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than competing aggressively against the opposing team in contrast baseball has no clock a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time at almost any turn in any baseball game the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy in contrast again the clock comes into play even in the case of multi-day test and first-class cricket the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting
while nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years at the turn of the 20th century games typically took an hour and a half to play in the 1920s they averaged just less than two hours which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960 by 1997 the average american league game lasted 2:57 (national league games were about 10 minutes shorterpitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters) in 2004 major league baseball declared that its goal was an average game of merely 2:45 by 2014 though the average mlb game took over three hours to complete the lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials increased offense more pitching changes and a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery and batters stepping out of the box more frequently other leagues have experienced similar issues in 2008 nippon professional baseball took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's average of 3:18
=== individual focus ===
although baseball is a team sport individual players are often placed under scrutiny and pressure in 1915 a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch of which there are often more than two hundred in a game involves an individual one-on-one contest the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits contrasting the game with both football and basketball scholar michael mandelbaum argues that baseball is the one closest in evolutionary descent to the older individual sports pitcher batter and fielder all act essentially independent of each other while coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts if the batter hits a line drive the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing the statistical precision of baseball is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it as described by mandelbaum
it is impossible to isolate and objectively assess the contribution each [football] team member makes to the outcome of the play  [e]very basketball player is interacting with all of his teammates all the time in baseball by contrast every player is more or less on his own  baseball is therefore a realm of complete transparency and total responsibility a baseball player lives in a glass house and in a stark moral universe  everything that every player does is accounted for and everything accounted for is either good or bad right or wrong
cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more there is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play
=== uniqueness of each baseball park ===
unlike those of most sports baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape while the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams following the rules of major league and minor league baseball is that fields built or remodeled since june 1 1958 must have a minimum distance of 325 feet (99 m) from home plate to the fences in left and right field and 400 feet (122 m) to center major league teams often skirt even this rule for example at minute maid park which became the home of the houston astros in 2000 the crawford boxes in left field are only 315 feet (96 m) from home plate there are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield the most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at boston's fenway park in use since 1912 the green monster is 310 feet (94 m) from home plate down the line and 37 feet (11 m) tall
similarly there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground a fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner these variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run the surface of the field is also unregulated while the image to the left shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all mlb teams with naturally surfaced fields) teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare some fieldsincluding several in mlbuse an artificial surface such as astroturf surface variations can have a significant effect on how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning similarly the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played while football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized the area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does so variations in that regard are largely insignificant
these physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark other local factors such as altitude and climate can also significantly affect play a given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher's park or a hitter's park if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements the most exceptional park in this regard is coors field home of the colorado rockies its high altitude5,282 feet (1,610 m) above sea levelis responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues wrigley field home of the chicago cubs is known for its fickle disposition a hitter's park when the strong winds off lake michigan are blowing out it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in the absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out but the nature of team rosters and players statistical records for example hitting a fly ball 330 feet (100 m) into right field might result in an easy catch on the warning track at one park and a home run at another a team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field such as the new york yankees will tend to stock its roster with left-handed pull hitters who can best exploit it on the individual level a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over timeeven more so if his talents are especially suited to the park
== statistics ==
organized baseball lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes in the late 19th century a former cricket player english-born henry chadwick of brooklyn new york was responsible for the development of the box score tabular standings the annual baseball guide the batting average and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball. the statistical record is so central to the game's historical essence that chadwick came to be known as father baseball in the 1920s american newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics initiating what journalist and historian alan schwarz describes as a tectonic shift in sports as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines.
the official baseball rules administered by major league baseball require the official scorer to categorize each baseball play unambiguously the rules provide detailed criteria to promote consistency the score report is the official basis for both the box score of the game and the relevant statistical records general managers managers and baseball scouts use statistics to evaluate players and make strategic decisions
certain traditional statistics are familiar to most baseball fans the basic batting statistics include
at bats plate appearances excluding walks and hit by pitcheswhere the batter's ability is not fully testedand sacrifices and sacrifice flieswhere the batter intentionally makes an out in order to advance one or more baserunners
hits times reached base because of a batted fair ball without fielding error or fielder's choice
runs times circling the bases and reaching home safely
runs batted in (rbis) number of runners who scored due to a batter's action (including the batter in the case of a home run) except when batter grounded into double play or reached on an error
home runs hits on which the batter successfully touched all four bases without the contribution of a fielding error
batting average hits divided by at batsthe traditional measure of batting ability
the basic baserunning statistics include
stolen bases times advancing to the next base entirely due to the runner's own efforts generally while the pitcher is preparing to deliver or delivering the ball
caught stealing times tagged out while attempting to steal a base
the basic pitching statistics include
wins credited to pitcher on winning team who last pitched before the team took a lead that it never relinquished (a starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings to qualify for a win)
losses charged to pitcher on losing team who was pitching when the opposing team took a lead that it never relinquished
saves games where the pitcher enters a game led by the pitcher's team finishes the game without surrendering the lead is not the winning pitcher and either (a) the lead was three runs or less when the pitcher entered the game (b) the potential tying run was on base at bat or on deck or (c) the pitcher pitched three or more innings
innings pitched outs recorded while pitching divided by three
strikeouts times pitching three strikes to a batter
winning percentage wins divided by decisions (wins plus losses)
earned run average (era) runs allowed excluding those resulting from fielding errors per nine innings pitched
the basic fielding statistics include
putouts times the fielder catches a fly ball tags or forces out a runner or otherwise directly effects an out
assists times a putout by another fielder was recorded following the fielder touching the ball
errors times the fielder fails to make a play that should have been made with common effort and the batting team benefits as a result
total chances putouts plus assists plus errors
fielding average successful chances (putouts plus assists) divided by total chances
among the many other statistics that are kept are those collectively known as situational statistics for example statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against if a given situation statistically favors a certain batter the manager of the fielding team may be more likely to change pitchers or have the pitcher intentionally walk the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed
=== sabermetrics ===
sabermetrics refers to the field of baseball statistical study and the development of new statistics and analytical tools the term is also used to refer directly to new statistics themselves the term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents bill james and derives from the society for american baseball research (sabr)
the growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter's skill than batting average
on-base percentage measures a batter's ability to get on base it is calculated by taking the sum of the batter's successes in getting on base (hits plus walks plus hit by pitches) and dividing that by the batter's total plate appearances (at bats plus walks plus hit by pitches plus sacrifice flies) except for sacrifice bunts
slugging percentage measures a batter's ability to hit for power it is calculated by taking the batter's total bases (one per each single two per double three per triple and four per home run) and dividing that by the batter's at bats
some of the new statistics devised by sabermetricians have gained wide use
on-base plus slugging (ops) measures a batter's overall ability it is calculated by adding the batter's on-base percentage and slugging percentage
walks plus hits per inning pitched (whip) measures a pitcher's ability at preventing hitters from reaching base it is calculated exactly as its name suggests
== popularity and cultural impact ==
writing in 1919 philosopher morris raphael cohen described baseball as america's national religion in the words of sports columnist jayson stark baseball has long been a unique paragon of american culture"a status he sees as devastated by the steroid abuse scandal baseball has an important place in other national cultures as well scholar peter bjarkman describes how deeply the sport is ingrained in the history and culture of a nation such as cuba [and] how thoroughly it was radically reshaped and nativized in japan. since the early 1980s the dominican republic in particular the city of san pedro de macors has been the major leagues primary source of foreign talent hall-of-famer roberto clemente remains one of the greatest national heroes in puerto rico's history while baseball has long been the island's primary athletic pastime its once well-attended professional winter league has declined in popularity since 1990 when young puerto rican players began to be included in the major leagues annual first-year player draft in the western hemisphere baseball is also one of the leading sports in canada colombia mexico the netherlands antilles nicaragua panama and venezuela in asia it is among the most popular sports in japan south korea and taiwan
the major league game in the united states was originally targeted toward a middle-class white-collar audience relative to other spectator pastimes the national league's set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience a century later the situation was very different with the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket pricesfootball basketball and hockeyprofessional baseball had become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading american spectator sports
in the late 1900s and early 2000s baseball's position compared to football in the united states moved in contradictory directions in 2008 major league baseball set a revenue record of $6.5 billion matching the nfl's revenue for the first time in decades a new mlb revenue record of $6.6 billion was set in 2009 on the other hand the percentage of american sports fans polled who named baseball as their favorite sport was 16% compared to pro football at 31% in 1985 the respective figures were pro football 24% baseball 23% because there are so many more major league baseball games played there is no comparison in overall attendance in 2008 total attendance at major league games was the second-highest in history 78.6 million 0.7% off the record set the previous year the following year amid the u.s recession attendance fell by 6.6% to 73.4 million attendance at games held under the minor league baseball umbrella also set a record in 2007 with 42.8 million this figure does not include attendance at games of the several independent minor leagues
in japan where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport combined revenue for the twelve teams in nippon professional baseball (npb) the body that oversees both the central and pacific leagues was estimated at $1 billion in 2007 total npb attendance for the year was approximately 20 million while in the preceding two decades mlb attendance grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled the comparable npb figures were stagnant there are concerns that mlb's growing interest in acquiring star japanese players will hurt the game in their home country in cuba where baseball is by every reckoning the national sport the national team overshadows the city and provincial teams that play in the top-level domestic leagues revenue figures are not released for the country's amateur system similarly according to one official pronouncement the sport's governing authority has never taken into account attendance  because its greatest interest has always been the development of athletes
as of 2007 little league baseball oversees more than 7,000 children's baseball leagues with more than 2.2 million participants2.1 million in the united states and 123,000 in other countries babe ruth league teams have over 1 million participants according to the president of the international baseball federation between 300,000 and 500,000 women and girls play baseball around the world including little league and the introductory game of tee ball
a varsity baseball team is an established part of physical education departments at most high schools and colleges in the united states in 2008 nearly half a million high schoolers and over 35,000 collegians played on their schools baseball teams the number of americans participating in baseball has declined since the late 1980s falling well behind the number of soccer participants by early in the 20th century intercollegiate baseball was japan's leading sport today high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there the final rounds of the two annual tournamentsthe national high school baseball invitational tournament in the spring and the even more important national high school baseball championship in the summerare broadcast around the country the tournaments are known respectively as spring koshien and summer koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played in cuba baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education which begins at age six talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive trainingthe first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team
=== baseball in popular culture ===
baseball has had a broad impact on popular culture both in the united states and elsewhere dozens of english-language idioms have been derived from baseball in particular the game is the source of a number of widely used sexual euphemisms the first networked radio broadcasts in north america were of the 1922 world series famed sportswriter grantland rice announced play-by-play from new york city's polo grounds on wjznewark new jersey which was connected by wire to wgyschenectady new york and wbzspringfield massachusetts the baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the united states and japan but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular such as the united kingdom
baseball has inspired many works of art and entertainment one of the first major examples ernest thayer's poem casey at the bat appeared in 1888 a wry description of the failure of a star player in what would now be called a clutch situation the poem became the source of vaudeville and other staged performances audio recordings film adaptations and an opera as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media there have been many baseball movies including the academy awardwinning the pride of the yankees (1942) and the oscar nominees the natural (1984) and field of dreams (1989) the american film institute's selection of the ten best sports movies includes the pride of the yankees at number 3 and bull durham (1988) at number 5 baseball has provided thematic material for hits on both stagethe adlerross musical damn yankeesand recordgeorge j gaskin's slide kelly slide simon and garfunkel's mrs robinson and john fogerty's centerfield the baseball-founded comedic sketch who's on first popularized by abbott and costello in 1938 quickly became famous six decades later time named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century baseball is also featured in various video games including mlb the show wii sports kinect sports season 2 and mario baseball
literary works connected to the game include the short fiction of ring lardner and novels such as bernard malamud's the natural (the source for the movie) robert coover's the universal baseball association inc. j henry waugh prop. and w p kinsella's shoeless joe (the source for field of dreams) baseball's literary canon also includes the beat reportage of damon runyon the columns of grantland rice red smith dick young and peter gammons and the essays of roger angell among the celebrated nonfiction books in the field are lawrence s ritter's the glory of their times roger kahn's the boys of summer and michael lewis's moneyball the 1970 publication of major league pitcher jim bouton's tell-all chronicle ball four is considered a turning point in the reporting of professional sports
baseball has also inspired the creation of new cultural forms baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards a typical example would feature an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other in the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies the 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data baseball cardsmany of which are now prized collectiblesare the source of the much broader trading card industry involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields
modern fantasy sports began in 1980 with the invention of rotisserie league baseball by new york writer daniel okrent and several friends participants in a rotisserie league draft notional teams from the list of active major league baseball players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players latest real-world statistics rotisserie-style play quickly became a phenomenon now known more generically as fantasy baseball it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports the field boomed with increasing internet access and new fantasy sportsrelated websites by 2008 29.9 million people in the united states and canada were playing fantasy sports spending $800 million on the hobby the burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing attention paid to sabermetricsfirst among fans only later among baseball professionals
