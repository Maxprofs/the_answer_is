sponges animals phylum porifera prfr meaning pore bearer multicellular organisms bodies full pores channels allowing water circulate consisting jellylike mesohyl sandwiched two thin layers cells sponges unspecialized cells transform types often migrate main cell layers mesohyl process sponges nervous digestive circulatory systems instead rely maintaining constant water flow bodies obtain food oxygen remove wastes
overview
sponges similar animals multicellular heterotrophic lack cell walls produce sperm cells unlike animals lack true tissues organs body symmetry shapes bodies adapted maximal efficiency water flow central cavity deposits nutrients leaves hole called osculum many sponges internal skeletons spongin andor spicules calcium carbonate silicon dioxide sponges sessile aquatic animals although freshwater species great majority marine salt water species ranging tidal zones depths exceeding m mi
approximately known species feed bacteria food particles water host photosynthesizing microorganisms endosymbionts alliances often produce food oxygen consume species sponge live foodpoor environments become carnivores prey mainly small crustaceans
species use sexual reproduction releasing sperm cells water fertilize ova species released others retained mother fertilized eggs form larvae swim search places settle sponges known regenerating fragments broken although works fragments include right types cells species reproduce budding conditions deteriorate example temperatures drop many freshwater species marine ones produce gemmules survival pods unspecialized cells remain dormant conditions improve either form completely new sponges recolonize skeletons parents

distinguishing features
sponges constitute phylum porifera defined sessile metazoans multicelled immobile animals water intake outlet openings connected chambers lined choanocytes cells whiplike flagella however carnivorous sponges lost water flow systems choanocytes known living sponges remold bodies types cells move within bodies change one type another
like cnidarians jellyfish etc ctenophores comb jellies unlike known metazoans sponges bodies consist nonliving jellylike mass sandwiched two main layers cells cnidarians ctenophores simple nervous systems cell layers bound internal connections mounted basement membrane thin fibrous mat also known basal lamina sponges nervous systems middle jellylike layers large varied populations cells types cells outer layers may move middle layer change functions
basic structure
cell types
sponges body hollow held shape mesohyl jellylike substance made mainly collagen reinforced dense network fibers also made collagen inner surface covered choanocytes cells cylindrical conical collars surrounding one flagellum per choanocyte wavelike motion whiplike flagella drives water sponges body sponges ostia channels leading interior mesohyl sponges controlled tubelike porocytes form closable inlet valves pinacocytes platelike cells form singlelayered external skin parts mesohyl covered choanocytes pinacocytes also digest food particles large enter ostia base animal responsible anchoring
types cell live move within mesohyl
lophocytes amoebalike cells move slowly mesohyl secrete collagen fibres
collencytes another type collagenproducing cell
rhabdiferous cells secrete polysaccharides also form part mesohyl
oocytes spermatocytes reproductive cells
sclerocytes secrete mineralized spicules little spines form skeletons many sponges species provide defense predators
addition instead sclerocytes demosponges spongocytes secrete form collagen polymerizes spongin thick fibrous material stiffens mesohyl
myocytes muscle cells conduct signals cause parts animal contract
grey cells act sponges equivalent immune system
archaeocytes amoebocytes amoebalike cells totipotent words capable transformation type cell also important roles feeding clearing debris block ostia
glass sponges syncytia
glass sponges present distinctive variation basic plan spicules made silica form scaffoldinglike framework whose rods living tissue suspended like cobweb contains cell types tissue syncytium ways behaves like many cells share single external membrane others like single cell multiple nuclei mesohyl absent minimal syncytiums cytoplasm soupy fluid fills interiors cells organized rivers transport nuclei organelles organs within cells substances instead choanocytes syncytia known choanosyncytia form bellshaped chambers water enters via perforations insides chambers lined collar bodies consisting collar flagellum without nucleus motion flagella sucks water passages cobweb expels via open ends bellshaped chambers
types cells single nucleus membrane connected singlenucleus cells main syncytium bridges made cytoplasm sclerocytes build spicules multiple nuclei glass sponge larvae connected tissues cytoplasm bridges connections sclerocytes far found adults may simply reflect difficulty investigating smallscale features bridges controlled plugged junctions apparently permit substances pass blocking others
water flow body structures
sponges work rather like chimneys take water bottom eject osculum little mouth top since ambient currents faster top suction effect produce bernoullis principle work free sponges control water flow various combinations wholly partially closing osculum ostia intake pores varying beat flagella may shut lot sand silt water
although layers pinacocytes choanocytes resemble epithelia complex animals bound tightly celltocell connections basal lamina thin fibrous sheet underneath flexibility layers remodeling mesohyl lophocytes allow animals adjust shapes throughout lives take maximum advantage local water currents
simplest body structure sponges tube vase shape known asconoid severely limits size animal body structure characterized stalklike spongocoel surrounded single layer choanocytes simply scaled ratio volume surface area increases surface increases square length width volume increases proportionally cube amount tissue needs food oxygen determined volume pumping capacity supplies food oxygen depends area covered choanocytes asconoid sponges seldom exceed mm diameter
sponges overcome limitation adopting syconoid structure body wall pleated inner pockets pleats lined choanocytes connect outer pockets pleats ostia increase number choanocytes hence pumping capacity enables syconoid sponges grow centimeters diameter
leuconoid pattern boosts pumping capacity filling interior almost completely mesohyl contains network chambers lined choanocytes connected water intakes outlet tubes leuconid sponges grow m ft diameter fact growth direction increases number choanocyte chambers enables take wider range forms example encrusting sponges whose shapes follow surfaces attach freshwater shallowwater marine sponges leuconid bodies networks water passages glass sponges similar leuconid structure three types structure crosssection area choanocytelined regions much greater intake outlet channels makes flow slower near choanocytes thus makes easier trap food particles example leuconia small leuconoid sponge centimetres tall centimetre diameter water enters intake canals cm per minute however leuconia million flagellated chambers whose combined diameter much greater canals water flow chambers slows cm per hour making easy choanocytes capture food water expelled single osculum cm per second fast enough carry waste products distance away
skeleton
zoology skeleton fairly rigid structure animal irrespective whether joints irrespective whether biomineralized mesohyl functions endoskeleton sponges skeleton soft sponges encrust hard surfaces rocks commonly mesohyl stiffened mineral spicules spongin fibers spicules may made silica calcium carbonate vary shape simple rods threedimensional stars six rays spicules produced sclerocyte cells may separate connected joints fused
sponges also secrete exoskeletons lie completely outside organic components example sclerosponges hard sponges massive calcium carbonate exoskeletons organic matter forms thin layer choanocyte chambers pits mineral exoskeletons secreted pinacocytes form animals skins
classes
sponges traditionally distributed three classes calcareous sponges calcarea glass sponges hexactinellida demosponges demospongiae however studies shown homoscleromorpha group thought belong demospongiae actually phylogenetically well separated therefore recently recognized fourth class sponges
sponges divided classes mainly according composition skeletons
vital functions
movement
although adult sponges fundamentally sessile animals marine freshwater species move across sea bed speeds mm per day result amoebalike movements pinacocytes cells species contract whole bodies many close oscula ostia juveniles drift swim freely adults stationary
respiration feeding excretion
sponges distinct circulatory respiratory digestive excretory systems instead water flow system supports functions filter food particles water flowing particles larger micrometers cannot enter ostia pinacocytes consume phagocytosis engulfing internal digestion particles m m trapped ostia taper outer inner ends particles consumed pinacocytes archaeocytes partially extrude walls ostia bacteriasized particles micrometers pass ostia caught consumed choanocytes since smallest particles far common choanocytes typically capture sponges food supply archaeocytes transport food packaged vesicles cells directly digest food least one species sponge internal fibers function tracks use nutrientcarrying archaeocytes tracks also move inert objects
used claimed glass sponges could live nutrients dissolved sea water averse silt however study found evidence concluded extract bacteria microorganisms water efficiently process suspended sediment grains extract prey collar bodies digest food distribute wrapped vesicles transported dynein motor molecules along bundles microtubules run throughout syncytium
sponges cells absorb oxygen diffusion water cells water flows body carbon dioxide soluble waste products ammonia also diffuse archeocytes remove mineral particles threaten block ostia transport mesohyl generally dump outgoing water current although species incorporate skeletons
carnivorous sponges
species live waters supply food particles poor prey crustaceans small animals far species discovered belong family cladorhizidae members guitarridae esperiopsidae also carnivores cases little known actually capture prey although species thought use either sticky threads hooked spicules carnivorous sponges live deep waters m mi development deepocean exploration techniques expected lead discovery several however one species found mediterranean caves depths m ft alongside usual filter feeding sponges cavedwelling predators capture crustaceans mm long entangling fine threads digest enveloping threads course days return normal shape evidence use venom
known carnivorous sponges completely lost water flow system choanocytes however genus chondrocladia uses highly modified water flow system inflate balloonlike structures used capturing prey
endosymbionts
freshwater sponges often host green algae endosymbionts within archaeocytes cells benefit nutrients produced algae many marine species host photosynthesizing organisms commonly cyanobacteria cases dinoflagellates symbiotic cyanobacteria may form third total mass living tissue sponges sponges gain energy supply microorganisms university stuttgart team reported spicules made silica conduct light mesohyl photosynthesizing endosymbionts live sponges host photosynthesizing organisms common waters relatively poor supplies food particles often leafy shapes maximize amount sunlight collect
recently discovered carnivorous sponge lives near hydrothermal vents hosts methaneeating bacteria digests
immune system
sponges complex immune systems animals however reject grafts species accept members species marine species gray cells play leading role rejection foreign material invaded produce chemical stops movement cells affected area thus preventing intruder using sponges internal transport systems intrusion persists grey cells concentrate area release toxins kill cells area immune system stay activated state three weeks
reproduction
asexual
sponges three asexual methods reproduction fragmentation budding producing gemmules fragments sponges may detached currents waves use mobility pinacocytes choanocytes reshaping mesohyl reattach suitable surface rebuild small functional sponges course several days capabilities enable sponges squeezed fine cloth regenerate sponge fragment regenerate contains collencytes produce mesohyl archeocytes produce cell types species reproduce budding
gemmules survival pods marine sponges many freshwater species produce thousands dying mainly freshwater species regularly produce autumn spongocytes make gemmules wrapping shells spongin often reinforced spicules round clusters archeocytes full nutrients freshwater gemmules may also include phytosynthesizing symbionts gemmules become dormant state survive cold drying lack oxygen extreme variations salinity freshwater gemmules often revive temperature drops stays cold months reaches nearnormal level gemmule germinates archeocytes round outside cluster transform pinacocytes membrane pore shell bursts cluster cells slowly emerges remaining archeocytes transform cell types needed make functioning sponge gemmules species different individuals join forces form one sponge gemmules retained within parent sponge spring difficult tell whether old sponge revived recolonized gemmules
sexual
sponges hermaphrodites function sexes simultaneously although sponges gonads reproductive organs sperm produced choanocytes entire choanocyte chambers sink mesohyl form spermatic cysts eggs formed transformation archeocytes choanocytes species egg generally acquires yolk consuming nurse cells spawning sperm burst cysts expelled via osculum contact another sponge species water flow carries choanocytes engulf instead digesting metamorphose ameboid form carry sperm mesohyl eggs cases engulf carrier cargo
species release fertilized eggs water retain eggs hatch four types larvae balls cells outer layer cells whose flagellae cilia enable larvae move swimming days larvae sink crawl find place settle cells transform archeocytes types appropriate locations miniature adult sponge
glass sponge embryos start dividing separate cells cells formed rapidly transform larvae externally ovoid band cilia round middle use movement internally typical glass sponge structure spicules cobweblike main syncitium draped around choanosyncytia multiple collar bodies center larvae leave parents bodies
life cycle
sponges temperate regions live years tropical species perhaps deepocean ones may live years calcified demosponges grow mm per year rate constant specimens m ft wide must years old sponges start sexual reproduction weeks old others wait several years old
coordination activities
adult sponges lack neurons kind nervous tissue however species ability perform movements coordinated bodies mainly contractions pinacocytes squeezing water channels thus expelling excess sediment substances may cause blockages species contract osculum independently rest body sponges may also contract order reduce area vulnerable attack predators cases two sponges fused example large still unseparated bud contraction waves slowly become coordinated siamese twins coordinating mechanism unknown may involve chemicals similar neurotransmitters however glass sponges rapidly transmit electrical impulses parts syncytium use halt motion flagella incoming water contains toxins excessive sediment myocytes thought responsible closing osculum transmitting signals different parts body
sponges contain genes similar contain recipe postsynaptic density important signalreceiving structure neurons animals however sponges genes activated flask cells appear larvae may provide sensory capability larvae swimming raises questions whether flask cells represent predecessors true neurons evidence sponges ancestors true neurons lost adapted sessile lifestyle
ecology
habitats
sponges worldwide distribution living wide range ocean habitats polar regions tropics live quiet clear waters sediment stirred waves currents would block pores making difficult feed breathe greatest numbers sponges usually found firm surfaces rocks sponges attach soft sediment means rootlike base
sponges abundant less diverse temperate waters tropical waters possibly organisms prey sponges abundant tropical waters glass sponges common polar waters depths temperate tropical seas porous construction enables extract food resourcepoor waters minimum effort demosponges calcareous sponges abundant diverse shallower nonpolar waters
different classes sponge live different ranges habitat
primary producers
sponges photosynthesizing endosymbionts produce three times oxygen consume well organic matter consume contributions habitats resources significant along australias great barrier reef relatively minor caribbean
defenses
many sponges shed sponge spicules forming dense carpet several meters deep keeps away echinoderms would otherwise prey sponges also produce toxins prevent sessile organisms bryozoans sea squirts growing near making sponges effective competitors living space one many examples includes ageliferin
species caribbean fire sponge tedania ignis cause severe rash humans handle turtles fish feed mainly sponges often said sponges produce chemical defenses predators however experiment showed relationship toxicity chemicals produced sponges taste fish would diminish usefulness chemical defenses deterrents predation fish may even help spread sponges detaching fragments
glass sponges produce toxic chemicals live deep water predators rare
predation
sponge flies also known spongillaflies neuroptera sisyridae specialist predators freshwater sponges female lays eggs vegetation overhanging water larvae hatch drop water seek sponges feed use elongated mouthparts pierce sponge suck fluids within larvae species cling surface sponge others take refuge sponges internal cavities fully grown larvae leave water spin cocoon pupate
bioerosion
caribbean chickenliver sponge chondrilla nucula secretes toxins kill coral polyps allowing sponges grow coral skeletons others especially family clionaidae use corrosive substances secreted archeocytes tunnel rocks corals shells dead mollusks sponges may remove m ft per year reefs creating visible notches lowtide level
diseases
caribbean sponges genus aplysina suffer aplysina red band syndrome causes aplysina develop one rustcolored bands sometimes adjacent bands necrotic tissue lesions may completely encircle branches sponge disease appears contagious impacts approximately percent cauliformis bahamian reefs rustcolored bands caused cyanobacterium unknown whether organism actually causes disease
collaboration organisms
addition hosting photosynthesizing endosymbionts sponges noted wide range collaborations organisms relatively large encrusting sponge lissodendoryx colombiensis common rocky surfaces extended range seagrass meadows letting surrounded overgrown seagrass sponges distasteful local starfish therefore protect lissodendoryx return seagrass sponges get higher positions away seafloor sediment
shrimps genus synalpheus form colonies sponges shrimp species inhabits different sponge species making synalpheus one diverse crustacean genera specifically synalpheus regalis utilizes sponge food source also defense shrimp predators many individuals inhabit single loggerhead sponge feeding larger particles collect sponge filters ocean feed
