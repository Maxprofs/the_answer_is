concepts
irreducible complexity
term irreducible complexity introduced biochemist michael behe book darwins black box though already described concept contributions revised edition pandas people behe defines single system composed several wellmatched interacting parts contribute basic function wherein removal one parts causes system effectively cease functioning
behe uses analogy mousetrap illustrate concept mousetrap consists several interacting piecesthe base catch spring hammerall must place mousetrap work removal one piece destroys function mousetrap intelligent design advocates assert natural selection could create irreducibly complex systems selectable function present parts assembled behe argued irreducibly complex biological mechanisms include bacterial flagellum e coli blood clotting cascade cilia adaptive immune system
critics point irreducible complexity argument assumes necessary parts system always necessary therefore could added sequentially argue something first merely advantageous later become necessary components change furthermore argue evolution often proceeds altering preexisting parts removing system rather adding sometimes called scaffolding objection analogy scaffolding support irreducibly complex building complete able stand behe acknowledged using sloppy prose argument darwinism add logical proof irreducible complexity remained popular argument among advocates intelligent design dover trial court held professor behes claim irreducible complexity refuted peerreviewed research papers rejected scientific community large
specified complexity
charles b thaxton physical chemist creationist used term specified complexity information theory claiming messages transmitted dna cell specified intelligence must originated intelligent agent intelligent design concept specified complexity developed mathematician philosopher theologian william dembski dembski states something exhibits specified complexity ie complex specified simultaneously one infer produced intelligent cause ie designed rather result natural processes provides following examples single letter alphabet specified without complex long sentence random letters complex without specified shakespearean sonnet complex specified states details living things similarly characterized especially patterns molecular sequences functional biological molecules dna
dembski defines complex specified information csi anything less chance occurring natural chance critics say renders argument tautology complex specified information cannot occur naturally dembski defined thus real question becomes whether csi actually exists nature
conceptual soundness dembskis specified complexitycsi argument discredited scientific mathematical communities specified complexity yet shown wide applications fields dembski asserts john wilkins wesley r elsberry characterize dembskis explanatory filter eliminative eliminates explanations sequentially first regularity chance finally defaulting design argue procedure flawed model scientific inference asymmetric way treats different possible explanations renders prone making false conclusions
richard dawkins another critic intelligent design argues god delusion allowing intelligent designer account unlikely complexity postpones problem designer would need least complex scientists argued evolution selection better able explain observed complexity evident use selective evolution design certain electronic aeronautic automotive systems considered problems complex human intelligent designers
finetuned universe
intelligent design proponents also occasionally appealed broader teleological arguments outside biology notably argument based finetuning universal constants make matter life possible argued solely attributable chance include values fundamental physical constants relative strength nuclear forces electromagnetism gravity fundamental particles well ratios masses particles intelligent design proponent center science culture fellow guillermo gonzalez argues values even slightly different universe would dramatically different making impossible many chemical elements features universe galaxies form thus proponents argue intelligent designer life needed ensure requisite features present achieve particular outcome
scientists generally responded arguments poorly supported existing evidence victor j stenger critics say intelligent design weak form anthropic principle essentially tautology view arguments amount claim life able exist universe able support life claim improbability lifesupporting universe also criticized argument lack imagination assuming forms life possible life know might exist things different different sort life might exist place number critics also suggest many stated variables appear interconnected calculations made mathematicians physicists suggest emergence universe similar quite probable
intelligent designer
contemporary intelligent design movement formulates arguments secular terms intentionally avoids identifying intelligent agent agents posit although state god designer designer often implicitly hypothesized intervened way god could intervene dembski design inference speculates alien culture could fulfill requirements pandas people proposes seti illustrates appeal intelligent design science philosopher science robert pennock suggested ralian ufo religion reallife example extraterrestrial intelligent designer view makes many bad arguments evolutionary theory creationists authoritative description intelligent design however explicitly states universe displays features designed acknowledging paradox dembski concludes intelligent agent strictly physical could presided origin universe origin life leading proponents made statements supporters believe designer christian god exclusion religions
beyond debate whether intelligent design scientific number critics argue existing evidence makes design hypothesis appear unlikely irrespective status world science example jerry coyne asks designer would give us pathway making vitamin c destroy disabling one enzymes see pseudogene designer would stock oceanic islands reptiles mammals amphibians freshwater fish despite suitability islands species coyne also points fact flora fauna islands resemble nearest mainland even environments different evidence species placed designer previously darwins black box behe argued simply incapable understanding designers motives questions cannot answered definitively odd designs could example placed designer reasonfor artistic reasons variety show asyetundetected practical purpose unguessable reasonor might coyne responds light evidence either life resulted intelligent design evolution intelligent designer cosmic prankster designed everything make look though evolved
intelligent design proponents paul nelson avoid problem poor design nature insisting simply failed understand perfection design behe cites paley inspiration differs paleys expectation perfect creation proposes designers necessarily produce best design behe suggests like parent wanting spoil child extravagant toys designer multiple motives giving priority excellence engineering says another problem argument imperfection critically depends psychoanalysis unidentified designer yet reasons designer would would anything virtually impossible know unless designer tells specifically reasons reliance inexplicable motives designer makes intelligent design scientifically untestable retired uc berkeley law professor author intelligent design advocate phillip e johnson puts forward core definition designer creates purpose giving example view aids created punish immorality caused hiv motives cannot tested scientific methods
asserting need designer complexity also raises question designed designer intelligent design proponents say question irrelevant outside scope intelligent design richard wein counters scientific explanations often create new unanswered questions assessing value explanation questions irrelevant must balanced improvements understanding explanation provides invoking unexplained explain origin beings little questionbegging new question raised explanation problematic question explanation purports answer richard dawkins sees assertion designer need explained thoughtterminating clich absence observable measurable evidence question designed designer leads infinite regression intelligent design proponents escape resorting religious creationism logical contradiction
movement
intelligent design movement direct outgrowth creationism scientific academic communities along us federal court view intelligent design either form creationism direct descendant closely intertwined traditional creationism several authors explicitly refer intelligent design creationism
movement headquartered center science culture established creationist wing discovery institute promote religious agenda calling broad social academic political changes discovery institutes intelligent design campaigns staged primarily united states although efforts made countries promote intelligent design leaders movement say intelligent design exposes limitations scientific orthodoxy secular philosophy naturalism intelligent design proponents allege science limited naturalism demand adoption naturalistic philosophy dismisses outofhand explanation includes supernatural cause overall goal movement reverse stifling dominance materialist worldview represented theory evolution favor science consonant christian theistic convictions

religion leading proponents
although arguments intelligent design intelligent design movement formulated secular terms intentionally avoid positing identity designer majority principal intelligent design advocates publicly religious christians stated view designer proposed intelligent design christian conception god stuart burgess phillip e johnson william dembski stephen c meyer evangelical protestants michael behe roman catholic jonathan wells member unification church nonchristian proponents include david klinghoffer jewish michael denton david berlinski agnostic muzaffar iqbal pakistanicanadian muslim phillip e johnson stated cultivating ambiguity employing secular language arguments carefully crafted avoid overtones theistic creationism necessary first step ultimately reintroducing christian concept god designer johnson explicitly calls intelligent design proponents obfuscate religious motivations avoid intelligent design identified another way packaging christian evangelical message johnson emphasizes first thing done get bible discussion say biblical issues unimportant point rather time address separated materialist prejudice scientific fact

arguments ignorance
eugenie c scott along glenn branch critics argued many points raised intelligent design proponents arguments ignorance argument ignorance lack evidence one view erroneously argued constitute proof correctness another view scott branch say intelligent design argument ignorance relies lack knowledge conclusion lacking natural explanation certain specific aspects evolution assume intelligent cause contend scientists would reply unexplained unexplainable dont know yet appropriate response invoking cause outside science particularly michael behes demands ever detailed explanations historical evolution molecular systems seem assume false dichotomy either evolution design proper explanation perceived failure evolution becomes victory design scott branch also contend supposedly novel contributions proposed intelligent design proponents served basis productive scientific research

possible theological implications
intelligent design proponents often insist claims require religious component however various philosophical theological issues naturally raised claims intelligent design
intelligent design proponents attempt demonstrate scientifically features irreducible complexity specified complexity could arise natural processes therefore required repeated direct miraculous interventions designer often christian concept god reject possibility designer works merely setting natural laws motion outset contrast theistic evolution even charles darwin open intelligent design distinct asserts repeated miraculous interventions addition designed laws contrasts major religious traditions created world gods interactions influences work way physical causes roman catholic tradition makes careful distinction ultimate metaphysical explanations secondary natural causes
concept direct miraculous intervention raises potential theological implications designer intervene alleviate suffering even though capable intervening reasons imply designer omnibenevolent see problem evil related theodicy
repeated interventions imply original design perfect final thus pose problem believe creators work perfect final intelligent design proponents seek explain problem poor design nature insisting simply failed understand perfection design example proposing vestigial organs unknown purposes proposing designers necessarily produce best design may unknowable motives actions
god gaps
intelligent design also characterized godofthegaps argument following form
gap scientific knowledge
gap filled acts god intelligent designer therefore proves existence god intelligent designer
godofthegaps argument theological version argument ignorance key feature type argument merely answers outstanding questions explanations often supernatural unverifiable ultimately subject unanswerable questions historians science observe astronomy earliest civilizations although astonishing incorporating mathematical constructions far excess practical value proved misdirected little importance development science failed inquire carefully mechanisms drove heavenly bodies across sky greek civilization first practiced science although yet mathematically oriented experimental science nevertheless attempt rationalize world natural experience without recourse divine intervention historically motivated definition science appeal intelligent creator explicitly excluded paralysing effect may scientific progress
