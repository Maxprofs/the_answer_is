process
overall process involves making conjectures hypotheses deriving predictions logical consequences carrying experiments based predictions determine whether original conjecture correct difficulties formulaic statement method however though scientific method often presented fixed sequence steps better considered general principles steps take place every scientific inquiry degree always order noted william whewell invention sagacity genius required every step
formulation question
question refer explanation specific observation sky blue also openended design drug cure particular disease stage frequently involves looking evaluating evidence previous experiments personal scientific observations assertions andor work scientists answer already known different question builds previous evidence posed applying scientific method scientific research determining good question difficult affects final outcome investigation
hypothesis
hypothesis conjecture based knowledge obtained formulating question may explain observed behavior part universe hypothesis might specific eg einsteins equivalence principle francis cricks dna makes rna makes protein might broad eg unknown species life dwell unexplored depths oceans statistical hypothesis conjecture population example population might people particular disease conjecture might new drug cure disease people terms commonly associated statistical hypotheses null hypothesis alternative hypothesis null hypothesis conjecture statistical hypothesis false eg new drug nothing cures due chance effects researchers normally want show null hypothesis false alternative hypothesis desired outcome eg drug better chance final point scientific hypothesis must falsifiable meaning one identify possible outcome experiment conflicts predictions deduced hypothesis otherwise cannot meaningfully tested
prediction
step involves determining logical consequences hypothesis one predictions selected testing unlikely prediction would correct simply coincidence convincing would prediction fulfilled evidence also stronger answer prediction already known due effects hindsight bias see also postdiction ideally prediction must also distinguish hypothesis likely alternatives two hypotheses make prediction observing prediction correct evidence either one statements relative strength evidence mathematically derived using bayes theorem
testing
investigation whether real world behaves predicted hypothesis scientists people test hypotheses conducting experiments purpose experiment determine whether observations real world agree conflict predictions derived hypothesis agree confidence hypothesis increases otherwise decreases agreement assure hypothesis true future experiments may reveal problems karl popper advised scientists try falsify hypotheses ie search test experiments seem doubtful large numbers successful confirmations convincing arise experiments avoid risk experiments designed minimize possible errors especially use appropriate scientific controls example tests medical treatments commonly run doubleblind tests test personnel might unwittingly reveal test subjects samples desired test drugs placebos kept ignorant hints bias responses test subjects furthermore failure experiment necessarily mean hypothesis false experiments always depend several hypotheses eg test equipment working properly failure may failure one auxiliary hypotheses see duhemquine thesis experiments conducted college lab kitchen table cerns large hadron collider bottom ocean mars using one working rovers astronomers experiments searching planets around distant stars finally individual experiments address highly specific topics reasons practicality result evidence broader topics usually accumulated gradually
analysis
involves determining results experiment show deciding next actions take predictions hypothesis compared null hypothesis determine better able explain data cases experiment repeated many times statistical analysis chisquared test may required evidence falsified hypothesis new hypothesis required experiment supports hypothesis evidence strong enough high confidence predictions hypothesis must tested hypothesis strongly supported evidence new question asked provide insight topic evidence scientists experience frequently incorporated stage process depending complexity experiment many iterations may required gather sufficient evidence answer question confidence build many answers highly specific questions order answer single broader question
dna example
discovery became starting point many studies involving genetic material field molecular genetics awarded nobel prize step example examined detail later article
components
scientific method also includes components required even iterations steps completed
replication
experiment cannot repeated produce results implies original results might error result common single experiment performed multiple times especially uncontrolled variables indications experimental error significant surprising results scientists may also attempt replicate results especially results would important work
external review
process peer review involves evaluation experiment experts typically give opinions anonymously journals request experimenter provide lists possible peer reviewers especially field highly specialized peer review certify correctness results opinion reviewer experiments sound based description supplied experimenter work passes peer review occasionally may require new experiments requested reviewers published peerreviewed scientific journal specific journal publishes results indicates perceived quality work
data recording sharing
scientists typically careful recording data requirement promoted ludwik fleck others though typically required might requested supply data scientists wish replicate original results parts original results extending sharing experimental samples may difficult obtain
scientific inquiry
scientific inquiry generally aims obtain knowledge form testable explanations used predict results future experiments allows scientists gain better understanding topic studied later able use understanding intervene causal mechanisms cure disease better explanation making predictions useful frequently likely continue explaining body evidence better alternatives successful explanations explain make accurate predictions wide range circumstances often called scientific theories
experimental results produce large changes human understanding improvements theoretical scientific understanding typically result gradual process development time sometimes across different domains science scientific models vary extent experimentally tested long acceptance scientific community general explanations become accepted time evidence accumulates given topic explanation question powerful alternatives explaining evidence often explanations altered time explanations combined produce new explanations
properties scientific inquiry
scientific knowledge closely tied empirical findings remain subject falsification new experimental observation incompatible found theory ever considered final since new problematic evidence might discovered evidence found new theory may proposed commonly found modifications previous theory sufficient explain new evidence strength theory argued related long persisted without major alteration core principles
theories also subject subsumption theories example thousands years scientific observations planets explained almost perfectly newtons laws however laws determined special cases general theory relativity explained previously unexplained exceptions newtons laws predicting explaining observations deflection light gravity thus certain cases independent unconnected scientific observations connected unified principles increasing explanatory power
since new theories might comprehensive preceded thus able explain previous ones successor theories might able meet higher standard explaining larger body observations predecessors example theory evolution explains diversity life earth species adapt environments many patterns observed natural world recent major modification unification genetics form modern evolutionary synthesis subsequent modifications also subsumed aspects many fields biochemistry molecular biology
beliefs biases
scientific methodology often directs hypotheses tested controlled conditions wherever possible frequently possible certain areas biological sciences difficult areas astronomy practice experimental control reproducibility effect diminishing potentially harmful effects circumstance degree personal bias example preexisting beliefs alter interpretation results confirmation bias heuristic leads person particular belief see things reinforcing belief even another observer might disagree words people tend observe expect observe
historical example belief legs galloping horse splayed point none horses legs touches ground point image included paintings supporters however first stopaction pictures horses gallop eadweard muybridge showed false legs instead gathered together another important human bias plays role preference new surprising statements see appeal novelty result search evidence new true contrast standard scientific method poorly attested beliefs believed acted upon via less rigorous heuristic sometimes taking advantage narrative fallacy narrative constructed elements become easier believe sometimes elements assumed priori contain logical methodological flaw process ultimately produced
elements scientific method
different ways outlining basic method used scientific inquiry scientific community philosophers science generally agree following classification method components methodological elements organization procedures tend characteristic natural sciences social sciences nonetheless cycle formulating hypotheses testing analyzing results formulating new hypotheses resemble cycle described
four essential elements scientific method iterations recursions interleavings orderings following

characterizations
scientific method depends upon increasingly sophisticated characterizations subjects investigation subjects also called unsolved problems unknowns example benjamin franklin conjectured correctly st elmos fire electrical nature taken long series experiments theoretical changes establish seeking pertinent properties subjects careful thought may also entail definitions observations observations often demand careful measurements andor counting
systematic careful collection measurements counts relevant quantities often critical difference pseudosciences alchemy science chemistry biology scientific measurements usually tabulated graphed mapped statistical manipulations correlation regression performed measurements might made controlled setting laboratory made less inaccessible unmanipulatable objects stars human populations measurements often require specialized scientific instruments thermometers spectroscopes particle accelerators voltmeters progress scientific field usually intimately tied invention improvement
uncertainty
measurements scientific work also usually accompanied estimates uncertainty uncertainty often estimated making repeated measurements desired quantity uncertainties may also calculated consideration uncertainties individual underlying quantities used counts things number people nation particular time may also uncertainty due data collection limitations counts may represent sample desired quantities uncertainty depends upon sampling method used number samples taken
definition
measurements demand use operational definitions relevant quantities scientific quantity described defined measured opposed vague inexact idealized definition example electric current measured amperes may operationally defined terms mass silver deposited certain time electrode electrochemical device described detail operational definition thing often relies comparisons standards operational definition mass ultimately relies use artifact particular kilogram platinumiridium kept laboratory france
scientific definition term sometimes differs substantially natural language usage example mass weight overlap meaning common discourse distinct meanings mechanics scientific quantities often characterized units measure later described terms conventional physical units communicating work
new theories sometimes developed realizing certain terms previously sufficiently clearly defined example albert einsteins first paper relativity begins defining simultaneity means determining length ideas skipped isaac newton define time space place motion well known einsteins paper demonstrates viz absolute time length independent motion approximations francis crick cautions us characterizing subject however premature define something remains illunderstood cricks study consciousness actually found easier study awareness visual system rather study free example cautionary example gene gene much poorly understood watson cricks pioneering discovery structure dna would counterproductive spend much time definition gene

hypothesis development
hypothesis suggested explanation phenomenon alternately reasoned proposal suggesting possible correlation among set phenomena
normally hypotheses form mathematical model sometimes always also formulated existential statements stating particular instance phenomenon studied characteristic causal explanations general form universal statements stating every instance phenomenon particular characteristic
scientists free use whatever resources creativity ideas fields induction bayesian inference imagine possible explanations phenomenon study charles sanders peirce borrowing page aristotle prior analytics described incipient stages inquiry instigated irritation doubt venture plausible guess abductive reasoning history science filled stories scientists claiming flash inspiration hunch motivated look evidence support refute idea michael polanyi made creativity centerpiece discussion methodology
william glen observes

predictions hypothesis
useful hypothesis enable predictions reasoning including deductive reasoning might predict outcome experiment laboratory setting observation phenomenon nature prediction also statistical deal probabilities
essential outcome testing prediction currently unknown case successful outcome increase probability hypothesis true outcome already known called consequence already considered formulating hypothesis
predictions accessible observation experience hypothesis yet testable remain extent unscientific strict sense new technology theory might make necessary experiments feasible thus much scientifically based speculation might convince one many hypothesis intelligent species exist true since experiment known test hypothesis science little say possibility future new technique might lead experimental test speculation would become part accepted science
dnapredictions

another example general relativity
einsteins theory general relativity makes several specific predictions observable structure spacetime light bends gravitational field amount bending depends precise way strength gravitational field arthur eddingtons observations made solar eclipse supported general relativity rather newtonian gravitation
experiments

classical model
classical model scientific inquiry derives aristotle distinguished forms approximate exact reasoning set threefold scheme abductive deductive inductive inference also treated compound forms reasoning analogy
pragmatic model
charles sanders peirce prs like purse characterized inquiry general pursuit truth per se struggle move irritating inhibitory doubts born surprises disagreements like reach secure belief belief one prepared act framed scientific inquiry part broader spectrum spurred like inquiry generally actual doubt mere verbal hyperbolic doubt held fruitless outlined four methods settling opinion ordered least successful
method tenacity policy sticking initial belief brings comforts decisiveness leads trying ignore contrary information others views truth intrinsically private public goes social impulse easily falters since one may well notice anothers opinion good ones initial opinion successes shine tend transitory
method authority overcomes disagreements sometimes brutally successes majestic longlived cannot operate thoroughly enough suppress doubts indefinitely especially people learn societies present past
method priori promotes conformity less brutally fosters opinions something like tastes arising conversation comparisons perspectives terms agreeable reason thereby depends fashion paradigms goes circles time intellectual respectable like first two methods sustains accidental capricious beliefs destining minds doubt
scientific method method wherein inquiry regards fallible purposely tests criticizes corrects improves
peirce held slow stumbling ratiocination dangerously inferior instinct traditional sentiment practical matters scientific method best suited theoretical research turn trammeled methods practical ends reasons first rule order learn one must desire learn corollary must block way inquiry scientific method excels others deliberately designed arrive eventually secure beliefs upon successful practices based starting idea people seek truth per se instead subdue irritating inhibitory doubt peirce showed struggle come submit truth sake beliefs integrity seek truth guidance potential practice correctly given goal wed scientific method
peirce rational inquiry implies presuppositions truth real reason presuppose least hope principle reasoners selfregulation real discoverable independent vagaries opinion vein defined truth correspondence sign particular proposition object pragmatically actual consensus definite finite community inquire would poll experts instead final opinion investigators would reach sooner later still inevitably push investigation far enough even start different points tandem defined real true signs object object possibility quality actuality brute fact necessity norm law independently finite communitys opinion pragmatically depends final opinion destined sufficient investigation destination far near truth given finite community thus theory inquiry boils science conceptions truth real involve idea community without definite limits thus potentially selfcorrecting far needed capable definite increase knowledge inference logic rooted social principle since depends standpoint sense unlimited
paying special attention generation explanations peirce outlined scientific method coordination three kinds inference purposeful cycle aimed settling doubts follows iiiiv neglected argument except otherwise noted

deduction two stages
explication unclearly premissed deductive analysis hypothesis order render parts clear possible
demonstration deductive argumentation euclidean procedure explicit deduction hypothesiss consequences predictions induction test evidence found corollarial needed theorematic
induction longrun validity rule induction deducible principle presuppositional reasoning general real object final opinion adequate investigation would lead anything process would ever lead would real induction involving ongoing tests observations follows method sufficiently persisted diminish error predesignate degree three stages
classification unclearly premissed inductive classing objects experience general ideas
probation direct inductive argumentation crude enumeration instances gradual new estimate proportion truth hypothesis test gradual induction qualitative quantitative qualitative dependent weightings qualities characters quantitative dependent measurements statistics countings
sentential induction inductive reasonings appraises different probations singly combinations makes selfappraisal appraisals passes final judgment whole result
communication community
frequently scientific method employed single person also several people cooperating directly indirectly cooperation regarded important element scientific community various standards scientific methodology used within environment
peer review evaluation
scientific journals use process peer review scientists manuscripts submitted editors scientific journals usually one three fellow usually anonymous scientists familiar field evaluation certain journals journal selects referees others especially journals extremely specialized manuscript author might recommend referees referees may may recommend publication might recommend publication suggested modifications sometimes publication another journal standard practiced various degrees different journals effect keeping literature free obvious errors generally improve quality material especially journals use standard rigorously peer review process limitations considering research outside conventional scientific paradigm problems groupthink interfere open fair deliberation new research
documentation replication
sometimes experimenters may make systematic errors experiments veer standard methods practices pathological science various reasons rare cases deliberately report false results occasionally scientists might attempt repeat experiments order duplicate results
archiving
researchers sometimes practice scientific data archiving compliance policies government funding agencies scientific journals cases detailed records experimental procedures raw data statistical analyses source code preserved order provide evidence methodology practice procedure assist potential future attempts reproduce result procedural records may also assist conception new experiments test hypothesis may prove useful engineers might examine potential practical applications discovery
data sharing
additional information needed study reproduced author study might asked provide might provide author refuses share data appeals made journal editors published study institution funded research
limitations
since impossible scientist record everything took place experiment facts selected apparent relevance reported may lead unavoidably problems later supposedly irrelevant feature questioned example heinrich hertz report size room used test maxwells equations later turned account small deviation results problem parts theory need assumed order select report experimental conditions observations hence sometimes described theoryladen
dimensions practice
