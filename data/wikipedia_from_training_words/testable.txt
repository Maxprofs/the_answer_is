testability a property applying to an empirical hypothesis involves two components
the logical property that is variously described as contingency defeasibility or falsifiability which means that counterexamples to the hypothesis are logically possible
the practical feasibility of observing a reproducible series of such counterexamples if they do exist
in short a hypothesis is testable if there is some real hope of deciding whether it is true or false of real experience upon this property of its constituent hypotheses rests the ability to decide whether a theory can be supported or falsified by the data of actual experience if hypotheses are tested initial results may also be labeled inconclusive
