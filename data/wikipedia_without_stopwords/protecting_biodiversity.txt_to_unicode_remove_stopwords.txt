causes effects
axis tilt
seasons result earths axis rotation tilted respect orbital plane angle approximately degrees tilt also known obliquity ecliptic
regardless time year northern southern hemispheres always experience opposite seasons summer winter one part planet directly exposed rays sun see fig exposure alternates earth revolves orbit approximately half year around march around september northern hemisphere tips toward sun maximum amount occurring june half year happens southern hemisphere instead northern maximum around december two instants sun directly overhead equator equinoxes also moment north pole south pole earth terminator hence day night equally divided northern southern hemispheres march equinox northern hemisphere experiencing spring hours daylight increase southern hemisphere experiencing autumn daylight hours shorten
effect axial tilt observable change day length altitude sun noon culmination sun year low angle sun winter months means incoming rays solar radiation spread larger area earths surface light received indirect lower intensity lower intensity light less able heat ground effect shorter daylight hours axial tilt earth accounts seasonal variation climate hemispheres
elliptical earth orbit
compared axial tilt factors contribute little seasonal temperature changes seasons result variation earths distance sun elliptical orbit fact earth reaches perihelion point orbit closest sun january reaches aphelion farthest point sun july slight contribution orbital eccentricity opposes temperature trends seasons northern hemisphere general effect orbital eccentricity earths seasons variation sunlight received
orbital eccentricity influence temperatures earth effect small counteracted factors research shows earth whole actually slightly warmer farther sun northern hemisphere land southern land warms readily sea noticeable intensification southern hemispheres winters summers due earths elliptical orbit mitigated abundance water southern hemisphere
maritime hemispheric
seasonal weather fluctuations changes also depend factors proximity oceans large bodies water currents oceans el nioenso oceanic cycles prevailing winds
temperate polar regions seasons marked changes amount sunlight turn often causes cycles dormancy plants hibernation animals effects vary latitude proximity bodies water example south pole middle continent antarctica therefore considerable distance moderating influence southern oceans north pole arctic ocean thus temperature extremes buffered water result south pole consistently colder southern winter north pole northern winter
cycle seasons polar temperate zones one hemisphere opposite summer northern hemisphere winter southern hemisphere vice versa
tropics
tropical subtropical regions little annual fluctuation sunlight however seasonal shifts rainy globalscale low pressure belt called intertropical convergence zone result amount precipitation tends vary dramatically average temperature convergence zone north equator tropical areas northern hemisphere experience wet season tropics south equator dry season pattern reverses convergence zone migrates position south equator
midlatitude thermal lag
meteorological terms summer solstice winter solstice maximum minimum insolation respectively fall middles summer winter heights seasons occur seven weeks later seasonal lag seasons though always defined meteorological terms
astronomical reckoning hours daylight alone solstices equinoxes middle respective seasons seasonal lag due thermal absorption release oceans regions continental climate predominate northern hemisphere often consider four dates start seasons diagram crossquarter days considered seasonal midpoints length seasons uniform elliptical orbit earth different speeds along orbit
fourseason calendar reckoning
calendarbased reckoning defines seasons relative rather absolute terms accordingly floral activity regularly observed coolest quarter year particular area still considered winter despite traditional association flowers spring summer additionally seasons considered change dates everywhere uses particular calendar method regardless variations climate one area another calendarbased methods use four season model identify warmest coolest coldest seasons separated two intermediate seasons
modern midlatitude meteorological
meteorological seasons reckoned temperature summer hottest quarter year winter coldest quarter year societas meteorologica palatina became defunct early international organization meteorology defined seasons groupings three whole months identified gregorian calendar ever since professional meteorologists world used definition therefore temperate areas northern hemisphere spring begins march summer june autumn september winter december southern hemisphere temperate zone spring begins september summer december autumn march winter june
sweden finland meteorologists use noncalendar based definition seasons based temperature spring begins daily averaged temperature permanently rises c summer begins temperature permanently rises c summer ends temperature permanently falls c winter begins temperature permanently falls c permanently means daily averaged temperature remained limit seven consecutive days implies two things first seasons begin fixed dates must determined observation known fact second new season begins different dates different parts country great britain onset spring used defined maximum daily temperature reached f defined sequence days almost always occurred march however global warming temperature uncommon winter
midlatitude astronomical
astronomical timing basis designating temperate seasons dates back least julian calendar used ancient romans continues used many modern gregorian calendars worldwide although countries like australia new zealand russia prefer use meteorological reckoning precise timing seasons determined exact times transit sun tropics cancer capricorn solstices times suns transit equator equinoxes traditional date close times

currently common equinox solstice dates march june september december fouryear average slowly shifts earlier times century progresses shift full day years compensated mainly century leap year rules gregorian calendar leap year current shift progressing since beginning last century equinoxes solstices relatively late also means many years twentieth century dates march june september december much common older books teach older people may still remember dates

noncalendarbased reckoning
ecologically speaking season period year certain types floral animal events happen eg flowers bloomspring hedgehogs hibernatewinter observe change daily floralanimal events season changing sense ecological seasons defined absolute terms unlike calendarbased methods seasons relative specific conditions associated particular ecological season dont normally occur particular region area cannot said experience season regular basis
modern midlatitude ecological
six seasons distinguished fixed calendarbased dates like meteorological astronomical seasons mild temperate regions tend experience beginning hibernal season month later cool temperate areas prevernal vernal seasons begin month earlier example prevernal crocus blooms typically appear early february mild coastal areas british columbia british isles western southern europe actual dates season vary climate region shift one year next average dates listed mild cool temperate climate zones northern hemisphere
prevernal early prespring begins february late january mild temperate march cool temperate deciduous tree buds begin swell migrating birds fly winter summer habitats
vernal spring begins march mild temperate april cool temperate tree buds burst leaves birds establish territories begin mating nesting
estival high summer begins june temperate climates trees full leaf birds hatch raise offspring
serotinal late summer generally begins mid late august deciduous leaves begin change color young birds reach maturity join adult birds preparing autumn migration traditional harvest season begins
autumnal autumn generally begins mid late september tree leaves full color turn brown fall ground birds migrate back wintering areas
hibernal winter begins december mild temperate november cool temperate deciduous trees bare fallen leaves begin decay migrating birds settled winter habitats
modern tropical ecological
tropics seasonal dates also vary common speak rainy wet monsoon season versus dry season example nicaragua dry season november april called summer rainy season may october called winter even though located northern hemisphere tropical areas threeway division hot rainy cool season used noticeable change amount sunlight different times year however many regions northern indian ocean subject monsoon rain wind cycles
floral animal activity variation near equator depends wetdry cycles seasonal temperature variations different species flowering emerging cocoons specific times monsoon season thus tropics characterized numerous miniseasons within larger seasonal blocks time
indigenous ecological polar midlatitude tropical
