protostellar cloud continue collapse long gravitational binding energy eliminated excess energy primarily lost radiation however collapsing cloud eventually become opaque radiation energy must removed means dust within cloud becomes heated temperatures k particles radiate wavelengths far infrared cloud transparent thus dust mediates collapse cloud
collapse density cloud increases toward center thus middle region becomes optically opaque first occurs density g cm core region called first hydrostatic core forms collapse essentially halted continues increase temperature determined virial theorem gas falling toward opaque region collides creates shock waves heat core
core temperature reaches k thermal energy dissociates h molecules followed ionization hydrogen helium atoms processes absorb energy contraction allowing continue timescales comparable period collapse free fall velocities density infalling material dropped g cm material sufficiently transparent allow energy radiated protostar escape combination convection within protostar radiation exterior allow star contract continues gas hot enough internal pressure support protostar gravitational collapsea state called hydrostatic equilibrium accretion phase nearly complete resulting object known protostar
accretion material onto protostar continues partially newly formed circumstellar disc density temperature high enough deuterium fusion begins outward pressure resultant radiation slows stop collapse material comprising cloud continues rain onto protostar stage bipolar jets produced called herbigharo objects probably means excess angular momentum infalling material expelled allowing star continue form

low mass high mass star formationedit
stars different masses thought form slightly different mechanisms theory lowmass star formation wellsupported plethora observations suggests lowmass stars form gravitational collapse rotating density enhancements within molecular clouds described collapse rotating cloud gas dust leads formation accretion disk matter channeled onto central protostar stars masses higher m however mechanism star formation well understood
massive stars emit copious quantities radiation pushes infalling material past thought radiation pressure might substantial enough halt accretion onto massive protostar prevent formation stars masses tens solar masses recent theoretical work shown production jet outflow clears cavity much radiation massive protostar escape without hindering accretion disk onto protostar present thinking massive stars may therefore able form mechanism similar low mass stars form
mounting evidence least massive protostars indeed surrounded accretion disks several theories massive star formation remain tested observationally perhaps prominent theory competitive accretion suggests massive protostars seeded lowmass protostars compete protostars draw matter entire parent molecular cloud instead simply small local region
another theory massive star formation suggests massive stars may form coalescence two stars lower mass
