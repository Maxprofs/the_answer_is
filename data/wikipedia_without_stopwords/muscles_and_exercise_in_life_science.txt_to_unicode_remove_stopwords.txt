cardiac muscle myocardium also involuntary muscle akin structure skeletal muscle found heart
cardiac skeletal muscles striated contain sarcomeres packed highly regular arrangements bundles myofibrils smooth muscle cells arranged sarcomeres striated sarcomeres skeletal muscles arranged regular parallel bundles cardiac muscle sarcomeres connect branching irregular angles called intercalated discs striated muscle contracts relaxes short intense bursts whereas smooth muscle sustains longer even nearpermanent contractions
skeletal voluntary muscle divided two broad types slow twitch fast twitch
type slow twitch red muscle dense capillaries rich mitochondria myoglobin giving muscle tissue characteristic red color carry oxygen sustain aerobic activity using fats carbohydrates fuel slow twitch fibers contract long periods time little force
type ii fast twitch muscle three major subtypes iia iix iib vary contractile speed force generated fast twitch fibers contract quickly powerfully fatigue rapidly sustaining short anaerobic bursts activity muscle contraction becomes painful contribute muscle strength greater potential increase mass type iib anaerobic glycolytic white muscle least dense mitochondria myoglobin small animals eg rodents major fast muscle type explaining pale color flesh

strongest human muscleedit
since three factors affect muscular strength simultaneously muscles never work individually misleading compare strength individual muscles state one strongest several muscles whose strength noteworthy different reasons
ordinary parlance muscular strength usually refers ability exert force external objectfor example lifting weight definition masseter jaw muscle strongest guinness book records records achievement bite strength n lbf seconds distinguishes masseter anything special muscle advantage working much shorter lever arm muscles
strength refers force exerted muscle eg place inserts bone strongest muscles largest crosssectional area tension exerted individual skeletal muscle fiber vary much fiber exert force order micronewton definition strongest muscle body usually said quadriceps femoris gluteus maximus
muscle strength determined crosssectional area shorter muscle stronger pound pound ie weight longer muscle crosssectional area myometrial layer uterus may strongest muscle weight female human body time infant delivered entire human uterus weighs kg oz childbirth uterus exerts n lbf downward force contraction
external muscles eye conspicuously large strong relation small size weight eyeball frequently said strongest muscles job sometimes claimed times stronger need however eye movements particularly saccades used facial scanning reading require high speed movements eye muscles exercised nightly rapid eye movement sleep
statement tongue strongest muscle body appears frequently lists surprising facts difficult find definition strength would make statement true note tongue consists eight muscles one
heart claim muscle performs largest quantity physical work course lifetime estimates power output human heart range watts much less maximum power output muscles example quadriceps produce watts minutes heart work continuously entire lifetime without pause thus outwork muscles output one watt continuously eighty years yields total work output two half gigajoules

exerciseedit
exercise often recommended means improving motor skills fitness muscle bone strength joint function exercise several effects upon muscles connective tissue bone nerves stimulate muscles one effect muscle hypertrophy increase size used bodybuilding
various exercises require predominance certain muscle fiber utilization another aerobic exercise involves long low levels exertion muscles used well maximal contraction strength long periods time classic example marathon aerobic events rely primarily aerobic oxygen system use higher percentage type slowtwitch muscle fibers consume mixture fat protein carbohydrates energy consume large amounts oxygen produce little lactic acid anaerobic exercise involves short bursts higher intensity contractions much greater percentage maximum contraction strength examples anaerobic exercise include sprinting weight lifting anaerobic energy delivery system uses predominantly type ii fasttwitch muscle fibers relies mainly atp glucose fuel consumes relatively little oxygen protein fat produces large amounts lactic acid sustained long period aerobic exercise many exercises partially aerobic partially anaerobic example soccer rock climbing involve combination
presence lactic acid inhibitory effect atp generation within muscle though producing fatigue inhibit even stop performance intracellular concentration becomes high however longterm training causes neovascularization within muscle increasing ability move waste products muscles maintain contraction moved muscles high concentrations within sarcomere lactic acid used muscles body tissues source energy transported liver converted back pyruvate addition increasing level lactic acid strenuous exercise causes loss potassium ions muscle causing increase potassium ion concentrations close muscle fibres interstitium acidification lactic acid may allow recovery force acidosis may protect fatigue rather cause fatigue
delayed onset muscle soreness pain discomfort may felt one three days exercising generally subsides two three days later thought caused lactic acid buildup recent theory caused tiny tears muscle fibers caused eccentric contraction unaccustomed training levels since lactic acid disperses fairly rapidly could explain pain experienced days exercise
hypertrophyedit
independent strength performance measures muscles induced grow larger number factors including hormone signaling developmental factors strength training disease contrary popular belief number muscle fibres cannot increased exercise instead muscles grow larger combination muscle cell growth new protein filaments added along additional mass provided undifferentiated satellite cells alongside existing muscle cells
biological factors age hormone levels affect muscle hypertrophy puberty males hypertrophy occurs accelerated rate levels growthstimulating hormones produced body increase natural hypertrophy normally stops full growth late teens testosterone one bodys major growth hormones average men find hypertrophy much easier achieve women taking additional testosterone anabolic steroids increase muscular hypertrophy
muscular spinal neural factors affect muscle building sometimes person may notice increase strength given muscle even though opposite subject exercise bodybuilder finds left biceps stronger completing regimen focusing right biceps phenomenon called cross education
atrophyedit
inactivity starvation mammals lead atrophy skeletal muscle decrease muscle mass may accompanied smaller number size muscle cells well lower protein content muscle atrophy may also result natural aging process disease
humans prolonged periods immobilization cases bed rest astronauts flying space known result muscle weakening atrophy atrophy particular interest manned spaceflight community weightlessness experienced spaceflight results loss much mass muscles consequences also noted small hibernating mammals like goldenmantled ground squirrels brown bats
aging gradual decrease ability maintain skeletal muscle function mass known sarcopenia exact cause sarcopenia unknown may due combination gradual failure satellite cells help regenerate skeletal muscle fibers decrease sensitivity availability critical secreted growth factors necessary maintain muscle mass satellite cell survival sarcopenia normal aspect aging actually disease state yet linked many injuries elderly population well decreasing quality life
also many diseases conditions cause muscle atrophy examples include cancer aids induce body wasting syndrome called cachexia syndromes conditions induce skeletal muscle atrophy congestive heart disease diseases liver
