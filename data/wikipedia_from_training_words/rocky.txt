rocky the italian stallion balboa is a hard-living but failing prize fighter from an italian neighborhood of philadelphia pennsylvania between fights he works as an enforcer for loan shark anthony gazzo and is regarded by many of his neighbors as a bum the world heavyweight champion apollo creed announces plans to hold a match in philadelphia during the upcoming united states bicentennial however he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent mac lee green is unable to compete due to an injured hand with all other potential replacements booked up or otherwise unavailable creed decides to spice things up and give a local contender a chance to face him he settles on rocky believing that he will be an easy challenge
rocky meets with promoter miles jergens and agrees to the match after several weeks of training using whatever he can find including meat carcasses as punching bags rocky accepts an offer of assistance from mickey goldmill a respected trainer who always criticized rocky for wasting his potential
at the same time rocky begins a relationship with adrian a clerk at the local pet store he gradually gains the shy adrian's trust culminating in a kiss her alcoholic brother paulie becomes jealous of rocky's success but rocky calms him by agreeing to advertise his meatpacking business at the fight the night before the match rocky becomes depressed after touring the arena he confesses to adrian that he does not expect to win but is content to go the distance against creed and prove himself to everyone
on new year's day the climactic boxing match begins with creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as george washington and then uncle sam taking advantage of his overconfidence rocky knocks him down in the first round--the first time that creed has ever been knocked down humiliated creed takes rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight though his ego never fully fades the fight goes on for the full 15 rounds with both fighters sustaining many injuries rocky suffers his first broken nose and debilitating trauma around the eye and creed sustains brutal blows to his ribs with substantial internal bleeding as the match progresses creed's superior skill is countered by rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punishment and his dogged refusal to be knocked out as the final round bell sounds with both fighters locked in each other's arms they promise to each other that there will be no rematch
after the fight multiple layers of drama are played out the sportscasters and the audience go wild jergens announces over the loudspeaker that the match was the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring and rocky calls out repeatedly for adrian who runs down and comes into the ring as paulie distracts arena security as jergens declares creed the winner by virtue of a split decision (8:7 7:8 9:6) adrian and rocky embrace and profess their love to each other

== productionedit ==
=== developmentedit ===
sylvester stallone wrote the screenplay for rocky in three and a half days shortly after watching the championship match between muhammad ali and chuck wepner that took place at richfield coliseum in richfield ohio on march 24 1975 wepner was tko'd in the 15th round of the match by ali but nobody ever expected him to last as long as he did despite the fact that the match motivated stallone to begin work on rocky he has subsequently denied that wepner provided any inspiration for the script other possible inspirations for the film may have included characteristics of real-life boxers rocky marciano and joe frazier as well as rocky graziano's autobiography somebody up there likes me and the movie of the same name wepner filed a lawsuit which was eventually settled with stallone for an undisclosed amount
united artists liked stallone's script and viewed it as a possible vehicle for a well-established star such as robert redford ryan o'neal burt reynolds or james caan stallone appealed to the producers to be given a chance to star in the film he later said that he would never have forgiven himself if the film became a success with someone else in the lead he also knew that producers irwin winkler's and robert chartoff's contract with the studio enabled them to greenlight a project if the budget was kept low enough the producers also collateralized any possible losses with their big-budget entry new york new york (whose eventual losses were ironically covered by rocky's success) the film's production budget ended up being $1,075,000 with a further $100,000 spent on producer's fees and $4.2 million of advertising costs
=== castingedit ===
although chartoff and winkler were enthusiastic about the script and the idea of stallone playing the lead character they were hesitant about having an unknown headline the film the producers also had trouble casting other major characters in the story with apollo creed and adrian cast unusually late by production standards (both were ultimately cast on the same day) real-life boxer ken norton was initially sought for the role of apollo creed but he pulled out and the role was ultimately given to carl weathers norton had had three fights with muhammad ali upon whom creed was loosely based according to the rocky scrapbook carrie snodgress was originally chosen to play adrian but a money dispute forced the producers to look elsewhere susan sarandon auditioned for the role but was deemed too pretty for the character after talia shire's ensuing audition chartoff and winkler along with avildsen insisted that she play the part
=== filmingedit ===
principal photography for rocky began on january 6 1976 filming took place primarily throughout philadelphia with a few scenes being shot in los angeles inventor/operator garrett brown's new steadicam was used to accomplish smooth photography while running alongside rocky during the film's philadelphia street jogging/training sequences and the run up the art museum's flight of stairs it was also used for some of the shots in the fight scenes and can be seen at the ringside during some wide shots of the final fight rocky is often erroneously cited as the first film to use the steadicam although it was actually the third after bound for glory and marathon man
certain elements of the story were altered during filming the original script had a darker tone mickey was portrayed as racist and the script ended with rocky throwing the fight after realizing he did not want to be part of the professional boxing world after all
during filming both stallone and weathers suffered injuries during the shooting of the final fight stallone suffered bruised ribs and weathers suffered a damaged nose the opposite injuries of what their characters had
the first date between rocky and adrian in which rocky bribes a janitor to allow them to skate after closing hours in a deserted ice skating rink was shot that way only because of budgetary pressures this scene was originally scheduled to be shot in a skating rink during regular business hours however the producers decided that they couldn't afford to hire the hundreds of extras that would have been necessary for that scene
the poster seen above the ring before rocky fights apollo creed shows rocky wearing red shorts with a white stripe when he actually wears white shorts with a red stripe when rocky points this out he is told that it doesn't really matter does it? according to director avildsen's dvd commentary this was an actual mistake made by the props department that they could not afford to rectify so stallone wrote the brief scene to ensure the audience didn't see it as a goof (carl weathers ironically wore white-striped red shorts for the creed-balboa rematch in rocky ii) avildsen said that the same situation arose with rocky's robe when it came back from the costume department it was far too baggy for stallone because the robe arrived on the day of filming the scene and there was no chance of replacing or altering it instead of ignoring this and risking the audience laughing at it stallone wrote the dialogue where rocky himself points out the robe is too big
=== musicedit ===
the musical score for rocky was composed by bill conti who previously composed a score for director john g avildsen's w.w and the dixie dancekings (1975) that was ultimately rejected by the studio in fact david shire (then-husband of talia shire) was the first to be offered the chance to compose the music for rocky but had to turn it down due to prior commitments thus avildsen reached out to conti without any studio intervention due to the film's relatively low budget the budget for the music was 25 grand, said avildsen and that was for everything the composers fee that was to pay the musicians that was to rent the studio that was to buy the tape that it was going to be recorded on.
the main theme song gonna fly now made it to number one on the billboard magazine's hot 100 list for one week (from july 2 to july 8 1977) and the american film institute placed it 58th on its afi's 100 years...100 songs a soundtrack album was released on november 12 1976 by united artists records the complete soundtrack was re-released in 1988 by emi on cd and cassette
== receptionedit ==
=== box officeedit ===
rocky grossed $5 million during its opening weekend and eventually reached $117 million at the north american box office adjusted for inflation the film has earned nearly $460 million in north america at 2015 prices overseas rocky fared just as well grossing $107 million for a worldwide box office accumulation of $225 million with its production budget of $1 million rocky is notable for its worldwide percentage return of over 11,000 percent it was the highest-grossing film of 1976 in the united states
=== critical responseedit ===
rocky received mixed to positive reviews at the time of its release roger ebert of the chicago sun-times gave it 4 out of 4 stars and said that stallone reminded him of the young marlon brando. box office magazine claimed that audiences would be touting sylvester sly stallone as a new star the film however did not escape criticism vincent canby of the new york times called it pure 30s make believe and dismissed both stallone's acting and avildsen's directing calling the latter none too decisive frank rich liked the film calling it almost 100 per cent schmaltz, but favoring it over the cynicism that was prevalent in movies at that time although he referred to the plot as gimmicky and the script heavy-handed he attributed all of the film's weaknesses to avildsen describing him as responsible for some of the most tawdry movies of recent years and who has an instinct for making serious emotions look tawdry and said of rocky he'll go for a cheap touch whenever he can and tries to falsify material that was suspect from the beginning  even by the standards of fairy tales it strains logic. rich also criticised the film's stupid song with couplets like feeling strong now/won't be long now.
several reviews including richard eder's (as well as canby's negative review) compared the work to that of frank capra andrew sarris found the capra comparisons disingenuous capra's movies projected more despair deep down than a movie like rocky could envisage and most previous ring movies have been much more cynical about the fight scene, and commenting on rocky's work as a loan shark says that the film teeters on the edge of sentimentalizing gangsters. sarris also found meredith oddly cast in the kind of part the late james gleason used to pick his teeth. sarris also took issue with avildsen's direction which he described as having been done with an insidious smirk with condescension toward everything and everybody, specifically finding fault for example with avildsen's multiple shots of a chintzy lamp in rocky's apartment sarris also found stallone's acting style a bit mystifying and his character all rough as opposed to a diamond in the rough like terry malloy
almost forty years later the film enjoys a reputation as a classic and still receives mostly positive reviews rocky holds a 93% certified fresh rating on rotten tomatoes based on 54 reviews with an average rating of 8.4/10 the site's consensus states this story of a down-on-his-luck boxer is thoroughly predictable but sylvester stallone's script and stunning performance in the title role brush aside complaints. another positive online review came from the bbc films website with both reviewer almar haflidason and bbc online users giving it 5/5 stars in steven j schneider's 1001 movies you must see before you die schneider says the film is often overlooked as schmaltz.
in 2006 rocky was selected for preservation in the united states national film registry by the library of congress as being culturally historically or aesthetically significant

=== rocky stepsedit ===
the famous scene of rocky running up the steps of the philadelphia museum of art has become a cultural icon with the steps acquiring the vernacular title of rocky steps in 1982 a statue of rocky commissioned by stallone for rocky iii was placed at the top of the rocky steps city commerce director dick doran claimed that stallone and rocky had done more for the city's image than anyone since ben franklin.
differing opinions of the statue and its placement led to a relocation to the sidewalk outside the spectrum arena although the statue was temporarily returned to the top of the steps in 1990 for rocky v and again in 2006 for the 30th anniversary of the original rocky (although this time it was placed at the bottom of the steps) later that year it was permanently moved to a spot next to the steps
the scene is frequently parodied in the media in you don't mess with the zohan zohan's nemesis phantom goes through a parodied training sequence finishing with him running up a desert dune and raising his hands in victory in the fourth season finale of the fresh prince of bel-air as the credits roll at the end of the episode will is seen running up the same steps of the philadelphia museum of art however as he celebrates after finishing his climb he passes out in exhaustion and while he lies unconscious on the ground a pickpocket steals his wallet and his wool hat also in the nutty professor there is a scene where eddie murphy is running up the stairs and throwing punches at the top
in 2006 e named the rocky steps scene #13 in its 101 most awesome moments in entertainment
during the 1996 summer olympics torch relay philadelphia native dawn staley was chosen to run up the museum steps in 2004 presidential candidate john kerry ended his pre-convention campaign at the foot of the steps before going to boston to accept his party's nomination for president
