the pancreas /pkris/ is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates in humans it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach it is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones including insulin glucagon somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide which circulate in the blood the pancreas is also a digestive organ secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine these enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates proteins and lipids in the chyme
== structureedit ==
the pancreas is an endocrine organ that lies in the abdomen specifically the upper left abdomen it is found behind the stomach with the head of the pancreas surrounded by the duodenum the pancreas is about 15 cm (6 in) long
anatomically the pancreas is divided into a head which rests within the concavity of the duodenum a body lying behind the base of the stomach and a tail which ends abutting the spleen the neck of the pancreas lies between the body and head and lies anterior to the superior mesenteric artery and vein the head of the pancreas surrounds these two vessels and a small uncinate process emerges from the lower part of the head lying behind the superior mesenteric artery
the pancreas is a secretory structure with an internal hormonal role (endocrine) and an external digestive role (exocrine) it has two main ducts the main pancreatic duct and the accessory pancreatic duct these drain enzymes through the ampulla of vater into the duodenum
=== marginsedit ===
the upper margin of the pancreas is blunt and flat to the right narrow and sharp to the left near the tail
it begins on the right in the omental tuber and is in relation with the celiac artery from which the hepatic artery courses to the right just above the gland while the lienal artery runs toward the left in a groove along this border
the lower margin of the pancreas separates the posterior from the inferior surface the superior mesenteric vessels emerge under its right extremity
the frontal margin of the pancreas separates the anterior from the inferior surface of the pancreas and along this border the two layers of the transverse mesocolon diverge from one another one passing upward over the frontal surface the other backward over the inferior surface
=== surfacesedit ===
the inferior surface of the pancreas is narrow on the right but broader on the left and is covered by peritoneum it lies upon the duodenojejunal flexure and on some coils of the jejunum its left extremity rests on the left colic flexure
the anterior surface of the pancreas faces the front of the abdomen most of the right half of this surface is in contact with the transverse colon with only areolar tissue intervening
from its upper part it joins to the neck of the pancreas at a well-marked prominence the omental tuber which abuts the lesser omentum its right edge is marked by a groove for the gastroduodenal artery
the lower part of the right half below the transverse colon is covered by peritoneum continuous with the inferior layer of the transverse mesocolon and is in contact with the coils of the small intestine
the superior mesenteric artery passes down in front of the left half across the uncinate process the superior mesenteric vein runs upward on the right side of the artery and behind the neck joins with the lienal vein to form the portal vein
=== blood supplyedit ===
the pancreas receives blood from branches of both the coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery the splenic artery runs along the top margin of the pancreas and supplies the neck body and tail of the pancreas through its pancreatic branches the largest of which is called the greater pancreatic artery the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery runs along the anterior and posterior surfaces of the head of the pancreas at its border with the duodenum these supply the head of the pancreas
the body and neck of the pancreas drain into the splenic vein the head drains into the superior mesenteric and portal veins
=== histologyedit ===
the pancreas contains tissue with an endocrine and exocrine role and this division is also visible when the pancreas is viewed under a microscope
the tissues with an endocrine role can be seen under staining as lightly-stained clusters of cells called pancreatic islets (also called islets of langerhans)
darker-staining cells form clusters called acini which are arranged in lobes separated by a thin fibrous barrier the secretory cells of each acinus surround a small intercalated duct because of their secretory function these cells have many small granules of zymogens that are visible the intercalated ducts drains into larger ducts within the lobule and finally interlobular ducts the ducts are lined by a single layer of columnar cells with increasing diameter several layers of columnar cells may be seen
=== variationedit ===
the size of the pancreas varies considerably several anatomical variations exist relating to the embryological development of the two buds of the pancreas the pancreas develops as two buds on either side of the duodenum the ventral bud eventually rotates to lie next to the dorsal bud eventually fusing if the two buds do not fuse a pancreas may exist as two separate lobes this is also called pancreatic divisum if the ventral bud does not fully rotate an annular pancreas may exist this is where sections of the pancreas completely encircle the duodenum and may even lead to duodenal atresia
an accessory pancreatic duct may exist if the main duct of pancreas does not regress
=== developmentedit ===
the pancreas forms from the embryonic foregut and is therefore of endodermal origin pancreatic development begins with the formation of a ventral and a dorsal pancreatic bud each structure communicates with the foregut through a duct the dorsal pancreatic bud forms the head body and tail whereas the ventral pancreatic bud forms the uncinate process
differential rotation and fusion of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds results in the formation of the definitive pancreas as the duodenum rotates to the right it carries with it the ventral pancreatic bud and common bile duct upon reaching its final destination the ventral pancreatic bud fuses with the much larger dorsal pancreatic bud at this point of fusion the main ducts of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds fuse forming the main pancreatic duct the duct of the dorsal bud regresses leaving the main pancreatic duct
differentiation of cells of the pancreas proceeds through two different pathways corresponding to the dual endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas in progenitor cells of the exocrine pancreas important molecules that induce differentiation include follistatin fibroblast growth factors and activation of the notch receptor system development of the exocrine acini progresses through three successive stages these are the predifferentiated protodifferentiated and differentiated stages which correspond to undetectable low and high levels of digestive enzyme activity respectively
the multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells have the capacity to differentiate into all the pancreatic cells acinar cells endocrine cells and ductal cells these progenitor cells are characterised by the co-expression of the transcription factors pdx1 and nkx6-1 under the influence of neurogenin-3 and isl1 but in the absence of notch receptor signaling these cells differentiate to form two lines of committed endocrine precursor cells the first line under the direction of a pax gene forms - and - cells which produce glucagon and pancreatic polypeptides respectively the second line influenced by pax-6 produces beta cells (-) and delta cells (-) which secrete insulin and somatostatin respectively
insulin and glucagon can be detected in the human fetal circulation by the fourth or fifth month of fetal development
== functionedit ==
the pancreas is a dual-function gland having features of both endocrine and exocrine glands
=== endocrineedit ===
the part of the pancreas with endocrine function is made up of approximately 3 million cell clusters called pancreatic islets these small micro organs are arranged along the pancreas in the form of density routes four main cell types exist in the islets they are relatively difficult to distinguish using standard staining techniques but they can be classified by their secretion alpha cells secrete glucagon (increase glucose in blood) beta cells secrete insulin (decrease glucose in blood) delta cells secrete somatostatin (regulates/stops and cells) and pp cells or (gamma) cells secrete pancreatic polypeptide
the islets are a compact collection of endocrine cells arranged in clusters and cords and are crisscrossed by a dense network of capillaries the capillaries of the islets are lined by layers of endocrine cells in direct contact with vessels and most endocrine cells are in direct contact with blood vessels either by cytoplasmic processes or by direct apposition according to the volume the body by alan e nourse the islets are busily manufacturing their hormone and generally disregarding the pancreatic cells all around them as though they were located in some completely different part of the body. the pancreatic islets play an imperative role in glucose metabolism and regulation of blood glucose concentration
=== exocrineedit ===
the pancreas also functions as an exocrine gland that assists the digestive system it secretes pancreatic fluid that contains digestive enzymes that pass to the small intestine these enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates proteins and lipids (fats) in the chyme
in humans the secretory activity of the pancreas is regulated directly via the effect of hormones in the blood on the pancreatic islets and indirectly through the effect of the autonomic nervous system on the blood flow
the exocrine component of the pancreas often called simply the exocrine pancreas is the portion of the pancreas that performs exocrine functions it has ducts that are arranged in clusters called acini (singular acinus) pancreatic secretions are secreted into the lumen of the acinus and then accumulate in intralobular ducts that drain to the main pancreatic duct which drains directly into the duodenum
control of the exocrine function of the pancreas is via the hormones gastrin cholecystokinin and secretin which are secreted by cells in the stomach and duodenum in response to distension and/or food and which cause secretion of pancreatic juices
there are two main classes of exocrine pancreatic secretions
pancreatic secretions from ductal cells contain bicarbonate ions and are alkaline in order to neutralize the acidic chyme that the stomach churns out
the pancreas is also the main source of enzymes for digesting fats (lipids) and proteins (the enzymes that digest polysaccharides by contrast are primarily produced by the walls of the intestines.)
the cells are filled with secretory granules containing the precursor digestive enzymes the major proteases which the pancreas secretes are trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen secreted to a lesser degree are pancreatic lipase and pancreatic amylase the pancreas also secretes phospholipase a2 lysophospholipase and cholesterol esterase
the precursor enzymes (termed zymogens or proenzymes) are inactive variants of the enzymes thus autodegradation which can lead to pancreatitis is avoided once released in the intestine the enzyme enteropeptidase (formerly and incorrectly called enterokinase) present in the intestinal mucosa activates trypsinogen by cleaving it to form trypsin the free trypsin then cleaves the rest of the trypsinogen as well as chymotrypsinogen to its active form chymotrypsin
=== innervationedit ===
sympathetic (adrenergic)
2 decreases secretion from beta cells increases secretion from alpha cells 2 increases secretion from beta cells
parasympathetic (muscarinic)
m3 increases stimulation of alpha cells and beta cells
== clinical relevanceedit ==
a puncture of the pancreas which may lead to the secretion of digestive enzymes such as lipase and amylase into the abdominal cavity as well as subsequent pancreatic self-digestion and digestion and damage to organs within the abdomen generally requires prompt and experienced medical intervention
it is possible for one to live without a pancreas provided that the person takes insulin for proper regulation of blood glucose concentration and pancreatic enzyme supplements to aid digestion
=== inflammationedit ===
inflammation of the pancreas is known as pancreatitis pancreatitis is most often associated with recurrent gallstones or chronic alcohol use although a variety of other causes including measles mumps some medications the congenital condition alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and even some scorpion stings may cause pancreatitis pancreatitis is likely to cause intense pain in the central abdomen that often radiates to the back and may be associated with jaundice in addition due to causing problems with fat digestion and bilirubin excretion pancreatitis often presents with pale stools and dark urine
in pancreatitis enzymes of the exocrine pancreas damage the structure and tissue of the pancreas detection of some of these enzymes such as amylase and lipase in the blood along with symptoms and findings on x-ray are often used to indicate that a person has pancreatitis a person with pancreatitis is also at risk of shock pancreatitis is often managed medically with analgesics removal of gallstones or treatment of other causes and monitoring to ensure a patient does not develop shock
=== canceredit ===
pancreatic cancers particularly the most common type pancreatic adenocarcinoma remain very difficult to treat and are mostly diagnosed only at a stage that is too late for surgery which is the only curative treatment pancreatic cancer is rare in those younger than 40 and the median age of diagnosis is 71 risk factors include smoking obesity diabetes and certain rare genetic conditions including multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer among others about 25% of cases are attributable to tobacco smoking while 5-10% of cases are linked to inherited genes
there are several types of pancreatic cancer involving both the endocrine and exocrine tissue pancreatic adenocarcinoma which affects the exocrine part of the pancreas is by far the most common form the many types of pancreatic endocrine tumors are all uncommon or rare and have varied outlooks however the incidence of these cancers has been rising sharply it is not clear to what extent this reflects increased detection especially through medical imaging of tumors that would be very slow to develop insulinomas (largely benign) and gastrinomas are the most common types in the united states pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of deaths due to cancer the disease occurs more often in the developed world which had 68% of new cases in 2012 pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has poor outcomes with the average percentage alive for at least one and five years after diagnosis being 25% and 5% respectively in localized disease where the cancer is small (< 2 cm) the number alive at five years is approximately 20% for those with neuroendocrine cancers the number alive after five years is much better at 65% varying considerably with type
=== diabetesedit ===
==== type 1 diabetesedit ====
diabetes mellitus type 1 is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks the insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas people with type 1 diabetes therefore lack the insulin needed to keep blood sugar levels within optimal ranges if left untreated this leads to high blood sugar and the array of associated symptoms type 1 diabetes develops in people of all ages but is most often diagnosed before adulthood for type 1 diabetics insulin injections are critical for survival
==== type 2 diabetesedit ====
diabetes mellitus type 2 is the most common form of diabetes the causes for high blood sugar in this form of diabetes usually are a combination of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion with both genetic and environmental factors playing an important role in the development of the disease the management of type 2 diabetes relies on a series of changes in diet and physical activity with the purpose of reducing blood sugar levels to normal ranges and increasing insulin sensitivity biguanides such as metformin are also used as part of the treatment along with insulin therapy
== historyedit ==
the pancreas was first identified for western civilization by herophilus (335280 bc) a greek anatomist and surgeon only a few hundred years later rufus of ephesus another greek anatomist gave the pancreas its name etymologically the term pancreas a modern latin adaptation of greek  [ ("all whole") and ("flesh")] originally means sweetbread although literally meaning all-flesh presumably because of its fleshy consistency it was only in 1889 when oskar minkowski discovered that removing the pancreas from a dog caused it to become diabetic (insulin was later discovered by frederick banting and charles herbert best in 1921)
the organ is mentioned prominently in the 1992 film encino man pauly shore's character stoney often refers to the organ in unrelated contexts perhaps demonstrating a fundamental misunderstanding of what the pancreas does
== other animalsedit ==
pancreatic tissue is present in all vertebrate species but its precise form and arrangement vary widely there may be up to three separate pancreases two of which arise from ventral buds and the other dorsally in most species (including humans) these fuse in the adult but there are several exceptions even when a single pancreas is present two or three pancreatic ducts may persist each draining separately into the duodenum (or equivalent part of the foregut) birds for example typically have three such ducts
in teleosts and a few other species (such as rabbits) there is no discrete pancreas at all with pancreatic tissue being distributed diffusely across the mesentery and even within other nearby organs such as the liver or spleen in a few teleost species the endocrine tissue has fused to form a distinct gland within the abdominal cavity but otherwise it is distributed among the exocrine components the most primitive arrangement however appears to be that of lampreys and lungfish in which pancreatic tissue is found as a number of discrete nodules within the wall of the gut itself with the exocrine portions being little different from other glandular structures of the intestine
