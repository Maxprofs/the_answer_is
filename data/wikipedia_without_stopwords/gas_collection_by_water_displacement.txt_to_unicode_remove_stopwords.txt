fixed platformsedit
platforms built concrete steel legs anchored directly onto seabed supporting deck space drilling rigs production facilities crew quarters platforms virtue immobility designed long term use instance hibernia platform various types structure used steel jacket concrete caisson floating steel even floating concrete steel jackets vertical sections made tubular steel members usually piled seabed see details regarding design construction installation platforms refer
concrete caisson structures pioneered condeep concept often inbuilt oil storage tanks sea surface tanks often used flotation capability allowing built close shore norwegian fjords scottish firths popular sheltered deep enough floated final position sunk seabed fixed platforms economically feasible installation water depths m ft
compliant towersedit
platforms consist slender flexible towers pile foundation supporting conventional deck drilling production operations compliant towers designed sustain significant lateral deflections forces typically used water depths ranging metres ft

floating production systemsedit
main types floating production systems fpso floating production storage offloading system fpsos consist large monohull structures generally always shipshaped equipped processing facilities platforms moored location extended periods actually drill oil gas variants applications called fso floating storage offloading system fsu floating storage unit used exclusively storage purposes host little process equipment one best sources floating production
