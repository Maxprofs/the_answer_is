a male () organism is the physiological sex that produces sperm each spermatozoon can fuse with a larger female gamete or ovum in the process of fertilization a male cannot reproduce sexually without access to at least one ovum from a female but some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually most male mammals including male humans have a y chromosome which codes for the production of larger amounts of testosterone to develop male reproductive organs
not all species share a common sex-determination system in most animals including humans sex is determined genetically but in some species it can be determined due to social environmental or other factors for example cymothoa exigua changes sex depending on the number of females present in the vicinity
== overviewedit ==
the existence of two sexes seems to have been selected independently across different evolutionary lineages (see convergent evolution) the repeated pattern is sexual reproduction in isogamous species with two or more mating types with gametes of identical form and behavior (but different at the molecular level) to anisogamous species with gametes of male and female types to oogamous species in which the female gamete is very much larger than the male and has no ability to move there is a good argument that this pattern was driven by the physical constraints on the mechanisms by which two gametes get together as required for sexual reproduction
accordingly sex is defined operationally across species by the type of gametes produced (i.e. spermatozoa vs ova) and differences between males and females in one lineage are not always predictive of differences in another
male/female dimorphism between organisms or reproductive organs of different sexes is not limited to animals male gametes are produced by chytrids diatoms and land plants among others in land plants female and male designate not only the female and male gamete-producing organisms and structures but also the structures of the sporophytes that give rise to male and female plants
== symboledit ==
a common symbol used to represent the male sex is the mars symbol (unicode u+2642 alt codes alt+11)a circle with an arrow pointing northeast the symbol is identical to the planetary symbol of mars it was first used to denote sex by carolus linnaeus in 1751 the symbol is often called a stylized representation of the roman god mars shield and spear according to stearn however all the historical evidence favours that it is derived from  the contraction of the greek name for the planet thouros
== sex determinationedit ==
the sex of a particular organism may be determined by a number of factors these may be genetic or environmental or may naturally change during the course of an organism's life although most species with male and female sexes have individuals that are either male or female hermaphroditic animals such as worms have both male and female reproductive organs
=== genetic determinationedit ===
most mammals including humans are genetically determined as such by the xy sex-determination system where males have an xy (as opposed to xx) sex chromosome it is also possible in a variety of species including human beings to be xxy or have other intersex/hermaphroditic qualities during reproduction a male can give either an x sperm or a y sperm while a female can only give an x egg a y sperm and an x egg produce a male while an x sperm and an x egg produce a female
the part of the y-chromosome which is responsible for maleness is the sex-determining region of the y-chromosome the sry the sry activates sox9 which forms feedforward loops with fgf9 and pgd2 in the gonads allowing the levels of these genes to stay high enough in order to cause male development for example fgf9 is responsible for development of the spermatic cords and the multiplication of sertoli cells both of which are crucial to male sexual development
the zw sex-determination system where males have a zz (as opposed to zw) sex chromosome may be found in birds and some insects (mostly butterflies and moths) and other organisms members of the insect order hymenoptera such as ants and bees are often determined by haplodiploidy where most males are haploid and females and some sterile males are diploid
=== environmental determinationedit ===
in some species of reptiles including alligators sex is determined by the temperature at which the egg is incubated other species such as some snails practice sex change adults start out male then become female in tropical clown fish the dominant individual in a group becomes female while the other ones are male
in some arthropods sex is determined by infection bacteria of the genus wolbachia alter their sexuality some species consist entirely of zz individuals with sex determined by the presence of wolbachia
== secondary sex characteristicsedit ==
in those species with two sexes males may differ from females in ways other than production of spermatozoa in many insects and fish the male is smaller than the female in seed plants which exhibit alternation of generations the female and male parts are both included within the sporophyte sex organ of a single organism in mammals including humans males are typically larger than females in birds the male often exhibits a colorful plumage that attracts females
