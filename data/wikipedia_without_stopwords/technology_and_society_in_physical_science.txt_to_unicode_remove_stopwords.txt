ibm introduced first hard disk drive component ramac computer system digital data today still stored magnetically hard disks optically media cdroms information stored analog devices year digital storage capacity exceeded analog first time almost data stored worldwide held digitally hard disks optical devices digital magnetic tape estimated worldwide capacity store information electronic devices grew less exabytes exabytes doubling roughly every years
databases
database management systems emerged address problem storing retrieving large amounts data accurately quickly one earliest systems ibms information management system ims still widely deployed years later ims stores data hierarchically ted codd proposed alternative relational storage model based set theory predicate logic familiar concepts tables rows columns first commercially available relational database management system rdbms available oracle
database management systems consist number components together allow data store accessed simultaneously many users maintaining integrity characteristic databases structure data contain defined stored separately data database schema
extensible markup language xml become popular format data representation recent years although xml data stored normal file systems commonly held relational databases take advantage robust implementation verified years theoretical practical effort evolution standard generalized markup language sgml xmls textbased structure offers advantage machine humanreadable
data retrieval
relational database model introduced programminglanguage independent structured query language sql based relational algebra
terms data information synonymous anything stored data becomes information organized presented meaningfully worlds digital data unstructured stored variety different physical formats even within single organization data warehouses began developed integrate disparate stores typically contain data extracted various sources including external sources internet organized way facilitate decision support systems dss
data transmission
data transmission three aspects transmission propagation reception broadly categorized broadcasting information transmitted unidirectionally downstream telecommunications bidirectional upstream downstream channels
