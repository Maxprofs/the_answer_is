production
special effects showing giant animals unfortunate scientists deformity fairly advanced time real animals including rabbit guinea pig professor deemers lab used represent giant creatures real spider also used shots entire monster shown shooting miniatures reserved closeups final shots creature fire resulting rather convincing monster giant ants seen earlier bigbug film entire film jack arnold said decided film generally people afraid spiders
although set arizona film shot california locations desert scenes apple valley movie also filmed around rock formations dead mans point lucerne valley california frequently used movie location many early western films takes place fictional town desert rock arizona
like tarantula makes atmospheric use desert locations although radioactive isotope make appearance differs bigbug films mutation caused peaceful research wellintentioned scientist rather nuclear weapons andor mad genius director jack arnold use matte effects two years later show miniaturization rather gigantism incredible shrinking man also featured encounter spider real spider one appeared tarantula
films theatrical release poster featuring spider two eyes instead normal eight carrying woman fangs represent scene final film gaudy depiction womaninperil become time standard bmovie poster cliche would continue used years
