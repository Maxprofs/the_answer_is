== historyedit ==
=== colonialedit ===
harvard was formed in 1636 by vote of the great and general court of the massachusetts bay colony it was initially called new college or the college at new towne in 1638 the college became home for north america's first known printing press carried by the ship john of london in 1639 the college was renamed harvard college after deceased clergyman john harvard who was an alumnus of the university of cambridge he had left the school 779 and his library of some 400 books the charter creating the harvard corporation was granted in 1650
in the early years the college trained many puritan ministers the college offered a classic academic course based on the english university modelmany leaders in the colony had attended the university of cambridgebut one consistent with the prevailing puritan philosophy the college was never affiliated with any particular denomination but many of its earliest graduates went on to become clergymen in congregational and unitarian churches throughout new england an early brochure published in 1643 described the founding of the college as a response to the desire to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches
the leading boston divine increase mather served as president from 1685 to 1701 in 1708 john leverett became the first president who was not also a clergyman which marked a turning of the college toward intellectual independence from puritanism
=== 19th centuryedit ===
throughout the 18th century enlightenment ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among congregationalist ministers putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist calvinist parties when the hollis professor of divinity david tappan died in 1803 and the president of harvard joseph willard died a year later in 1804 a struggle broke out over their replacements henry ware was elected to the chair in 1805 and the liberal samuel webber was appointed to the presidency of harvard two years later which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional ideas at harvard to the dominance of liberal arminian ideas (defined by traditionalists as unitarian ideas)
in 1846 the natural history lectures of louis agassiz were acclaimed both in new york and on the campus at harvard college agassiz's approach was distinctly idealist and posited americans participation in the divine nature and the possibility of understanding intellectual existences agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the divine plan in all phenomena when it came to explaining life-forms agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence this dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of common sense realism derived from scottish philosophers thomas reid and dugald stewart whose works were part of the harvard curriculum at the time the popularity of agassiz's efforts to soar with plato probably also derived from other writings to which harvard students were exposed including platonic treatises by ralph cudworth john norrisand in a romantic vein samuel coleridge the library records at harvard reveal that the writings of plato and his early modern and romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the official philosophy of the more empirical and more deistic scottish school
charles w eliot president 18691909 eliminated the favored position of christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction while eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of american higher education he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education but by transcendentalist unitarian convictions derived from william ellery channing and ralph waldo emerson these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature the right and ability of each person to perceive truth and the indwelling god in each person
=== 20th centuryedit ===
during the 20th century harvard's international reputation grew as a burgeoning endowment and prominent professors expanded the university's scope rapid enrollment growth continued as new graduate schools were begun and the undergraduate college expanded radcliffe college established in 1879 as sister school of harvard college became one of the most prominent schools for women in the united states harvard became a founding member of the association of american universities in 1900
in the early 20th century the student body was predominately old-stock high-status protestants especially episcopalians congregationalists and presbyterians"a group later called wasps (white anglo-saxon protestants by the 1970s it was much more diversified
james bryant conant (president 19331953) reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee its preeminence among research institutions he saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy so conant devised programs to identify recruit and support talented youth in 1943 he asked the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be at the secondary as well as the college level the resulting report published in 1945 was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of american education in the 20th century
in 19451960 admissions policies were opened up to bring in students from a more diverse applicant pool no longer drawing mostly from rich alumni of select new england prep schools the undergraduate college was now open to striving middle class students from public schools many more jews and catholics were admitted but few blacks hispanics or asians
women remained segregated at radcliffe though more and more took harvard classes nonetheless harvard's undergraduate population remained predominantly male with about four men attending harvard college for every woman studying at radcliffe following the merger of harvard and radcliffe admissions in 1977 the proportion of female undergraduates steadily increased mirroring a trend throughout higher education in the united states harvard's graduate schools which had accepted females and other groups in greater numbers even before the college also became more diverse in the post-world war ii period
in 1999 radcliffe college founded in 1879 as the harvard annex for women merged formally with harvard university becoming the radcliffe institute for advanced study
=== 21st centuryedit ===
