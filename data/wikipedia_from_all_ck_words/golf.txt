golf is a club and ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible
golf is one of the few ball games that do not require a standardized playing area the game is played on a course with an arranged progression of either nine or 18 holes each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from and a putting green containing the actual hole there are other standard forms of terrain in between such as the fairway rough and hazards but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement
golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual known as stroke play or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team known as match play stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels
== origin ==
while the modern game of golf originated in 15th-century scotland the game's ancient origins are unclear and much debated some historians trace the sport back to the roman game of paganica in which participants used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball one theory asserts that paganica spread throughout europe as the romans conquered most of the continent during the first century bc and eventually evolved into the modern game others cite chuiwan ("chui means striking and wan means small ball) as the progenitor a chinese game played between the eighth and 14th centuries a ming dynasty scroll dating back to 1368 entitled the autumn banquet shows a member of the chinese imperial court swinging what appears to be a golf club at a small ball with the aim of sinking it into a hole the game is thought to have been introduced into europe during the middle ages another early game that resembled modern golf was known as cambuca in england and chambot in france the persian game chaugn is another possible ancient origin in addition kolven (a game involving a ball and curved bats) was played annually in loenen netherlands beginning in 1297 to commemorate the capture of the assassin of floris v a year earlier
the modern game originated in scotland where the first written record of golf is james ii's banning of the game in 1457 as an unwelcome distraction to learning archery james iv lifted the ban in 1502 when he became a golfer himself with golf clubs first recorded in 1503-1504 for golf clubbes and balles to the king that he playit with to many golfers the old course at st andrews a links course dating to before 1574 is considered to be a site of pilgrimage in 1764 the standard 18 hole golf course was created at st andrews when members modified the course from 22 to 18 holes golf is documented as being played on musselburgh links east lothian scotland as early as 2 march 1672 which is certified as the oldest golf course in the world by guinness world records the oldest surviving rules of golf were compiled in march 1744 for the company of gentlemen golfers later renamed the honourable company of edinburgh golfers which was played at leith scotland the world's oldest golf tournament in existence and golf's first major is the open championship which was first played on 17 october 1860 at prestwick golf club in ayrshire scotland with scottish golfers winning the earliest majors two scotsmen from dunfermline john reid and robert lockhart first demonstrated golf in the us by setting up a hole in an orchard in 1888 with reid setting up america's first golf club the same year st andrews golf club in yonkers new york
== golf course ==
a golf course consists of either 9 or 18 holes each with a teeing ground that is set off by two markers showing the bounds of the legal tee area fairway rough and other hazards and the putting green surrounded by the fringe with the pin (normally a flagstick) and cup
the levels of grass are varied to increase difficulty or to allow for putting in the case of the green while many holes are designed with a direct line-of-sight from the teeing area to the green some holes may bend either to the left or to the right this is commonly called a dogleg in reference to a dog's knee the hole is called a dogleg left if the hole angles leftwards and dogleg right if it bends right sometimes a hole's direction may bend twice this is called a double dogleg
a regular golf course consists of 18 holes but nine-hole courses are common and can be played twice through for a full round of 18 holes
early scottish golf courses were primarily laid out on links land soil-covered sand dunes directly inland from beaches this gave rise to the term golf links particularly applied to seaside courses and those built on naturally sandy soil inland
the first 18-hole golf course in the united states was on a sheep farm in downers grove illinois in 1892 the course is still there today
== play of the game ==
every round of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order a round typically consists of 18 holes that are played in the order determined by the course layout each hole is played once in the round on a standard course of 18 holes on a nine-hole course players may play a short game playing each hole once or a full round by playing each hole twice
playing a hole on a golf course is initiated by putting a ball into play by striking it with a club on the teeing ground (also called the tee box or simply the tee) for this first shot on each hole it is allowed but not required for the golfer to place the ball on a tee prior to striking it a tee is a small peg that can be used to elevate the ball slightly above the ground up to a few centimetres high tees are commonly made of wood but may be constructed of any material including plastic traditionally golfers used mounds of sand to elevate the ball and containers of sand were provided for the purpose a few courses still require sand to be used instead of peg tees to reduce litter and reduce damage to the teeing ground tees help reduce the interference of the ground or grass on the movement of the club making the ball easier to hit and also places the ball in the very centre of the striking face of the club (the sweet spot") for better distance
when the initial shot on a hole is intended to move the ball a long distance (typically more than 225 yards (206 m)) the shot is commonly called a drive and is generally made with a long-shafted large-headed wood club called a driver shorter holes may be initiated with other clubs such as higher-numbered woods or irons once the ball comes to rest the golfer strikes it again as many times as necessary using shots that are variously known as a lay-up an approach a pitch or a chip until the ball reaches the green where he or she then putts the ball into the hole (commonly called sinking the putt or holing out") the goal of getting the ball into the hole ("holing the ball) in as few strokes as possible may be impeded by obstacles such as areas of longer grass called rough (usually found alongside fairways) which both slows any ball that contacts it and makes it harder to advance a ball that has stopped on it doglegs which are changes in the direction of the fairway that often require shorter shots to play around them bunkers (or sand traps) and water hazards such as ponds or streams
in stroke play competitions played according to strict rules each player plays his or her ball until it is holed no matter how many strokes that may take in match play it is acceptable to simply pick up one's ball and surrender the hole after enough strokes have been made by a player that it is mathematically impossible for the player to win the hole it is also acceptable in informal stroke play to surrender the hole after hitting three strokes more than the par rating of the hole (a triple bogey - see below) while technically a violation of rule 3-2 this practice speeds play as a courtesy to others and avoids runaway scores excessive frustration and injuries caused by overexertion
the total distance from the first tee box to the 18th green can be quite long total yardages through the green can be in excess of 7000 yards and when adding in the travel distance between the green of one hole and the tee of the next even skilled players may easily travel five miles or more during a round at some courses electric golf carts are used to travel between shots which can speed-up play and allows participation by individuals unable to walk a whole round on other courses players generally walk the course either carrying their bag using a shoulder strap or using a golf trolley for their bag these trolleys may or may not be battery assisted at many amateur tournaments including u.s high school and college play players are required to walk and to carry their own bags but at the professional and top amateur level as well as at high-level private clubs players may be accompanied by caddies who carry and manage the players equipment and who are allowed by the rules to give advice on the play of the course a caddy's advice can only be given to the player or players for whom the caddy is working and not to other competing players
== rules and regulations ==
the rules of golf are internationally standardised and are jointly governed by the r&a spun off in 2004 from the royal and ancient golf club of st andrews (founded 1754) and the united states golf association (usga)
the underlying principle of the rules is fairness as stated on the back cover of the official rule book
play the ball as it lies play the course as you find it and if you cannot do either do what is fair
there are strict regulations regarding the amateur status of golfers essentially anybody who has ever received payment or compensation for giving instruction or played golf for money is not considered an amateur and may not participate in competitions limited solely to amateurs however amateur golfers may receive expenses that comply with strict guidelines and they may accept non-cash prizes within the limits established by the rules of amateur status
in addition to the officially printed rules golfers also abide by a set of guidelines called golf etiquette etiquette guidelines cover matters such as safety fairness pace of play and a player's obligation to contribute to the care of the course though there are no penalties for breach of etiquette rules players generally follow the rules of golf etiquette in an effort to improve everyone's playing experience
=== penalties ===
penalties are incurred in certain situations they are counted towards a player's score as if there were extra swing(s) at the ball strokes are added for rule infractions or for hitting one's ball into an unplayable situation
a lost ball or a ball hit out of bounds result in a penalty of one stroke and distance (rule 271) a one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player's equipment causes the ball to move or the removal of a loose impediment causes the ball to move (rule 182) if a golfer makes a stroke at the wrong ball (rule 192) or hits a fellow golfer's ball with a putt (rule 195) the player incurs a two-stroke penalty most rule infractions lead to stroke penalties but also can lead to disqualification disqualification could be from cheating signing for a lower score or from rule infractions that lead to improper play
== equipment ==
golf clubs are used to hit the golf ball each club is composed of a shaft with a lance (or grip") on the top end and a club head on the bottom long clubs which have a lower amount of degree loft are those meant to propel the ball a comparatively longer distance and short clubs a higher degree of loft and a comparatively shorter distance the actual physical length of each club is longer or shorter depending on the distance the club is intended to propel the ball
golf clubs have traditionally been arranged into three basic types woods are large-headed long-shafted clubs meant to propel the ball a long distance from relatively open lies such as the tee box and fairway of particular importance is the driver or 1-wood which is the lowest lofted wood club and in modern times has become highly specialized for making extremely long-distance tee shots up to 300 yards (270 m) or more in the hands of a professional golfer traditionally these clubs had heads made of a hardwood hence the name but virtually all modern woods are now made of metal such as titanium or of composite materials irons are shorter-shafted clubs with a metal head primarily consisting of a flat angled striking face traditionally the clubhead was forged from iron modern iron clubheads are investment-cast from a steel alloy irons of varying loft are used for a variety of shots from virtually anywhere on the course but most often for shorter-distance shots approaching the green or to get the ball out of tricky lies such as sand traps the third class is the putter which evolved from the irons to create a low-lofted balanced club designed to roll the ball along the green and into the hole putters are virtually always used on the green or in the surrounding rough/fringe a fourth class called hybrids evolved as a cross between woods and irons and are typically seen replacing the low-lofted irons with a club that provides similar distance but a higher launch angle and a more forgiving nature
a maximum of 14 clubs is allowed in a player's bag at one time during a stipulated round the choice of clubs is at the golfer's discretion although every club must be constructed in accordance with parameters outlined in the rules (clubs that meet these parameters are usually called conforming".) violation of these rules can result in disqualification
the exact shot hit at any given time on a golf course and which club is used to accomplish the shot are always completely at the discretion of the golfer in other words there is no restriction whatsoever on which club a golfer may or may not use at any time for any shot
golf balls are spherical usually white (although other colours are allowed) and minutely pock-marked by dimples that decrease aerodynamic drag by increasing air turbulence around the ball in motion which delays boundary layer separation and reduces the drag-inducing wake behind the ball thereby allowing the ball to fly farther
a tee is allowed only for the first stroke on each hole unless the player must hit a provisional tee shot or replay his or her first shot from the tee
many golfers wear golf shoes with metal or plastic spikes designed to increase traction thus allowing for longer and more accurate shots
a golf bag is used to transport golf clubs and the player's other or personal equipment golf bags have several pockets designed for carrying equipment and supplies such as tees balls and gloves golf bags can be carried pulled on a trolley or harnessed to a motorized golf cart during play golf bags have both a hand strap and shoulder strap for carrying and sometimes have retractable legs that allow the bag to stand upright when at rest
== stroke mechanics ==
the golf swing is outwardly similar to many other motions involving swinging a tool or playing implement such as an axe or a baseball bat however unlike many of these motions the result of the swing is highly dependent on several sub-motions being properly aligned and timed to ensure that the club travels up to the ball in line with the desired path the clubface is in line with the swing path and the ball impacts the centre or sweet spot of the clubface the ability to do this consistently across a complete set of clubs with a wide range of shaft lengths and clubface areas is a key skill for any golfer and takes a significant effort to achieve
golfers start with the non-dominant side of the body facing the target (for a right-hander the target is to their left) at address the player's body and the centerline of the club face are positioned parallel to the desired line of travel with the feet either perpendicular to that line or slightly splayed outward the feet are commonly shoulder-width apart for middle irons and putters narrower for short irons and wider for long irons and woods the ball is typically positioned more to the front of the player's stance (closer to the leading foot) for lower-lofted clubs with the usual ball position for a drive being just behind the arch of the leading foot the ball is placed further back in the player's stance (toward the trailing foot) as the loft of the club to be used increases most iron shots and putts are made with the ball roughly centered in the stance while a few mid- and short-iron shots are made with the ball slightly behind the centre of the stance to ensure consistent contact between the ball and clubface so the ball is on its way before the club continues down into the turf
the golfer chooses a golf club grip and stroke appropriate to the distance
the drive or full swing is used on the teeing ground and fairway typically with a wood or long iron to produce the maximum distance capable with the club in the extreme the windup can end with the shaft of the club parallel to the ground above the player's shoulders
the approach or 3/4 swing is used in medium- and long-distance situations where an exact distance and good accuracy is preferable to maximum possible distance such as to place the ball on the green or lay up in front of a hazard the windup or backswing of such a shot typically ends up with the shaft of the club pointing straight upwards or slightly towards the player
the chip or half-swing is used for relatively short-distance shots near the green with high-lofted irons and wedges the goal of the chip is to land the ball safely on the green allowing it to roll out towards the hole it can also be used from other places to accurately position the ball into a more advantageous lie the backswing typically ends with the head of the club between hip and head height
the putt is used in short-distance shots on or near the green typically made with the eponymous putter although similar strokes can be made with medium to high-numbered irons to carry a short distance in the air and then roll (a bump and run") the backswing and follow-through of the putt are both abbreviated compared to other strokes with the head of the club rarely rising above the knee the goal of the putt is usually to put the ball in the hole although a long-distance putt may be called a lag and is made with the primary intention of simply closing distance to the hole or otherwise placing the ball advantageously
having chosen a club and stroke to produce the desired distance the player addresses the ball by taking their stance to the side of it and (except when the ball lies in a hazard) grounding the club behind the ball the golfer then takes their backswing rotating the club their arms and their upper body away from the ball and then begins their swing bringing the clubhead back down and around to hit the ball a proper golf swing is a complex combination of motions and slight variations in posture or positioning can make a great deal of difference in how well the ball is hit and how straight it travels the general goal of a player making a full swing is to propel the clubhead as fast as possible while maintaining a single plane of motion of the club and clubhead to send the clubhead into the ball along the desired path of travel and with the clubhead also pointing that direction
accuracy and consistency is typically stressed over pure distance a player with a straight drive that travels only 220 yards (200 m) will nevertheless be able to accurately place the ball into a favourable lie on the fairway and can make up for the lesser distance of any given club by simply using more club (a lower loft) on their tee shot or on subsequent fairway and approach shots however a golfer with a drive that may go 280 yards (260 m) but often doesn't fly straight will be less able to position their ball advantageously the ball may hook pull draw fade push or slice off the intended line and land out of bounds or in the rough or hazards and thus the player will require many more strokes to hole out
=== musculature ===
a golf stroke uses muscles on core (especially erector spinae muscles and latissimus dorsi muscle when turning) hamstring shoulder and wrist stronger muscles on wrist can prevent wrists from being twisted at swings while stronger shoulders increase the turning force weak wrists can also deliver the impacts to elbows and even neck and lead to injury of them (when a muscle contracts it pulls equally from both ends and in order to have movement at only one end of the muscle other muscles must come into play to stabilize the bone to which the other end of the muscle is attached.) golf is a unilateral exercise that can break body balances requiring exercises to keep the balance in muscles
=== types of putting ===
putting is considered to be the most important component of the game of golf as the game of golf has evolved there have been many different putting techniques and grips that have been devised to give golfers the best chance to make putts when the game originated golfers would putt with their dominate hand on the bottom of the grip and their weak hand on top of the grip this grip and putting style is known as conventional there are many variations of conventional including overlap where the golfer overlaps the off hand index finger onto off the dominant pinky interlock where the offhand index finger interlocks with the dominant pinky and ring finger double or triple overlap and so on recently cross handed putting has become a popular trend amongst professional golfers and amateurs cross handed putting is the idea that the dominant hand is on top of the grip where the weak hand is on the bottom this grip restricts the motion in your dominant hand and eliminates the possibility of wrist breakdowns through the putting stroke
other notable putting styles include the claw a style that has the grip directly in between the thumb and index finger of the dominant hand while the palm faces the target the weak hand placed normally on the putter anchored putting a style that requires a longer putter shaft that can be anchored into the players stomach or below the chin the idea is to stabilize one end of the putter thus creating a more consistent pendulum stroke this style will be banned in 2016 on the profession circuits
== scoring and handicapping ==
=== par ===
a hole is classified by its par meaning the number of strokes a skilled golfer should require to complete play of the hole the minimum par of any hole is 3 because par always includes a stroke for the tee shot and two putts pars of 4 and 5 strokes are ubiquitous on golf courses more rarely a few courses feature par-6 and even par-7 holes strokes other than the tee shot and putts are expected to be made from the fairway for example a skilled golfer expects to reach the green on a par-4 hole in two strokesone from the tee (the drive") and another second stroke to the green (the approach")and then roll the ball into the hole in two putts for par putting the ball on the green with two strokes remaining for putts is called making green in regulation or gir missing a gir does not necessarily mean a golfer won't make par but it does make doing so more difficult as it reduces the number of putts available conversely making a gir does not guarantee a par as the player might require three or more putts to hole out professional golfers typically make between 60% and 70% of greens in regulation
the primary factor for classifying the par of a relatively straight hazard-free hole is the distance from the tee to the green a typical par-3 hole is less than 250 yards (225 m) in length with a par-4 hole ranging between 251 and 475 yards (225434 m) and a par-5 hole being longer than 475 yards (435 m) the rare par-6s can stretch well over 650 yards (595 m) these distances are based on the typical scratch golfer's drive distance of between 240 and 280 yards (220 and 260 m) a green further than the average player's drive will require additional shots from the fairway however other considerations must be taken into account the key question is how many strokes would a scratch golfer take to make the green by playing along the fairway? the grade of the land from the tee to the hole might increase or decrease the carry and rolling distance of shots as measured linearly along the ground sharp turns or hazards may require golfers to lay up on the fairway in order to change direction or hit over the hazard with their next shot these design considerations will affect how even a scratch golfer would play the hole irrespective of total distance from tee to green and must be included in a determination of par however a par score never includes expected penalty strokes as a scratch player is never expected to hit a ball into a water hazard or other unplayable situation so the placement of hazards only affect par when considering how a scratch golfer would avoid them
eighteen-hole courses typically total to an overall par score of 72 for a complete round this is based on an average par of 4 for every hole and so is often arrived at by designing a course with an equal number of par-5 and par-3 holes the rest being par-4 many combinations exist that total to par-72 and other course pars exist from 68 up to 76 and are not less worthy than courses of par-72 additionally in some countries including the united states courses are classified according to their play difficulty which may be used to calculate a golfer's playing handicap for a given course
the two primary difficulty ratings in the u.s are the course rating which is effectively the expected score for a zero-handicap scratch golfer playing the course (and may differ from the course par) and the slope rating which is a measure of how much worse a bogey golfer (with an 18 handicap) would be expected to play than a scratch golfer these two numbers are available for any usga-sanctioned course and are used in a weighted system to calculate handicaps (see below)
==== scoring ====
the goal is to play as few strokes per round as possible a golfer's score is usually expressed as the difference between the player's number of strokes and the par score a hole in one (or an ace") occurs when a golfer sinks his ball into the cup with his first stroke from the tee common scores for a hole also have specific terms
in a typical professional tournament or among scratch amateur players birdie-bogey play is common a player will lose a stroke by bogeying a hole then gain one by scoring a birdie eagles are uncommon but not rare however only 18 players have scored an albatross in a pga men's major tournament
=== basic forms of golf ===
there are two basic forms of golf play match play and stroke play stroke play is more popular
==== match play ====
two players (or two teams) play each hole as a separate contest against each other in what is called match play the party with the lower score wins that hole or if the scores of both players or teams are equal the hole is halved (or tied) the game is won by the party that wins more holes than the other in the case that one team or player has taken a lead that cannot be overcome in the number of holes remaining to be played the match is deemed to be won by the party in the lead and the remainder of the holes are not played for example if one party already has a lead of six holes and only five holes remain to be played on the course the match is over and the winning party is deemed to have won 6 & 5 at any given point if the lead is equal to the number of holes remaining the party leading the match is said to be dormie and the match is continued until the party increases the lead by one hole or ties any of the remaining holes thereby winning the match or until the match ends in a tie with the lead player's opponent winning all remaining holes when the game is tied after the predetermined number of holes have been played it may be continued until one side takes a one-hole lead
==== stroke play ====
the score achieved for each and every hole of the round or tournament is added to produce the total score and the player with the lowest score wins in stroke play stroke play is the game most commonly played by professional golfers if there is a tie after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament a playoff takes place between all tied players playoffs either are sudden death or employ a pre-determined number of holes anywhere from three to a full 18 in sudden death a player who scores lower on a hole than all of his opponents wins the match if at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre-determined number of holes then play continues in sudden death format where the first player to win a hole wins the tournament
=== other forms of play ===
the other forms of play in the game of golf are bogey competition skins 9-points stableford team play and unofficial team variations
==== bogey competition ====
a bogey competition is a scoring format sometimes seen in at informal tournaments its scoring is similar to match play except each player compares their hole score to the hole's par rating instead of the score of another player the player wins the hole if they score a birdie or better they lose the hole if they score a bogey or worse and they halve the hole by scoring par by recording only this simple win-loss-halve score on the sheet a player can shrug off a very poorly-played hole with a simple - mark and move on as used in competitions the player or pair with the best win-loss differential wins the competition
==== skins ====
a skins game is a variation on match play where each hole has an amount of money (the skin") attached this may be prize money at the professional level (the most famous event to use these rules was the lg skins game played at indian wells golf resort in california until 2008) or an amount wagered for each hole among amateur players the player with the lowest score on the hole wins the skin for that hole if two or more players tie for the lowest score the skin carries over to the next hole this continues until a player wins a hole outright which may (and often does) result in a player receiving money for a previous hole that they hadn't tied for if players tie the 18th hole either all players or only the tying players repeat the 18th hole until an outright winner is decided for that hole (and all undecided skins)
==== 9-points ====
a nine-point game is another variant of match play typically played among threesomes where each hole is worth a total of nine points the player with the lowest score on a hole receives five points the next-lowest score 3 and the next-lowest score 1 ties are generally resolved by summing the points contested and dividing them among the tying players a two-way tie for first is worth four points to both players a two-way tie for second is worth two points to both players and a three-way tie is worth three points to each player the player with the highest score after 18 holes (in which there are 162 points to be awarded) wins the game this format can be used to wager on the game systematically players each contribute the same amount of money to the pot and a dollar value is assigned to each point scored (or each point after 18) based on the amount of money in the pot with any overage going to the overall winner
==== stableford ====
the stableford system is a simplification of stroke play that awards players points based on their score relative to the hole's par the score for a hole is calculated by taking the par score adding 2 then subtracting the player's hole score making the result zero if negative alternately stated a double bogey or worse is zero points a bogey is worth one point par is two a birdie three an eagle four and so on the advantages of this system over stroke play are a more natural higher is better scoring the ability to compare stableford scores between plays on courses with different total par scores (scoring an even in stroke play will always give a stableford score of 36) discouraging the tendency to abandon the entire game after playing a particularly bad hole (a novice playing by strict rules may score as high as an 8 or 10 on a single difficult hole their stableford score for the hole would be zero which puts them only two points behind par no matter how badly they played) and the ability to simply pick up one's ball once it is impossible to score any points for the hole which speeds play
the usga and r&a sanction a modified stableford system for scratch players which makes par worth zero a birdie worth 2 eagle 5 and double-eagle 8 while a bogey is a penalty of -1 and a double-bogey or worse -3 as with the original system the highest score wins the game and terrible scores on one or two holes won't wreck an entire game but this system rewards bogey-birdie play more than the original encouraging golfers to try to make the riskier birdie putt or eagle chipshot instead of simply parring each hole
==== team play ====
foursome defined in rule 29 this is played between two teams of two players each in which each team has only one ball and players alternate playing it for example if players a and b form a team a tees off on the first hole b will play the second shot a the third and so on until the hole is finished on the second hole b will tee off (regardless who played the last putt on the first hole) then a plays the second shot and so on foursomes can be played as match play or stroke play
fourball defined in rules 30 and 31 this is also played between two teams of two players each but every player plays their own ball and for each team the lower score on each hole counts fourballs can be played as match play or stroke play
===== unofficial team variations =====
scramble also known as ambrose or best-shot each player in a team tees off on each hole and the players decide which shot was best every player then plays their second shot from within a clublength of where the best shot has come to rest (and no closer to the hole) and the procedure is repeated until the hole is finished this system is very common at informal tournaments such as for charity as it speeds play (due to the reduced number of shots taken from bad lies) allows teams of varying sizes and allows players of widely varying skill levels to participate without a profoundly negative impact on team score
champagne scramble a combination of a scramble and best-ball only the first shot of each hole is a scramble all players tee off decide on the best tee shot then each player plays their own ball starting at that point until they hole out without deciding any further best shots the best score amongst the team's players is counted
better ball or best-ball like fourball each player plays the hole as normal but the lowest score of all the players on the team counts as the team's score for the hole
greensome (also known as scotch foursomes) also called modified alternate shot this is played in pairs both players tee off and then pick the best shot as in a scramble the player who did not shoot the best first shot plays the second shot the play then alternates as in a foursome a variant of greensome is sometimes played where the opposing team chooses which of their opponent's tee shots the opponents should use the player who did not shoot the chosen first shot plays the second shot play then continues as a greensome
wolf (also known as ship captain & crew captain pig) a version of match play with a foursome an order of play for each player is established for the duration of the round the first player hits a ball from the tee then waits for each successive player to hit (2nd 3rd and 4th) after each player hits the 1st player has the option of choosing a partner for the hole (the 1st player is the wolf for that hole) usually by calling wolf before the next player hits once a partner is picked each two-some (the wolf and his or her partner vs the remaining two players) scores their total strokes and the winning two-some is awarded 1-point each for winning a hole and zero points for tying the next hole the rotation moves forward (e.g the 2nd player is now hitting 1st and the wolf and the previous wolf hits last) a wolf can decide to go alone to win extra points but they must beat all other players in stroke play on that hole if alone the wolf is awarded 2-points for going alone after everyone has hit or 4 points for declaring lone wolf before anyone else hits if the lone wolf loses to even one player the 3 other players get 1-point each the winner is the player with the most points at the end of the round strategically care must be taken not to let a low-handicap player run away with all the points by being constantly paired with the wolf.
shotgun starts are mainly used for amateur tournament play in this variant each of the groups playing starts their game on a different hole allowing for all players to start and end their round at roughly the same time all 18 holes are still played but a player or foursome may for instance start on hole 5 play through to the 18th hole then continue with hole 1 and end on hole 4 this speeds the completion of the entire event as players are not kept waiting for progressive tee times at the first hole this form of play as a minor variation to stroke or match play is neither defined nor disallowed by strict rules and so is used according to local rules for an event
=== handicap systems ===
a handicap is a numerical measure of an amateur golfer's ability to play golf over the course of 18 holes a player's handicap generally represents the number of strokes above par that the player will make over the course of an above-average round of golf the better the player the lower their handicap is someone with a handicap of 0 or less is often called a scratch golfer and would typically score or beat the course par on a round of play (depending on course difficulty)
calculating a handicap is often complicated the general reason being that golf courses are not uniformly challenging from course to course or between skill levels a player scoring even par on course a might average four over par on course b while a player averaging 20 over par on course a might average only 16 over on course b so to the scratch golfer course b is more difficult but to the bogey golfer course a is more difficult the reasons for this are inherent in the types of challenges presented by the same course to both golfers distance is often a problem for amateur bogey golfers with slower swing speeds who get less distance with each club and so typically require more shots to get to the green raising their score compared to a scratch golfer with a stronger swing however courses are often designed with hazard placement to mitigate this advantage forcing the scratch player to lay up to avoid bunkers or water while the bogey golfer is more or less unaffected as the hazard lies out of their range finally terrain features and fairway maintenance can affect golfers of all skill levels narrowing the fairway by adding obstacles or widening the rough on each side will typically increase the percentage of shots made from disadvantageous lies increasing the challenge for all players
by usga rules handicap calculation first requires calculating a handicap differential for each round of play the player has completed by strict rules that in itself is a function of the player's gross adjusted score (adjustments can be made to mitigate various deviations either from strict rules or from a player's normal capabilities for handicap purposes only) and two course-specific difficulty ratings the course rating a calculated expected score for a hypothetical scratch golfer and the slope rating a number based on how much worse a hypothetical 20-handicap bogey golfer would score compared to the scratch golfer the average slope rating of all usga-rated courses as of 2012 is 113 which also factors into the differential computation
the most recent differentials are logged up to 20 of them and then the best of these (the number used depends on the number available) are selected averaged multiplied by 96 (an excellence factor that reduces the handicap of higher-scoring players encouraging them to play better and thus lower their handicap) and truncated to the tenths place to produce the handicap index additional calculations can be used to place higher significance on a player's recent tournament scores a player's handicap index is then multiplied by the slope rating of the course to be played divided by the average slope rating of 113 then rounded to the nearest integer to produce the player's course handicap
once calculated the course handicap is applied in stroke play by simply reducing the player's gross score by the handicap to produce a net score so a gross score of 96 with a handicap of 22 would produce a net score of 74 in match play the lower handicap is subtracted from the higher handicap and the resulting handicap strokes are awarded to the higher handicapper by distributing them among the holes according to each hole's difficulty holes are ranked on the scorecard from 1 to 18 (or however many holes are available) and one stroke is applied to each hole from the most difficult to the least difficult so if one player has a 9 handicap and another has a 25 handicap the 25-handicap player receives one handicap stroke on each of the most difficult 16 holes (25-9) if the 25-handicapper were playing against a scratch golfer (zero handicap) all 25 strokes would be distributed first by applying one stroke to each hole then applying the remaining strokes one each to the most difficult 7 holes so the handicap player would subtract 2 strokes from each of the most difficult 7 holes and 1 each from the remaining 11
handicap systems have potential for abuse by players who may intentionally play badly to increase their handicap ("throwing their cap") before playing to their potential at an important event with a valuable prize for this reason professional golf associations do not use them but they can be calculated and used along with other criteria to determine the relative strengths of various professional players touring professionals being the best of the best often have negative handicaps they can be expected on average to score lower than the course rating on any course
== popularity ==
in 2005 golf digest calculated that the countries with most golf courses per capita in order were scotland new zealand australia ireland canada wales united states sweden and england (countries with fewer than 500,000 people were excluded)
the number of course in other territories increases an example of this being the expansion of golf in china the first golf course in china opened in 1984 but by the end of 2009 there were roughly 600 in the country for much of the 21st century development of new golf courses in china has been officially banned (with the exception of the island province of hainan) but the number of courses had nonetheless tripled from 2004 to 2009 the ban has been evaded with the government's tacit approval simply by not mentioning golf in any development plans
in the united states the number of people who play golf twenty-five times or more per year decreased from 6.9 million in 2000 to 4.6 million in 2005 according to the national golf foundation the ngf reported that the number who played golf at all decreased from 30 to 26 million over the same period

== professional golf ==
the majority of professional golfers work as club or teaching professionals ("pros") and only compete in local competitions a small elite of professional golfers are tournament pros who compete full-time on international tours many club and teaching professionals working in the golf industry start as caddies or with a general interest in the game finding employment at golf courses and eventually moving on to certifications in their chosen profession these programs include independent institutions and universities and those that eventually lead to a class a golf professional certification touring professionals typically start as amateur players who attain their pro status after success in major tournaments that win them either prize money and/or notice from corporate sponsors jack nicklaus for example gained widespread notice by finishing second in the 1960 u.s open to champion arnold palmer with a 72-hole score of 282 (the best score to date in that tournament by an amateur) he played one more amateur year in 1961 winning that year's u.s amateur championship before turning pro in 1962
=== instruction ===
golf instruction involves the teaching and learning of the game of golf proficiency in teaching golf instruction requires not only technical and physical ability but also knowledge of the rules and etiquette of the game in some countries golf instruction is best performed by teachers certified by the professional golfers association some top instructors who work with professional golfers have become quite well known in their own right instructors use a combination of physical conditioning mental visualization classroom sessions club fitting driving range instruction on-course play under real conditions and review of videotaped swings in slow motion to teach golf
=== golf tours ===
there are at least twenty professional golf tours each run by a pga or an independent tour organization which is responsible for arranging events finding sponsors and regulating the tour typically a tour has members who are entitled to compete in most of its events and also invites non-members to compete in some of them gaining membership of an elite tour is highly competitive and most professional golfers never achieve it
perhaps the most widely known tour is the pga tour which tends to attract the strongest fields outside the four majors and the four world golf championships events this is due mostly to the fact that most pga tour events have a first prize of at least 800,000 usd the european tour which attracts a substantial number of top golfers from outside north america ranks second to the pga tour in worldwide prestige some top professionals from outside north america play enough tournaments to maintain membership on both the pga tour and european tour in three of the four most recent golf seasons both tours money titles were claimed by the same individual with luke donald doing so in 2011 and rory mcilroy in 2012 and 2014 in 2013 henrik stenson won the fedex cup points race on the pga tour and the european tour money title but did not top the pga tour money list (that honour going to tiger woods)
the other leading men's tours include the japan golf tour the asian tour (asia outside japan) the pga tour of australasia and the sunshine tour (for southern africa primarily south africa) the japan australasian sunshine pga and european tours are the charter members of the trade body of the world's main tours the international federation of pga tours founded in 1996 the asian tour became a full member in 1999 the canadian tour became an associate member of the federation in 2000 and the tour de las amricas (latin america) became an associate member of the federation in 2007 the federation underwent a major expansion in 2009 that saw eleven new tours become full members the canadian tour tour de las amricas china golf association the korea professional golfers association professional golf tour of india and the operators of all six major women's tours worldwide the oneasia tour founded in 2009 is not a member of the federation but was founded as a joint venture of the australasia china japan and korean tours in 2011 the tour de las amricas was effectively taken over by the pga tour and in 2012 was folded into the new pga tour latinoamrica also in 2012 the canadian tour was renamed pga tour canada after it agreed to be taken over by the pga tour all men's tours that are federation members except the india tour offer points in the official world golf ranking (owgr) to players who place sufficiently high in their events the oneasia tour also offers ranking points
golf is unique in having lucrative competition for older players there are several senior tours for men aged fifty and over arguably the best known of which is the u.s.-based champions tour
there are six principal tours for women each based in a different country or continent the most prestigious of these is the united states-based lpga tour all of the principal tours offer points in the women's world golf rankings for high finishers in their events
all of the leading professional tours for under-50 players have an official developmental tour in which the leading players at the end of the season will earn a tour card on the main tour for the following season examples include the web.com tour which feeds to the pga tour and the challenge tour which is the developmental tour of the european tour the web.com and challenge tours also offer owgr points
=== men's major championships ===
the major championships are the four most prestigious men's tournaments of the year in chronological order they are the masters the u.s open the open championship (referred to in north america as the british open) and the pga championship
the fields for these events include the top several dozen golfers from all over the world the masters has been played at augusta national golf club in augusta georgia since its inception in 1934 it is the only major championship that is played at the same course each year the u.s open and pga championship are played at courses around the united states while the open championship is played at courses around the united kingdom
prior to the advent of the pga championship and the masters the four majors were the u.s open the u.s amateur the open championship and the british amateur
=== women's major championships ===
women's golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors the list of majors recognised by the dominant women's tour the lpga tour in the u.s. has changed several times over the years with the most recent changes occurring in 2001 and 2013 like the pga tour the (u.s.) lpga tour long had four majors but now has five the ana inspiration (previously known by several other names most recently the kraft nabisco championship) the women's pga championship (previously known as the lpga championship) the u.s women's open the women's british open (which replaced the du maurier classic as a major in 2001) and the evian championship (added as the fifth major in 2013) only the last two are also recognised as majors by the ladies european tour however the significance of this is limited as the lpga is far more dominant in women's golf than the pga tour is in mainstream men's golf for example the bbc has been known to use the u.s definition of women's majors without qualifying it also the ladies golf union the governing body for women's golf in great britain and ireland stated on its official website that the women's british open was the only women's major to be played outside the u.s. (this was before the elevation of the evian championship to major status) for many years the ladies european tour tacitly acknowledged the dominance of the lpga tour by not scheduling any of its own events to conflict with the three lpga majors played in the u.s. but that changed beginning in 2008 when the let scheduled an event opposite the lpga championship the second-richest women's tour the lpga of japan tour does not recognise any of the u.s lpga or european majors as it has its own set of majors (historically three since 2008 four) however these events attract little notice outside japan
=== senior major championships ===
senior (aged fifty and over) men's golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors the list of senior majors on the u.s.-based champions tour has changed over the years but always by expansion the champions tour now recognises five majors the senior pga championship the tradition the senior players championship the united states senior open and the senior (british) open championship
of the five events the senior pga is by far the oldest having been founded in 1937 the other events all date from the 1980s when senior golf became a commercial success as the first golf stars of the television era such as arnold palmer and gary player reached the relevant age the senior british open was not recognised as a major by the champions tour until 2003 the european seniors tour recognises only the senior pga and the two senior opens as majors however the champions tour is arguably more dominant in global senior golf than the u.s lpga is in global women's golf
