screw mechanism converts rotational motion linear motion torque rotational force linear force one six classical simple machines common form consists cylindrical shaft helical grooves ridges called threads around outside screw passes hole another object medium threads inside hole mesh screws threads shaft screw rotated relative stationary threads screw moves along axis relative medium surrounding example rotating wood screw forces wood screw mechanisms either screw shaft rotate threaded hole stationary object threaded collar nut rotate around stationary screw shaft geometrically screw viewed narrow inclined plane wrapped around cylinder
like simple machines screw amplify force small rotational force torque shaft exert large axial force load smaller pitch distance screws threads greater mechanical advantage ratio output input force screws widely used threaded fasteners hold objects together devices screw tops containers vises screw jacks screw presses
mechanisms use principle also called screws dont necessarily shaft threads example corkscrew helixshaped rod sharp point archimedes screw water pump uses rotating helical chamber move water uphill common principle screws rotating helix cause linear motion

lead pitchedit
fineness coarseness screws threads defined two closely related quantities
lead defined axial distance parallel screws axis screw travels one complete revolution shaft lead determines mechanical advantage screw smaller lead higher mechanical advantage
pitch defined axial distance crests adjacent threads
screws called single start screws single helical thread wrapped around lead pitch equal differ multiple start screws several intertwined threads screws lead equal pitch multiplied number starts multiplestart screws used large linear motion given rotation desired example screw caps bottles ball point pens
handednessedit
helix screws thread twist two possible directions known handedness screw threads oriented seen screw shaft moves away viewer screw tightened turned clockwise direction known righthanded rh thread follows right hand grip rule fingers right hand curled around shaft direction rotation thumb point direction motion shaft threads oriented opposite direction known lefthanded lh
common convention righthandedness default handedness screw threads therefore threaded parts fasteners righthanded threads one explanation righthanded threads became standard righthanded person tightening righthanded screw screwdriver easier tightening lefthanded screw uses stronger supinator muscle arm rather weaker pronator muscle since people righthanded righthanded threads became standard threaded fasteners lefthanded screw threads used machines applications
rotation shaft would cause conventional righthanded nut loosen rather tighten due fretting induced precession examples include
left hand pedal bicycle
lefthand screw holding circular saw blade bench grinder wheel
devices threads either end like turnbuckles removable pipe segments parts one righthanded one lefthanded thread turning piece tightens loosens threads time
gas supply connections prevent dangerous misconnections example gas welding flammable gas supply line attached lefthanded threads accidentally switched oxygen supply uses righthanded threads
make useless public thus discouraging theft lefthanded light bulbs used railway subway stations
coffin lids said traditionally held lefthanded screws
screw threadsedit
different shapes profiles threads used screws employed different purposes screw threads standardized parts made different manufacturers mate correctly
thread angleedit
thread angle included angle measured section parallel axis two bearing faces thread angle axial load force normal bearing surface approximately equal half thread angle thread angle great effect friction efficiency screw well wear rate strength greater thread angle greater angle load vector surface normal larger normal force threads required support given load therefore increasing thread angle increases friction wear screw
outward facing angled thread bearing surface acted load force also applies radial outward force nut causing tensile stress radial bursting force increases increasing thread angle tensile strength nut material insufficient excessive load nut large thread angle split nut
thread angle also effect strength threads threads large angle wide root compared size stronger

c whitworth british standard similar british standard replaced unified thread standard
machine linkages lead screws jackscrews contrast friction must minimized therefore threads smaller angles used
d square thread strongest lowest friction thread thread angle doesnt apply bursting force nut however difficult fabricate requiring single point cutting tool due need undercut edges used highload applications jackscrews lead screws mostly replaced acme thread modified square thread small thread angle sometimes used instead cheaper manufacture
e acme thread thread angle higher friction square thread easier manufacture used split nut adjust wear widely used vises cclamps valves scissor jacks lead screws machines like lathes
f buttress thread used highload applications load force applied one direction screw jacks angle bearing surface efficient square thread stronger easier manufacture
g knuckle thread similar square thread corners rounded protect damage also giving higher friction lowstrength applications manufactured cheaply sheet stock rolling used light bulbs sockets

selflocking propertyedit
large frictional forces cause screws practical use selflocking also called nonreciprocal nonoverhauling means applying torque shaft cause turn amount axial load force shaft cause turn back way even applied torque zero contrast simple machines reciprocal non locking means load force great enough move backwards overhaul thus machine used either direction example lever force load end large move backwards work applied force screws designed selflocking absence torque shaft stay whatever position left however screw mechanisms large enough pitch good lubrication selflocking overhaul push drill use screw backwards sense applying axial force shaft turn screw
selflocking property one reason large use screw threaded fasteners wood screws sheet metal screws studs bolts tightening fastener turning puts compression force materials parts fastened together amount force parts cause screw untighten property also basis use screws screw top container lids vises cclamps screw jacks heavy object raised turning jack shaft shaft released stay whatever height raised
