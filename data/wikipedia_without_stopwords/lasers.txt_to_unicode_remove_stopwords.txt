fundamentals
lasers distinguished light sources coherence spatial coherence typically expressed output narrow beam diffractionlimited laser beams focused tiny spots achieving high irradiance low divergence order concentrate power great distance
temporal longitudinal coherence implies polarized wave single frequency whose phase correlated relatively great distance coherence length along beam beam produced thermal incoherent light source instantaneous amplitude phase vary randomly respect time position thus short coherence length
lasers characterized according wavelength vacuum single wavelength lasers actually produce radiation several modes slightly differing frequencies wavelengths often single polarization although temporal coherence implies monochromaticity lasers emit broad spectrum light emit different wavelengths light simultaneously lasers single spatial mode consequently light beams diverge required diffraction limit however devices classified lasers based method producing light ie stimulated emission lasers employed applications light required spatial temporal coherence could produced using simpler technologies

laser physics
electrons interact electromagnetic fields important understanding chemistry physics
stimulated emission
classical view energy electron orbiting atomic nucleus larger orbits nucleus atom however quantum mechanical effects force electrons take discrete positions orbitals thus electrons found specific energy levels atom two shown
electron absorbs energy either light photons heat phonons receives incident quantum energy transitions allowed discrete energy levels two shown leads emission lines absorption lines
electron excited lower higher energy level stay way forever electron excited state may decay lower energy state occupied according particular time constant characterizing transition electron decays without external influence emitting photon called spontaneous emission phase associated photon emitted random material many atoms excited state may thus result radiation spectrally limited centered around one wavelength light individual photons would common phase relationship would emanate random directions mechanism fluorescence thermal emission
external electromagnetic field frequency associated transition affect quantum mechanical state atom electron atom makes transition two stationary states neither shows dipole field enters transition state dipole field acts like small electric dipole dipole oscillates characteristic frequency response external electric field frequency probability atom entering transition state greatly increased thus rate transitions two stationary states enhanced beyond due spontaneous emission transition higher state called absorption destroys incident photon photons energy goes powering increased energy higher state transition higher lower energy state however produces additional photon process stimulated emission
gain medium cavity
gain medium excited external source energy excited state lasers medium consists population atoms excited state means outside light source electrical field supplies energy atoms absorb transformed excited states
gain medium laser normally material controlled purity size concentration shape amplifies beam process stimulated emission described material state gas liquid solid plasma gain medium absorbs pump energy raises electrons higherenergy excited quantum states particles interact light either absorbing emitting photons emission spontaneous stimulated latter case photon emitted direction light passing number particles one excited state exceeds number particles lowerenergy state population inversion achieved amount stimulated emission due light passes larger amount absorption hence light amplified makes optical amplifier optical amplifier placed inside resonant optical cavity one obtains laser oscillator
situations possible obtain lasing single pass em radiation gain medium produces laser beam without need resonant reflective cavity see example nitrogen laser thus reflection resonant cavity usually required laser absolutely necessary

continuous wave operation required population inversion gain medium continually replenished steady pump source lasing media impossible lasers would require pumping laser high continuous power level would impractical destroy laser producing excessive heat lasers cannot run cw mode
pulsed operation
pulsed operation lasers refers laser classified continuous wave optical power appears pulses duration repetition rate encompasses wide range technologies addressing number different motivations lasers pulsed simply cannot run continuous mode
cases application requires production pulses large energy possible since pulse energy equal average power divided repetition rate goal sometimes satisfied lowering rate pulses energy built pulses laser ablation example small volume material surface work piece evaporated heated short time whereas supplying energy gradually would allow heat absorbed bulk piece never attaining sufficiently high temperature particular point
applications rely peak pulse power rather energy pulse especially order obtain nonlinear optical effects given pulse energy requires creating pulses shortest possible duration utilizing techniques qswitching
optical bandwidth pulse cannot narrower reciprocal pulse width case extremely short pulses implies lasing considerable bandwidth quite contrary narrow bandwidths typical cw lasers lasing medium dye lasers vibronic solidstate lasers produces optical gain wide bandwidth making laser possible thus generate pulses light short femtoseconds

modelocking
modelocked laser capable emitting extremely short pulses order tens picoseconds less femtoseconds pulses repeat round trip time time takes light complete one round trip mirrors comprising resonator due fourier limit also known energytime uncertainty pulse short temporal length spectrum spread considerable bandwidth thus gain medium must gain bandwidth sufficiently broad amplify frequencies example suitable material titaniumdoped artificially grown sapphire tisapphire wide gain bandwidth thus produce pulses femtoseconds duration
modelocked lasers versatile tool researching processes occurring extremely short time scales known femtosecond physics femtosecond chemistry ultrafast science maximizing effect nonlinearity optical materials eg secondharmonic generation parametric downconversion optical parametric oscillators like due large peak power ablation applications extremely short pulse duration laser produce pulses achieve extremely high peak power
