visible wavelengths pass optical window region electromagnetic spectrum allows wavelengths pass largely unattenuated earths atmosphere example phenomenon clean air scatters blue light red wavelengths midday sky appears blue optical window also referred visible window overlaps human visible response spectrum near infrared nir window lies human vision well medium wavelength ir mwir window long wavelength far infrared lwir fir window although animals may experience
history
th century roger bacon theorized rainbows produced similar process passage light glass crystal
th century isaac newton discovered prisms could disassemble reassemble white light described phenomenon book opticks first use word spectrum latin appearance apparition sense print describing experiments optics newton observed narrow beam sunlight strikes face glass prism angle reflected beam passes glass emerging differentcolored bands newton hypothesized light made corpuscles particles different colors different colors light moving different speeds transparent matter red light moving quickly violet glass result red light bent refracted less sharply violet passes prism creating spectrum colors
newton divided spectrum seven named colors red orange yellow green blue indigo violet chose seven colors belief derived ancient greek sophists connection colors musical notes known objects solar system days week human eye relatively insensitive indigos frequencies otherwisewellsighted people cannot distinguish indigo blue violet reason later commentators including isaac asimov suggested indigo regarded color right merely shade blue violet however evidence indicates newton meant indigo blue correspond modern meanings color words comparing newtons observation prismatic colors color image visible light spectrum shows indigo corresponds today called blue whereas blue corresponds cyan
th century goethe wrote optical spectra theory colours goethe used word spectrum spektrum designate ghostly optical afterimage schopenhauer vision colors goethe argued continuous spectrum compound phenomenon newton narrowed beam light isolate phenomenon goethe observed wider aperture produces spectrum rather reddishyellow bluecyan edges white spectrum appears edges close enough overlap
early th century concept visible spectrum became definite light outside visible range discovered characterized william herschel infrared johann wilhelm ritter ultraviolet thomas young thomas johann seebeck others young first measure wavelengths different colors light
connection visible spectrum color vision explored thomas young hermann von helmholtz early th century theory color vision correctly proposed eye uses three distinct receptors perceive color
animal color vision
many species see light frequencies outside human visible spectrum bees many insects detect ultraviolet light helps find nectar flowers plant species depend insect pollination may owe reproductive success appearance ultraviolet light rather colorful appear humans birds see ultraviolet nm sexdependent markings plumage visible ultraviolet range many animals see ultraviolet range however cannot see red light reddish wavelengths bees visible spectrum ends nm orange wavelengths start birds however see red wavelengths although far light spectrum humans popular belief common goldfish animal see infrared ultraviolet light incorrect goldfish cannot see infrared light
spectral colors
colors produced visible light narrow band wavelengths monochromatic light called pure spectral colors various color ranges indicated illustration approximation spectrum continuous clear boundaries one color next
spectroscopy
spectroscopy study objects based spectrum color emit absorb reflect spectroscopy important investigative tool astronomy scientists use analyze properties distant objects typically astronomical spectroscopy uses highdispersion diffraction gratings observe spectra high spectral resolutions helium first detected analysis spectrum sun chemical elements detected astronomical objects emission lines absorption lines
shifting spectral lines used measure doppler shift red shift blue shift distant objects
color display spectrum
color displays eg computer monitors televisions cannot reproduce colors discernible human eye colors outside color gamut device spectral colors approximated coloraccurate reproduction spectrum projected onto uniform gray field resulting mixed colors rgb coordinates nonnegative reproduced without distortion accurately simulates looking spectrum gray background
