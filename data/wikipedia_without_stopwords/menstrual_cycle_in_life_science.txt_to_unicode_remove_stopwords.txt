menstrual cycle regular natural changes occurs uterus ovaries make pregnancy possible cycle required production ovocytes preparation uterus pregnancy women report symptoms one two weeks prior menstruation common symptoms include acne tender breasts bloating feeling tired irritability mood changes symptoms interfere normal life therefore qualify premenstrual syndrome women severe
first period usually begins twelve fifteen years age point time known menarche may occasionally start early eight onset may still normal average age first period generally later developing world earlier developed world typical length time first day one period first day next days young women days adults average days menstruation stops occurring menopause usually occurs years age bleeding usually lasts around days
menstrual cycle governed hormonal changes changes altered using hormonal birth control prevent pregnancy cycle divided three phases based events ovary ovarian cycle uterus uterine cycle ovarian cycle consists follicular phase ovulation luteal phase whereas uterine cycle divided menstruation proliferative phase secretory phase
stimulated gradually increasing amounts estrogen follicular phase discharges blood menses flow stop lining uterus thickens follicles ovary begin developing influence complex interplay hormones several days one occasionally two become dominant nondominant follicles shrink die approximately midcycle hours luteinizing hormone lh surges dominant follicle releases ovocyte event called ovulation ovulation ovocyte lives hours less without fertilization remains dominant follicle ovary become corpus luteum body primary function producing large amounts progesterone influence progesterone uterine lining changes prepare potential implantation embryo establish pregnancy implantation occur within approximately two weeks corpus luteum involute causing sharp drops levels progesterone estrogen hormone drop causes uterus shed lining process termed menstruation menstruation also occur animals including shrews bats primates apes monkeys
onset frequency
average age menarche may occasionally start early eight onset may still normal first period often occurs later developing world developed world
average age menarche years united states canada uk years iceland factors genetics diet overall health affect timing
cessation menstrual cycles end womans reproductive period termed menopause average age menopause women years anywhere common menopause age considered premature industrialised countries like age menarche age menopause largely result cultural biological factors however illnesses certain surgeries medical treatments may cause menopause occur earlier might otherwise
length womans menstrual cycle typically varies somewhat shorter cycles longer cycles woman experiences variations less eight days longest cycles shortest cycles considered regular menstrual cycles unusual woman experience cycle length variations less four days length variation eight days considered moderately irregular cycles variation days womans shortest longest cycle lengths considered irregular
average menstrual cycle lasts days variability menstrual cycle lengths highest women years age lowest regular ages subsequently variability increases slightly women aged usually length variation eight days woman considered moderately irregular menstrual cycles variation days considered irregular
luteal phase menstrual cycle length individuals mean days sd days whereas follicular phase tends show much variability lognormally distributed individuals follicular phases days follicular phase also seems get significantly shorter age geometric mean days women aged vs days women aged
health effects
women neurological conditions experience increased activity conditions time menstrual cycle example drops estrogen levels known trigger migraines especially woman suffers migraines also taking birth control pill many women epilepsy seizures pattern linked menstrual cycle called catamenial epilepsy different patterns seem exist seizures coinciding time menstruation coinciding time ovulation frequency occur firmly established using one particular definition one group scientists found around onethird women intractable partial epilepsy catamenial epilepsy effect hormones proposed progesterone declines estrogen increases would trigger seizures recently studies shown high doses estrogen cause worsen seizures whereas high doses progesterone act like antiepileptic drug studies medical journals found women experiencing menses times likely commit suicide
mice used experimental system investigate possible mechanisms levels sex steroid hormones might regulate nervous system function part mouse estrous cycle progesterone highest level nervecell gaba receptor subtype delta high since gaba receptors inhibitory nerve cells delta receptors less likely fire cells lower numbers delta receptors part mouse estrous cycle estrogen levels higher progesterone levels number delta receptors decrease increasing nerve cell activity turn increasing anxiety seizure susceptibility
estrogen levels may affect thyroid behavior example luteal phase estrogen levels lower velocity blood flow thyroid lower follicular phase estrogen levels higher
among women living closely together thought onsets menstruation tend synchronize effect first described possibly explained action pheromones subsequent research called hypothesis question
research indicates women significantly higher likelihood anterior cruciate ligament injuries preovulatory stage postovulatory stage may also premenstrual water retention
fertility
fertile period time highest likelihood pregnancy resulting sexual intercourse covers time days days ovulation day cycle day luteal phase corresponds second beginning third week variety methods developed help individual women estimate relatively fertile relatively infertile days cycle systems called fertility awareness
fertility awareness methods rely cycle length records alone called calendarbased methods methods require observation one three primary fertility signs basal body temperature cervical mucus cervical position known symptomsbased methods urine test kits available detect lh surge occurs hours ovulation known ovulation predictor kits opks computerized devices interpret basal body temperatures urinary test results changes saliva called fertility monitors
womans fertility also affected age womans total egg supply formed fetal life ovulated decades later suggested long lifetime may make chromatin eggs vulnerable division problems breakage mutation chromatin sperm produced continuously mans reproductive life however despite hypothesis similar paternal age effect also observed
measured women undergoing vitro fertilization longer menstrual cycle length associated higher pregnancy delivery rates even age adjustment delivery rates ivf estimated almost doubled women menstrual cycle length days compared women menstrual cycle length shorter days longer menstrual cycle length also significantly associated better ovarian response gonadotropin stimulation embryo quality
mood behavior
different phases menstrual cycle correlate womens moods cases hormones released menstrual cycle cause behavioral changes females mild severe mood changes occur menstrual cycle phase ovarian hormones may contribute increased empathy women natural shift hormone levels different phases menstrual cycle studied conjunction test scores completing empathy exercises women follicular stage menstrual cycle performed better women midluteal phase significant correlation progesterone levels ability accurately recognize emotion found performances emotion recognition tasks better women lower progesterone levels women follicular stage showed higher emotion recognition accuracy midluteal phase counterparts women found react negative stimuli midluteal stage women follicular stage perhaps indicating reactivity social stress menstrual cycle phase overall found women follicular phase demonstrated better performance tasks contain empathetic traits
fear response women two different points menstrual cycle examined oestrogen highest preovulatory stage women significantly better identifying expressions fear women menstruating oestrogen levels lowest women equally able identify happy faces demonstrating fear response powerful response summarize menstrual cycle phase oestrogen levels correlates womens fear processing
however examination daily moods women measuring ovarian hormones may indicate less powerful connection comparison levels stress physical health ovarian hormones less impact overall mood indicates changes ovarian hormones may influence mood daytoday level influence mood stressors
menstrual disorders
infrequent irregular ovulation called oligoovulation absence ovulation called anovulation normal menstrual flow occur without ovulation preceding anovulatory cycle cycles follicular development may start completed nevertheless estrogens formed stimulate uterine lining anovulatory flow resulting thick endometrium caused prolonged continued high estrogen levels called estrogen breakthrough bleeding anovulatory bleeding triggered sudden drop estrogen levels called withdrawal bleeding anovulatory cycles commonly occur menopause perimenopause women polycystic ovary syndrome
little flow less ml called hypomenorrhea regular cycles intervals days fewer polymenorrhea frequent irregular menstruation known metrorrhagia sudden heavy flows amounts greater ml termed menorrhagia heavy menstruation occurs frequently irregularly menometrorrhagia term cycles intervals exceeding days oligomenorrhea amenorrhea refers three six months without menses pregnant womans reproductive years
cycles phases
menstrual cycle described ovarian uterine cycle ovarian cycle describes changes occur follicles ovary whereas uterine cycle describes changes endometrial lining uterus cycles divided three phases ovarian cycle consists follicular phase ovulation luteal phase whereas uterine cycle consists menstruation proliferative phase secretory phase
ovarian cycle
follicular phase
follicular phase first part ovarian cycle phase ovarian follicles mature get ready release egg latter part phase overlaps proliferative phase uterine cycle
influence rise follicle stimulating hormone fsh first days cycle ovarian follicles stimulated follicles present birth developing better part year process known folliculogenesis compete dominance influence several hormones one follicles stop growing one dominant follicle ovary continue maturity follicle reaches maturity called tertiary graafian follicle contains ovum
ovulation
ovulation second phase ovarian cycle mature egg released ovarian follicles oviduct follicular phase estradiol suppresses production luteinizing hormone lh anterior pituitary gland egg nearly matured levels estradiol reach threshold effect reversed estrogen stimulates production large amount lh process known lh surge starts around day average cycle may last hours
exact mechanism opposite responses lh levels estradiol well understood animals gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh surge shown precede lh surge suggesting estrogens main effect hypothalamus controls gnrh secretion may enabled presence two different estrogen receptors hypothalamus estrogen receptor alpha responsible negative feedback estradiollh loop estrogen receptor beta responsible positive estradiollh relationship however humans shown high levels estradiol provoke abrupt increases lh even gnrh levels pulse frequencies held constant suggesting estrogen acts directly pituitary provoke lh surge
release lh matures egg weakens wall follicle ovary causing fully developed follicle release secondary oocyte secondary oocyte promptly matures ootid becomes mature ovum mature ovum diameter mm
two ovariesleft rightovulates appears essentially random known left right coordination exists occasionally ovaries release egg eggs fertilized result fraternal twins
released ovary egg swept fallopian tube fimbria fringe tissue end fallopian tube day unfertilized egg disintegrate dissolve fallopian tube
fertilization spermatozoon occurs usually takes place ampulla widest section fallopian tubes fertilized egg immediately begins process embryogenesis development developing embryo takes three days reach uterus another three days implant endometrium usually reached blastocyst stage time implantation
women ovulation features characteristic pain called mittelschmerz german term meaning middle pain sudden change hormones time ovulation sometimes also causes light midcycle blood flow
luteal phase
luteal phase final phase ovarian cycle corresponds secretory phase uterine cycle luteal phase pituitary hormones fsh lh cause remaining parts dominant follicle transform corpus luteum produces progesterone increased progesterone adrenals starts induce production estrogen hormones produced corpus luteum also suppress production fsh lh corpus luteum needs maintain consequently level fsh lh fall quickly time corpus luteum subsequently atrophies falling levels progesterone trigger menstruation beginning next cycle time ovulation progesterone withdrawal caused menstruation begin process typically takes two weeks days considered normal individual woman follicular phase often varies length cycle cycle contrast length luteal phase fairly consistent cycle cycle
loss corpus luteum prevented fertilization egg syncytiotrophoblast outer layer resulting embryocontaining structure blastocyst later also becomes outer layer placenta produces human chorionic gonadotropin hcg similar lh preserves corpus luteum corpus luteum continue secrete progesterone maintain new pregnancy pregnancy tests look presence hcg
uterine cycle
menstruation
menstruation also called menstrual bleeding menses catamenia period first phase uterine cycle flow menses normally serves sign woman become pregnant however cannot taken certainty number factors cause bleeding pregnancy factors specific early pregnancy cause heavy flow
eumenorrhea denotes normal regular menstruation lasts days usually days anywhere days considered normal average blood loss menstruation milliliters ml considered normal women experience menorrhagia susceptible iron deficiency average person enzyme called plasmin inhibits clotting menstrual fluid
painful cramping abdomen back upper thighs common first days menstruation severe uterine pain menstruation known dysmenorrhea common among adolescents younger women affecting adolescent females menstruation begins symptoms premenstrual syndrome pms breast tenderness irritability generally decrease many sanitary products marketed women use menstruation
proliferative phase
proliferative phase second phase uterine cycle estrogen causes lining uterus grow proliferate time mature ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts estradiol estrogen estrogens initiate formation new layer endometrium uterus histologically identified proliferative endometrium estrogen also stimulates crypts cervix produce fertile cervical mucus may noticed women practicing fertility awareness
secretory phase
secretory phase final phase uterine cycle corresponds luteal phase ovarian cycle secretory phase corpus luteum produces progesterone plays vital role making endometrium receptive implantation blastocyst supportive early pregnancy increasing blood flow uterine secretions reducing contractility smooth muscle uterus also side effect raising womans basal body temperature
ovulation suppression
birth control
forms birth control affect menstrual cycle hormonal contraceptives work disrupting progestogen negative feedback decreases pulse frequency gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh release hypothalamus decreases release folliclestimulating hormone fsh luteinizing hormone lh anterior pituitary decreased levels fsh inhibit follicular development preventing increase estradiol levels progestogen negative feedback lack estrogen positive feedback lh release prevent midcycle lh surge inhibition follicular development absence lh surge prevent ovulation
degree ovulation suppression progestogenonly contraceptives depends progestogen activity dose low dose progestogenonly contraceptivestraditional progestogen pills subdermal implants norplant jadelle intrauterine system mirenainhibit ovulation cycles rely mainly effects thickening cervical mucus contraceptive effectiveness intermediate dose progestogenonly contraceptivesthe progestogenonly pill cerazette subdermal implant nexplanonallow follicular development consistently inhibit ovulation cycles cervical mucus changes occur lowdose progestogens highdose progestogenonly contraceptivesthe injectables depoprovera noristeratcompletely inhibit follicular development ovulation
combined hormonal contraceptives include estrogen progestogen estrogen negative feedback anterior pituitary greatly decreases release fsh makes combined hormonal contraceptives effective inhibiting follicular development preventing ovulation estrogen also reduces incidence irregular breakthrough bleeding several combined hormonal contraceptivesthe pill nuvaring contraceptive patchare usually used way causes regular withdrawal bleeding normal cycle menstruation occurs estrogen progesterone levels drop rapidly temporarily discontinuing use combined hormonal contraceptives placebo week using patch ring week similar effect causing uterine lining shed withdrawal bleeding desired combined hormonal contraceptives may taken continuously although increases risk breakthrough bleeding
breastfeeding
breastfeeding causes negative feedback occur pulse secretion gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh luteinizing hormone lh depending strength negative feedback breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression follicular development ovulation normal menstrual cycle may resume suppression ovulation likely suckling occurs frequently production prolactin response suckling important maintaining lactational amenorrhea average women fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience return menstruation fourteen half months postpartum wide range response among individual breastfeeding women however experiencing return menstruation two months others remaining amenorrheic months postpartum
