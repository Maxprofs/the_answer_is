example sodium chloride
ionic bonding common pairs atoms one pair metal low electronegativity sodium second nonmetal high electronegativity chlorine
chlorine atom seven electrons outer electron shell first second shells filled two eight electrons respectively first electron affinity chlorine energy release chlorine gains electron kj per mole chlorine atoms adding second electron chlorine requires energy energy cannot recovered formation chemical bond result chlorine often form compound eight electrons outer shell complete octet
sodium atom single electron outermost electron shell first second shells full two eight electrons respectively remove outer electron requires first ionization energy kj per mole sodium atoms small amount energy contrast second electron resides deeper second electron shell second ionization energy required removal much larger kj per mole thus sodium cases form compound lost single electron full outer shell eight electrons octet

history
late th century known coordination compounds formerly called molecular compounds formed combination atoms molecules manner valencies atoms involved apparently became satisfied alfred werner showed number atoms groups associated central atom coordination number often coordination numbers maximum known less frequent richard abegg one first extend concept coordination number concept valence distinguished atoms electron donors acceptors leading positive negative valence states greatly resemble modern concept oxidation states abegg noted difference maximum positive negative valences element model frequently eight gilbert n lewis referred insight abeggs rule used help formulate cubical atom model rule eight began distinguish valence valence electrons irving langmuir refined concepts renamed cubical octet atom octet theory octet theory evolved known octet rule
explanation quantum theory
quantum theory atom explains eight electrons closed shell sp electron configuration closedshell configuration one lowlying energy levels full higher energy levels empty example neon atom ground state full n shell sp empty n shell according octet rule atoms immediately neon periodic table ie c n o f na mg al tend attain similar configuration gaining losing sharing electrons
argon atom analogous sp configuration also empty d level considerably higher energy p unlike hydrogen atom sp still considered closed shell chemical purposes atoms immediately argon tend attain configuration compounds however hypervalent molecules d level may play part bonding although controversial see
helium p level according quantum theory closed shell p electrons atoms helium h li follow duet rule tend configuration helium
exceptions
incomplete valence shell
seven electron species free radicals unpaired electrons example methyl radical ch unpaired electron nonbonding orbital carbon atom electron opposite spin orbital another example chlorine radical produced cfcs known harmful ozone layer
six electron species highly reactive short lived example carbenes two unshared valence electrons carbon atom triplet singlet state another example bh dimerizes diborane bh achieve stability
stable molecular radicals eg nitric oxide obtain octet configurations means threeelectron bond contributes one shared one unshared electron octet bonded atom groundstate oxygen generally represented obeying octet rule actually contains two bonds
rules
duet rule first shellthe noble gas helium two electrons outer shell stable since p subshell followed immediately thus shell valence electrons hydrogen needs one additional electron attain stable configuration lithium needs lose one
