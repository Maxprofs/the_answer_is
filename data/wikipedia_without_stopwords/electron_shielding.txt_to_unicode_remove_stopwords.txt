shielding effect describes attraction electron nucleus atom one electron shell shielding effect defined reduction effective nuclear charge electron cloud due difference attraction forces electrons nucleus also referred screening effect atomic shielding
cause
hydrogen atom group periodic table one valence electron force electron large electromagnetic attraction nucleus however electrons involved electron nshell experiences electromagnetic attraction positive nucleus also repulsion forces electrons shells n causes net force electrons outer shells significantly smaller magnitude therefore electrons strongly bonded nucleus electrons closer nucleus phenomenon often referred orbital penetration effect shielding theory also contributes explanation valenceshell electrons easily removed atom
size shielding effect difficult calculate precisely due effects quantum mechanics approximation estimate effective nuclear charge electron following
z number protons nucleus average number electrons nucleus electron question found using quantum chemistry schrdinger equation using slaters empirical formulas
rutherford backscattering spectroscopy correction due electron screening modifies coulomb repulsion incident ion target nucleus large distances
