neutron economy defined ratio adjoint weighted average excess neutron production divided adjoint weighted average fission production
distribution neutron energies nuclear reactor differs fission neutron spectrum due slowing neutrons elastic inelastic collisions fuel coolant construction material neutrons slow elastic inelastic collisions absorbed via neutron capture lost leakage neutron economy balanced account reactor neutrons created neutrons lost absorption nonfuel elements resonance absorption fuel leakage fast thermal energy ranges
heavy water extremely efficient moderator result reactors using heavy water candu also high neutron economy
quantity indicates much neutron economy balance given term reactivity reactor exactly critical neutron production exactly equal neutron destruction reactivity zero reactivity positive reactor supercritical reactivity negative reactor subcritical
however term neutron economy used instantaneous reactivity reactor also describe overall efficiency nuclear reactor design
