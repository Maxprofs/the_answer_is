== gameplay ==
like previous games in the final fantasy series final fantasy viii consists of three main modes of play the world map field map and battle screen the world map is a 3d display in which the player may navigate freely across a small-scale rendering of the game world characters travel across the world map in a variety of ways including by foot car chocobo train and airship the field map consists of controllable 3d characters overlaid on one or more 2d pre-rendered backgrounds which represent environmental locations such as towns or forests the battle screen is a 3d model of a location such as a street or room where turn-based fights between playable characters and cpu-controlled enemies take place the interface is menu-driven as in previous titles but with the typical weapon and armor systems removed and new features present such as the junction system also featured is a collectible card-based minigame called triple triad
=== junction system ===
final fantasy viii uses a battle system based on summon-able monsters called guardian forces abbreviated in-game as gf. assigning ("junctioning") a gf onto a character allows the player to use battle commands beyond attack with the main weapon such as magic gf (to summon the junctioned gf and have it perform an action) item and draw (to draw magic spells from an enemy and store it or immediately cast in battle) while previous final fantasy titles provided each character with a limited pool of magic points that were consumed by each spell in final fantasy viii spells are acquired ("drawn") either from enemies in battle draw points distributed throughout the game's environments or by refining items and cards spells are then stocked on characters as quantified inventory (up to 100 per spell and limited to 32 distinct spells per character) and are consumed one by one when used characters can also junction these spells onto their statisticssuch as strength vitality and luckfor various bonuses provided the character has junctioned a guardian force the junction system's flexibility affords the player a wide range of customization options
the use of summoned creatures for anything other than a single devastating attack during battle was a significant departure for the final fantasy series the junction system also acts as a substitute for armor and accessories used in previous titles to enhance the characters statistics moreover where earlier titles required weapons to be equipped and tailored to the character each major character in final fantasy viii features a unique weapon which can be upgraded affecting its appearance power and limit break
=== limit breaks ===
characters in final fantasy viii have unique special attacks called limit breaks as in final fantasy vii while the limit breaks in final fantasy vii are triggered after sufficient damage has been received in final fantasy viii the availability of limit breaks depends on a character's current healtha limit break is more likely to be available to a character with low health the magic spell aura increases the probability of limit breaks appearing regardless of a character's remaining hit points while various status afflictions can prevent limit breaks they are similar to the desperation attacks of final fantasy vi as they are randomly triggered when a character's health falls below a certain level and his or her hit points are in yellow instead of white
final fantasy viii also introduced interactive elements to complement limit break animations these interactive sequences which vary between character weapon and limit break range from randomly selected magic spells to precisely timed button inputs successfully completing an interactive sequence increases the resulting attack's potency
=== experience levels ===
final fantasy viii used an experience point and level system quite different from previous games in the series while exp is awarded after battling and defeating enemies who are predominantly encountered randomly and contribute to the continued strengthening and level-gaining of the characters here the similarity ends while levels in previous games required ever-increasing amounts of exp to surmount (e.g. getting to level 2 might require 200 experience points level 3 might require 400 etc.) characters in final fantasy viii gain a level after accumulating 1000 points the enemies levels around the world furthermore scales depending on the average level of the active party as opposed to most rpgs where enemies from previously-visited locations in the game are often weak and easily defeated however some enemies do not receive level-scaling and remain at static levels higher-level enemies are capable of inflicting and withstanding significantly more damage may have additional special attacks and carry additional magic spells allowing for junctioning bonuses which themselves far exceed the bonuses imparted by level-gain bosses do not give any exp but do give significant amounts of ap
in addition to gaining levels guardian forces earn ability points (ap) after battles which are automatically allocated to special abilities that guardian forces can learn when a guardian force has learned an ability that ability becomes available for any character that junctions the gf or the character party as is the case with field abilities these abilities allow characters to attack more efficiently refine magic spells from items receive stat bonuses upon leveling up access shops remotely and use additional battle commands

=== setting and characters ===
most of final fantasy viii is set on an unnamed fantasy world with one moon the game primarily consists of modern elements but does contain some futuristic elements the planet comprises five major landmasses with esthar the largest covering most of the eastern portion of the map galbadia the second-largest continent lies to the west and contains many of the game's locations the northernmost landmass is trabia an arctic region positioned roughly in the middle of the world map lies balamb the smallest continent the island on which the game begins the remaining landmass is small and mostly desolate riddled with rough rocky terrain caused by the impact of a lunar cry an event where monsters from the moon fall to the planet the southernmost landmass includes an archipelago of broken sections of land that have drifted apart islands and marine structures flesh out the rest of the game world and a handful of off-world locations round out the game's playable areas

after the team escapes along with a conscious squall edea launches a missile attack on trabia garden fearing that balamb garden is the next target of edea's plan the team splits into two units squall's group returns to balamb to warn of the attack but must first stop an internal garden conflict incited by norg seed's financier selphie's team travels to the missile base to stop the launch but fails squall inadvertently activates balamb garden's mobile fortress form allowing the facility to evade the missiles however unable to control the garden it collides with the docks at fishermans horizon while local technicians repair the garden the galbadian army invade in search of a girl named ellone who had been staying at balamb garden until recently ellone eventually escapes to esthar the world's technological superpower during squall's meeting with ellone he learns that she had been sending him and his allies into flashbacks set 17 years in the past in a vain effort to alter the present the scenes center on laguna and his two friends kiros and ward during the flashbacks laguna changes from a galbadian soldier to the defender of a country village then moves from being the leader of a resistance movement against sorceress adel to the president of esthar
meanwhile squall confronts his personal anxieties fueled by ongoing developments such as headmaster cid appointing him as seed's new leader and his increasing attraction to rinoa while investigating trabia garden's wreckage squall and his comrades learn that they along with seifer and ellone were all raised (except for rinoa) in an orphanage run by edea after eventual separation they later developed amnesia due to their use of guardian forces it is also revealed that cid and edea had established garden and seed primarily to defeat corrupt sorceresses after these revelations the forces of balamb garden and the galbadian army led by squall and seifer respectively engage in battle above the orphanage after balamb defeats galbadia the player learns that edea is merely an unwilling tool for ultimecia a powerful sorceress from the future who wishes to compress time into a single moment it is for this reason she has sought ellone edea loses a decisive battle against the seed forcing ultimecia to transfer her powers to rinoa edea survives but rinoa enters a coma squall becomes obsessed with waking her and goes to esthar to find ellone as he believes that she can help save rinoa
while rinoa is being treated on esthar's space station ultimecia uses her to free sorceress adel from her orbital prison ultimecia then orders seifer to activate the lunatic pandora facility inciting a rain of creatures from the moon that sends adel's containment device to the planet having selected adel as her next host ultimecia abandons rinoa in outer space squall rescues her and they return to the planet on a derelict starship upon their landing delegates from esthar isolate rinoa for fear of her sorceress abilities forcing squall to rescue her they are met by the president of esthar who reveals himself to be laguna and apologizes for the incident and announces dr odine's plan to let ultimecia possess rinoa have ellone send rinoa (and thus ultimecia as well) to the past and then retrieve only rinoa back to the present enabling ultimecia to achieve time compression as it would allow squall's group to confront ultimecia in her time to do this squall's team infiltrates lunatic pandora defeats seifer and adel and has rinoa inherit adel's sorceress powers time compression is thus initiated squall and his allies travel to ultimecia's era and defeat her
with ultimecia defeated the universe begins returning to normal however squall is nearly lost in the flow of time as he witnesses the origins of the game's story ghostly sporadic apparitions of rinoa and a faceless portrait of himself when a dying ultimecia travels back in time to pass her powers to edea squall informs edea of the concepts of garden and seed that she will create afterward he is able to properly recollect his memories and thus return to the present with rinoa's help the end cinematic depicts the events after squall's return to the present seifer no longer a garden member is once again reunited with raijin and fujin laguna visits raine's grave (and remembers his proposal to her) along with ellone ward and kiros and a celebration takes place in the garden with squall and rinoa sharing a kiss under the moonlight
== development ==
development of final fantasy viii began in 1997 during the english-language translation of final fantasy vii as with much of the production of final fantasy vii series creator and veteran hironobu sakaguchi served as the executive producer working primarily on the development of final fantasy the spirits within and leaving direction of final fantasy viii to yoshinori kitase shinji hashimoto was assigned to be the producer in sakaguchi's place while the game and battle system were designed by kitase and hiroyuki ito respectively the card game triple triad was conceived and implemented by programmer kentarow yasui the concept was derived from trading cards which is a popular hobby in some parts of japan triple triad was meant to keep the player's interest during long stretches without cutscenes originally it was simply about collecting cards but yasui considered this too disconnected from the main game and begged for the inclusion of an ability to transform cards into items the game's total development costs approximately 3 billion with a crew of about 180 people many of whom had previously worked on vii
=== visual design ===
from the beginning kitase knew he wanted a thematic combination of fantasy and realism to this end he aimed to include a cast of characters who appeared to be ordinary people character designer and battle visual director tetsuya nomura and art director yusuke naora strove to achieve this impression through the inclusion of realistically proportioned charactersa departure from the super deformed designs used in the previous title additionally naora attempted to enhance the realism of the world through predominantly bright lighting effects with shadows distributed as appropriate other measures taken included implementing rental cars for travel in-game and the use of motion capture technology to give the game's characters lifelike movements in the game's full motion video sequences the fmv sequences were created by a team of roughly 35 people with the total cinematic run-time being estimated at over an hour approximately 20 minutes longer than the fmv sequences in vii
in an interview with famitsu naora described that the game was generally designed to be a bright fresh final fantasy. the designers felt a need to invert the atmosphere of previous games in the series which had feelings of light emerging from darkness this decision was easy for the developers to make because most of them had worked on final fantasy vii and felt that a new direction was acceptable the world designs were also developed with the knowledge that most of the staff were now used to computer graphics which was not the case with final fantasy vii the developers also noted that with final fantasy viii they attempted to mix future real life and fantasy. as part of a theme desired by kitase to give the game a foreign atmosphere various designs were given to its locations using the style of internationally familiar places while also maintaining a fantasy atmosphere inspiration ranged from ancient egyptian and greek architecture to the city of paris france to an idealized futuristic european society flags were also given to some factions their designs based on the group's history and culture
to maintain a foreign atmosphere the characters of the game were designed to have predominantly european appearances the first final fantasy viii character created was squall desiring to add a unique angle to squall's appearance and emphasize his role as the central character nomura gave him a scar across his brow and the bridge of his nose as there was not yet a detailed history conceived for the character nomura left the explanation for squall's scar to scenario writer kazushige nojima squall was given a gunblade a fictional revolversword hybrid that functions primarily as a sword with an added damaging vibration feature activated by use of its gun mechanism similar to a vibroblade his character design was complemented by a fur lining along the collar of his jacket incorporated by nomura as a challenge for the game's full motion video designers additionally some designs nomura had previously drawn but had not yet used in a final fantasy game were incorporated into final fantasy viii these were the designs of edea fujin and raijin the latter two had originally been designed for use in final fantasy vii but with the inclusion of the turks characters in that game it was felt that fujin and raijin were unnecessary nomura had designed edea before the development of final fantasy vii based on the style of yoshitaka amano for the guardian forces nomura felt they should be unique beings without clothes or other human-like concepts this was problematic as he did not want them to become the actual monsters so he took great care in their design leviathan was the first gf created as a test and included in a game demo after it received a positive reaction from players nomura decided to create the remaining sequences in a similar fashion
=== story development ===
the plot of final fantasy viii was conceived by kitase with the stories for the characters provided by nomura and the actual scenario written by nojima during the game's pre-production nomura suggested the game be given a school days feel nojima already had a story in mind in which the main characters were the same age their ideas meshed taking form as the garden military academies nojima planned that the two playable parties featured in the game (squall's present day group and laguna's group from the past) would be highly contrasted with one another this idea was conveyed through the age and experience of laguna's group versus the youth and navet of squall's group nojima has expressed that the dynamic of players relationships with the protagonist is important to him both final fantasy vii and final fantasy viii feature reserved quiet protagonists in the form of cloud strife and squall with final fantasy viii however nojima worked to give players actual insight into what the character was thinking a direct contrast with his handling of final fantasy vii which encouraged the player to speculate
=== other media ===

=== music ===
regular series composer nobuo uematsu wrote the soundtrack for final fantasy viii he tried to base the songs off of the emotional content of when they would be played asserting that expressing the emotions he desires is more important than improving skills i think it will be a shame if we won't be able to cry as we play our own game he could not determine a character's emotions solely based on the plot instead using images of appearance and attire"it's important to know when their emotions are at their height but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...! in response to a question by ign music stating that the music of final fantasy viii was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game uematsu stated the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line of course but it's also my intention to put various types of music into one game the absence of character themes found in the previous two games was due to uematsu finding those of final fantasy vi and final fantasy vii ineffective uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a highlight in the game but he found final fantasy viii only focused on squall leonhart and rinoa heartilly as a couple resulting in the eyes on me theme
the original soundtrack was released on four compact discs by digicube in japan on march 10 1999 and by square ea in north america as final fantasy viii music collection in january 2000 it was republished worldwide by square enix on may 10 2004 an album of orchestral arrangements of selected tracks from the game was released under the title fithos lusec wecos vinosec final fantasy viii on november 19 1999 by digicube and subsequently published on july 22 2004 by square enix the pieces were arranged and conducted by shir hamaguchi for a live orchestra a collection of piano arrangements performed by shinko ogata was released under the title piano collections final fantasy viii by digicube on january 21 2000 and subsequently re-published by square enix on july 22 2004
the score is best known for two songs liberi fatali a latin choral piece that is played during the introduction to the game and eyes on me a pop song serving as the game's theme performed by chinese singer faye wong near the end of the production of final fantasy vii the developers suggested to use a singer but abandoned the idea due to a lack of reasoning based on the game's theme and storyline however nobuo uematsu thought a ballad would closely relate to the theme and characters of final fantasy viii this resulted in the game's developers sharing countless artists eventually deciding on wong uematsu claims her voice and mood seem to match my image of the song exactly and that her ethnicity fits the international image of final fantasy after negotiations were made eyes on me was recorded in hong kong with an orchestra the song was released as a cd single in japan and sold over 400,000 copies setting the record for highest-selling video game music disc ever released in that country at the time liberi fatali was played during the 2004 summer olympics in athens during the women's synchronized swimming event
