== overview ==
=== origins ===
pioneering economist john r commons used the term human resource in his 1893 book the distribution of wealth but did not further build upon it the term human resource was subsequently in use during the 1910s and 1920s as was the notion that workers could be seen as a kind of capital asset among scholars the first use of human resources in its modern form was in a 1958 report by economist e wight bakke the term began to become more developed in the 19th century due to misunderstandings between the employers and employees
=== the term in practice ===
from the corporate objective employees have been traditionally viewed as assets to the enterprise whose value is enhanced by further learning and development referred to as human resource development organizations will engage in a broad range of human resource management practices to capitalize on those assets an employee base that is a mirror reflection of the make-up of society insofar as race gender sexual orientation etc
skills and qualifications as industries move from manual to more managerial professions so does the need for more highly skilled graduates if the market is tight (i.e not enough staff for the jobs) employers must compete for employees by offering financial rewards community investment etc

=== concerns about the terminology ===
one major concern about considering people as assets or resources is that they will be commoditized and abused some analysis suggests that human beings are not commodities or resources but are creative and social beings in a productive enterprise the 2000 revision of iso 9001 in contrast requires identifying the processes their sequence and interaction and to define and communicate responsibilities and authorities in general heavily unionised nations such as france and germany have adopted and encouraged such approaches also in 2001 the international labour organization decided to revisit and revise its 1975 recommendation 150 on human resources development resulting in its labour is not a commodity principle one view of these trends is that a strong social consensus on political economy and a good social welfare system facilitate labour mobility and tend to make the entire economy more productive as labour can develop skills and experience in various ways and move from one enterprise to another with little controversy or difficulty in adapting
another important controversy regards labour mobility and the broader philosophical issue with usage of the phrase human resources governments of developing nations often regard developed nations that encourage immigration or guest workers as appropriating human capital that is more rightfully part of the developing nation and required to further its economic growth over time the united nations have come to more generally support the developing nations point of view and have requested significant offsetting foreign aid contributions so that a developing nation losing human capital does not lose the capacity to continue to train new people in trades professions and the arts
