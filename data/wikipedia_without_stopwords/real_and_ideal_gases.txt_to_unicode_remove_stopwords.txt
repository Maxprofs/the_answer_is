amagats law law partial volumes describes behaviour properties mixtures ideal well cases nonideal gases use chemistry thermodynamics amagats law states extensive volume v nv gas mixture equal sum volumes vi k component gases temperature pressure p remain
experimental expression volume extensive quantity named emile amagat
according amagats law partial volume total volume nonreacting mixture gases constant temperature pressure equal sum individual partial volumes constituent gases considered partial volumes components gaseous mixture total volume would represented
amagats daltons laws predict properties gas mixtures predictions ideal gases however real nonideal gases results differ daltons law partial pressures assumes gases mixture noninteracting gas independently applies pressure sum total pressure amagats law assumes volumes component gases temperature pressure additive interactions different gases average interactions components
interactions interpreted terms second virial coefficient bt mixture two components second virial coefficient mixture expressed
subscripts refer components xs mole fractions bs second virial coefficients cross term b mixture given
