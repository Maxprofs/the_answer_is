vision is that which is seen in a dream trance or religious ecstasy especially a supernatural appearance that usually conveys a revelation visions generally have more clarity than dreams but traditionally fewer psychological connotations visions are known to emerge from spiritual traditions and could provide a lens into human nature and reality prophecy is often associated with visions
in simple words it is a spiritual experience in which the experience can be seen and hence it is called a vision according to sufism vision is the mystical awareness of the supernatural usually in visible form in islamic mysticism vision is often referred to as 'deedar'(arabic: {{{1}}}) or 'deedar-e-elahi' or 'deedar-e-khuda'(vision of god) the muslim prayers were made obligatory for the vision of god
vision however is connected to human subjectivity and it is the inward experience of the soul because "deedar" literally means 'decision' or 'view' whether sleeping or awake it is the subjective perception or intuition william chittick 'vision' takes place at the level of 'thought' which accroding to rumi is identical with 'imagination
