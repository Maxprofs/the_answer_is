assumptions
theory ideal gases makes following assumptions
gas consists small particles known molecules smallness size total volume individual gas molecules added negligible compared volume smallest open ball containing molecules equivalent stating average distance separating gas particles large compared size
particles mass
number molecules large statistical treatment applied
molecules constant random rapid motion
rapidly moving particles constantly collide among walls container collisions perfectly elastic means molecules considered perfectly spherical shape elastic nature
except collisions interactions among molecules negligible exert forces one another
implies
