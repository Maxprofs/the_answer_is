present knowledge

great volumes clastic rocks deposited nevada surrounding areas western eastern facies assemblages
almost orogenic deposits range age late devonian midpennsylvanian may middle devonian age
orogenic deposits generally disconformable relation underlying strata
areas within western facies domain first elevated eroded depressed received blanket conglomeratic sediments
clasts deposits derived areas outside western facies domain bulk derived western facies assemblage
blocky exposures eastern facies carbonate rocks cambrian devonian age scattered across western facies domain
metamorphic rocks volcanic arcs granitic intrusives associated antler orogeny reported
age earliestknown orogenic deposits coincides approximately age alamo impact event early late devonian age possibly significant coincidence
