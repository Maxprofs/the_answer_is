reproductionedit
bacteria archaea reproduce asexual reproduction usually binary fission genetic exchange recombination still occur form horizontal gene transfer replicative process simply involving transference dna two cells bacterial conjugation
dna transferedit
dna transfer prokaryotic cells occurs bacteria archaea although mainly studied bacteria bacteria gene transfer occurs three processes bacterial virus bacteriophagemediated transduction plasmidmediated conjugation natural transformation transduction bacterial genes bacteriophage appears reflect occasional error intracellular assembly virus particles rather adaptation host bacteria transfer bacterial dna control bacteriophages genes rather bacterial genes conjugation wellstudied e coli system controlled plasmid genes adaptation distributing copies plasmid one bacterial host another infrequently process plasmid may integrate host bacterial chromosome subsequently transfer part host bacterial dna another bacterium plasmid mediated transfer host bacterial dna conjugation also appears accidental process rather bacterial adaptation
natural bacterial transformation involves transfer dna one bacterium another intervening medium unlike transduction conjugation transformation clearly bacterial adaptation dna transfer depends numerous bacterial gene products specifically interact perform complex process bacterium bind take recombine donor dna chromosome must first enter special physiological state called competence genes required bacillus subtilis development competence length dna transferred b subtilis transformation much third whole chromosome transformation common mode dna transfer prokaryotic species thus far known naturally competent transformation
among archaea halobacterium volcanii forms cytoplasmic bridges cells appear used transfer dna one cell another another archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus transfers dna cells direct contact frols et al found exposure solfataricus dna damaging agents induces cellular aggregation suggested cellular aggregation may enhance dna transfer among cells provide increased repair damaged dna via homologous recombination
socialityedit
prokaryotes considered strictly unicellular form stable aggregate communities communities encased stabilizing polymer matrix slime may called biofilms cells biofilms often show distinct patterns gene expression phenotypic differentiation time space also multicellular eukaryotes changes expression often appear result celltocell signaling phenomenon known quorum sensing
biofilms may highly heterogeneous structurally complex may attach solid surfaces exist liquidair interfaces potentially even liquidliquid interfaces bacterial biofilms often made microcolonies approximately domeshaped masses bacteria matrix separated voids medium eg water may flow relatively uninhibited microcolonies may join together substratum form continuous layer closing network channels separating microcolonies structural complexitycombined observations oxygen limitation ubiquitous challenge anything growing size beyond scale diffusion least partially eased movement medium throughout biofilmhas led speculate may constitute circulatory system many researchers started calling prokaryotic communities multicellular example differential cell expression collective behavior signaling programmed cell death cases discrete biological dispersal events seem point direction however colonies seldom ever founded single founder way animals plants founded single cells presents number theoretical issues explanations cooperation evolution multicellularity focused high relatedness members group colony whole organism copy gene present members group behaviors promote cooperation members may permit members average greater fitness similar group selfish individuals see inclusive fitness hamiltons rule

prokaryotes diversified greatly throughout long existence metabolism prokaryotes far varied eukaryotes leading many highly distinct prokaryotic types example addition using photosynthesis organic compounds energy eukaryotes prokaryotes may obtain energy inorganic compounds hydrogen sulfide enables prokaryotes thrive harsh environments cold snow surface antarctica studied cryobiology hot undersea hydrothermal vents landbased hot springs
prokaryotes live nearly environments earth archaea bacteria thrive harsh conditions high temperatures thermophiles high salinity halophiles organisms referred extremophiles many archaea grow plankton oceans symbiotic prokaryotes live bodies organisms including humans

evolution prokaryotesedit
current model evolution first living organisms form prokaryotes may evolved protocells general eukaryotes thought evolved later history life
however authors questioned conclusion arguing current set prokaryotic species may evolved complex eukaryotic ancestors process simplification
others argued three domains life arose simultaneously set varied cells formed single gene pool
controversy summarized
consensus among biologists concerning position eukaryotes overall scheme cell evolution current opinions origin position eukaryotes span broad spectrum including views eukaryotes arose first evolution prokaryotes descend eukaryotes arose contemporaneously eubacteria archeabacteria hence represent primary line descent equal age rank prokaryotes eukaryotes arose symbiotic event entailing endosymbiotic origin nucleus eukaryotes arose without endosymbiosis eukaryotes arose symbiotic event entailing simultaneous endosymbiotic origin flagellum nucleus addition many models reviewed summarized elsewhere
oldest known fossilized prokaryotes laid approximately billion years ago billion years formation earths crust eukaryotes appear fossil record later may formed endosymbiosis multiple prokaryote ancestors oldest known fossil eukaryotes billion years old however genetic evidence suggests eukaryotes appeared early billion years ago
earth place universe life known exist suggested evidence mars fossil living prokaryotes possibility remains subject considerable debate skepticism
relationship eukaryotesedit
division prokaryotes eukaryotes usually considered important distinction difference among organisms distinction eukaryotic cells true nucleus containing dna whereas prokaryotic cells nucleus eukaryotes prokaryotes contain large rnaprotein structures called ribosomes produce protein
another difference ribosomes prokaryotes smaller eukaryotes however two organelles found many eukaryotic cells mitochondria chloroplasts contain ribosomes similar size makeup found prokaryotes one many pieces evidence mitochondria chloroplasts descended freeliving bacteria theory holds early eukaryotic cells took primitive prokaryotic cells phagocytosis adapted incorporate structures leading mitochondria see today
genome prokaryote held within dnaprotein complex cytosol called nucleoid lacks nuclear envelope complex contains single cyclic doublestranded molecule stable chromosomal dna contrast multiple linear compact highly organized chromosomes found eukaryotic cells addition many important genes prokaryotes stored separate circular dna structures called plasmids
prokaryotes lack mitochondria chloroplasts instead processes oxidative phosphorylation photosynthesis take place across prokaryotic cell membrane however prokaryotes possess internal structures prokaryotic cytoskeletons suggested bacterial order planctomycetes membrane around nucleoid contain membranebound cellular structures however investigation revealed planctomycetes cells compartmentalized nucleated like bacterial membrane systems interconnected
prokaryotic cells usually much smaller eukaryotic cells therefore prokaryotes larger surfaceareatovolume ratio giving higher metabolic rate higher growth rate consequence shorter generation time eukaryotes
