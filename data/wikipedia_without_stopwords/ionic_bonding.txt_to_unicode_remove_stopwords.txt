ionic bonding type chemical bond involves electrostatic attraction oppositely charged ions primary interaction occurring ionic compounds ions atoms lost one electrons known cations atoms gained one electrons known anions transfer electrons known electrovalence contrast covalence simplest case cation metal atom anion nonmetal atom ions complex nature eg molecular ions like nh simpler words ionic bond transfer electrons metal nonmetal order atoms obtain full valence shell
important recognize clean ionic bonding one atom takes electron another cannot exist ionic compounds degree covalent bonding electron sharing thus term ionic bonding given ionic character greater covalent characterthat bond large electronegativity difference exists two atoms causing bonding polar ionic covalent bonding electrons shared equally bonds partially ionic partially covalent character called polar covalent bonds
ionic compounds conduct electricity molten solution typically solid ionic compounds generally high melting point depending charge ions consist higher charges stronger cohesive forces higher melting point also tend soluble water opposite trend roughly holds weaker cohesive forces greater solubility
