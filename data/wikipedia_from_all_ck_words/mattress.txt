a mattress is a large pad for supporting the reclining body used as a bed or as part of a bed mattresses may consist of a quilted or similarly fastened case usually of heavy cloth that contains hair straw cotton foam rubber etc. or a framework of metal springs mattresses may also be filled with air or water
the word mattress derives from the arabic matrah which means something thrown down or place where something is thrown down and hence mat cushion during the crusades europeans adopted the arabic method of sleeping on cushions on the floor and the word materas eventually descended into middle english through the romance languages
mattresses are usually placed on top of a bed base which may be solid as in the case of a platform bed or elastic e.g with an upholstered wood and wire box spring or a slatted foundation popular in europe a divan incorporates both mattress and foundation in a single upholstered footed unit divans have at least one innerspring layer as well as cushioning materials they may be supplied with a secondary mattress and/or a removable topper.
early mattresses contained a variety of natural materials including straw feathers or horse hair in the first half of the 20th century a typical mattress sold in north america had an innerspring core and cotton batting or fiberfill modern mattresses usually contain either an inner spring core or materials such as latex viscoelastic or other flexible polyurethane foams other fill components include insulator pads over the coils that prevent the bed's upholstery layers from cupping down into the innerspring as well as polyester fiberfill in the bed's top upholstery layers mattresses may also be filled with air or water or a variety of natural fibers such as in futons in southeast asia bedding is made with kapok in 1900 english-born engineer james marshall introduced the first individually wrapped pocketed spring coil mattress now commonly known as marshall coils and founded marshall mattress a company that bears his name and is still in operation in toronto canada he allowed vi-spring patent rights in england where they were known as marshall mattress of england until the 1930s
in north america the typical mattress sold today is an innerspring however there is increasing interest in all-foam beds and so-called hybrid beds which include both an innerspring and high-end foams such as visco-elastic or latex in the comfort layers in europe polyurethane foam cores and latex cores have long been popular and make up a much larger proportion of the mattresses sold in south asia coir is a common mattress material
== construction ==
a conventional mattress consists of two primary sections a core or support layer and the upholstery or comfort layer wrapped in a thick fabric called the ticking
upholstery layers cover the mattress and provide cushioning and comfort the upholstery layer consists of three parts the insulator the middle upholstery and the quilt
== types ==
=== innerspring ===
innerspring mattresses commonly consist of just the spring core and the top and bottom upholstery layers
==== core ====
the core of the mattress supports the sleepers body modern spring mattress cores often called innersprings, are made up of steel coil springs or coils.
the gauge of the coils is another factor which determines firmness and support coils are measured in quarter increments the lower the number the thicker the spring in general higher-quality mattress coils have a 14-gauge (1.63 mm) diameter coils of 14 to 15.5-gauge (1.63 to 1.37 mm) give more easily under pressure while a 12.5-gauge (1.94 mm) coil the thickest typically available feels quite firm
connections between the coils help the mattress retain its shape most coils are connected by interconnecting wires encased coils are not connected but the fabric encasement helps preserve the mattress shape
there are four types of mattress coils
bonnell coils are the oldest and most common first adapted from buggy seat springs of the 19th century they are still prevalent in mid-priced mattresses bonnell springs are a knotted round-top hourglass-shaped steel wire coil when laced together with cross wire helicals these coils form the simplest innerspring unit also referred to as a bonnell unit
offset coils are an hourglass type coil on which portions of the top and bottom convolutions have been flattened in assembling the innerspring unit these flat segments of wire are hinged together with helical wires the hinging effect of the unit is designed to conform to body shape lfk coils are an unknotted offset coil with a cylindrical or columnar shape
continuous coils (the leggett & platt brand name is mira-coil") is an innerspring configuration in which the rows of coils are formed from a single piece of wire they work in a hinging effect similar to that of offset coils
marshall coils also known as wrapped or encased coils or pocket springs are thin-gauge barrel-shaped knotless coils individually encased in fabric pocketsnormally a fabric from man-made nonwoven fiber some manufacturers precompress these coils which makes the mattress firmer and allows for motion separation between the sides of the bed as the springs are not wired together they work more or less independently the weight on one spring does not affect its neighbours more than half the consumers who participated in a survey had chosen to buy pocket spring mattresses
==== upholstery layers ====
upholstery layers cover the mattress and provide cushioning and comfort some manufacturers call the mattress core the support layer and the upholstery layer the comfort layer. the upholstery layer consists of three parts the insulator the middle upholstery and the quilt
the insulator separates the mattress core from the middle upholstery it is usually made of fibre or mesh and is intended to keep the middle upholstery in place
the middle upholstery comprises all the material between the insulator and the quilt it is usually made from materials which are intended to provide comfort to the sleeper including flexible polyurethane foam (which includes convoluted egg-crate foam) visco-elastic foam latex foam felt polyester fiber cotton fiber wool fiber and nonwoven fiber pads in europe and north america mattress makers have begun incorporating gel-infused foams soft-solid gels layered over foam and poured gels in the top comfort layer of the bed
the quilt is the top layer of the mattress made of light foam or fibres stitched to the underside of the ticking it provides a soft surface texture to the mattress and can be found in varying degrees of firmness
==== foundation ====
there are three main types of foundation or bed base
a traditional box spring consists of a rigid frame containing extra heavy duty springs this foundation is often paired with an innerspring mattress as it extends the life of the spring unit at the mattress's core all-foam mattresses are often paired with platform-style bases
an all-wood foundation usually has seven or eight support slats disposed below paperboard or beaverboard this foundation variously called a no-flex low-flex or zero-deflection unit as well as an ortho box provides support similar to a platform foundation all-wood foundations have become increasingly prevalent as u.s mattress makers shifted to super-thick one-sided mattresses
a grid-top foundation is a combination of steel and wood
typically the measurements of a foundation will be about 1-2 shorter than the measurement of a mattress
==== fabric cover ====
ticking is the protective fabric cover used to encase mattresses and foundations it is usually designed to coordinate with the foundation border fabric and comes in a wide variety of colors and styles mattress fabrics can be knits damask or printed wovens or inexpensive nonwovens during the past decade along with the rise in popularity of all-foam beds stretchy knit ticking on the bed's top panel has become a standard look on both innerspring and foam beds most ticking is made with polyester yarns more expensive mattress fabrics may contain a combination of polyester with rayon cotton silk wool or other natural yarns
until the early 2000s beds were normally upholstered with a single fabric this was usually a damask ticking or for inexpensive bedsets a nonwoven fabric covering all surfaces of the mattress and foundation today's bedsets are covered with up to six different fabrics a better quality circular knit or woven damask on the top panelthe bed's sleeping surface a matching or contrasting [usually woven] fabric on the border of the mattress a matching or contrasting [usually woven] fabric on the foundation side panels a non-skid woven or non-woven fabric on the surface of the foundation and reverse side of the mattress and a nonwoven dust cover on the under side of the foundation some north american mattress producers are beginning to use furniture upholstery fabrics on the bed's borders giving beds a more european home furnishings look
=== foam mattress ===
all-foam mattresses use different weights and densities of petrochemical-based flexible polyurethane foams and visco-elastic foams or memory foam and latex rubber foams a number of mattress manufacturers have incorporated polyurethane and visco-elastic foams with a portion of plant-based content
==== latex foam ====
latex foam in mattresses is generally a blend of the latex of the hevea brasiliensis tree and synthetic latex which is derived from petrochemicals and other substances and fillers there are however natural latex mattresses that leave out polyurethane-based chemicals latex foam is produced using either the talalay or the dunlop process each provides a different feel dunlop is generally a firmer foam talalay is softer while the dunlop process produces a denser foam the talalay process produces a lighter one that has more air in it if you were to weigh each as latex cores the dunlop foam would be heavier because it has more latex in it talalay is more expensive as its production is more resource intensive natural latex foam has a higher latex content than synthetic latex however 100% natural latex foam is misleading
==== memory foam ====
memory foam mattresses use conforming visco-elastic foam over firmer polyurethane base foam some innerspring mattresses have memory foam in their upholstery layer different feels and comfort levels are achieved by varying the thickness weight and formulation of the visco-elastic foams and the base foams latex and memory foam mattresses each provide a unique feel this type of mattress is good at relieving pressure on painful joints but is usually more expensive than spring mattresses
memory foam is affected by temperature in a cool bedroom a memory foam mattress will feel firmer than it does in a warm bedroom memory softens and conforms to the sleeper in response to body temperature and body weight traditional memory foam molds to the body creating a depression the sleeper must roll out of when changing sleep positions mattress manufacturers have responded to this issue by using faster response memory foams they spring back more quickly when the sleeper moves foam mattresses are also known to generally sleep warmer than innerspring mattresses mattress makers have addressed the issue with open-cell memory foams pinhole cored memory foam gel-infused memory foams channel-cut foam cores reticulated foam support layers and other technologies to improve air circulation through all-foam beds
=== bladder mattresses ===
mattresses can also be made from bladders of some fluid notably water or air these date to antiquity goatskin bladders filled with water were used in persia at least as early as 3600 bce and gained increased popularity in the 20th century with improved manufacturing
==== air mattress ====
air mattresses use one or more air chambers instead of springs to provide support quality and price can range from inexpensive ones used occasionally for camping to high-end luxury beds air mattresses designed for typical bedroom use cost about the same as inner-spring mattresses with comparable features
air bladder construction varies from a simple polyethylene bag to internally baffled multiple chambers of latex (vulcanized rubber) or vinyl with bonded cotton exteriors mattresses may have a layer of foam above the air chambers for added cushioning and may be enclosed in a cover some such beds are termed soft-sided air beds
adjustable-firmness air mattresses are available some allow independent adjustment of each side of the bed they are made in a variety of models from basic no-frills ones that measure about 7 in height to high-profile 15 tall hybrids that contain several types of foam pillow tops and digital pumps with memory for individual pressure settings
adjustable-firmness mattresses for medical use have special control mechanisms in the 1990s self-adjusting air beds that automatically change their pressure periodically or inflate and deflate several air chambers alternately were introduced the intention of these periodic changes is to reduce problems with decubitus ulcers (bed sores) though as of 2008 the effectiveness of these techniques was still being researched
air mattresses for camping are available which are filled with foam which itself provides little support but expands when the air valve is opened allowing air to enter so the mattress (nearly) inflates by itself this is especially useful for campers who carry their equipment as unlike with normal air mattresses no pump is needed for inflating available brands include aerobed coleman therm-a-rest and others
the u.s consumer product safety commission advises consumers not to let infants sleep on air mattresses this is motivated by reports of deaths mostly infants younger than 8 months of age who were placed to sleep on air mattresses and either suffocated in a face down position on an air mattress or died due to suffocation after falling into gaps between the mattress and bed frame or the mattress and adjacent furniture or wall
==== waterbeds ====
a waterbed is a mattress with water in its interior instead of metal coils or air waterbeds can be lined with different layers of fiber to achieve the level of firmness the user desires waterbeds are well known for providing support to the spine and other body parts similar to the other mattress types there are several options of support which range up to 100% waveless where the user does not notice he/she is laying upon a waterbed
== quality ==
many parameters determine mattress quality laboratory test methods have been established for some of these parameters such as pressure distribution skin microclimate hygiene edge support and long-term stability some of these have been developed by duncan bain working on behalf of the uk's medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency
other parameters such as firmness are more specific to the sleeper in general firm mattresses are recommended for stomach and some back sleepers soft mattresses are recommended for side sleepers and medium mattresses are recommended for the majority of back sleepers double mattresses are available with a softer and a firmer part or with adjustable firmness levels to accommodate sleepers with different preferences who share a bed
== lifespan ==
mattresses deteriorate over time and the lifespan of a mattress depends on a variety of factors notably materials manufacturing quality care and the vigorousness of use a poor quality foam comfort layer can deteriorate noticeably in 1 year while a quality latex core can last 20 years or more innerspring cores typically last around 10 years the comfort layer is almost invariably the first area to fail which is why mattresses are often double-sided to extend the lifespan a separate topper may be used instead of or in addition to a comfort layer which reduces wear and is replaceable without replacing the entire mattress
in the united states mattress warranties are typically for 10 years or 20 years sometimes 25 years though this specifically addresses manufacturing defects and faster-than-normal deterioration not expected deterioration with time in the united states as of 2008 there is a general expectation that mattresses should last about 10 years and this is the average number of years americans keep mattresses though this varies by age group this expectation is based on a number of factors including sales pitches the expectation that mattresses will last the length of their warranty hence 10 years or 20 years accordingly and comparison with other household items
mattress replacement cycle is a key driver of income and profits for the mattress industry a 5-year replacement cycle yields double the sales of a 10-year replacement cycle for instance so the mattress industry has a financial incentive to shorten the replacement cycle notably the international sleep products association (ispa) established the better sleep council (bsc) in 1979 with the stated goal to shorten the mattress replacement cycle in addition to encouraging people to invest in better bedding
in terms of scientific studies an industry-funded 2006 study by researchers at oklahoma state university (funded by the bsc) of 59 people with poor sleep who received free new replacement mattresses for their existing mattresses 5 years or older (average age 9.5 years) found improved sleep particularly when the existing mattresses was cheap a follow-up paper by some of the same authors with additional statistical analysis reinforced these conclusions the bsc has subsequently cited this study in the ispa-published news magazine for mattress manufacturers bedtimes to advocate a more frequent replacement cycle specifically to consider replacing a mattress every five to seven years the recommendation is based largely on this study
== maintenance and care ==
the main wear problems that can occur with a mattress are sagging mildew and staining these are prevented by proper support rotation and flipping keeping it dry and using a mattress pad or protector some symptoms of a broken or worn-out mattress include springs which can be felt poking through the upholstery layer visible permanent sagging or deformity lumpiness and excessive squeaking
mattresses require a solid foundation which does not itself sag a sagging foundation such as by weak slats on a wide bed will in turn cause the mattress to sag consistently sleeping in the same place and body position causes excessive wear and thus rotating or flipping mattresses is used to reduce this double-sided mattresses can be alternately flipped width-wise (about the long axis) and length-wise (about the shorter axis) or alternately flipped and rotated while single-sided mattresses are only rotated which is simpler but less effective flipping/rotation schedules vary between materials and manufacturers but typically recommended is monthly for the first six months and every two or three months thereafter foundations should also be rotated if possible though less frequently rotating box springs twice a year is recommended while sagging is undesirable some level of indentation (about 8 cm or 1.5 inches) is natural if natural materials are used in a comfort layer
excessive wear on mattresses such as folding and bending placing heavy objects in one spot or excess force on the handles will also cause more rapid deterioration care should particularly be taken during transport or storage
mattresses require ventilation to remain dry and prevent mildew and thus should not be placed directly on the floor or on a solid surface slats or a box spring provide space for airflow while solid wood or plywood (as in cheap bunkie boards) does not additional ventilation is recommended for natural materials in which case leaving the mattress naked after stripping sheets (for example while laundering) is recommended if a mattress is allowed to become damp for example by wet cleaning mildew may develop inside the upholstery cleaning with a vacuum cleaner or mild surface cleanser and a slightly damp cloth avoids this
mattresses absorb fluids and stains readily notably from nightly sweating (which results in a yellow stain) and other bodily fluids (sexual fluids or menstruation) in addition to accidental spills these visibly stain the ticking and seep through into lower layers in addition to being unhygienic hard to launder and unsightly such stains typically void a warranty thus a mattress protector is suggested to protect the mattress this can be removed and cleaned separately and replaced if damaged
== sizes ==
mattresses thicknesses range from four to eighteen inches (10 to 46 cm)
