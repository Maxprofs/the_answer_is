also sometimes used loosely synonym totality intermolecular forces van der waals forces relatively weak compared covalent bonds play fundamental role fields diverse supramolecular chemistry structural biology polymer science nanotechnology surface science condensed matter physics van der waals forces define many properties organic compounds including solubility polar nonpolar media
low molecular weight alcohols hydrogenbonding properties polar hydroxyl group dominate weaker van der waals interactions higher molecular weight alcohols properties nonpolar hydrocarbon chains dominate define solubility van der waals forces quickly vanish longer distances interacting molecules
first direct measurements strength van der waals force single organic molecule bound metal surface made via atomic force microscopy corroborated density functional calculations
definitionedit
van der waals forces include attractions repulsions atoms molecules surfaces well intermolecular forces differ covalent ionic bonding caused correlations fluctuating polarizations nearby particles consequence quantum dynamics
intermolecular forces four major contributions
repulsive component resulting pauli exclusion principle prevents collapse molecules
attractive repulsive electrostatic interactions permanent charges case molecular ions dipoles case molecules without inversion center quadrupoles molecules symmetry lower cubic general permanent multipoles electrostatic interaction sometimes called keesom interaction keesom force willem hendrik keesom
induction also known polarization attractive interaction permanent multipole one molecule induced multipole another interaction sometimes called debye force peter jw debye
dispersion usually named fritz london attractive interaction pair molecules including nonpolar atoms arising interactions instantaneous multipoles
