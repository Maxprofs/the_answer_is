gregory chaitin a noted computer scientist propounds a view that comprehension is a kind of data compression in his essay the limits of reason he argues that understanding something means being able to figure out a simple set of rules that explains it for example we understand why day and night exist because we have a simple modelthe rotation of the earththat explains a tremendous amount of datachanges in brightness temperature and atmospheric composition of the earth we have compressed a large amount of information by using a simple model that predicts it similarly we understand the number 0.33333 by thinking of it as one-third the first way of representing the number requires an infinite amount of memory but the second way can produce all the data of the first representation but uses much less information chaitin argues that comprehension is this ability to compress data
