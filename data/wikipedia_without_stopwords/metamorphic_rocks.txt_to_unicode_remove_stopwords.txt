metamorphic rocks arise transformation existing rock types process called metamorphism means change form original rock protolith subjected heat temperatures greater c pressure bars causing profound physical andor chemical change protolith may sedimentary rock igneous rock another older metamorphic rock
metamorphic rocks make large part earths crust classified texture chemical mineral assemblage metamorphic facies may formed simply deep beneath earths surface subjected high temperatures great pressure rock layers form tectonic processes continental collisions cause horizontal pressure friction distortion also formed rock heated intrusion hot molten rock called magma earths interior study metamorphic rocks exposed earths surface following erosion uplift provides information temperatures pressures occur great depths within earths crust examples metamorphic rocks gneiss slate marble schist quartzite
metamorphic mineralsedit
metamorphic minerals form high temperatures pressures associated process metamorphism minerals known index minerals include sillimanite kyanite staurolite andalusite garnet
minerals olivines pyroxenes amphiboles micas feldspars quartz may found metamorphic rocks necessarily result process metamorphism minerals formed crystallization igneous rocks stable high temperatures pressures may remain chemically unchanged metamorphic process however minerals stable within certain limits presence minerals metamorphic rocks indicates approximate temperatures pressures formed
change particle size rock process metamorphism called recrystallization instance small calcite crystals sedimentary rock limestone chalk change larger crystals metamorphic rock marble metamorphosed sandstone recrystallization original quartz sand grains results compact quartzite also known metaquartzite often larger quartz crystals interlocked high temperatures pressures contribute recrystallization high temperatures allow atoms ions solid crystals migrate thus reorganizing crystals high pressures cause solution crystals within rock point contact
foliationedit
layering within metamorphic rocks called foliation derived latin word folia meaning leaves occurs rock shortened along one axis recrystallization causes platy elongated crystals minerals mica chlorite become rotated long axes perpendicular orientation shortening results banded foliated rock bands showing colors minerals formed
textures separated foliated nonfoliated categories foliated rock product differential stress deforms rock one plane sometimes creating plane cleavage example slate foliated metamorphic rock originating shale nonfoliated rock planar patterns strain
rocks subjected uniform pressure sides lack minerals distinctive growth habits foliated rock subject differential stress type foliation develops depends metamorphic grade instance starting mudstone following sequence develops increasing temperature slate finegrained foliated metamorphic rock characteristic low grade metamorphism phyllite finegrained found areas low grade metamorphism schist medium coarsegrained found areas medium grade metamorphism gneiss coarse coarsegrained found areas highgrade metamorphism marble generally foliated allows use material sculpture architecture
another important mechanism metamorphism chemical reactions occur minerals without melting process atoms exchanged minerals thus new minerals formed many complex hightemperature reactions may take place mineral assemblage produced provides us clue temperatures pressures time metamorphism
metasomatism drastic change bulk chemical composition rock often occurs processes metamorphism due introduction chemicals surrounding rocks water may transport chemicals rapidly great distances role played water metamorphic rocks generally contain many elements absent original rock lack originally present still introduction new chemicals necessary recrystallization occur

rock contact altered igneous intrusion frequently becomes indurated coarsely crystalline many altered rocks type formerly called hornstones term hornfels often used geologists signify fine grained compact nonfoliated products contact metamorphism shale may become dark argillaceous hornfels full tiny plates brownish biotite marl impure limestone may change grey yellow greenish limesilicatehornfels siliceous marble tough splintery abundant augite garnet wollastonite minerals calcite important component diabase andesite may become diabase hornfels andesite hornfels development new hornblende biotite partial recrystallization original feldspar chert flint may become finely crystalline quartz rock sandstones lose clastic structure converted mosaic small closefitting grains quartz metamorphic rock called quartzite
rock originally banded foliated example laminated sandstone foliated calcschist character may obliterated banded hornfels product fossils even may shapes preserved though entirely recrystallized many contactaltered lavas vesicles still visible though contents usually entered new combinations form minerals originally present minute structures however disappear often completely thermal alteration profound thus small grains quartz shale lost blend surrounding particles clay fine groundmass lavas entirely reconstructed
recrystallization manner peculiar rocks distinct types often produced thus shales may pass cordierite rocks may show large crystals andalusite chiastolite staurolite garnet kyanite sillimanite derived aluminous content original shale considerable amount mica muscovite biotite often simultaneously formed resulting product close resemblance many kinds schist limestones pure often turned coarsely crystalline marbles admixture clay sand original rock minerals garnet epidote idocrase wollastonite present sandstones greatly heated may change coarse quartzites composed large clear grains quartz intense stages alteration commonly seen igneous rocks minerals formed high temperatures easily transformed recrystallized
cases rocks fused dark glassy product minute crystals spinel sillimanite cordierite may separate shales occasionally thus altered basalt dikes feldspathic sandstones may completely vitrified similar changes may induced shales burning coal seams even ordinary furnace
also tendency metasomatism igneous magma sedimentary country rock whereby chemicals exchanged introduced granites may absorb fragments shale pieces basalt case hybrid rocks called skarn arise dont characteristics normal igneous sedimentary rocks sometimes invading granite magma permeates rocks around filling joints planes bedding etc threads quartz feldspar exceptional instances known may take place large scale
regional metamorphismedit
regional metamorphism also known dynamic metamorphism name given changes great masses rock wide area rocks metamorphosed simply great depths earths surface subjected high temperatures great pressure caused immense weight rock layers much lower continental crust metamorphic except recent igneous intrusions horizontal tectonic movements collision continents create orogenic belts cause high temperatures pressures deformation rocks along belts metamorphosed rocks later uplifted exposed erosion may occur long belts large areas surface process metamorphism may destroyed original features could revealed rocks previous history recrystallization rock destroy textures fossils present sedimentary rocks metasomatism change original composition
regional metamorphism tends make rock indurated time give foliated shistose gneissic texture consisting planar arrangement minerals platy prismatic minerals like mica hornblende longest axes arranged parallel one another reason many rocks split readily one direction along micabearing zones schists gneisses minerals also tend segregated bands thus seams quartz mica mica schist thin consisting essentially one mineral along mineral layers composed soft fissile minerals rocks split readily freshly split specimens appear faced coated mineral example piece mica schist looked facewise might supposed consist entirely shining scales mica edge specimens however white folia granular quartz visible gneisses alternating folia sometimes thicker less regular schists importantly less micaceous may lenticular dying rapidly gneisses also rule contain feldspar schists tougher less fissile contortion crumbling foliation means uncommon splitting faces undulose puckered schistosity gneissic banding two main types foliation formed directed pressure elevated temperature interstitial movement internal flow arranging mineral particles crystallizing directed pressure field
