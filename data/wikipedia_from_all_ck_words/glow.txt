== recording ==
feels is known for its unconventional guitar sounds which were obtained in part by the unique tuning the band used geologist explained how they created and used this tuning on the collected animals message board
all the songs on feels are tuned to our friends piano which was out of tune to begin with dave and i made loops from recordings of him playing her piano and we used those loops in the early songwriting process for feels so since those loops are premade and can't be tuned the guitars have to be tuned to the loops it's not out of tune in any traditional whole step/half step kind of way...we're talking microtonally out of tune after years of not being professionally tuned and subtle natural detuning kind of like if you played guitar in standard tuning for years but never once re-tuned it to make sure it was right it would have its own unique out-of-tune tuning based on what strings you played most often how hard you played it the temperature in the room the humidity etc when we went into the studio it ruled over everything we did even doctess's live piano playing required us bringing in a professional piano tuner playing him a minidisc recording of our friend's out of tune piano and having him try to de-tune the studio's piano in exactly the same way our friend's was without those recordings or the loops dave and i made you wouldn't be able to get it exact unless you tune to the album while it's playing and even then you'd have to know which loop in the album we use to tune which one chord it is and because of the way we mixed the loop in it is almost impossible to separate from dave's guitar i'll never forget when the tuner finished (we had to wait to start recording until he finished) and he stood up from the bench and went there you go the piano's perfectly out of tune.
feels is the first album to feature significant contributions from musicians outside its core members geologist described the contributions of doctess and the recording process on the collected animals message board
kristin plays on every song she played live as we did the live tracking but there was often a lot of bleed into the piano mics from the other instruments so she often re-did or elaborated on her parts at night when she could have quiet in the studio we all played in one room so there was so [sic] isolation except josh's guitar amps which we stuck in a bathroom.
geologist also described working with eyvind kang on the collected animals message board
he was only there for an afternoon we had sent him live recordings of the songs we wanted him on (daffy bees fickle cycle and people) but he never had a chance to listen to them so he came in and would listen to each track once then talk with us about ideas and then just improvise over the song as scott [colburn] predicted (he has worked with eyvind many times over the last 10 years) he never hit a wrong note it was pretty mindblowing to watch he played violin viola and tried some traditional chinese instrument which we took out because it didn't mix so well wish we had more time to jam because i'm sure it [would] have [been] a lot of fun dave [aka avey tare] and i had been thinking about who to ask to play violin on a few songs that we wanted violin on and eyvind was our first choice we'd been big fans of his since first hearing him play violin on a sun city girls record in the mid-90's it was kind of just great luck that he was our first choice and that scott knew him and had recorded him a bunch and that he lived in the seattle area when i first asked him if he'd be interested his crucial question was what we wanted out of a violin part in a song did we want it to stand out melodically so a listener would say oh here comes the violin part or did we want him to explore the violin and how it would fit into the song (i.e doing noise more textural parts) i replied the latter and he was stoked that was the ultimate reason we chose him he's so good at exploring and pushing the limits of his instruments he can master the pretty and melodic stuff harsh noise music trancey drones etc.
engineer scott colburn also provided a few details about recording feels on the collected animals message board (under the username scooter") feels started on tape and ended up in nuendo...the vocals had effects on them but they were no different than the effects used live butt [sic] each vocal track was recorded with 6 microphones thereby creating a whole new effect.
== title and artwork ==
the cover art is reminiscent of the work of artist henry darger its creator the group's singer dave portner has been a huge fan of darger but didn't have darger in mind while creating the cover art he found a children's educational guide on the street and thought the images fit the sound and the lyrics perfectly. in an interview kria brekkan revealed the origin of the title i think what i brought to it perhaps got channeled through dave's creativity and so on we had been intense pan-pals for nearly a year at the time when it was recorded and when my friends saw the album cover they thought it was my art and they laughed about the title because it came from my use of english i used the word feels for feelings.
