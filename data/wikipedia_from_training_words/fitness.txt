reason is the capacity for consciously making sense of things applying logic establishing and verifying facts and changing or justifying practices institutions and beliefs based on new or existing information it is closely associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy science language mathematics and art and is normally considered to be a definitive characteristic of human nature the concept of reason is sometimes referred to as rationality and sometimes as discursive reason in opposition to intuitive reason
reason or reasoning is associated with thinking cognition and intellect reason like habit or intuition is one of the ways by which thinking comes from one idea to a related idea for example it is the means by which rational beings understand themselves to think about cause and effect truth and falsehood and what is good or bad it is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change beliefs attitudes traditions and institutions and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination
in contrast to reason as an abstract noun a reason is a consideration which explains or justifies some event phenomenon or behaviour the field of logic studies ways in which human beings reason through argument
psychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason e.g which cognitive and neural processes are engaged and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw the field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason
== etymology and related wordsedit ==
in the english language and other modern european languages reason and related words represent words which have always been used to translate latin and classical greek terms in the sense of their philosophical usage
the original greek term was  logos the root of the modern english word logic but also a word which could mean for example speech or explanation or an account (of money handled)
as a philosophical term logos was translated in its non-linguistic senses in latin as ratio this was originally not just a translation used for philosophy but was also commonly a translation for logos in the sense of an account of money
french raison is derived directly from latin and this is the direct source of the english word reason
the earliest major philosophers to publish in english such as francis bacon thomas hobbes and john locke also routinely wrote in latin and french and compared their terms to greek treating the words logos ratio raison and reason as inter-changeable the meaning of the word reason in senses such as human reason also overlaps to a large extent with rationality and the adjective of reason in philosophical contexts is normally rational rather than reasoned or reasonable some philosophers such as thomas hobbes for example also used the word ratiocination as a synonym for reasoning
== philosophical historyedit ==
the proposal that reason gives humanity a special position in nature has been argued to be a defining characteristic of western philosophy and later western modern science starting with classical greece philosophy can be described as a way of life based upon reason and in the other direction reason has been one of the major subjects of philosophical discussion since ancient times reason is often said to be reflexive or self-correcting, and the critique of reason has been a persistent theme in philosophy it has been defined in different ways at different times by different thinkers
=== classical philosophyedit ===
for many classical philosophers nature was understood teleologically meaning that every type of thing had a definitive purpose which fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims perhaps starting with pythagoras or heraclitus the cosmos is even said to have reason reason by this account is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature such as sociability because it is something humans share with nature itself linking an apparently immortal part of the human mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself within the human mind or soul (psyche) reason was described by plato as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts such as spiritedness (thumos) and the emotions aristotle plato's student defined human beings as rational animals emphasizing reason as a characteristic of human nature he defined the highest human happiness or well being (eudaimonia) as a life which is lived consistently excellently and completely in accordance with reason
the conclusions to be drawn from the discussions of aristotle and plato on this matter are amongst the most debated in the history of philosophy but teleological accounts such as aristotle's were highly influential for those who attempt to explain reason in a way which is consistent with monotheism and the immortality and divinity of the human soul for example in the neo-platonist account of plotinus the cosmos has one soul which is the seat of all reason and the souls of all individual humans are part of this soul reason is for plotinus both the provider of form to material things and the light which brings individuals souls back into line with their source such neo-platonist accounts of the rational part of the human soul were standard amongst medieval islamic philosophers and under this influence mainly via averroes came to be debated seriously in europe until well into the renaissance and they remain important in iranian philosophy
=== subject-centred reason in early modern philosophyedit ===
the early modern era was marked by a number of significant changes in the understanding of reason starting in europe one of the most important of these changes involved a change in the metaphysical understanding of human beings scientists and philosophers began to question the teleological understanding of the world nature was no longer assumed to be human-like with its own aims or reason and human nature was no longer assumed to work according to anything other than the same laws of nature which affect inanimate things this new understanding eventually displaced the previous world view that derived from a spiritual understanding of the universe
accordingly in the 17th century ren descartes explicitly rejected the traditional notion of humans as rational animals, suggesting instead that they are nothing more than thinking things along the lines of other things in nature any grounds of knowledge outside that understanding was therefore subject to doubt
in his search for a foundation of all possible knowledge descartes deliberately decided to throw into doubt all knowledge except that of the mind itself in the process of thinking
at this time i admit nothing that is not necessarily true i am therefore precisely nothing but a thinking thing that is a mind or intellect or understanding or reason words of whose meanings i was previously ignorant
this eventually became known as epistemological or subject-centred reason because it is based on the knowing subject who perceives the rest of the world and itself as a set of objects to be studied and successfully mastered by applying the knowledge accumulated through such study breaking with tradition and many thinkers after him descartes explicitly did not divide the incorporeal soul into parts such as reason and intellect describing them as one indivisible incorporeal entity
a contemporary of descartes thomas hobbes described reason as a broader version of addition and subtraction which is not limited to numbers this understanding of reason is sometimes termed calculative reason similar to descartes hobbes asserted that no discourse whatsoever can end in absolute knowledge of fact past or to come but that sense and memory is absolute knowledge
in the late 17th century through the 18th century john locke and david hume developed descartes line of thought still further hume took it in an especially skeptical direction proposing that there could be no possibility of deducing relationships of cause and effect and therefore no knowledge is based on reasoning alone even if it seems otherwise
hume famously remarked that we speak not strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason reason is and ought only to be the slave of the passions and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them. hume also took his definition of reason to unorthodox extremes by arguing unlike his predecessors that human reason is not qualitatively different from either simply conceiving individual ideas or from judgments associating two ideas and that reason is nothing but a wonderful and unintelligible instinct in our souls which carries us along a certain train of ideas and endows them with particular qualities according to their particular situations and relations. it followed from this that animals have reason only much less complex than human reason
in the 18th century immanuel kant attempted to show that hume was wrong by demonstrating that a transcendental self or i was a necessary condition of all experience therefore suggested kant on the basis of such a self it is in fact possible to reason both about the conditions and limits of human knowledge and so long as these limits are respected reason can be the vehicle of morality justice and understanding
=== substantive and formal reasonedit ===
in the formulation of kant who wrote some of the most influential modern treatises on the subject the great achievement of reason is that it is able to exercise a kind of universal law-making kant was able therefore to re-formulate the basis of moral-practical theoretical and aesthetic reasoning on universal laws
here practical reasoning is the self-legislating or self-governing formulation of universal norms and theoretical reasoning the way humans posit universal laws of nature
under practical reason the moral autonomy or freedom of human beings depends on their ability to behave according to laws that are given to them by the proper exercise of that reason this contrasted with earlier forms of morality which depended on religious understanding and interpretation or nature for their substance
according to kant in a free society each individual must be able to pursue their goals however they see fit so long as their actions conform to principles given by reason he formulated such a principle called the categorical imperative which would justify an action only if it could be universalized
act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law
in contrast to hume then kant insists that reason itself (german vernunft) has natural ends itself the solution to the metaphysical problems especially the discovery of the foundations of morality kant claimed that this problem could be solved with his transcendental logic which unlike normal logic is not just an instrument which can be used indifferently as it was for aristotle but a theoretical science in its own right and the basis of all the others
according to jrgen habermas the substantive unity of reason has dissolved in modern times such that it can no longer answer the question how should i live? instead the unity of reason has to be strictly formal or procedural. he thus described reason as a group of three autonomous spheres (on the model of kant's three critiques)
cognitive-instrumental reason is the kind of reason employed by the sciences it is used to observe events to predict and control outcomes and to intervene in the world on the basis of its hypotheses
moral-practical reason is what we use to deliberate and discuss issues in the moral and political realm according to universalizable procedures (similar to kant's categorical imperative) and
aesthetic reason is typically found in works of art and literature and encompasses the novel ways of seeing the world and interpreting things that those practices embody
for habermas these three spheres are the domain of experts and therefore need to be mediated with the lifeworld by philosophers in drawing such a picture of reason habermas hoped to demonstrate that the substantive unity of reason which in pre-modern societies had been able to answer questions about the good life could be made up for by the unity of reason's formalizable procedures
=== the critique of reasonedit ===
hamann herder kant hegel kierkegaard nietzsche heidegger foucault rorty and many other philosophers have contributed to a debate about what reason means or ought to mean some like kierkegaard nietzsche and rorty are skeptical about subject-centred universal or instrumental reason and even skeptical toward reason as a whole others including hegel believe that it has obscured the importance of intersubjectivity or spirit in human life and attempt to reconstruct a model of what reason should be
some thinkers e.g foucault believe there are other forms of reason neglected but essential to modern life and to our understanding of what it means to live a life according to reason
in the last several decades a number of proposals have been made to re-orient this critique of reason or to recognize the other voices or new departments of reason
for example in opposition to subject-centred reason habermas has proposed a model of communicative reason that sees it as an essentially cooperative activity based on the fact of linguistic intersubjectivity
nikolas kompridis has proposed a widely encompassing view of reason as that ensemble of practices that contributes to the opening and preserving of openness in human affairs and a focus on reason's possibilities for social change
the philosopher charles taylor influenced by the 20th century german philosopher martin heidegger has proposed that reason ought to include the faculty of disclosure which is tied to the way we make sense of things in everyday life as a new department of reason
in the essay what is enlightenment? michel foucault proposed a concept of critique based on kant's distinction between private and public uses of reason this distinction as suggested has two dimensions
private reason is the reason that is used when an individual is a cog in a machine or when one has a role to play in society and jobs to do to be a soldier to have taxes to pay to be in charge of a parish to be a civil servant.
public reason is the reason used when one is reasoning as a reasonable being (and not as a cog in a machine) when one is reasoning as a member of reasonable humanity. in these circumstances the use of reason must be free and public.
== reason compared to related conceptsedit ==
=== reason compared to logicedit ===
the terms logic or logical are sometimes used as if they were identical with the term reason or with the concept of being rational or sometimes logic is seen as the most pure or the defining form of reason for example in modern economics rational choice is assumed to equate to logically consistent choice
reason and logic can however be thought of as distinct although logic is one important aspect of reason author douglas hofstadter in gdel escher bach characterizes the distinction in this way logic is done inside a system while reason is done outside the system by such methods as skipping steps working backward drawing diagrams looking at examples or seeing what happens if you change the rules of the system
reason is a type of thought and the word logic involves the attempt to describe rules or norms by which reasoning operates so that orderly reasoning can be taught the oldest surviving writing to explicitly consider the rules by which reason operates are the works of the greek philosopher aristotle especially prior analysis and posterior analysis although the ancient greeks had no separate word for logic as distinct from language and reason aristotle's newly coined word syllogism (syllogismos) identified logic clearly for the first time as a distinct field of study when aristotle referred to the logical (h logik) he was referring more broadly to rational thought
=== reason compared to cause-and-effect thinking and symbolic thinkingedit ===
as pointed out by philosophers such as hobbes locke and hume some animals are also clearly capable of a type of associative thinking even to the extent of associating causes and effects a dog once kicked can learn how to recognize the warning signs and avoid being kicked in the future but this does not mean the dog has reason in any strict sense of the word it also does not mean that humans acting on the basis of experience or habit are using their reason
human reason requires more than being able to associate two ideas even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect perceptions of smoke for example and memories of fire for reason to be involved the association of smoke and the fire would have to be thought through in a way which can be explained for example as cause and effect in the explanation of locke for example reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of syllogism
more generally reason in the strict sense requires the ability to create and manipulate a system of symbols as well as indices and icons according to charles sanders peirce the symbols having only a nominal though habitual connection to either smoke or fire one example of such a system of artificial symbols and signs is language
the connection of reason to symbolic thinking has been expressed in different ways by philosophers thomas hobbes described the creation of markes or notes of remembrance (leviathan ch.4) as speech he used the word speech as an english version of the greek word logos so that speech did not need to be communicated when communicated such speech becomes language and the marks or notes or remembrance are called signes by hobbes going further back although aristotle is a source of the idea that only humans have reason (logos) he does mention that animals with imagination for whom sense perceptions can persist come closest to having something like reasoning and nous and even uses the word logos in one place to describe the distinctions which animals can perceive in such cases
=== reason imagination mimesis and memoryedit ===
reason and imagination rely on similar mental processes imagination is not only found in humans aristotle for example stated that phantasia (imagination that which can hold images or phantasmata) and phronein (a type of thinking that can judge and understand in some sense) also exist in some animals according to him both are related to the primary perceptive ability of animals which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order of the things that are perceived without distinguishing universals and without deliberation or logos but this is not yet reason because human imagination is different
the recent modern writings of terrence deacon and merlin donald writing about the origin of language also connect reason connected to not only language but also mimesis more specifically they describe the ability to create language as part of an internal modeling of reality specific to humankind other results are consciousness and imagination or fantasy in contrast modern proponents of a genetic pre-disposition to language itself include noam chomsky and steven pinker to whom donald and deacon can be contrasted
as reason is symbolic thinking and peculiarly human then this implies that humans have a special ability to maintain a clear consciousness of the distinctness of icons or images and the real things they represent starting with a modern author merlin donald writes
a dog might perceive the meaning of a fight that was realistically play-acted by humans but it could not reconstruct the message or distinguish the representation from its referent (a real fight) [...] trained apes are able to make this distinction young children make this distinction early hence their effortless distinction between play-acting an event and the event itself
in classical descriptions an equivalent description of this mental faculty is eikasia in the philosophy of plato this is the ability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else related somehow but not the same and therefore allows humans to perceive that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such what klein refers to as dianoetic eikasia is the eikasia concerned specifically with thinking and mental images such as those mental symbols icons signes and marks discussed above as definitive of reason explaining reason from this direction human thinking is special in the way that we often understand visible things as if they were themselves images of our intelligible objects of thought as foundations (hypothses in ancient greek) this thinking (dianoia) is ...an activity which consists in making the vast and diffuse jungle of the visible world depend on a plurality of more precise nota.
both merlin donald and the socratic authors such plato and aristotle emphasize the importance of mimesis often translated as imitation or representation donald writes
imitation is found especially in monkeys and apes [ but ] mimesis is fundamentally different from imitation and mimicry in that it involves the invention of intentional representations [...] mimesis is not absolutely tied to external communication
mimsis is a concept now popular again in academic discussion that was particularly prevalent in plato's works and within aristotle it is discussed mainly in the poetics in michael davis's account of the theory of man in this work
it is the distinctive feature of human action that whenever we choose what we do we imagine an action for ourselves as though we were inspecting it from the outside intentions are nothing more than imagined actions internalizings of the external all action is therefore imitation of action it is poetic
donald like plato (and aristotle especially in on memory and recollection) emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through one's mental world the ancient greek anamnsis normally translated as recollection was opposed to mneme or memory memory shared with some animals requires a consciousness not only of what happened in the past but also that something happened in the past which is in other words a kind of eikasia ...but nothing except man is able to recollect. recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known klein writes that to become aware of our having forgotten something means to begin recollecting. donald calls the same thing autocueing which he explains as follows mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal self-generated cues this permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations without the aid of external cues probably the earliest form of representational thinking.
in a celebrated paper in modern times the fantasy author and philologist j.r.r tolkien wrote in his essay on fairy stories that the terms fantasy and enchantment are connected to not only ....the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires.... but also ...the origin of language and of the mind.
=== logical reasoning methods and argumentationedit ===
looking at logical categorizations of different types of reasoning the traditional main division made in philosophy is between deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning formal logic has been described as the science of deduction the study of inductive reasoning is generally carried out within the field known as informal logic or critical thinking
==== deductive reasoningedit ====
a subdivision of philosophy is logic logic is the study of reasoning deduction is a form of reasoning in which a conclusion follows necessarily from the stated premises a deduction is also the conclusion reached by a deductive reasoning process one classic example of deductive reasoning is that found in syllogisms like the following
premise 1 all humans are mortal
premise 2 socrates is a human
conclusion socrates is mortal
the reasoning in this argument is valid because there is no way in which the premises 1 and 2 could be true and the conclusion 3 be false
==== inductive reasoningedit ====
induction is a form of inference producing propositions about unobserved objects or types either specifically or generally based on previous observation it is used to ascribe properties or relations to objects or types based on previous observations or experiences or to formulate general statements or laws based on limited observations of recurring phenomenal patterns
inductive reasoning contrasts strongly with deductive reasoning in that even in the best or strongest cases of inductive reasoning the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion instead the conclusion of an inductive argument follows with some degree of probability relatedly the conclusion of an inductive argument contains more information than is already contained in the premises thus this method of reasoning is ampliative
a classic example of inductive reasoning comes from the empiricist david hume
premise the sun has risen in the east every morning up until now
conclusion the sun will also rise in the east tomorrow
==== abductive reasoningedit ====
abductive reasoning or argument to the best explanation is a form of inductive reasoning since the conclusion in an abductive argument does not follow with certainty from its premises and concerns something unobserved what distinguishes abduction from the other forms of reasoning is an attempt to favour one conclusion above others by attempting to falsify alternative explanations or by demonstrating the likelihood of the favoured conclusion given a set of more or less disputable assumptions for example when a patient displays certain symptoms there might be various possible causes but one of these is preferred above others as being more probable
==== analogical reasoningedit ====
analogical reasoning is incorrectly reasoning from the particular to the particular an example follows
premise 1 socrates is human and mortal
premise 2 plato is human
conclusion plato is mortal
analogical reasoning can be viewed as a form of inductive reasoning from a single example but if it is intended as inductive reasoning it is a bad example because inductive reasoning typically uses a large number of examples to reason from the particular to the general analogical reasoning often leads to wrong conclusions for example
premise 1 socrates is human and male
premise 2 beyonc is human
conclusion therefore beyonc is male
==== fallacious reasoningedit ====
flawed reasoning in arguments is known as fallacious reasoning bad reasoning within arguments can be because it commits either a formal fallacy or an informal fallacy
formal fallacies occur when there is a problem with the form or structure of the argument the word formal refers to this link to the form of the argument an argument that contains a formal fallacy will always be invalid
an informal fallacy is an error in reasoning that occurs due to a problem with the content rather than mere structure of the argument
== traditional problems raised concerning reasonedit ==
philosophy is sometimes described as a life of reason with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim or philosophizing about philosophizing the first question is concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve knowledge of truth better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge the other question is whether a life of reason a life that aims to be guided by reason can be expected to achieve a happy life more so than other ways of life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not)
=== reason versus truth and first principles"edit ===
since classical times a question has remained constant in philosophical debate (which is sometimes seen as a conflict between movements called platonism and aristotelianism) concerning the role of reason in confirming truth people use logic deduction and induction to reach conclusions they think are true conclusions reached in this way are considered more certain than sense perceptions on their own on the other hand if such reasoned conclusions are only built originally upon a foundation of sense perceptions then our most logical conclusions can never be said to be certain because they are built upon the very same fallible perceptions they seek to better
this leads to the question of what types of first principles or starting points of reasoning are available for someone seeking to come to true conclusions in greek first principles are archai starting points and the faculty used to perceive them is sometimes referred to in aristotle and plato as nous which was close in meaning to awareness or consciousness
empiricism (sometimes associated with aristotle but more correctly associated with british philosophers such as john locke and david hume as well as their ancient equivalents such as democritus) asserts that sensory impressions are the only available starting points for reasoning and attempting to attain truth this approach always leads to the controversial conclusion that absolute knowledge is not attainable idealism (associated with plato and his school) claims that there is a higher reality from which certain people can directly arrive at truth without needing to rely only upon the senses and that this higher reality is therefore the primary source of truth
philosophers such as plato aristotle al-farabi avicenna averroes maimonides aquinas and hegel are sometimes said to have argued that reason must be fixed and discoverableperhaps by dialectic analysis or study in the vision of these thinkers reason is divine or at least has divine attributes such an approach allowed religious philosophers such as thomas aquinas and tienne gilson to try to show that reason and revelation are compatible according to hegel ...the only thought which philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of history is the simple conception of reason that reason is the sovereign of the world that the history of the world therefore presents us with a rational process.
since the 17th century rationalists reason has often been taken to be a subjective faculty or rather the unaided ability (pure reason) to form concepts for descartes spinoza and leibniz this was associated with mathematics kant attempted to show that pure reason could form concepts (time and space) that are the conditions of experience kant made his argument in opposition to hume who denied that reason had any role to play in experience
=== reason versus emotion or passionedit ===
after plato and aristotle western literature often treated reason as being opposed to emotions or feelings this was an understanding of human nature developed for example by stoic philosophy in roman times people might say their passions made them behave contrary to reason or that their reason kept the passions under control this is often expressed colloquially as the dilemma between following the head (reason) or the heart (emotions)
reason has been seen as a slave or judge of the passions notably in the work of david hume and more recently of freud reasoning which claims that the object of a desire is demanded by logic alone is called rationalization
rousseau first proposed in his second discourse that reason and political life is not natural and possibly harmful to mankind he asked what really can be said about what is natural to mankind what other than reason and civil society best suits his constitution rousseau saw two principles prior to reason in human nature first we hold an intense interest in our own well-being secondly we object to the suffering or death of any sentient being especially one like ourselves these two passions lead us to desire more than we could achieve we become dependent upon each other and on relationships of authority and obedience this effectively puts the human race into slavery rousseau says that he almost dares to assert that nature does not destine men to be healthy according to velkley rousseau outlines certain programs of rational self-correction most notably the political legislation of the contrat social and the moral education in mile all the same rousseau understands such corrections to be only ameliorations of an essentially unsatisfactory condition that of socially and intellectually corrupted humanity.
this quandary presented by rousseau led to kant's new way of justifying reason as freedom to create good and evil these therefore are not to be blamed on nature or god in various ways german idealism after kant and major later figures such nietzsche bergson husserl scheler and heidegger remain pre-occupied with problems coming from the metaphysical demands or urges of reason the influence of rousseau and these later writers is also large upon art and politics many writers (such as nikos kazantzakis) extol passion and disparage reason in politics modern nationalism comes from rousseau's argument that rationalist cosmopolitanism brings man ever further from his natural state
another view on reason and emotion was proposed in the 1994 book titled descartes error by antonio damasio in it damasio presents the somatic marker hypothesis which states that emotions guide behavior and decision-making damasio argues that these somatic markers (known collectively as gut feelings") are intuitive signals that direct our decision making processes in a certain way that cannot be solved with rationality alone damasio further argues that rationality requires emotional input in order to function
=== reason versus faith or traditionedit ===
though theologies and religions typically do not claim to be irrational there is often a perceived conflict or tension between faith and tradition on the one hand and reason on the other as potentially competing sources of wisdom law and truth defenders of traditions and faiths from claims that they are irrationalist for ignoring or even attempting to forbid reason and argument concerning some subjects typically maintain that there is no real conflict with reason because reason itself is not enough to explain such things as the origins of the universe or right and wrong and so reason can and should be complemented by other sources of knowledge or in other words first principles the counter claim to this is that such a defense does not logically explain why some arguments from reason would be forbidden or ignored while others are favoured
there are enormously wide differences between different faiths or even schools within different faiths concerning this matter
some commentators have claimed that western civilization can be almost defined by its serious testing of the limits of tension between unaided reason and faith in revealed truthsfiguratively summarized as athens and jerusalem respectively leo strauss spoke of a greater west that included all areas under the influence of the tension between greek rationalism and abrahamic revelation including the muslim lands he was particularly influenced by the great muslim philosopher al-farabi to consider to what extent eastern philosophy might have partaken of these important tensions strauss thought it best to consider whether dharma or tao may be equivalent to nature (by which we mean physis in greek) according to strauss the beginning of philosophy involved the discovery or invention of nature and the pre-philosophical equivalent of nature was supplied by such notions as custom or ways which appear to be really universal in all times and places the philosophical concept of nature or natures as a way of understanding archai (first principles of knowledge) brought about a peculiar tension between reasoning on the one hand and tradition or faith on the other
although there is this special history of debate concerning reason and faith in the islamic christian and jewish traditions the pursuit of reason is sometimes argued to be compatible with the other practice of other religions of a different nature such as hinduism because they do not define their tenets in such an absolute way
== reason in particular fields of studyedit ==
=== reason in political philosophy and ethicsedit ===
aristotle famously described reason (with language) as a part of human nature which means that it is best for humans to live politically meaning in communities of about the size and type of a small city state (polis in greek) for example
it is clear then that a human being is more of a political [politikon = of the polis] animal [zion] than is any bee or than any of those animals that live in herds for nature as we say makes nothing in vain and humans are the only animals who possess reasoned speech [logos] voice of course serves to indicate what is painful and pleasant that is why it is also found in other animals because their nature has reached the point where they can perceive what is painful and pleasant and express these to each other but speech [logos] serves to make plain what is advantageous and harmful and so also what is just and unjust for it is a peculiarity of humans in contrast to the other animals to have perception of good and bad just and unjust and the like and the community in these things makes a household or city [polis] [...] by nature then the drive for such a community exists in everyone but the first to set one up is responsible for things of very great goodness for as humans are the best of all animals when perfected so they are the worst when divorced from law and right the reason is that injustice is most difficult to deal with when furnished with weapons and the weapons a human being has are meant by nature to go along with prudence and virtue but it is only too possible to turn them to contrary uses consequently if a human being lacks virtue he is the most unholy and savage thing and when it comes to sex and food the worst but justice is something political [to do with the polis] for right is the arrangement of the political community and right is discrimination of what is just (aristotle's politics 1253a 1.2 peter simpson's translation with greek terms inserted in square brackets.)
the concept of human nature being fixed in this way implied in other words that we can define what type of community is always best for people this argument has remained a central argument in all political ethical and moral thinking since then and has become especially controversial since firstly rousseau's second discourse and secondly the theory of evolution already in aristotle there was an awareness that the polis had not always existed and had needed to be invented or developed by humans themselves the household came first and the first villages and cities were just extensions of that with the first cities being run as if they were still families with kings acting like fathers
friendship [philia] seems to prevail [in] man and woman according to nature [kata phusin] for people are by nature [ti phusei] pairing [sunduastikon] more than political [politikon = of the polis] inasmuch as the household [oikos] is prior [proteron = earlier] and more necessary than the polis and making children is more common [koinoteron] with the animals in the other animals community [koinnia] goes no further than this but people live together [sumoikousin] not only for the sake of making children but also for the things for life for from the start the functions [erga] are divided and are different [for] man and woman thus they supply each other putting their own into the common [eis to koinon] it is for these [reasons] that both utility [chrsimon] and pleasure [hdu] seem to be found in this kind of friendship (nicomachean ethics viii.12.1162a rough literal translation with greek terms shown in square brackets.)
rousseau in his second discourse finally took the shocking step of claiming that this traditional account has things in reverse with reason language and rationally organized communities all having developed over a long period of time merely as a result of the fact that some habits of cooperation were found to solve certain types of problems and that once such cooperation became more important it forced people to develop increasingly complex cooperationoften only to defend themselves from each other
in other words according to rousseau reason language and rational community did not arise because of any conscious decision or plan by humans or gods nor because of any pre-existing human nature as a result he claimed living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape if anything is specifically human in this theory it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans this view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from charles darwin's theory of evolution
the two competing theories concerning the origins of reason are relevant to political and ethical thought because according to the aristotelian theory a best way of living together exists independently of historical circumstances according to rousseau we should even doubt that reason language and politics are a good thing as opposed to being simply the best option given the particular course of events that lead to today rousseau's theory that human nature is malleable rather than fixed is often taken to imply for example by karl marx a wider range of possible ways of living together than traditionally known
however while rousseau's initial impact encouraged bloody revolutions against traditional politics including both the french revolution and the russian revolution his own conclusions about the best forms of community seem to have been remarkably classical in favor of city-states such as geneva and rural living
=== psychologyedit ===
scientific research into reasoning is carried out within the fields of psychology and cognitive science psychologists attempt to determine whether or not people are capable of rational thought in a number of different circumstances
assessing how well someone engages in reasoning is the project of determining the extent to which the person is rational or acts rationally it is a key research question in the psychology of reasoning rationality is often divided into its respective theoretical and practical counterparts
==== behavioral experiments on human reasoningedit ====
experimental cognitive psychologists carry out research on reasoning behaviour such research may focus for example on how people perform on tests of reasoning such as intelligence or iq tests or on how well people's reasoning matches ideals set by logic (see for example the wason test) experiments examine how people make inferences from conditionals e.g. if a then b and how they make inferences about alternatives e.g. a or else b they test whether people can make valid deductions about spatial and temporal relations e.g. a is to the left of b or a happens after b and about quantified assertions e.g. all the a are b experiments investigate how people make inferences about factual situations hypothetical possibilities probabilities and counterfactual situations
==== developmental studies of children's reasoningedit ====
developmental psychologists investigate the development of reasoning from birth to adulthood piaget's theory of cognitive development was the first complete theory of reasoning development subsequently several alternative theories were proposed including the neo-piagetian theories of cognitive development
==== neuroscience of reasoningedit ====
the biological functioning of the brain is studied by neurophysiologists and neuropsychologists research in this area includes research into the structure and function of normally functioning brains and of damaged or otherwise unusual brains in addition to carrying out research into reasoning some psychologists for example clinical psychologists and psychotherapists work to alter people's reasoning habits when they are unhelpful
=== computer scienceedit ===
==== automated reasoningedit ====
in artificial intelligence and computer science scientists study and use automated reasoning for diverse applications including automated theorem proving the formal semantics of programming languages and formal specification in software engineering
==== meta-reasoningedit ====
meta-reasoning is reasoning about reasoning in computer science a system performs meta-reasoning when it is reasoning about its own operation this requires a programming language capable of reflection the ability to observe and modify its own structure and behaviour
=== evolution of reasonedit ===
a species could benefit greatly from better abilities to reason about predict and understand the world french social and cognitive scientist dan sperber with his colleague hugo describes the idea that there could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason sperber points out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective - as demonstrated by the success of projects like science sperber says this could suggest that there are not just individual but group selection pressures at play any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members increasing their fitness this could also help explain why humans according to sperber are not optimized to reason effectively alone patricia cohen writing for the new york times summarizes some of mercier's thoughts on this argumentative theory (which states that reason is adapted to persuasion) to cohen the idea is that humans debate like lawyers they often commit to one side of an argument and converse until the truth is discovered
