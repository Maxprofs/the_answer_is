a try is a way of scoring points in rugby union and rugby league football a try is scored by grounding the ball in the opposition's in-goal area (on or behind the goal line) rugby union and league differ slightly in defining grounding the ball and the in-goal area
the term try comes from try at goal signifying that originally grounding the ball only gave the opportunity to try to score with a kick at goal
a try is analogous to a touchdown in american and canadian football with the major difference being that a try requires the ball be simultaneously touching the ground in the in-goal area and an attacking player who is in the field of play or in-goal (the official name of the extra point in american football according to nfl rules is the try) in the laws of both codes of rugby the term touch down formally refers only to grounding the ball by the defensive team in their in-goal although occasionally people refer to a try as a touchdown the correct usage for the action is grounding the ball
== scoring a try ==
=== aspects common to both union and league ===
there are differences in the fine detail of the laws and their interpretation between the two rugby codes these are the common aspects while the differences are treated below
the player holding the ball to score a try and the ball itself must not be in touch or touch-in-goal (including on or over the dead ball line) the touchline touch-in-goal lines and dead ball lines count as being out there has to be contact with the ground by a player or the ball for it to be ruled in touch or touch-in-goal parts of the body in the air above the lines and outside the field of play or in-goal are not touch and it is common to see players who are partly in the air over the lines still grounding the ball successfully
the in-goal area in which the ball must be grounded includes the goal line but not the touch-in-goal and dead ball lines
grounding the ball in both codes means either holding it and touching it to the ground in-goal or placing hand arm or front of body between waist and neck (the front torso) on top of the ball which is on the ground in-goal
a player does not need to be holding the ball to ground it if the ball is on the ground or just above it it can be touched to the ground with a hand arm or front torso match officials interpret dropping the ball in-goal as a knock-on and disallow a try for a try to be awarded they consider whether the player had the intention to ground the ball and was in control of the ball when he did grounding of the ball can be instantaneous it does not matter if the player immediately lets go and the ball then bounces forward
an attacking player who falls to the ground before reaching the goal line scores a try if momentum carries the player so that the ball touches the in-goal including the goal line
=== variations specific to rugby union ===
a player may ground the ball in one of two ways (1) if the ball is held in the hand(s) or arm(s) merely touching the ball to the ground in-goal suffices and no downward pressure is required (2) if the ball is on the ground in-goal downward pressure from the hand(s) arm(s) or upper body (waist to neck) is required for a try to be awarded an attacking player must ground the ball before a defender does so if there is doubt about which team first grounded the ball the attacking team are awarded a 5-metre scrum
a player who is in touch or touch-in-goal but who is not carrying the ball may score a try by grounding the ball in-goal
the goal-posts and padding at ground level are part of the goal line and therefore of the in-goal so a try may be scored by grounding the ball at the foot of the posts
a player may ground the ball in a scrum as soon as the ball reaches or crosses the goal line (the laws governing the scrum do not apply to the in-goal area so as soon as the ball crosses the line players may unbind and ground the ball.)
if an attacking player is tackled short of the goal-line but immediately reaches out and places the ball on or over the goal-line a try is scored (this is a direct contrast to rugby league which would award a penalty for double movement see below there is occasionally confusion amongst spectators and players at community levels of the game and an incorrect protest of double movement is a common one at english rugby union matches.)
if a television match official (tmo or video referee) has been appointed the referee may ask for advice before deciding whether to award a try but under current protocols the tmo may only advise on whether the ball was properly grounded on whether the ball or ball-carrier went into touch or touch-in-goal in the act of scoring and on any foul play that may have occurred
=== variations specific to rugby league ===
the laws of rugby league still refer to the need for downward pressure to be exerted in grounding the ball with hand or arm
the laws of rugby league specify that a try is scored if an attacker grounds the ball simultaneously with a defender
an attacking player whose momentum does not allow the ball to reach the try-line or in-goal after their ball-carrying arm touches the ground may not reach out to score if a defender is in contact with them this is disallowed by interpretation as a double movement
players who are in touch-in-goal and not carrying the ball may not score a try by pressing a loose ball still in play to the ground
a try may not be scored in a scrum which crosses the goal line but when the ball comes out of scrum a player may pick it up and bore through their own scrum to score a try
video referees in rugby league are given a wider scope to look at the validity of a try if the onfield referee is unsure or needs clarification they may refer to the video referee to award a possible try this referral must also be sent with the onfield referees opinion on whether the play is a try (signaled by forming a t with their forearms) or no try (signaled by folding their arms across the shoulders) the video referee must then find evidence to support the opinion or conclusive evidence against the opinion in the event the video referee cannot prove or deny the opinion the original opinion is upheld
== point value ==
in rugby union a try is worth five points in rugby league four although a try is worth less in rugby league it is more often the main method of scoring due to the smaller value of a goal kick and surety of possession in rugby union however there is heavier reliance placed on goals to accumulate points at elite levels due to the significant value of goals and the defending team's skills
in rugby union the value of a try has varied over time from none to five points in rugby league the original value was three this was increased to four in 1983
the welsh rugby union is planning to trial a change in the scoring value in the 201516 welsh premier division (the level below pro12) under the trial plan which must still be approved by world rugby a try would be worth six points instead of five with penalty tries worth eight points with no conversion attempt taken in addition penalties and drop goals would be reduced from three points to two
== penalty try ==
in both rugby league and in rugby union if the referee believes that a try has been prevented by the defending team's misconduct he may award the attacking team a penalty try penalty tries are always awarded under the posts regardless of where the offence took place in rugby union the standard applied by the referee is that a try probably would have been scored the referee does not have to be certain a try would have been scored in rugby league the referee may award a penalty try if in his opinion a try would have been scored but for the unfair play of the defending team.
in rugby league an 8-point try is awarded if the defending team commits an act of foul play as the ball is being grounded the try is awarded and is followed by a conversion attempt in-line from where the try was scored and then a penalty kick from in front of the posts in rugby union foul play after a try being scored results in a penalty being awarded on the half way mark in lieu of a kick off
== conversion ==
in both codes when a try is scored the scoring team gets to attempt a conversion which is a kick at goal to convert the try from one set of points into another larger set of points the kick is taken at any point on the field of play in line with the point that the ball was grounded for the try and parallel to the touch-lines if successful additional points are scored for the conversion to be successful the ball must pass over the crossbar and between the uprights in both codes the conversion may be attempted as either a place kick (from the ground) or a drop kick most players will nevertheless opt for a place kick this being generally regarded as the easier skill note however that in both rugby sevens (usually but not always played under union rules) and rugby league nines conversions may only take place as drop kicks in rugby league the game clock continues during preparation and execution of a conversion with the institution of a 25-second shot clock at certain tournaments from the moment the try is awarded by the referee within which time the conversion kick must be taken hence a team may decline a conversion attempt if recommencing play as quickly as possible is advantageous to them
to make the conversion easier attacking players will try to ground the ball as close to the centre of the in goal area as possible the attacking player will however ground the ball when confronted by a defender rather than risk losing the ball by being tackled or passing it to a team mate
in both rugby union and rugby league a conversion is worth two points a successful kick at goal thus converts a five-point try to seven for rugby union and a four-point try to six for rugby league
== past to present ==
in early forms of rugby football the point of the game was to score goals a try [at goal] was awarded for a grounding the ball in the opponents in-goal area the try had zero value itself but allowed the attacking team to try a kick at goal without interference from the other team this kick if successful converts a try into a goal
modern rugby and all derived forms now favour the try over a goal and thus the try has a definite value that has increased over time and has for many years surpassed the number of points awarded for a goal in rugby league and rugby union a conversion attempt is still given but is simply seen as adding extra bonus points these points however can mean the difference between winning or losing a match so thought is given to fielding players with good goal-kicking skill
