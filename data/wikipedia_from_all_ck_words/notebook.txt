a notebook (notepad writing pad drawing pad legal pad) is a small book or binder of paper pages often ruled used for purposes such as recording notes or memoranda writing drawing or scrapbooking
== paper notebooks ==
paper notebooks can be distinguished by
form factor (size and weight)
binding and cover material (including printing and graphics)
pre-printed material on writing surfaces (lines graphics text)
== legal pad ==
according to legend thomas w holley of holyoke massachusetts invented the legal pad around the year 1888 when he innovated the idea to collect all the sortings various sort of substandard paper scraps from various factories and stitch them together in order to sell them as pads at an affordable and fair price in about 1900 the latter then evolved into the modern legal pad when a local judge requested for a margin to be drawn on the left side of the paper this was the first legal pad
the only technical requirement for this type of stationery to be considered a true legal pad is that it must have margins of 1.25 inches (3.17 centimeters) from the left edge of legal pad here the margin also known as down lines is room used to write notes or comments legal pads usually have a gum binding at the top as opposed to a spiral or stitched binding
== binding and cover ==
principal types of binding are padding perfect spiral comb sewn clasp disc and pressure some of which can be combined binding methods can affect whether a notebook can lie flat when open and whether the pages are likely to remain attached the cover material is usually distinct from the writing surface material more durable more decorative and more firmly attached it also is stiffer than the pages even taken together cover materials should not contribute to damage or discomfort
it is frequently cheaper to purchase notebooks that are spiral-bound meaning that a spiral of wire is looped through large perforations at the top or side of the page other bound notebooks are available that use glue to hold the pages together this process is padding today it is common for pages in such notebooks to include a thin line of perforations that make it easier to tear out the page spiral-bound pages can be torn out but frequently leave thin scraggly strips from the small amount of paper that is within the spiral as well as an uneven rip along the top of the torn-out page hard-bound notebooks include a sewn spine and the pages are not easily removed some styles of sewn bindings allow pages to open flat while others cause the pages to drape
variations of notebooks that allow pages to be added removed and replaced are bound by rings rods or discs in each of these systems the pages are modified with perforations that facilitate the specific binding mechanism's ability to secure them ring-bound and rod-bound notebooks secure their contents by threading perforated pages around straight or curved prongs in the open position the pages can be removed and rearranged in the closed position the pages are kept in order disc-bound notebooks remove the open or closed operation by modifying the pages themselves a page perforated for a disc-bound binding system contains a row of teeth along the side edge of the page that grip onto the outside raised perimeter of individual discs
== preprinting ==
notebooks used for drawing and scrapbooking are usually blank notebooks for writing usually have some kind of printing on the writing material if only lines to align writing or facilitate certain kinds of drawing inventor's notebooks have page numbers preprinted to support priority claims they may be considered as grey literature many notebooks have graphic decorations personal organizers can have various kinds of preprinted pages
== uses ==
artists often use large notebooks which include wide spaces of blank paper appropriate for drawing lawyers use rather large notebooks known as legal pads that contain lined paper (often yellow) and are appropriate for use on tables and desks these horizontal lines or rules are sometimes classified according to their space apart with wide rule the farthest college rule closer legal rule slightly closer and narrow rule closest allowing more lines of text per page when sewn into a pasteboard backing these may be called composition books or in smaller signatures may be called blue books or exam books and used for essay exams
in contrast journalists prefer small hand-held notebooks for portability (reporters notebooks) and sometimes use shorthand when taking notes scientists and other researchers use lab notebooks to document their experiments the pages in lab notebooks are sometimes graph paper to plot data police officers are required to write notes on what they observe using a police notebook land surveyors commonly record field notes in durable hard-bound notebooks called field books.
students take notes in notebooks and studies suggest the act of writing (as opposed to typing) improves learning
notebook pages can be recycled via standard paper recycling recycled notebooks are available differing in recycled percentage and paper quality
== possible electronic successors ==
since the late 20th century many attempts have been made to integrate the simplicity of a notebook with the editing searching and communication capacities of computers through the development of note taking software laptop computers began to be called notebooks when they reached a small size in the 1990s but they did not have any special note-taking ability personal digital assistants (pdas) came next integrating small liquid crystal displays with a touch-sensitive layer to input graphics and written text tablet pcs are larger and provide more writing and navigation space
digital paper combines the simplicity of a traditional pen and notebook with digital storage and interactivity by printing an invisible dot pattern on the notebook paper and using a pen with a built in infrared camera the written text can be transferred to a laptop mobile phone or backoffice for storage and processing
