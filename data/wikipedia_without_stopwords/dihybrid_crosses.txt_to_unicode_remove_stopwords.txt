dihybrid cross cross two pure lines varieties strains differ two observed traits mendelian sense alleles loci relationship complete dominance recessive example rryyrryy parents result f offspring heterozygous r y rryy
rules meiosis apply dihybrid codified mendels first law mendels second law also called law segregation law independent assortment respectively
genes separate chromosomes allele pair shows independent segregation first filial generation f generation produces four identical offspring second filial generation occurs crossing members first filial generation shows phenotypic appearance ratio
represents proportion individuals displaying dominant traits
