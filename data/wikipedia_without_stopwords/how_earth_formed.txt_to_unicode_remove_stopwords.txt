cosmic evolution quantitative subject whereas big history typically cosmic evolution practiced mostly natural scientists big history social scholars two subjects closely allied overlapping benefit cosmic evolutionists tend treat universal history linearly thus humankind enters story recent times whereas big historians tend stress humanity many cultural achievements granting human beings larger part story one compare contrast different emphases watching two short movies portraying bigbangtohumankind narrative one arrow time animating time linearly cosmic origins capturing time actually lookback time logarithmically former humans enter minute movie last second latter appear much earlieryet correct
different treatments time billion years different emphases historical content clarified noting cosmic evolutionists divide whole narrative three phases seven epochs

one striking finding complexity studies apparently ranked order among known material systems universe although absolute energy astronomical systems greatly exceeds humans although mass densities stars planets bodies brains comparable energy rate density humans modern human society approximately million times greater stars galaxies example sun emits vast luminosity x ergs equivalent nearly billion billion billion watt light bulb also huge mass x g thus second amount energy equaling ergs passes gram star contrast star energy flows gram plants leaf photosynthesis much nearly million times rushes gram human brain thinking wg
cosmic evolution subjective qualitative assertion one damn thing another inclusive scientific worldview constitutes objective quantitative approach toward deciphering much comprises organized material nature uniform consistent philosophy approach toward complex systems demonstrates basic differences within among many varied systems degree kind particular suggests optimal ranges energy rate density grant opportunities evolution complexity systems able adjust adapt otherwise take advantage energy flows survive prosper systems adversely affected much little energy nonrandomly eliminated
