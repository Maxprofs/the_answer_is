== critical reception ==
identified has received generally favorable reviews having a 63 metascore based on 7 reviews billboard said that the album panders to the preteen demo with stop-start pop that ranges from pleasant (the title track) to dull ("amazed") to off-putting ("hook it up") but for little girls this is one nonstop sing-along. the new york times said that a handful of songs like this would have sufficed to help mature her image and yet identified is far more interesting and unexpected.
blender gave it a three stars out of five and claimed that her voice was made to rip and when she lets go just a little the coyness turns sultryproof that she might just have a life after high school. variety said that identified shows that the high school musical veteran is definitely ready to graduate the better parts of the album find her reaching for a more mature sound but she hedges her bets with large portions of treacly teen-pop...the weakest link in most of the songs is hudgens thin piping voice.
