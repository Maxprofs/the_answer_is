k (named kay /ke/) is the eleventh letter of the modern english alphabet and the iso basic latin alphabet in english the letter k usually represents the voiceless velar plosive
== history ==
the letter k comes from the greek letter (kappa) which was taken from the semitic kap the symbol for an open hand this in turn was likely adapted by semites who had lived in egypt from the hieroglyph for hand representing d in the egyptian word for hand d-r-t the semites evidently assigned it the sound value /k/ instead because their word for hand started with that sound
in the earliest latin inscriptions the letters c k and q were all used to represent the sounds /k/ and /g/ (which were not differentiated in writing) of these q was used to represent /k/ or /g/ before a rounded vowel k before /a/ and c elsewhere later the use of c and its variant g replaced most usages of k and q k survived only in a few fossilized forms such as kalendae the calends
when greek words were taken into latin the kappa was transliterated as a c loanwords from other alphabets with the sound /k/ were also transliterated with c hence the romance languages generally use c and have k only in later loanwords from other language groups the celtic languages also tended to use c instead of k and this influence carried over into old english
