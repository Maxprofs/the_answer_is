a truck (united states canada australia new zealand south africa puerto rico also called a lorry in the united kingdom ireland and indian subcontinent) is a motor vehicle designed to transport cargo trucks vary greatly in size power and configuration with the smallest being mechanically similar to an automobile commercial trucks can be very large and powerful and may be configured to mount specialized equipment such as in the case of fire trucks and concrete mixers and suction excavators
modern trucks are largely powered by diesel engines although small to medium size trucks with gasoline engines exist in the us in the european union vehicles with a gross combination mass of up to 3,500 kilograms (7,716 lb) are known as light commercial vehicles and those over as large goods vehicles
== historyedit ==
=== steam trucksedit ===
trucks and cars have a common ancestor the steam-powered fardier nicolas-joseph cugnot built in 1769 however steam trucks were not common until the mid-1800s the roads of the time built for horse and carriages limited these vehicles to very short hauls usually from a factory to the nearest railway station the first semi-trailer appeared in 1881 towed by a steam tractor manufactured by de dion-bouton steam-powered trucks were sold in france and the united states until the eve of world war i and the beginning of world war ii in the united kingdom where they were known as steam wagons
=== internal combustionedit ===
in 1895 karl benz designed and built the first truck in history using the internal combustion engine later that year some of benz's trucks were modified to become the first bus by the netphener the first motorbus company in history a year later in 1896 another internal combustion engine truck was built by gottlieb daimler other companies such as peugeot renault and bssing also built their own versions the first truck in the united states was built by autocar in 1899 and was available with optional 5 or 8 horsepower motors
trucks of the era mostly used two-cylinder engines and had a carrying capacity of 1,500 to 2,000 kilograms (3,300 to 4,400 lb) in 1904 700 heavy trucks were built in the united states 1000 in 1907 6000 in 1910 and 25000 in 1914
after world war i several advances were made pneumatic tires replaced the previously common full rubber versions electric starters power brakes 4 6 and 8 cylinder engines closed cabs and electric lighting followed the first modern semi-trailer trucks also appeared touring car builders such as ford and renault entered the heavy truck market
=== diesel enginesedit ===
although it had been invented in 1890 the diesel engine was not common in trucks in europe until the 1930s in the united states it took much longer for diesel engines to be accepted gasoline engines were still in use on heavy trucks in the 1970s while in europe they had been completely replaced 20 years earlier
== legal issuesedit ==
commercial trucks in the us pay higher road use taxes on a state level than other road vehicles and are subject to extensive regulation a few reasons commercial trucks pay higher road use taxes they are bigger and heavier than most other vehicles and cause more wear and tear per hour on roadways and trucks and their drivers are on the road for more hours per day rules on use taxes differ among jurisdictions
the federal government has rules for commercial vehicles regulating how many hours a driver may be on the clock how much rest and sleep time is required (e.g. 11 hours driving/14 hours on-duty followed by 10 hours off with a maximum of 70 hours/8 days or 60 hours/7 days 34 hours restart ) and many other rules violations are often subject to significant penalties instruments to track each driver's hours must sometimes be fitted
trucks are subject to noise emission requirements (emanating from the u.s noise control act) in order to protect the public from noise health effects since trucks contribute disproportionately to roadway noise due to elevated stacks and intense tire and aerodynamic noise characteristics
the federal bridge law deals with the relation between the gross weight of the truck the number of axles and the spacing between the axles that the truck can have on the interstate highway system each state determines the maximum permissible vehicle combination and axle weight on state and local roads
== types of trucks by sizeedit ==
=== ultra light trucksedit ===
often produced as variations of golf cars with internal combustion or battery electric drive these are used typically for off-highway use on estates golf courses and parks while not suitable for highway use some variations may be licensed as slow speed vehicles for operation on streets generally as a body variation of a neighborhood electric vehicle a few manufactures produce specialized chassies for this type of vehicle while zap motors markets a version of their xebra electric tricycle (licensable in the u.s as a motorcycle)
=== very light trucksedit ===
popular in europe and asia many mini trucks are factory redesigns of light automobiles usually with monocoque bodies specialized designs with substantial frames such as the italian piaggio shown here are based upon japanese designs (in this case by daihatsu) and are popular for use in old town sections of european cities that often have very narrow alleyways
regardless of name these small trucks serve a wide range of uses in japan they are regulated under the kei car laws which allow vehicle owners a break in taxes for buying a smaller and less-powerful vehicle (currently the engine is limited to 660 cc {0.66l} displacement) these vehicles are used as on-road utility vehicles in japan these japanese-made mini trucks that were manufactured for on-road use are competing with off-road atvs in the united states and import regulations require that these mini trucks have a 25 mph (40 km/h) speed governor as they are classified as low speed vehicles these vehicles have found uses in construction large campuses (government university and industrial) agriculture cattle ranches amusement parks and replacements for golf carts
major mini truck manufacturers and their brands

=== light trucksedit ===
light trucks are car-sized (in the us no more than 6,300 kilograms (13,900 lb)) and are used by individuals and businesses alike in the uk they may not weigh more than 3,500 kilograms (7,700 lb) and are allowed to be driven with a driving licence for cars pickup trucks called utes in australia and new zealand are common in north america and some regions of latin america asia and africa but not so in europe where this size of commercial vehicle is most often made as vans
=== medium trucksedit ===
medium trucks are larger than light but smaller than heavy trucks in the us they are defined as weighing between 13,000 and 33,000 pounds (6,000 and 15,000 kg) for the uk and the eu the weight is between 3.5 and 7.5 tonnes (3.9 and 8.3 tons) local delivery and public service (dump trucks garbage trucks and fire-fighting trucks) are normally around this size
=== heavy trucksedit ===
heavy trucks are the largest on-road trucks class 8 these include vocational applications such as heavy dump trucks concrete pump trucks and refuse hauling as well as ubiquitous long-haul 64 tractor units
road damage and wear increase very rapidly with the axle weight the axle weight is the truck weight divided by the number of axles but the actual axle weight depends on the position of the load over the axles the number of steering axles and the suspension type also influence the amount of the road wear in many countries with good roads a six-axle truck may have a maximum weight over 50 tonnes (49 long tons 55 short tons)
=== off-road trucksedit ===
off-road trucks include standard extra heavy-duty highway-legal trucks typically outfitted with off-road features such as a front driving axle and special tires for applications such as logging and construction and purpose-built off-road vehicles unconstrained by weight limits such as the liebherr t 282b mining truck
== terminologyedit ==
=== etymologyedit ===
the word truck might come from a back-formation of truckle with the meaning small wheel pulley from middle english trokell in turn from latin trochlea another explanation is that it comes from latin trochus with the meaning of iron hoop in turn both go back to greek trokhos () meaning wheel from trekhein ( to run") the first known usage of truck was in 1611 when it referred to the small strong wheels on ships cannon carriages in its extended usage it came to refer to carts for carrying heavy loads a meaning known since 1771 with the meaning of motor-powered load carrier it has been in usage since 1930 shortened from motor truck which dates back to 1916
lorry has a more uncertain origin but probably has its roots in the rail transport industry where the word is known to have been used in 1838 to refer to a type of truck (a freight car as in british usage not a bogie as in the american) specifically a large flat wagon it probably derives from the verb lurry (to pull tug) of uncertain origin with the meaning of self-propelled vehicle for carrying goods it has been in usage since 1911
before that the word lorry was used for a sort of big horse-drawn goods wagon
=== international varianceedit ===
in the united states canada and the philippines truck is usually reserved for commercial vehicles larger than normal cars and includes pickups and other vehicles having an open load bed in australia new zealand and south africa the word truck is mostly reserved for larger vehicles in australia and new zealand a pickup truck is usually called a ute (short for utility") while in south africa it is called a bakkie (afrikaans small open container") in the united kingdom india malaysia singapore ireland and hong kong lorry is used instead of truck but only for the medium and heavy types
in american english the word truck is often preceded by a word describing the type of vehicle such as a tanker truck in british english these would be referred to as a tanker or petrol tanker
in australia and new zealand the term ute (short for coup utility) is used to describe a pickup truck with an open cargo carrying space but a front similar to a passenger car and which requires only a passenger car licence to drive the concept was developed in 1933 by lewis bandt of the ford motor company in geelong following a request from a gippsland farmer's wife for a vehicle that they could go to church in on sunday without getting wet and also use to take the pigs to market on monday
== drivingedit ==
in many countries driving a truck requires a special driving license the requirements and limitations vary with each different jurisdiction
=== australiaedit ===
in australia a truck driver's license is required for any motor vehicle with a gross vehicle mass (gvm) exceeding 4,500 kilograms (9,921 lb) the motor vehicles classes are further expanded as
lr light rigid a rigid vehicle with a gvm of more than 4,500 kilograms (9,921 lb) but not more than 8,000 kilograms (17,637 lb) any towed trailer must not weigh more than 9,000 kilograms (19,842 lb) gvm
mr medium rigid a rigid vehicle with 2 axles and a gvm of more than 8,000 kilograms (17,637 lb) any towed trailer must not weigh more than 9,000 kilograms (19,842 lb) gvm also includes vehicles in class lr
hr heavy rigid a rigid vehicle with three or more axles and a gvm of more than 8,000 kilograms (17,637 lb)) any towed trailer must not weigh more than 9,000 kilograms (19,842 lb)) gvm also includes articulated buses and vehicles in class mr
hc heavy combination a typical prime mover plus semi-trailer combination
mc multi combination e.g. b doubles/road trains
there is also a heavy vehicle transmission condition for a license class hr hc or mc test passed in a vehicle fitted with an automatic or synchromesh transmission a driver's license will be restricted to vehicles of that class fitted with a synchromesh or automatic transmission to have the condition removed a person needs to pass a practical driving test in a vehicle with non-synchromesh transmission (constant mesh or crash box)
=== european unionedit ===
driving licensing has been harmonised throughout the european union so that common albeit complex rules apply on all member states (see european driving licence) as an overview to drive a vehicle weighing more than 7.5 tonnes (16,535 lb) for commercial purposes requires a specialist licence (the type varies depending on the use of the vehicle and number of seats) for licences first acquired after 1997 that weight was reduced to 3,500 kilograms (7,716 lb) not including trailers
=== united statesedit ===
in the united states a commercial driver's license is required to drive any type of commercial vehicle weighing 26,001 lb (11,794 kg) or more in 2006 the us trucking industry employed 1.8 million drivers of heavy trucks
=== indiaedit ===
there are around 5 million truck drivers in india
=== south africaedit ===
to drive any vehicle with a gvm exceeding 3,500 kilograms (7,700 lb) a code c1 drivers license is required furthermore if the vehicle exceeds 16,000 kilograms (35,000 lb) a code c license becomes necessary
to drive any vehicle in south africa towing a trailer with a gvm more than 750 kilograms (1,650 lb) further restrictions apply and the driver must possess a license suitable for the gvm of the total combination as well as an articulated endorsement this is indicated with the letter e prefixing the license code
in addition any vehicle designed to carry goods or passengers may only be driven by a driver possessing a public driver's permit (or prdp) of the applicable type this is an additional license that is added to the dl card of the operator and subject to annual renewal unlike the five-year renewal period of a normal license
the requirements for obtaining the different classes are below
g required for the transport of general goods requires a criminal record check and a fee on issuing and renewal
p required for the transport of paying passengers requires a more stringent criminal record check on additionally the driver must be over the age of 21 at time of issue a g class prdp will be issued at the same time
d required for the transport of dangerous materials requires all of the same checks as class p in addition the driver must be over 25 at time of issue
== anatomyedit ==
almost all trucks share a common construction they are made of a chassis a cab an area for placing cargo or equipment axles suspension and roadwheels an engine and a drivetrain pneumatic hydraulic water and electrical systems may also be present many also tow one or more trailers or semi-trailers
=== cabedit ===
the cab is an enclosed space where the driver is seated a sleeper is a compartment attached to the cab where the driver can rest while not driving sometimes seen in semi-trailer trucks
there are several possible cab configurations
cab over engine (coe) or flat nose where the driver is seated above the front axle and the engine this design is almost ubiquitous in europe where overall truck lengths are strictly regulated but also widely used in the rest of the world as well they were common in north american heavy duty trucks but lost prominence when permitted length was extended in the early 1980s nevertheless this design is still popular in north america among medium and light duty trucks to reach the engine the whole cab tilts forward earning this design the name of tilt-cab this type of cab is especially suited to the delivery conditions in europe where many roads follow the layout of much more ancient paths and trackways which require the additional turning capability given by the short wheelbase of the cab over engine type the coe design was invented by viktor schreckengost
conventional cabs are the most common in north america and australia and are known in the uk as american cabs and in the netherlands as torpedo cabs the driver is seated behind the engine as in most passenger cars or pickup trucks conventionals are further divided into large car and aerodynamic designs a large car or long nose is a conventional truck with a long (6-to-8-foot or 1.8-to-2.4-metre or more) hood aerodynamic cabs are very streamlined with a sloped hood and other features to lower drag
cab beside engine designs also exist but are rather rare and are mainly used inside shipping yards or other specialist uses that require the vehicle to carry long loads such as pipes metal rods flat iron and other construction materials this type is often custom made from a regular cabover truck that gets the upper half of its cab removed on the passenger side and replaced by an extended section of the bed
a further step from this is the side loading forklift that can be described as a specially fabricated vehicle with the same properties as a truck of this type in addition to the ability to pick up its own load
=== engineedit ===
most small trucks such as sport utility vehicles (suvs) or pickups and even light medium-duty trucks in north america china and russia use gasoline engines (petrol engines) but many diesel engined models are now being produced most of the heavier trucks use four-stroke diesel engines with a turbocharger and intercooler huge off-highway trucks use locomotive-type engines such as a v12 detroit diesel two stroke engine diesel engines are becoming the engine of choice for trucks ranging from class 3 to 8 gvws a large proportion of refuse trucks in the united states employ cng (compressed natural gas) engines for their low fuel cost and reduced carbon emissions
north american manufactured highway trucks often use an engine built by a third party such as cat cummins or detroit diesel but both mack and navistar offer their own engines
in the european union all new truck engines must comply with euro 5 emission regulations
=== drivetrainedit ===
small trucks use the same type of transmissions as almost all cars having either an automatic transmission or a manual transmission with synchromesh (synchronizers) bigger trucks often use manual transmissions without synchronizers saving bulk and weight although synchromesh transmissions are used in larger trucks as well transmissions without synchronizers known as crash boxes require double-clutching for each shift (which can lead to repetitive motion injuries) or a technique known colloquially as floating a method of changing gears which doesn't use the clutch except for starts and stops due to the physical effort of double clutching especially with non-power-assisted clutches faster shifts and less clutch wear
double-clutching allows the driver to control the engine and transmission revolutions to synchronize so that a smooth shift can be made for example when upshifting the accelerator pedal is released and the clutch pedal is depressed while the gear lever is moved into neutral the clutch pedal is then released and quickly pushed down again while the gear lever is moved to the next higher gear finally the clutch pedal is released and the accelerator pedal pushed down to obtain required engine speed although this is a relatively fast movement perhaps a second or so while transmission is in neutral it allows the engine speed to drop and synchronize engine and transmission revolutions relative to the road speed downshifting is performed in a similar fashion except the engine speed is now required to increase (while transmission is in neutral) just the right amount in order to achieve the synchronization for a smooth non-collision gear change skip changing is also widely used in principle operation is the same as double-clutching but it requires neutral be held slightly longer than a single-gear change
common north american setups include 9 10 13 15 and 18 speeds automatic and semi-automatic transmissions for heavy trucks are becoming more and more common due to advances both in transmission and engine power in europe 8 10 12 and 16 gears are common on larger trucks with manual transmission while automatic or semi-automatic transmissions would have anything from 5 to 12 gears almost all heavy truck transmissions are of the range and split (double h shift pattern) type where range change and socalled half gears or splits are air operated and always preselected before the main gear selection
=== frameedit ===
a truck frame consists of two parallel boxed (tubular) or cshaped rails or beams held together by crossmembers these frames are referred to as ladder frames due to their resemblance to a ladder if tipped on end the rails consist of a tall vertical section (two if boxed) and two shorter horizontal flanges the height of the vertical section provides opposition to vertical flex when weight is applied to the top of the frame (beam resistance) though typically flat the whole length on heavy duty trucks the rails may sometimes be tapered or arched for clearance around the engine or over the axles the holes in rails are used either for mounting vehicle components and running wires and hoses or measuring and adjusting the orientation of the rails at the factory or repair shop
the frame is almost always made of steel but can be made (whole or in part) of aluminum for a lighter weight a tow bar may be found attached at one or both ends but heavy trucks almost always make use of a fifth wheel hitch
== environmental effectsedit ==
trucks contribute to air noise and water pollution similarly to automobiles trucks may emit lower air pollution emissions than cars per equivalent vehicle mass although the absolute level per vehicle distance traveled is higher and diesel particulate matter is especially problematic for health with respect to noise pollution trucks emit considerably higher sound levels at all speeds compared to typical cars this contrast is particularly strong with heavy-duty trucks there are several aspects of truck operations that contribute to the overall sound that is emitted continuous sounds are those from tires rolling on the roadway and the constant hum of their diesel engines at highway speeds less frequent noises but perhaps more noticeable are things like the repeated sharp-pitched whistle of a turbocharger on acceleration or the abrupt blare of an exhaust brake retarder when traversing a downgrade there has been noise regulation put in place to help control where and when the use of engine braking retarders are allowed
concerns have been raised about the effect of trucking on the environment particularly as part of the debate on global warming in the period from 1990 to 2003 carbon dioxide emissions from transportation sources increased by 20% despite improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency
in 2005 transportation accounted for 27% of u.s greenhouse gas emission increasing faster than any other sector
between 1985 and 2004 in the u.s. energy consumption in freight transportation grew nearly 53% while the number of ton-miles carried increased only 43%
according to a 1995 u.s government estimate the energy cost of carrying one ton of freight a distance of one kilometer averages 337 kj for water 221 kj for rail 2,000 kj for trucks and nearly 13,000 kj for air transport many environmental organizations favor laws and incentives to encourage the switch from road to rail especially in europe
the european parliament is moving to ensure that charges on heavy-goods vehicles should be based in part on the air and noise pollution they produce and the congestion they cause according to legislation approved by the transport committee the eurovignette scheme has been proposed whereby new charges would be potentially levied against things such as noise and air pollution and also weight related damages from the lorries themselves

primary liability insurance coverage protects the truck from damage or injuries to other people as a result of a truck accident this truck insurance coverage is mandated by u.s state and federal agencies and proof of coverage is required to be sent to them interstate trucks in the u.s are required to have a minimum of $75,000 in liability insurance this includes motor carriers operating vehicles with a gross weight rating in excess of 10,000 lbs (which transport non-hazardous materials) all motor carriers operating vehicles transporting materials classified as hazardous and which have a gross weight rating in excess of 10,000 lbs must have a minimum of $1,000,000 in liability insurance all motor carriers operating vehicles such as tanks or hopper-type cargo vehicles with a capacity in excess of 3,500 water gallons must have a minimum of $5,000,000 in liability insurance pricing is dependent on region driving records and history of the trucking operation
motor truck cargo insurance protects the transporter for his responsibility in the event of damaged or lost freight the policy is purchased with a maximum load limit per vehicle cargo insurance coverage limits can range from $10,000 to $100,000 or more pricing for this insurance is mainly dependent on the type of cargo being hauled
=== trucking accidentsedit ===
in 2002 and 2004 there were over 5,000 fatalities related to trucking accidents in the united states the trucking industry has since made significant efforts in increasing safety regulations in 2008 the industry had successfully lowered the fatality rate to just over 4,000 deaths but trucking accidents are still an issue that causes thousands of deaths and injuries each year approximately 6,000 trucking accident fatalities occur annually in the united states fatalities are not the only issue caused by trucking accidents here are some of the environmental issues that arise with trucking accidents
14.4% of trucking accidents cause cargo to spill
6.5% cause open flames
the usdot 2009 large trucks in fatal crashes with passenger vehicles with driver-related factors figures show that in 22% of crashes the large truck driver was a factor while 80.5% of passenger vehicle drivers were alcohol or other drugs among heavy truck drivers were a factor in 31% of crashes among passenger vehicle drivers they were a factor in 11.75% of crashes
