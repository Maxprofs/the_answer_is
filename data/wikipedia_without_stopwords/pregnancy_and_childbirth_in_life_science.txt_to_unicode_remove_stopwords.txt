terminology
one scientific term state pregnancy gravidity adjective gravid latin heavy pregnant female sometimes referred gravida similarly term parity abbreviated para used number times female given birth twins multiple births counted one pregnancy birth woman never pregnant referred nulligravida woman pregnant first time referred primigravida woman subsequent pregnancies multigravida multiparous therefore second pregnancy woman would described gravida para upon live delivery gravida para inprogress pregnancies abortions miscarriages stillbirths account parity values less gravida number case twins triplets etc gravida number parity value increased one women never carried pregnancy achieving weeks gestation age referred nulliparous
recent medical literature prefers terminology preterm postterm premature postmature preterm postterm defined whereas premature postmature historical meaning relate infants size state development rather stage pregnancy

ectopic pregnancy implantation embryo outside uterus
hyperemesis gravidarum excessive nausea severe morning sickness
also increased susceptibility severity certain infections pregnancy
intercurrent diseases
pregnant woman may intercurrent diseases defined disease directly caused pregnancy may become worse potential risk pregnancy
diabetes mellitus pregnancy deals interactions diabetes mellitus restricted gestational diabetes pregnancy risks child include miscarriage growth restriction growth acceleration fetal obesity macrosomia polyhydramnios much amniotic fluid birth defects
systemic lupus erythematosus pregnancy pregnancy setting sle confers increased rate fetal death utero spontaneous abortion miscarriage neonatal lupus
thyroid disease pregnancy uncorrected cause adverse effects fetal maternal wellbeing deleterious effects thyroid dysfunction also extend beyond pregnancy delivery affect neurointellectual development early life child demand thyroid hormones increased pregnancy may cause previously unnoticed thyroid disorder worsen
hypercoagulability pregnancy propensity pregnant women develop thrombosis blood clots pregnancy factor hypercoagulability pregnancyinduced hypercoagulability physiologically adaptive mechanism prevent post partum bleeding however combination underlying hypercoagulable states risk thrombosis embolism may become substantial
physiology
initiation
normally initiation pregnancy considered first day womans last menstrual period using date resulting fetal age called gestational age choice result inability discern point time actual creation fetus happened vitro fertilisation gestational age calculated days oocyte retrieval days
interplay hormones includes follicle stimulating hormone stimulates folliculogenesis oogenesis creates mature egg cell female gamete fertilization event egg cell fuses male gamete spermatozoon point fertilization fused product female male gamete referred zygote fertilized egg fusion male female gametes usually occurs following act sexual intercourse fertilization also occur assisted reproductive technology artificial insemination vitro fertilisation
fertilization sometimes used initiation pregnancy derived age termed fertilization age fertilization usually occurs two weeks next expected menstrual period
development embryo fetus
sperm egg cell released one females two ovaries unite one two fallopian tubes fertilized egg known zygote moves toward uterus journey take week complete cell division begins approximately hours male female cells unite cell division continues rapid rate cells develop known blastocyst blastocyst arrives uterus attaches uterine wall process known implantation
development mass cells become infant called embryogenesis first approximately ten weeks gestation time cells begin differentiate various body systems basic outlines organ body nervous systems established end embryonic stage beginnings features fingers eyes mouth ears become visible also time development structures important support embryo including placenta umbilical cord placenta connects developing embryo uterine wall allow nutrient uptake waste elimination gas exchange via mothers blood supply umbilical cord connecting cord embryo fetus placenta
ten weeks gestational age embryo becomes known fetus beginning fetal stage risk miscarriage decreases sharply stage fetus mm inches length heartbeat seen via ultrasound fetus makes involuntary motions continued fetal development early body systems structures established embryonic stage continue develop sex organs begin appear third month gestation fetus continues grow weight length although majority physical growth occurs last weeks pregnancy
electrical brain activity first detected fifth sixth week gestation considered primitive neural activity rather beginning conscious thought synapses begin forming weeks begin multiply quickly week months birth
maternal changes
pregnancy woman undergoes many physiological changes entirely normal including cardiovascular hematologic metabolic renal respiratory changes increases blood sugar breathing cardiac output required levels progesterone oestrogens rise continually throughout pregnancy suppressing hypothalamic axis therefore also menstrual cycle
fetus genetically different woman viewed unusually successful allograft main reason success increased immune tolerance pregnancy immune tolerance concept body able mount immune system response certain triggers
pregnancy typically broken three periods trimesters three months obstetricians define trimester weeks total duration weeks although average duration pregnancy weeks hard fast rules distinctions useful describing changes take place time
first trimester
minute ventilation increases first trimester womb grow size lemon eight weeks many symptoms discomforts pregnancy like nausea tender breasts appear first trimester
second trimester
weeks pregnancy called second trimester women feel energized period begin put weight symptoms morning sickness subside eventually fade away uterus muscular organ holds developing fetus expand times normal size pregnancy
although fetus begins move first trimester second trimester movement often referred quickening felt typically happens fourth month specifically th st week th week woman pregnant common women feel fetus move much later second trimester women begin wear maternity clothes
third trimester
final weight gain takes place weight gain throughout pregnancy womans abdomen transform shape drops due fetus turning downward position ready birth second trimester womans abdomen would upright whereas third trimester drop low fetus moves regularly felt woman fetal movement become strong disruptive woman womans navel sometimes become convex popping due expanding abdomen
head engagement fetal head descends cephalic presentation relieves pressure upper abdomen renewed ease breathing also severely reduces bladder capacity increases pressure pelvic floor rectum
also third trimester maternal activity sleep positions may affect fetal development due restricted blood flow instance enlarged uterus may impede blood flow compressing vena cava lying flat relieved lying left side
determining gestational age
mean pregnancy length estimated days gestational age timed first day last menstrual period days retrospectively estimated obstetric ultrasound measurement fetal biparietal diameter bpd second trimester algorithms take account variables whether first subsequent child mothers race age length menstrual cycle menstrual regularity order standard reference point normal pregnancy duration assumed medical professionals days weeks gestational age
best method determining gestational age ultrasound first trimester pregnancy typically accurate within seven days means fewer percent births occur day weeks gestational age percent births within week duration percent within weeks estimation due date mobile apps essentially always give consistent estimations compared correct leap year pregnancy wheels made paper differ days generally correct leap year estimated due date edd established rarely changed determination gestational age accurate earlier pregnancy
common system used among healthcare professionals naegeles rule developed early th century calculates expected due date first day last normal menstrual period lmp lnmp regardless factors known make inaccurate shorter longer menstrual cycle length pregnancy commonly lasts weeks according lnmpbased method assuming woman predictable menstrual cycle length close days conceives th day cycle
average time birth estimated days weeks two days ovulation standard deviation days coefficient variation
accurate dating pregnancy important used calculating results various prenatal tests example triple test decision may made induce labour fetus perceived overdue furthermore ultrasound dating predicts later due date lmp might indicate slowed fetal growth require closer review
stage pregnancy defined beginning legal fetal viability varies around world sometimes incorporates weight well gestational age ranges weeks norway weeks us australia weeks uk weeks italy spain
timing childbirth
ideal childbirth labor begins woman term pregnancy considered term gestation lasted weeks
events completion weeks considered preterm preterm birth associated range complications avoided possible
sometimes womans water breaks contractions weeks birth unavoidable however spontaneous birth weeks considered term associated risks preterm birth planned birth weeks caesarean section labor induction although term results increased risk complications factors including underdeveloped lungs newborns infection due underdeveloped immune system feeding problems due underdeveloped brain jaundice underdeveloped liver
babies born weeks gestation better outcomes babies born either range special time period called full term whenever possible waiting labor begin time period best health mother baby decision perform induction must made weighing risks benefits safer weeks
events weeks considered postterm pregnancy exceeds weeks risk complications woman fetus increases significantly therefore otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy obstetricians usually prefer induce labour stage weeks
childbirth
childbirth referred labor delivery medical field process whereby infant born
woman considered labour begins experiencing regular uterine contractions accompanied changes cervix primarily effacement dilation childbirth widely experienced painful women report painless labours others find concentrating birth helps quicken labour lessen sensations births successful vaginal births sometimes complications arise woman may undergo cesarean section
time immediately birth mother baby hormonally cued bond mother release oxytocin hormone also released breastfeeding studies show skintoskin contact mother newborn immediately birth beneficial mother baby review done world health organization found skintoskin contact mothers babies birth reduces crying improves motherinfant interaction helps mothers breastfeed successfully recommend neonates allowed bond mother first two hours birth period tend alert following hours early life
postnatal period
postnatal period also referred puerperium begins immediately delivery extends six weeks period mothers body begins return prepregnancy conditions includes changes hormone levels uterus size
diagnosis
beginning pregnancy may detected either based symptoms pregnant woman using medical tests women weeks women delivery refuse acknowledge pregnant denial pregnancy nonpregnant women strong belief pregnant along physical changes condition known pseudocyesis false pregnancy
physical signs
pregnant women experience number symptoms signify pregnancy number early medical signs associated pregnancy signs include
presence human chorionic gonadotropin hcg blood urine
missed menstrual period
implantation bleeding occurs implantation embryo uterus third fourth week last menstrual period
increased basal body temperature sustained weeks ovulation
chadwicks sign darkening cervix vagina vulva
goodells sign softening vaginal portion cervix
hegars sign softening uterus isthmus
pigmentation linea alba linea nigra darkening skin midline abdomen caused hyperpigmentation resulting hormonal changes usually appearing around middle pregnancy
darkening nipples areolas due increase hormones
biomarkers
pregnancy detection accomplished using one various pregnancy tests detect hormones generated newly formed placenta serving biomarkers pregnancy blood urine tests detect pregnancy days implantation blood pregnancy tests sensitive urine tests giving fewer false negatives home pregnancy tests urine tests normally detect pregnancy days fertilization quantitative blood test determine approximately date embryo conceived hcg doubles every hours single test progesterone levels also help determine likely fetus survive threatened miscarriage bleeding early pregnancy
ultrasound
obstetric ultrasonography detect congenital diseases early stage estimate due date detect multiple pregnancies resultant estimated gestational age due date fetus slightly accurate methods based last menstrual period ultrasound used measure nuchal fold order screen downs syndrome
