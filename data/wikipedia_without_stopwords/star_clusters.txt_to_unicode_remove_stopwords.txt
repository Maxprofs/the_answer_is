star clusters star clouds groups stars two types star clusters distinguished globular clusters tight groups hundreds thousands old stars gravitationally bound open clusters loosely clustered groups stars generally contain fewer hundred members often young open clusters become disrupted time gravitational influence giant molecular clouds move galaxy cluster members continue move broadly direction space even though longer gravitationally bound known stellar association sometimes also referred moving group

globular cluster
globular clusters gc roughly spherical groupings several million stars packed regions light years across commonly consist old population ii starsjust hundred million years younger universe itselfwhich mostly yellow red mass less two solar masses stars predominate within clusters hotter massive stars exploded supernovae evolved planetary nebula phases end white dwarfs yet rare blue stars exist globulars thought formed stellar mergers dense inner regions stars known blue stragglers
galaxy globular clusters distributed roughly spherically galactic halo around galactic centre orbiting centre highly elliptical orbits astronomer harlow shapley able estimate suns distance galactic centre based distribution globular clusters previously suns location within milky way means well established
recently globular clusters cause great mystery astronomy theories stellar evolution gave ages oldest members globular clusters greater estimated age universe however greatly improved distance measurements globular clusters using hipparcos satellite increasingly accurate measurements hubble constant resolved paradox giving age universe billion years age oldest stars hundred million years less

intermediate forms
astronomers discovered completely new type star cluster andromeda galaxy several ways similar globular clusters although less dense currently intermediate clusters also known extended globular clusters discovered milky way three discovered andromeda galaxy mwfs c mwfs c mwfs c
newfound star clusters contain hundreds thousands stars similar number stars found globular clusters clusters also share characteristics globular clusters eg stellar populations metallicity distinguishes globular clusters much larger several hundred lightyears across hundreds times less dense distances stars therefore much greater within newly discovered extended clusters parametrically clusters lie somewhere low dark matter globular cluster dark matterdominated dwarf spheroidal galaxy
clusters formed yet known formation might well related globular clusters m clusters milky way yet known also unknown galaxy contains kind clusters would unlikely m sole galaxy extended clusters
another type cluster faint fuzzies far found lenticular galaxies like ngc ngc characterized large size compared globular clusters ringlike distribution around centers host galaxies latter seem old objects
open clusters
open clusters oc different globular clusters unlike spherically distributed globulars confined galactic plane almost always found within spiral arms generally young objects tens millions years old rare exceptions old billion years messier closest observed old open cluster example form h ii regions orion nebula
open clusters usually contain hundred members within region lightyears across much less densely populated globular clusters much less tightly gravitationally bound time disrupted gravity giant molecular clouds clusters close encounters cluster members also result ejection evaporation
prominent open clusters pleiades hyades taurus double cluster hchi persei also prominent dark skies open clusters often dominated hot young blue stars although stars shortlived stellar terms lasting tens millions years open clusters tend dispersed stars die
establishing precise distances open clusters enables calibration famed periodluminosity relationship shown cepheids variable stars used standard candles cepheids luminous used establish distances remote galaxies expansion rate universe hubble constant indeed open cluster designated ngc hosts three classical cepheids critical efforts

stellar associations
open cluster become gravitationally unbound newly formed group stars fails form cluster constituent stars continue move similar paths space group known stellar association moving group stars big dipper members former open cluster ursa major moving group similar proper motions stars across sky including alphecca zeta trianguli australis related group sun lies edge stream stars moment isnt member shown different galactic orbit age chemical composition
another stellar association surrounding mirfak persei prominent binoculars distant moving clusters cannot readily detected since proper motions stars need known
astronomical significance clusters
stellar clusters important many areas astronomy stars born roughly time different properties stars cluster function mass stellar evolution theories rely observations open globular clusters
clusters also crucial step determining distance scale universe nearest clusters close enough distances measured using parallax hertzsprungrussell diagram plotted clusters absolute values known luminosity axis similar diagram plotted cluster whose distance known position main sequence compared first cluster distance estimated process known mainsequence fitting reddening stellar populations must accounted using method
nomenclature
