genetic disorder genetic problem caused one abnormalities genome especially condition present birth congenital genetic disorders quite rare affect one person every several thousands millions
genetic disorders may may heritable ie passed parents genes nonheritable genetic disorders defects may caused new mutations changes dna cases defect heritable occurs germ line disease forms cancer may caused inherited genetic condition people new mutations people mainly environmental causes still people whether extent person genetic defect abnormality actually suffer disease almost always affected environmental factors events persons development
types recessive gene disorders confer advantage certain environments one copy gene present
singlegeneedit
singlegene disorder result single mutated gene human diseases caused singlegene defects singlegene disorders passed subsequent generations several ways genomic imprinting uniparental disomy however may affect inheritance patterns divisions recessive dominant types hard fast although divisions autosomal xlinked types since latter types distinguished purely based chromosomal location gene example achondroplasia typically considered dominant disorder children two genes achondroplasia severe skeletal disorder achondroplasics could viewed carriers sicklecell anemia also considered recessive condition heterozygous carriers increased resistance malaria early childhood could described related dominant condition couple one partner sufferers carriers singlegene disorder wish child vitro fertilization means preimplantation genetic diagnosis check whether embryo genetic disorder
autosomal dominantedit
one mutated copy gene necessary person affected autosomal dominant disorder affected person usually one affected parent chance child inherit mutated gene autosomal dominant conditions sometimes reduced penetrance means although one mutated copy needed individuals inherit mutation go develop disease examples type disorder huntingtons disease neurofibromatosis type neurofibromatosis type marfan syndrome hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer hereditary multiple exostosestuberous sclerosis von willebrand disease acute intermittent porphyria highly penetrant autosomal dominant disorder birth defects also called congenital anomalies
autosomal recessiveedit
two copies gene must mutated person affected autosomal recessive disorder affected person usually unaffected parents carry single copy mutated gene referred carriers two unaffected people carry one copy mutated gene risk pregnancy child affected disorder examples type disorder albinism mediumchain acylcoa dehydrogenase deficiency cystic fibrosis sicklecell disease taysachs disease niemannpick disease spinal muscular atrophy roberts syndrome certain phenotypes wet versus dry earwax also determined autosomal recessive fashion
xlinked dominantedit
xlinked dominant disorders caused mutations genes x chromosome disorders inheritance pattern prime example xlinked hypophosphatemic rickets males females affected disorders males typically severely affected females xlinked dominant conditions rett syndrome incontinentia pigmenti type aicardi syndrome usually fatal males either utero shortly birth therefore predominantly seen females exceptions finding extremely rare cases boys klinefelter syndrome xxy also inherit xlinked dominant condition exhibit symptoms similar female terms disease severity chance passing xlinked dominant disorder differs men women sons man xlinked dominant disorder unaffected since receive fathers y chromosome daughters inherit condition woman xlinked dominant disorder chance affected fetus pregnancy although noted cases incontinentia pigmenti female offspring generally viable addition although conditions alter fertility per se individuals rett syndrome aicardi syndrome rarely reproduce
xlinked recessiveedit
xlinked recessive conditions also caused mutations genes x chromosome males frequently affected females chance passing disorder differs men women sons man xlinked recessive disorder affected daughters carry one copy mutated gene woman carrier xlinked recessive disorder xrxr chance sons affected chance daughters carry one copy mutated gene therefore carriers xlinked recessive conditions include serious diseases hemophilia duchenne muscular dystrophy leschnyhan syndrome well common less serious conditions male pattern baldness redgreen color blindness xlinked recessive conditions sometimes manifest females due skewed xinactivation monosomy x turner syndrome
ylinkededit
ylinked disorders also called holandric disorders caused mutations y chromosome conditions display may transmitted heterogametic sex eg male humans offspring sex simply means ylinked disorders humans passed men sons females never affected possess y allosomes
ylinked disorders exceedingly rare wellknown examples typically cause infertility reproduction conditions possible circumvention infertility medical intervention
mitochondrialedit
type inheritance also known maternal inheritance applies genes mitochondrial dna egg cells contribute mitochondria developing embryo mothers pass mitochondrial conditions children example type disorder lebers hereditary optic neuropathy
many genesedit
genetic disorders may also complex multifactorial polygenic meaning likely associated effects multiple genes combination lifestyles environmental factors multifactorial disorders include heart disease diabetes although complex disorders often cluster families clearcut pattern inheritance makes difficult determine persons risk inheriting passing disorders complex disorders also difficult study treat specific factors cause disorders yet identified studies aim identify cause complex disorders use several methodological approaches determine genotypephenotype associations one method genotypefirst approach starts identifying genetic variants within patients determining associated clinical manifestations opposed traditional phenotypefirst approach may identify causal factors previously obscured clinical heterogeneity penetrance expressivity
pedigree polygenic diseases tend run families inheritance fit simple patterns mendelian diseases mean genes cannot eventually located studied also strong environmental component many eg blood pressure
asthma
autoimmune diseases multiple sclerosis
cancers
ciliopathies
cleft palate
diabetes
heart disease
hypertension
inflammatory bowel disease
intellectual disability
mood disorder
obesity
refractive error
infertility
diagnosisedit
due wide range genetic disorders presently known diagnosis genetic disorder widely varied dependent disorder genetic disorders diagnosed birth early childhood however huntingtons disease escape detection patient well adulthood
basic aspects genetic disorder rests inheritance genetic material depth family history possible anticipate possible disorders children direct medical professionals specific tests depending disorder allow parents chance prepare potential lifestyle changes anticipate possibility stillbirth contemplate termination prenatal diagnosis detect presence characteristic abnormalities fetal development ultrasound detect presence characteristic substances via invasive procedures involve inserting probes needles uterus amniocentesis
prognosisedit
genetic disorders directly result death however known cures genetic disorders many genetic disorders affect stages development downs syndrome others result purely physical symptoms muscular dystrophy disorders huntingtons disease show signs adulthood active time genetic disorder patients mostly rely maintaining slowing degradation quality life maintain patient autonomy includes physical therapy pain management may include selection alternative medicine programs
treatmentedit
treatment genetic disorders ongoing battle gene therapy clinical trials completed ongoing approved worldwide despite treatment options revolve around treating symptoms disorders attempt improve patient quality life
gene therapy refers form treatment healthy gene introduced patient alleviate defect caused faulty gene slow progression disease major obstacle delivery genes appropriate cell tissue organ affected disorder one introduce gene potentially trillions cells carry defective copy question roadblock understanding genetic disorder correcting genetic disorder
