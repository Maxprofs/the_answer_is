sunburn is a form of radiation burn that affects living tissue such as skin that results from an overexposure to ultraviolet (uv) radiation commonly from the sun common symptoms in humans and other animals include red or reddish skin that is hot to the touch pain general fatigue and mild dizziness an excess of uv radiation can be life-threatening in extreme cases exposure of the skin to lesser amounts of uv radiation will often produce a suntan
excessive uv radiation is the leading cause of primarily non-malignant skin tumors sunscreen is widely agreed to prevent sunburn and some types of skin cancer clothing including hats is considered the preferred skin protection method moderate sun tanning without burning can also prevent subsequent sunburn as it increases the amount of melanin a photoprotective pigment that is the skin's natural defense against overexposure importantly both sunburn and the increase in melanin production are triggered by direct dna damage when the skin cells dna is overly damaged by uv radiation type i cell-death is triggered and the skin is replaced
== signs and symptomsedit ==
typically there is initial redness (erythema) followed by varying degrees of pain proportional in severity to both the duration and intensity of exposure
other symptoms can include edema itching peeling skin rash nausea fever chills and syncope also a small amount of heat is given off from the burn caused by the concentration of blood in the healing process giving a warm feeling to the affected area sunburns may be first- or second-degree burns
=== variationsedit ===
minor sunburns typically cause nothing more than slight redness and tenderness to the affected areas in more serious cases blistering can occur extreme sunburns can be painful to the point of debilitation and may require hospital care
=== durationedit ===
sunburn can occur in less than 15 minutes and in seconds when exposed to non-shielded welding arcs or other sources of intense ultraviolet light nevertheless the inflicted harm is often not immediately obvious
after the exposure skin may turn red in as little as 30 minutes but most often takes 2 to 6 hours pain is usually most extreme 6 to 48 hours after exposure the burn continues to develop for 1 to 3 days occasionally followed by peeling skin in 3 to 8 days some peeling and itching may continue for several weeks
=== skin canceredit ===
ultraviolet radiation causes sunburns and increases the risk of three types of skin cancer melanoma basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma of greatest concern is that the melanoma risk increases in a dose-dependent manner with the number of a person's lifetime cumulative episodes of sunburn
== causesedit ==
=== biologicaledit ===
sunburn is caused by uv radiation either from the sun or from artificial sources such as tanning lamps welding arcs or ultraviolet germicidal irradiation it is a reaction of the body to direct dna damage from uvb light this damage is mainly the formation of a thymine dimer the damage is recognized by the body which then triggers several defense mechanisms including dna repair to revert the damage apoptosis and peeling to remove irreparably damaged skin cells and increased melanin production to prevent future damage melanin readily absorbs uv wavelength light acting as a photoprotectant by preventing uv photons from disrupting chemical bonds melanin inhibits both the direct alteration of dna and the generation of free radicals thus indirect dna damage
sunburn causes an inflammation process including production of prostanoids and bradykinin these chemical compounds increase sensitivity to heat by reducing the threshold of heat receptor (trpv1) activation from 109 f (43 c) to 85 f (29 c) the pain may be caused by overproduction of a protein called cxcl5 which activates nerve fibres
skin type determines the ease of sunburn in general people with lighter skin tone have a greater risk of sunburn age also affects how skin reacts to sun the skin of children younger than six and adults older than sixty are more sensitive to sunlight
=== medicationsedit ===
the risk of a sunburn can be increased by pharmaceutical products that sensitize users to uv radiation certain antibiotics oral contraceptives and tranquillizers have this effect
=== uv intensityedit ===
the uv index indicates the risk of getting a sunburn at a given time and location contributing factors include
the time of day between 10am and 4pm daylight saving time the sun's rays are the strongest
cloud cover uv is partially blocked by clouds but even on an overcast day a significant percentage of the sun's damaging uv radiation can pass through clouds
proximity to reflective surfaces such as water sand concrete snow and ice all of these reflect the sun's rays and can cause sunburns
the season of the year the position of the sun in late spring and early summer can cause a more-severe sunburn
altitude at a higher altitude it is easier to become burnt because there is less of the earth's atmosphere to block the sunlight uv exposure increases about 4% for every 1000 ft (305 m) gain in elevation
proximity to the equator (latitude) between the polar and tropical regions the closer to the equator the more direct sunlight passes through the atmosphere over the course of a year for example the southern united states gets fifty percent more sunlight than the northern united states
because of variations in the intensity of uv radiation passing through the atmosphere the risk of sunburn increases with proximity to the tropic latitudes located between 23.5 north and south latitude all else being equal (e.g. cloud cover ozone layer terrain etc.) over the course of a full year each location within the tropic or polar regions receives approximately the same amount of uv radiation in the temperate zones between 23.5 and 66.5 uv radiation varies substantially by latitude and season the higher the latitude the lower the intensity of the uv rays intensity in the northern hemisphere is greatest during the months of may june and july and in the southern hemisphere november december and january on a minute-by-minute basis the amount of uv radiation is dependent on the angle of the sun this is easily determined by the height ratio of any object to the size of its shadow the greatest risk is at solar noon when shadows are at their minimum and the sun's radiation passes most directly through the atmosphere regardless of one's latitude (assuming no other variables) equal shadow lengths mean equal amounts of uv radiation
the skin and eyes are most sensitive to damage by uv at 265275 nm wavelength which is in the lower uvc band that is almost never encountered except from artificial sources like welding arcs most sunburn is caused by longer wavelengths simply because those are more prevalent in sunlight at ground level
=== ozone depletionedit ===
in recent decades the incidence and severity of sunburn has increased worldwide partly because of chemical damage to the atmosphere's ozone layer between the 1970s and the 2000s average stratospheric ozone decreased by approximately 4% contributing an approximate 4% increase to the average uv intensity at the earth's surface ozone depletion and the seasonal ozone hole have led to much larger changes in some locations especially in the southern hemisphere
=== tanningedit ===
suntans which naturally develop in some individuals as a protective mechanism against the sun are viewed by most in the western world as desirable this has led to increased exposure to uv radiation from both the natural sun and tanning lamps
== preventionedit ==
=== skinedit ===
the most effective way to prevent sunburn is to reduce the amount of uv radiation reaching the skin the strength of sunlight is published in many locations as a uv index the world health organization recommends to limit time in midday summer sun (between 10 a.m and 4 p.m.) to watch the uv index to seek shade to wear protective clothing (including a wide-brim hat) and to use sunscreen sunlight is generally strongest when the sun is close to the highest point in the sky due to time zones and daylight saving time this is not necessarily at 12 noon but often one to two hours later
commercial preparations are available that block uv light known as sunscreens or sunblocks they have a sun protection factor (spf) rating based on the sunblock's ability to suppress sunburn the higher the spf rating the lower the amount of direct dna damage the stated protection factors are correct only if 2 l of sunscreen is applied per square cm of exposed skin this translates into about 28 ml (1 oz) to cover the whole body of an adult male which is much more than many people use in practice broad-spectrum sunscreens contain filters that protect against uva radiation as well as uvb although uva radiation does not primarily cause sunburn it does contribute to skin aging and an increased risk of skin cancer
research has shown that the best sunscreen protection is achieved by application 15 to 30 minutes before exposure followed by one reapplication 15 to 30 minutes after exposure begins further reapplication is necessary only after activities such as swimming sweating and rubbing this varies based on the indications and protection shown on the label from as little as 80 minutes in water to a few hours depending on the product selected
sunscreen is effective and thus recommended for preventing melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma there is little evidence that it is effective in preventing basal cell carcinoma other advice to reduce rates of skin cancer includes avoiding sunburning wearing protective clothing sunglasses and hats and attempting to avoid sun exposure or periods of peak exposure the u.s preventive services task force recommends that people between 9 and 25 years of age be advised to avoid ultraviolet light typical use of sunscreen does not usually result in vitamin d deficiency but extensive usage may
when one is exposed to any artificial source of occupational uv special protective clothing (for example welding helmets/shields) should be worn such sources can produce uvc an extremely carcinogenic wavelength of uv which ordinarily is not present in normal sunlight having been filtered out by the atmosphere
=== eyesedit ===
the eyes are also sensitive to sun exposure at about the same uv wavelengths as skin snow blindness is essentially sunburn of the cornea wrap-around sunglasses or the use by spectacle-wearers of glasses that block uv light reduce the harmful radiation uv light has been implicated in the development of age-related macular degeneration pterygium and cataract concentrated clusters of melanin commonly known as freckles are often found within the iris
=== dietedit ===
dietary factors influence susceptibility to sunburn recovery from sunburn and risk of secondary complications from sunburn several dietary antioxidants including essential vitamins have been shown to have some effectiveness for protecting against sunburn and skin damage associated with ultraviolet radiation in both human and animal studies supplementation with vitamin c and vitamin e was shown in one study to reduce the amount of sunburn after a controlled amount of uv exposure a review of scientific literature through 2007 found that beta carotene (vitamin a) supplementation had a protective effect against sunburn but that the effects were only evident in the long-term with studies of supplementation for periods less than 10 weeks in duration failing to show any effects there is also evidence that common foods may have some protective ability against sunburn if taken for a period before the exposure
== treatmentedit ==
the primary measure is avoiding further exposure to the sun the best treatment for most sunburns is time most sunburns heal completely within a few weeks
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen or naproxen) and aspirin may decrease redness and pain topical steroids (such as hydrocortisone cream) do not help with sunburns
home treatments that may help the discomfort include using cool and wet cloths on the sunburned areas applying soothing lotions that contain aloe vera to the sunburn areas was supported by one review others have found aloe vera to have no effect aloe vera has no ability to protect people from sunburns
