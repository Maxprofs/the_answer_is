a protoplanet is a large planetary embryo that originated within a protoplanetary disc and has undergone internal melting to produce a differentiated interior protoplanets are thought to form out of kilometer-sized planetesimals that gravitationally perturb each other's orbits and collide gradually coalescing into the dominant planets
in the case of the solar system it is thought that the collisions of planetesimals created a few hundred planetary embryos such embryos were similar to ceres and pluto with masses of about 1022 to 1023 kg and were a few thousand kilometers in diameter over the course of hundreds of millions of years they collided with one another the exact sequence whereby planetary embryos collided to assemble the planets is not known but it is thought that initial collisions would have replaced the first generation of embryos with a second generation consisting of fewer but larger embryos these in their turn would have collided to create a third generation of fewer but even larger embryos eventually only a handful of embryos were left which collided to complete the assembly of the planets proper
early protoplanets had more radioactive elements the quantity of which has been reduced over time due to radioactive decay heating due to radioactivity impact and gravitational pressure melted parts of protoplanets as they grew toward being planets in melted zones their heavier elements sank to the center while lighter elements rose to the surface such a process is known as planetary differentiation the composition of some meteorites show that differentiation took place in some asteroids
the giant impact hypothesis proposes that the moon formed from a colossal impact of a hypothetical protoplanet named theia with earth early in the solar system's history
in the inner solar system the three protoplanets to survive more-or-less intact are the asteroids 1 ceres 2 pallas and 4 vesta 16 psyche is likely the survivor of a violent hit-and-run with another object that stripped off the outer rocky layers of a protoplanet the asteroid 21 lutetia has also shown characteristics that resemble a protoplanet kuiper-belt dwarf planets have also been referred to as protoplanets because iron meteorites have been found on earth it is deemed likely that there once were other metal-cored protoplanets in the asteroid belt that since have been disrupted and that are the source of these meteorites
in february 2013 astronomers made the first direct observation of a protoplanet forming in a disk of gas and dust around a distant star
