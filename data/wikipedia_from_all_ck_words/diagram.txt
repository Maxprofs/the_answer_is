a diagram is a symbolic representation of information according to some visualization technique diagrams have been used since ancient times but became more prevalent during the enlightenment sometimes the technique uses a three-dimensional visualization which is then projected onto a two-dimensional surface the word graph is sometimes used as a synonym for diagram
== overview ==
the term diagram in its commonly used sense can have a general or specific meaning
visual information device  like the term illustration the diagram is used as a collective term standing for the whole class of technical genres including graphs technical drawings and tables
specific kind of visual display  this is the genre that shows qualitative data with shapes that are connected by lines arrows or other visual links
in science the term is used in both ways for example anderson (1997) stated more generally diagrams are pictorial yet abstract representations of information and maps line graphs bar charts engineering blueprints and architects sketches are all examples of diagrams whereas photographs and video are not on the other hand lowe (1993) defined diagrams as specifically abstract graphic portrayals of the subject matter they represent
in the specific sense diagrams and charts contrast with computer graphics technical illustrations infographics maps and technical drawings by showing abstract rather than literal representations of information the essence of a diagram can be seen as
a form of visual formatting devices
a display that does not show quantitative data (numerical data) but rather relationships and abstract information
with building blocks such as geometrical shapes connected by lines arrows or other visual links
or in hall's (1996) words diagrams are simplified figures caricatures in a way intended to convey essential meaning these simplified figures are often based on a set of rules the basic shape according to white (1984) can be characterized in terms of elegance clarity ease pattern simplicity and validity elegance is basically determined by whether or not the diagram is the simplest and most fitting solution to a problem
== main diagram types ==
there are at least the following types of diagrams
chart-like diagrams which take a collection of items and relationships between them and express them by giving each item a 2d position while the relationships are expressed as connections between the items or overlaps between the items examples of such techniques
graph-based diagrams theses display a relationship between two variables that take either discrete or a continuous ranges of values examples
schematics and other types of diagrams e.g.
many of these types of diagrams are commonly generated using diagramming software thousands of diagram techniques exist some more examples follow
