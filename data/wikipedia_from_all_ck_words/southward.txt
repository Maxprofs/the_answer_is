=== early historyedit ===
southwark is on a previously marshy area south of the river thames recent excavation has revealed prehistoric activity including evidence of early ploughing burial mounds and ritual activity the area was originally a series of islands in the river thames this formed the best place to bridge the thames and the area became an important part of londinium owing its importance to its position as the endpoint of the roman london bridge two roman roads stane street and watling street met at southwark in what is now borough high street archaeological work at tabard street in 2004 discovered a plaque with the earliest reference to london from the roman period on it londinium was abandoned at the end of the roman occupation in the early fifth century and both the city and its bridge collapsed in decay archaeologically evidence of settlement is replaced by a largely featureless soil called the dark earth which probably (although this is contested) represents an urban area abandoned
southwark appears to recover only during the time of king alfred and his successors sometime about 886 ad the burh of southwark was created and the roman city area reoccupied it was probably fortified to defend the bridge and hence the re-emerging city of london to the north this defensive role is highlighted by the use of the bridge in 1016 as a defence against king sweyn and his son king cnut by ethelred the unready and again in 1066 against king william the conqueror he failed to force the bridge during the norman conquest of england but southwark was devastated
southwark appears in the domesday book of 1086 as held by several surrey manors its assets were the bishop odo of bayeux held the monastery (the site of the cathedral) the tide-way - which still exists as st mary overy dock the king owned the church (probably st olave's) and its tidal stream (st olave's dock) the dues of the waterway or mooring place were shared between the king and earl godwin the king also had the toll of the strand and the men of southwark had the right to a haw and its toll southwark's value to the king was 16 much of southwark was originally owned by the churchthe greatest reminder of monastic london is southwark cathedral originally the priory of st mary overy
during the early middle ages southwark developed and was one of the four surrey towns which returned members of parliament for the first commons assembly in 1295 an important market occupied the high street from some time in the 13th century which was controlled by the city's officersit was later removed in order to improve traffic to the bridge under a separate trust by act of parliament of 1756 as the borough market on the present site the area was renowned for its inns especially the tabard from which chaucer's pilgrims set off on their journey in the canterbury tales
just west of the bridge was the clink liberty manor which was never controlled by the city technically held under the bishopric of winchester's nominal authority this area therefore became the entertainment district for london and it was also the red-light area in 1587 southwark was given its first playhouse theatre the rose the rose was set up by philip henslowe and soon became a popular place of entertainment for all classes of londoners both christopher marlowe and william shakespeare two of the finest writers of the elizabethan age worked at the rose
in 1599 the globe theatre in which shakespeare was a shareholder was erected on the bankside in the liberty of the clink it burned down in 1613 and was rebuilt in 1614 only to be closed by the puritans in 1642 and subsequently pulled down not long thereafter a modern replica called shakespeare's globe has been built near the original site southwark was also a favourite area for entertainment such as bull and bear-baiting the impresario in the later elizabethan period for these entertainments was shakespeare's colleague edward alleyn who left many local charitable endowments most notably dulwich college
on 26 may 1676 ten years after the great fire of london a great fire broke out which continued for 17 hours before houses were blown up to create fire breaks king charles ii and his brother the duke of york were involved in the effort
there was also a famous fair in southwark which took place near the church of st george the martyr william hogarth depicted this fair in his engraving of southwark fair (1733)
southwark was also the location of several prisons including those of the crown or prerogative courts the marshalsea and king's bench prisons that of the local manors courts e.g borough compter the clink and the surrey county gaol originally housed at the white lion inn (also called informally the borough gaol') and eventually at horsemonger lane gaol
one other local family is of note the harvards john harvard went to the local parish free school of st saviour's and on to cambridge university he migrated to the massachusetts colony and left his library and the residue of his will to the new college there named after him as its first benefactor harvard university maintains a link having paid for a memorial chapel within southwark cathedral (his family's parish church) and where its uk-based alumni hold services john harvard's mother's house is in stratford upon avon
=== urbanisationedit ===
in 1836 the first railway for the london area was created the london and greenwich railway originally terminating at spa road station and later extended west to london bridge station
in 1861 another great fire of southwark destroyed a large number of buildings between tooley street and the thames including those around hays wharf (later replaced by hays galleria) and blocks to the west almost as far as st olave's church
the first deep-level london tube underground line was the city and south london railway now the bank branch of the northern line opened in 1890 running from king william street south through borough to stockwell southwark since 1999 is also now served by southwark bermondsey and london bridge stations on the jubilee line
=== local governanceedit ===
the ancient borough of southwark initially consisted of the surrey parishes of st george the martyr st olave st margaret and st mary st margaret and st mary were abolished in 1541 and their former area combined to create southwark st saviour around 1555 southwark st thomas was split off from st olave and in 1733 southwark st john horsleydown was also split off
in 1855 the parishes came into the area of responsibility of the metropolitan board of works the st george the martyr parish was large enough to be governed by a vestry st john horsleydown st olave and st thomas were grouped to form the st olave district st savour was combined with southwark christchurch (the former liberty of paris garden) to form the st saviour's district in 1889 the area became part of the county of london st olave and st thomas were combined as a single parish in 1896
the local government arrangements were reorganised in 1900 with a metropolitan borough of southwark created comprising the parishes of southwark christchurch southwark st saviours southwark st george the martyr and newington the eastern parishes that had formed the st olave district instead became part of the metropolitan borough of bermondsey in 1965 the two boroughs were combined with the metropolitan borough of camberwell to form the current london borough of southwark
=== relationship with the city of londonedit ===
southwark was outside of the control of the city of london and was a haven for criminals and free traders who would sell goods and conduct trades outside the regulation of the city livery companies in 1327 the city obtained control from edward iii of the manor next to the south-side of london bridge  the town of southwark (called latterly guildable manor'i.e. the place of taxes and tolls) the livery companies also ensured that they had jurisdiction over the area
from the norman period manorial organisation obtained through major lay and ecclesiastic magnates southwark still has vestiges of this because of the connection with the city of london in 1327 the city acquired from edward iii the original vill of southwark and this was also described as the borough in 1536 henry viii acquired the bermondsey priory properties and in 1538 that of the archbishop in 1550 these were sold to the city
after many decades of petitioning in 1550 southwark was incorporated into the city of london as the ward of bridge without however the alderman was appointed by the court of aldermen and no common councilmen were ever elected this ward was constituted of the original guildable manor and the properties previously held by the church under a charter of edward vi latterly called the king's manor and great liberty manor these manors are still constituted by the city under a bailiff and steward with their courts leet and view of frankpledge juries and officers which still meettheir annual assembly being held in november under the present high steward (the recorder of london) the ward and aldermanry were effectively abolished in 1978 by merging it with the ward of bridge (within) these manorial courts were preserved under the administration of justice act 1977 therefore between 1750 and 1978 southwark had two persons (the alderman and the recorder) who were members of the city's court of aldermen and common council who were elected neither by the city freemen or by the southwark electorate but appointed by the court of aldermen
