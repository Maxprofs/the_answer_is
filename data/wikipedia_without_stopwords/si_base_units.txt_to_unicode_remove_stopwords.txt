si base quantities form set mutually independent dimensions required dimensional analysis commonly employed science technology however given realization units may well interdependent ie defined terms
names symbols si base units written lowercase eg metre us english meter symbol m except symbols named persons written initial capital letter ie kelvin lord kelvin symbol k ampere andrmarie ampre symbol

several modifications definitions base units additions base units since metre convention since redefinition metre kilogram unit directly defined terms physical artifact rather property nature however mole ampere candela also linked definitions mass platinumiridium cylinder stored vault near paris long objective metrology find way define kilogram terms fundamental constant way metre defined terms speed light
st general conference weights measures cgpm placed efforts official footing recommended national laboratories continue efforts refine experiments link unit mass fundamental atomic constants view future redefinition kilogram two main possibilities attracted attention planck constant avogadro constant
international committee weights measures cipm approved preparation new definitions kilogram ampere kelvin noted possibility new definition mole based avogadro constant rd cgpm decided postpone formal change next general conference
note cipm october ian mills president cipm consultative committee units ccu cataloged uncertainties fundamental constants physics according current definitions values proposed new definition urged cipm accept proposed changes definition kilogram ampere kelvin mole referenced values fundamental constants namely plancks constant h electron charge e boltzmanns constant k avogadros constant na
