spermatozoon pronounced sprmtzon alternate spelling spermatozon plural spermatozoa ancient greek seed ancient greek living motile sperm cell moving form haploid cell male gamete spermatozoon joins ovum form zygote zygote single cell complete set chromosomes normally develops embryo
sperm cells contribute approximately half nuclear genetic information diploid offspring excluding cases mitochondrial dna mammals sex offspring determined sperm cell spermatozoon bearing y chromosome lead male xy offspring one bearing x chromosome lead female xx offspring sperm cells first observed anton van leeuwenhoek
mammalian spermatozoon structure function sizeedit
humansedit
human sperm cell reproductive cell males survive warm environments leaves male body sperms survival likelihood reduced may die thereby decreasing total sperm quality sperm cells come two types female male sperm cells give rise female xx offspring fertilization differ carry xchromosome sperm cells give rise male xy offspring carry ychromosome
human sperm cells consist flat disc shaped head m m tail m long tail flagellates propels sperm cell mmminute humans whipping elliptical cone semen alkaline nature reach full motility hypermotility reach vagina alkaline ph neutralized acidic vaginal fluids gradual process takes minutes time fibrinogen seminal vesicles forms clot securing protecting sperm become hypermotile fibrinolysin prostate dissolves clot allowing sperm progress optimally
spermatozoon characterized minimum cytoplasm densely packed dna known eukaryotes compared mitotic chromosomes somatic cells sperm dna least sixfold highly condensed
specimen contributes dnachromatin centriole perhaps also oocyteactivating factor oaf may also contribute paternal messenger rna mrna also contributing embryonic development
human spermatozoon contains different proteins
dna damage repairedit
dna damages present spermatozoa period meiosis fertilization may repaired fertilized egg repaired serious deleterious effects fertility developing embryo human spermatozoa particularly vulnerable free radical attack generation oxidative dna damage see eg oxodeoxyguanosine
exposure males certain lifestyle environmental andor occupational hazards may increase risk aneuploid spermatozoa particular risk aneuploidy increased tobacco smoking occupational exposure benzene insecticides perfluorinated compounds increased aneuploidy spermatozoa often occurs association increased dna damage
avoidance immune system responseedit
glycoprotein molecules surface ejaculated sperm cells recognized human female immune systems interpreted signal cell rejected female immune system might otherwise attack sperm reproductive tract specific glycoproteins coating sperm cells also utilized cancerous bacterial cells parasitic worms hivinfected white blood cells thereby avoiding immune response host organism
bloodtestis barrier maintained tight junctions sertoli cells seminiferous tubules prevents communication forming spermatozoa testis blood vessels immune cells circulating within within interstitial space prevents eliciting immune response bloodtestis barrier also important preventing toxic substances disrupting spermatogenesis

species fruit fly produce largest known spermatozoon found nature drosophila melanogaster produces sperm mm relative drosophila bifurca produces largest known spermatozoon measuring mm size d melanogaster entire sperm tail included gets incorporated oocyte cytoplasm however d bifurca small portion tail enters oocyte
wood mouse apodemus sylvaticus possesses spermatozoa falciform morphology makes gametocytes even unique presence apical hook sperm head hook used attach hooks flagella spermatozoa aggregation caused attachments mobile trains result trains provide improved motility female reproductive tract means fertilization promoted
postmeiotic phase mouse spermatogenesis sensitive environmental genotoxic agents male germ cells form mature spermatozoa progressively lose ability repair dna damage irradiation male mice late spermatogenesis induce damage persists least days fertilizing spermatozoa disruption maternal dna doublestrand break repair pathways increases spermatozoaderived chromosomal aberrations treatment male mice melphalan bifunctional alkylating agent frequently employed chemotherapy induces dna lesions meiosis may persist unrepaired state germ cells progress though dna repaircompetent phases spermatogenic development unrepaired dna damages spermatozoa fertilization lead offspring various abnormalities
sea urchins arbacia punctulataare ideal organisms use sperm research spawn large numbers sperm sea making wellsuited model organisms experiments
plants algae fungiedit
gametophytes bryophytes ferns gymnosperms produce motile sperm cells contrary pollen grains employed gymnosperms angiosperms renders sexual reproduction absence water impossible since water necessary medium sperm egg meet algae lower plant sperm cells often multiflagellated see image thus morphologically different animal spermatozoa
algae fungi produce nonmotile sperm cells called spermatia higher plants algae fungi fertilization involves migration sperm nucleus fertilization tube eg pollen tube higher plants reach egg cell
spermatozoa production mammalsedit
spermatozoa produced seminiferous tubules testes process called spermatogenesis round cells called spermatogonia divide differentiate eventually become spermatozoa copulation cloaca vagina gets inseminated spermatozoa move chemotaxis ovum inside fallopian tube uterus
spermatozoa activationedit
approaching egg cell rather complex multistep process chemotaxis guided different chemical substancesstimuli individual levels phylogeny one significant common signaling characters event prototype professional chemotaxis receptors formyl peptide receptor receptorcell well activator ability ligand formyl metleuphe demonstrated surface membrane even case human sperms mammalian sperm cells become even active approach egg cell process called sperm activation sperm activation shown caused calcium ionophores vitro progesterone released nearby cumulus cells binding zp zona pellucida cumulus cells embedded gellike substance made primarily hyaluronic acid developed ovary egg support grows
initial change called hyperactivation causes change spermatozoa motility swim faster tail movements become forceful erratic
recent discovery links hyperactivation sudden influx calcium ion tails whiplike tail flagellum sperm studded ion channels formed proteins called catsper channels selective allowing calcium ions pass opening catsper channels responsible influx calcium sudden rise calcium levels causes flagellum form deeper bends propelling sperm forcefully viscous environment sperm hyperactivity necessary breaking two physical barriers protect egg fertilization
second process sperm activation acrosome reaction involves releasing contents acrosome disperse exposure enzymes attached inner acrosomal membrane sperm occurs sperm first meets egg lockandkey type mechanism speciesspecific prevents sperm egg different species fusing evidence binding triggers acrosome release enzymes allow sperm fuse egg
zp one proteins make zona pellucida binds partner molecule sperm enzymes inner acrosomal membrane digest zona pellucida sperm penetrates zona pellucida part sperms cell membrane fuses egg cells membrane contents head diffuse egg
upon penetration oocyte said become activated undergoes secondary meiotic division two haploid nuclei paternal maternal fuse form zygote order prevent polyspermy minimise possibility producing triploid zygote several changes eggs zona pellucida renders impenetrable shortly first sperm enters egg
