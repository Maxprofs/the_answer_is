factors influencing rate reaction
nature reaction reactions naturally faster others number reacting species physical state particles form solids move much slowly gases solution complexity reaction factors greatly influence rate reaction
concentration reaction rate increases concentration described rate law explained collision theory reactant concentration increases frequency collision increases
pressure rate gaseous reactions increases pressure fact equivalent increase concentration gasthe reaction rate increases direction fewer moles gas decreases reverse direction condensedphase reactions pressure dependence weak

electromagnetic radiation intensity light electromagnetic radiation form energy may speed rate even make reaction spontaneous provides particles reactants energy energy one way another stored reacting particles may break bonds promote molecules electronically vibrationally excited states creating intermediate species react easily intensity light increases particles absorb energy hence rate reaction increases
example methane reacts chlorine dark reaction rate slow sped mixture put diffused light bright sunlight reaction explosive
catalyst presence catalyst increases reaction rate forward reverse reactions providing alternative pathway lower activation energy
example platinum catalyzes combustion hydrogen oxygen room temperature
isotopes kinetic isotope effect consists different reaction rate molecule different isotopes usually hydrogen isotopes mass difference hydrogen deuterium
