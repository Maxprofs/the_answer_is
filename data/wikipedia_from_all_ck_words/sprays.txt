a spear is a pole weapon consisting of a shaft usually of wood with a pointed head the head may be simply the sharpened end of the shaft itself as is the case with fire hardened spears or it may be made of a more durable material fastened to the shaft such as flint obsidian iron steel or bronze the most common design for hunting or combat spears since ancient times has incorporated a metal spearhead shaped like a triangle lozenge or leaf the heads of fishing spears usually feature barbs or serrated edges
the word spear comes from the old english spere from the proto-germanic speri from a proto-indo-european root *sper- spear pole spears can be divided into two broad categories those designed for thrusting in melee combat and those designed for throwing (usually referred to as javelins)
the spear has been used throughout human history both as a hunting and fishing tool and as a weapon along with the axe knife and club it is one of the earliest and most important tools developed by early humans as a weapon it may be wielded with either one hand or two it was used in virtually every conflict up until the modern era where even then it continues on in the form of the bayonet and is probably the most commonly used weapon in history
== originsedit ==
spear manufacture and use is not confined to human beings it is also practiced by the western chimpanzee chimpanzees near kdougou senegal have been observed to create spears by breaking straight limbs off trees stripping them of their bark and side branches and sharpening one end with their teeth they then used the weapons to hunt galagos sleeping in hollows orangutans also have used spears to fish presumably after observing humans fishing in a similar manner
=== prehistoryedit ===
archaeological evidence found in present-day germany documents that wooden spears have been used for hunting since at least 400,000 years ago and a 2012 study suggests that homo heidelbergensis may have developed the technology about 500,000 years ago wood does not preserve well however and craig stanford a primatologist and professor of anthropology at the university of southern california has suggested that the discovery of spear use by chimpanzees probably means that early humans used wooden spears as well perhaps five million years ago
neanderthals were constructing stone spear heads from as early as 300,000 bp and by 250,000 years ago wooden spears were made with fire-hardened points
from 200,000 bp onwards middle paleolithic humans began to make complex stone blades with flaked edges which were used as spear heads these stone heads could be fixed to the spear shaft by gum or resin or by bindings made of animal sinew leather strips or vegetable matter during this period a clear difference remained between spears designed to be thrown and those designed to be used in hand-to-hand combat by the magdalenian period (c 15000-9500 bc) spear-throwers similar to the later atlatl were in use
== militaryedit ==
spears were one of the most common personal weapons used in the stone age and they remained in use as important military and hunting implements until the advent of firearms they may be seen as the ancestor of such military weapons as the lance the pilum the halberd the naginata the glaive the bill and the pike one of the earliest weapons fashioned by human beings and their ancestors the spear is still used for hunting and fishing and its influences still may be seen in current military gear such as the rifle-mounted bayonet
spears may be used as both a projectile and melee weapons spears used primarily for thrusting may be used with either one or two hands and tend to have heavier and sturdier designs than those intended exclusively for throwing those designed for throwing often referred to as javelins tend to be lighter and have a more streamlined head and they may be thrown either by hand or with the assistance of a spear thrower such as the atlatl or woomera from the atlatl dart the arrow for use with bows eventually developed
=== ancient historyedit ===
==== infantryedit ====
short one-handed spears featuring socketed metal heads were used in conjunction with a shield by the earliest bronze age cultures they were wielded in either single combat or in large troop formations this tradition continued from the first mesopotamian cultures through the various ancient egyptian dynasties to the period of the ancient greek city states
==== africaedit ====
the spear probably originated in africa sometime during the evolution of the genus homo it was an important part of the nubian and ancient egyptian military and continued to be used throughout african history even after the introduction of gunpowder the most common kind of spear used in africa is the assegai which is usually thrown later the zulu people of eastern south africa would become known for their particular skill with shortened thrusting spears called iklwa these spears were designed for close combat and often were wielded in conjunction with a large oval shield advanced skills in close combat allowed the zulu military to conquer much of southeast africa
===== greeksedit =====
the spear is the main weapon of the warriors of homer's iliad the use of both a single thrusting spear and two throwing spears are mentioned it has been suggested that two styles of combat are being described an early style with thrusting spears dating to the mycenaean period in which the iliad is set and anachronistically a later style with throwing spears from homer's own archaic period
in the 7th century bc the greeks evolved a new close-order infantry formation the phalanx the key to this formation was the hoplite who was equipped with a large circular bronze-faced shield (hoplon) and a 79 ft (22.75 m) spear with an iron head and bronze butt-spike (doru) the hoplite phalanx dominated warfare among the greek city states from the 7th into the 4th century bc
the 4th century saw major changes one was the greater use of peltasts light infantry armed with spear and javelins the other was the development of the sarissa a two-handed pike 18 ft (5.5 m) in length by the macedonians under phillip of macedon and alexander the great the pike phalanx supported by peltasts and cavalry became the dominant mode of warfare among the greeks from the late 4th century onward until greek military systems were supplanted by the roman legions
==== cavalryedit ====
during this time the spear was also used by cavalry the majority of ancient cavalry units were equipped either with javelins or a one-handed thrusting spear similar to that used by infantry some however used longer spears the macedonian xyston was 1214 ft (3.64.2 m) in length and could be used with one or two hands the use of the two-handed kontos by heavily armoured soldiers on horseback known as cataphracts was developed first by nomadic eastern iranian tribes and spread throughout the ancient world these would be used to great effect by the diadochi kingdoms and the parthians and later by the sassanians and sarmatians later roman and byzantine armies also made use of these troops
==== romansedit ====
in the pre-marian roman armies the first two lines of battle the hastati and principes often fought with a sword called a gladius and pila heavy javelins that were specifically designed to be thrown at an enemy to pierce and foul a target's shield originally the principes were armed with a short spear called a hasta but these gradually fell out of use eventually being replaced by the gladius the third line the triarii continued to use the hasta
from the late 2nd century bc all legionaries were equipped with the pilum the pilum continued to be the standard legionary spear until the end of the 2nd century ad auxilia however were equipped with a simple hasta and perhaps throwing spears during the 3rd century ad although the pilum continued to be used legionaries usually were equipped with other forms of throwing and thrusting spear similar to auxilia of the previous century by the 4th century the pilum had effectively disappeared from common use
=== middle east and north africa during islamic periodedit ===
muslim warriors used a spear that was called an az-zayah berbers pronounced it zaya but the english term derived from the old french via berber is assegai it is a pole weapon used for throwing or hurling usually a light spear or javelin made of hard wood and pointed with a forged iron tip.the az-zayah played an important role during the islamic conquest as well as during later periods well into the 20th century a longer pole az-zayah was being used as a hunting weapon from horseback the az-zayah spread far into sub-saharan africa as well as india although these places already had their own variants of the spear it was the weapon of choice during the fulani jihad as well as during the mahdist war in sudan it is still being used by sikh nihang in the punjab as well as certain wandering sufi ascetics (derwishes)
=== european middle agesedit ===
after the fall of the roman empire the spear and shield continued to be used by nearly all western european cultures since a medieval spear required only a small amount of steel along the sharpened edges (most of the spear-tip was wrought iron) it was an economical weapon quick to manufacture and needing less smithing skill than a sword it remained the main weapon of the common soldier the vikings for instance although often portrayed with axe or sword in hand were armed mostly with spears as were their anglo-saxon irish or continental contemporaries
==== infantryedit ====
broadly speaking spears were either designed to be used in melee or to be thrown within this simple classification there was a remarkable range of types for example m.j swanton identified thirty different spearhead categories and sub-categories in early saxon england most medieval spearheads were generally leaf-shaped notable types of early medieval spears include the angon a throwing spear with a long head similar to the roman pilum used by the franks and anglo-saxons and the winged (or lugged) spear which had two prominent wings at the base of the spearhead either to prevent the spear penetrating too far into an enemy or to aid in spear fencing originally a frankish weapon the winged spear also was popular with the vikings it would become the ancestor of later medieval polearms such as the partisan and spetum
the thrusting spear also has the advantage of reach being considerably longer than other weapon types exact spear lengths are hard to deduce as few spear shafts survive archaeologically but 6 ft 8 ft (1.8m 2.5m) would seem to have been the norm some nations were noted for their long spears including the scots and the flemish spears usually were used in tightly ordered formations such as the shieldwall or the schiltron to resist cavalry spear shafts could be planted against the ground william wallace drew up his schiltrons in a circle at the battle of falkirk in 1298 to deter charging cavalry but it was a widespread tactic sometimes known as the crown formation
throwing spears became rarer as the middle ages drew on but survived in the hands of specialists such as the catalan almogavars they were commonly used in ireland until the end of the 16th century
spears began to lose fashion among the infantry during the 14th century being replaced by pole weapons that combined the thrusting properties of the spear with the cutting properties of the axe such as the halberd where spears were retained they grew in length eventually evolving into pikes which would be a dominant infantry weapon in the 16th and 17th centuries
==== cavalryedit ====
cavalry spears were originally the same as infantry spears and were often used with two hands or held with one hand overhead in the 11th century after the adoption of stirrups and a high-cantled saddle the spear became a decidedly more powerful weapon a mounted knight would secure the lance by holding it with one hand and tucking it under the armpit (the couched lance technique) this allowed all the momentum of the horse and knight to be focused on the weapon's tip whilst still retaining accuracy and control this use of the spear spurred the development of the lance as a distinct weapon that was perfected in the medieval sport of jousting
in the 14th century tactical developments meant that knights and men-at-arms often fought on foot this led to the practice of shortening the lance to about 5 ft (1.5m.) to make it more manageable as dismounting became commonplace specialist pole weapons such as the pollaxe were adopted by knights and this practice ceased
=== european renaissance and afteredit ===
==== infantryedit ====
the development of both the long two-handed pike and gunpowder in renaissance europe saw an ever increasing focus on integrated infantry tactics those infantry not armed with these weapons carried variations on the pole-arm including the halberd and the bill ultimately the spear proper was rendered obsolete on the battlefield its last flowering was the half-pike or spontoon a shortened version of the pike carried by officers and ncos while originally a weapon this came to be seen more as a badge of office or leading staff by which troops were directed the half-pike sometimes known as a boarding pike was also used as a weapon on board ships until the 19th century
==== cavalryedit ====
at the start of the renaissance cavalry remained predominantly lance-armed gendarmes with the heavy knightly lance and lighter cavalry with a variety of lighter lances by the 1540s however pistol-armed cavalry called reiters were beginning to make their mark cavalry armed with pistols and other lighter firearms along with a sword had virtually replaced lance armed cavalry in western europe by the beginning of the 17th century although the lance persisted in eastern europe from whence it was reintroduced into the european mainstream in the 19th century
=== asiaedit ===
==== chinaedit ====
spears (qiang) were used first as hunting weapons amongst the ancient chinese they became popular as infantry weapons during the warring states and qin era when spearmen were used as especially highly disciplined soldiers in organized group attacks when used in formation fighting spearmen would line up their large rectangular or circular shields in a shieldwall manner the qin also employed long spears (more akin to a pike) in formations similar to swiss pikemen in order to ward off cavalry the han empire would use similar tactics as its qin predecessors halberds polearms and dagger axes were also common weapons during this time
spears were also common weaponry for warring states qin and han era cavalry units during these eras the spear would develop into a longer lance-like weapon used for cavalry charges
==== indiaedit ====
south asian spears were used both in missile and non-missile form both by cavalry and foot-soldiers mounted spear-fighting was practiced using with a ten-foot ball-tipped wooden lance called a bothati the end of which was covered in dye so that hits may be confirmed spears were constructed from a variety of materials such as the sang made completely of steel and the ballam which had a bamboo shaft the rajputs wielded a type of spear for infantrymen which had a club integrated into the spearhead and a pointed butt end other spears had forked blades several spear-points and numerous other innovations one particular spear unique to india was the vita or corded lance used by the maratha army it had a rope connecting the spear with the user's wrist allowing the weapon to be thrown and pulled back
==== japanedit ====
medieval japan employed spears for infantrymen to use but it was not until the 11th century in that samurai began to prefer spears over bows several polearms were used in the japanese theatres the naginata was a glaive-like weapon with a long curved blade popularly among the samurai and the buddhist warrior-monks often used against cavalry the yari was a longer polearm with a shorter and often straight-bladed spearhead which became the weapon of choice of both the samurai and the ashigaru (footmen) during the warring states era
==== koreaedit ====
spears and pole-arms were utilized heavily throughout the history of korean warfare with some types serving specialized purposes especially during the three kingdoms of korea period in which wars among the korean states as well as with neighboring chinese dynasties were highly frequent korean military forces were constantly improving upon weaponry and martial practices during this time period spears were often lengthy and sturdy and were armed by heavily armored shock infantrymen reflecting the prevalence of cavalry engagements and open combat
the goguryeo empire which was by far the most powerful korean sovereignty of that time with its domain stretching from northern korea to the entirety of manchuria and parts of northeastern china was especially well known for its highly motivated and battle-hardened soldiers goguryeo cavalrymen were primarily armed with spears with swords relegated to a secondary position
pole-arms and spears eventually became commonplace weapons among korean infantry during the joseon dynasty and military officers were expected to be proficient in the use of at least several types of spears one of the most prolific pole weapons of this period was the dangpa a modified type of trident its unique feature is the slightly crooked two outer teeth of the weapon with a middle tip extending farther this design was made so that the soldier could stab and penetrate deep into his enemy with maximum force while the two outer teeth would prevent the weapon from becoming stuck to the opponent's body most korean foot soldiers especially those positioned to defend fortresses and strongholds were highly trained in the use of the dangpa some other pole weapons were used such as the woldo a weapon that resembles its more well-known cousin the chinese guan dao the woldo was used mostly by joseon warriors and officers
in the late sixteenth century japanese forces under the leadership of warlord toyotomi hideyoshi instigated an invasion on the korean peninsula to initiate the imjin wars the dangpa continued to be a favorite among korean soldiers stationed to defend fortresses because of its versatility in siege combat the dangpa's balanced weight allowed the soldier to achieve great striking power and its piercing capabilities were invaluable to forcing off climbing japanese soldiers because of its length korean infantry armed with the dangpa could use it to corner multiple japanese troops en masse the dangpa was also used by korean marines in admiral yi's naval operations although to a less prominent extent the tactical nature of korean naval warfare relied upon superior firepower and maneuverability of korean ships and as such korean sailors preferred using projectiles such as bows and arrows as primary weapons however in the case of boarding and close combat situations a small number of korean marines would be armed with the dangpa these sailors acted as pushing infantry by being the first to board an enemy vessel during an engagement the sailors with their dangpa would stave or push off approaching japanese infantry until a significant number of korean swordsmen could board the vessel
==== philippinesedit ====
filipino spears (sibat) were used as both a weapon and a tool throughout the philippines it also called bangkaw sumbling or palupad in the islands of visayas and mindanao sibat are typically made from rattan either with a sharpened tip or a head made from metal these heads may either be single-edged double-edged or barbed styles vary according to function and origin for example a sibat designed for fishing may not be the same as those used for hunting
the spear was used as the primary weapon in expeditions and battles against neighbouring island kingdoms and it become famous during the 1521 battle of mactan where the chieftain lapu lapu of cebu fought against spanish forces led by ferdinand magellan who was subsequently killed
==== vietnamedit ====
along with the axe the spear was the most common ancient weapon found in vietnam spearheads are of various sizes and shapes some only 12 centimetres in length and others 30 to 40 cm long spear shafts also vary greatly soldier figures on 13th-century vases show very short and slender spears used together with shields cavalry spears up to 4 metres long resemble the european lances drawn by 17th-century westerners
=== mesoamericaedit ===
as advanced metallurgy was largely unknown in pre-columbian america outside of western mexico and south america most weapons in meso-america were made of wood or obsidian this didn't mean that they were less lethal as obsidian may be sharpened to become many times sharper than steel meso-american spears varied greatly in shape and size while the aztecs preferred the sword-like macuahuitl for fighting the advantage of a far-reaching thrusting weapon was recognised and a large portion of the army would carry the tepoztopilli into battle the tepoztopilli was a pole-arm and to judge from depictions in various aztec codices it was roughly the height of a man with a broad wooden head about twice the length of the users palm or shorter edged with razor-sharp obsidian blades which were deeply set in grooves carved into the head and cemented in place with bitumen or plant resin as an adhesive the tepoztopili was able both to thrust and slash effectively
throwing spears also were used extensively in meso-american warfare usually with the help of an atlatl throwing spears were typically shorter and more stream-lined than the tepoztopilli and some had obsidian edges for greater penetration
spears were used after the meso-american period in various conflicts including the latin american wars of independence and the spanish american wars of independence plainsmen cavalry (known as llanos) led by jos antonio pez used spears against the royalists in battles such as battle of las queseras del medio the toma de las flecheras and the battle of carabobo
=== native americanedit ===
typically most spears made by native americans were created with materials surrounded by their communities usually the shaft of the spears were made with a wooden stick while the head of the spear was fashioned from arrowheads pieces of metal such as copper or a bone that had been sharpened spears were a preferred weapon by many since it was inexpensive to create could more easily be taught to others and could be made quickly and in large quantities
native americans used the buffalo pound method to kill buffalo which required a hunter to dress as a buffalo and lure one into a ravine where other hunters were hiding once the buffalo appeared the other hunters would kill him with spears a variation of this technique called the buffalo jump was when a runner would lead the animals towards a cliff as the buffalo got close to the cliff other members of the tribe would jump out from behind rocks or trees and scare the buffalo over the cliff other hunters would be waiting at the bottom of the cliff to spear the animal to death
== huntingedit ==
one of the earliest forms of killing prey for humans hunting game with a spear and spear fishing continues to this day as both a means of catching food and as a cultural activity some of the most common prey for early humans were mega fauna such as mammoths which were hunted with various kinds of spear one theory for the quaternary extinction event was that most of these animals were hunted to extinction by humans with spears even after the invention of other hunting weapons such as the bow the spear continued to be used either as a projectile weapon or used in the hand as was common in boar hunting
=== typesedit ===
barred spears a barred spear has a crossbar beneath the blade to prevent too deep a penetration of the spear into an animal the bar may be forged as part of the spearhead or may be more loosely tied by means of loops below the blade barred spears are known from the bronze age but the first historical record of their use in europe is found in the writings of xenophon in the 5th century bc examples also are shown in roman art in the middle ages a winged or lugged war-spear was developed (see above) but the later middle ages saw the development of specialised types such as the boar-spear and the bear-spear the boar-spear could be used both on foot or horseback

=== modern revivaledit ===
spear hunting fell out of favour in most of europe in the 18th century but continued in germany enjoying a revival in the 1930s spear hunting is still practiced in the usa animals taken are primarily wild boar and deer although trophy animals such as cats and big game as large as a cape buffalo are hunted with spears alligator are hunted in florida with a type of harpoon
