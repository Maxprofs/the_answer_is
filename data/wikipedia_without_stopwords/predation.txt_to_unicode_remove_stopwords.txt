ecosystem predation biological interaction predator organism hunting feeds prey organism attacked predators may may kill prey prior feeding act predation often results death prey eventual absorption preys tissue consumption thus predation often though always carnivory categories consumption herbivory eating parts plants mycophagy eating parts fungi detritivory consumption dead organic material detritus consumption categories fall rubric consumerresource systems often difficult separate various types feeding behaviors example parasitic species prey host organism lay eggs offspring feed continues live decaying corpse died key characteristic predation however predators direct impact prey population hand detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising decay dead individuals direct impact donor organisms
selective pressures imposed one another often leads evolutionary arms race prey predator resulting various antipredator adaptations ways classifying predation surveyed include grouping trophic level diet specialization nature predators interaction prey
functional classification
classification predators extent feed interact prey one way ecologists may wish categorize different types predation instead focusing eat system classifies predators way eat general nature interaction predator prey species two factors considered close predator prey latter two cases term prey may replaced host whether prey directly murdered predator considered true predation parasitoidism involving certain death
true predation
true predator commonly known one kills eats another living thing whereas types predator harm prey way form kills predators may hunt actively prey pursuit predation sit wait prey approach within striking distance ambush predators predators kill large prey dismember chew prior eating jaguar human others may eat usually much smaller prey whole bottlenose dolphin swallowing fish snake duck stork swallowing frog animals kill large small prey size domestic cats dogs prime examples may either depending upon circumstances either would devour large insect whole dismember rabbit predation entails venom subdues prey creature predator ingests prey killing box jellyfish disabling found behavior cone shell cases venom rattlesnakes spiders contributes digestion prey item even predator begins eating cases prey organism may die mouth digestive system predator baleen whales example eat millions microscopic plankton prey broken well entering whale seed predation egg predation forms true predation seeds eggs represent potential organisms predators classification need eat prey entirely example predators cannot digest bones others may eat part organism grazing see still consistently cause direct death
grazing
grazing organisms may also kill prey species seldom case herbivores like zooplankton live unicellular phytoplankton therefore individualized nature organism kill prey many eat small part plant grazing livestock may pull grass roots simply grazed upon allowing plant regrow kelp frequently grazed subtidal kelp forests regrows base blade continuously cope browsing pressure animals may also grazed upon female mosquitos land hosts briefly gain sufficient proteins development offspring starfish may grazed capable regenerating lost arms
parasitism
parasites times difficult distinguish grazers feeding behavior similar many ways however noted close association host species grazing species elephant may travel many kilometers single day grazing many plants process parasites form close associations hosts usually one lifetime close living arrangement may described term symbiosis living together unlike mutualism association significantly reduces fitness host parasitic organisms range macroscopic mistletoe parasitic plant microscopic internal parasites cholera species however loose associations hosts lepidoptera butterfly moth larvae may feed parasitically single plant may graze several nearby plants therefore wise treat classification system continuum rather four isolated forms
parasitoidism
parasitoids organisms living host feeding directly upon eventually leading death much like parasites close symbiotic relationship host hosts like previous two classifications parasitoid predators kill hosts instantly however unlike parasites similar true predators fate prey quite inevitably death wellknown example parasitoids ichneumon wasps solitary insects living free life adult laying eggs another species caterpillar larvae feed growing host causing little harm first soon devouring internal organs finally destroying nervous system resulting prey death stage young wasps developed sufficiently move next stage life cycle though limited mainly insect order hymenoptera diptera coleoptera parasitoids make much insect species
degree specialization
among predators large degree specialization many predators specialize hunting one species prey others opportunistic kill eat almost anything examples humans leopards dogs alligators specialists usually particularly well suited capturing preferred prey prey turn often equally suited escape predator called evolutionary arms race tends keep populations species equilibrium predators specialize certain classes prey single species switch prey varying degrees success preferred target extremely scarce may also resort scavenging herbivorous diet possible
trophic level
predators often another organisms prey likewise prey often predators though blue jays prey insects may turn prey cats snakes snakes may prey hawks one way classifying predators trophic level organisms feed autotrophs producers trophic pyramid known herbivores primary consumers feed heterotrophs animals known secondary consumers secondary consumers type carnivore also tertiary consumers eating carnivores quartary consumers eating forth fraction energy passed next level hierarchy predation must end somewhere seldom goes higher five six levels may go high three trophic levels example lion preys upon large herbivores wildebeest turn eat grasses predator top food chain one preyed upon organism called apex predator examples include orca sperm whale anaconda komodo dragon tiger lion tiger shark nile crocodile eagles owlsand even omnivorous humans grizzly bears apex predator one environment may retain position top predator introduced another habitat dog among alligators skunk presence great horned owl immune skunk spray snapping turtle among jaguars predatory species introduced area faces predators domestic cat dog insular environments become apex predator default
many organisms humans prime examples eat multiple levels food chain thus make classification problematic carnivore may eat secondary tertiary consumers prey may difficult classify similar reasons organisms showing carnivory herbivory known omnivores even herbivores giant panda may supplement diet meat scavenging carrion provides significant part diet fearsome predators carnivorous plants would difficult fit classification producing food also digesting anything may trap organisms eat detritivores parasites would also difficult classify scheme
predation competition
alternative view offered richard dawkins predation form competition genes predator prey competing body survival machine prey organism best understood context gene centered view evolution another manner predation competition connected throughout intraguild predation intraguild predators kill eat predators different species trophic level thus potential competitors
ecological role
predators may increase biodiversity communities preventing single species becoming dominant predators known keystone species may profound influence balance organisms particular ecosystem introduction removal predator changes population density drastic cascading effects equilibrium many populations ecosystem example grazers grassland may prevent single dominant species taking
elimination wolves yellowstone national park profound impacts trophic pyramid without predation herbivores began overgraze many woody browse species affecting areas plant populations addition wolves often kept animals grazing riparian areas protected beavers food sources encroached upon removal wolves direct effect beaver populations habitat became territory grazing furthermore predation keeps hydrological features creeks streams normal working order increased browsing willows conifers along blacktail creek due lack predation caused channel incision helped slow water hold soil place
adaptations behavior
act predation broken maximum four stages detection prey attack capture finally consumption relationship predator prey one typically beneficial predator detrimental prey species sometimes however predation indirect benefits prey species though individuals preyed upon benefit means applicable stage predator prey species evolutionary arms race maximize respective abilities obtain food avoid eaten interaction resulted vast array adaptations groups
one adaptation helping predators prey avoid detection camouflage form crypsis species appearance helps blend background camouflage consists color also shape pattern background upon organism seen environment eg praying mantis right resembling dead leaves organisms eg zebras stripes blend herd making difficult lions focus single target convincing camouflage likely organism go unseen
mimicry related phenomenon organism similar appearance another species one example drone fly looks lot like bee yet completely harmless cannot sting another example batesian mimicry io moth automeris io markings wings resemble owls eyes insectivorous predator disturbs moth reveals hind wings temporarily startling predator giving time escape predators may also use mimicry lure prey however female fireflies genus photuris example copy light signals species thereby attracting male fireflies captured eaten see aggressive mimicry
predator
successful predation results gain energy hunting invariably involves energetic costs well hunger issue general predators seek attack prey since costs outweigh benefits instance large predatory fish like shark well fed aquarium typically ignore smaller fish swimming around prey fish take advantage fact apex predator apparently uninterested surplus killing represents deviation type behaviour treatment consumption terms costbenefit analysis known optimal foraging theory quite successful study animal behavior general costs benefits considered energy gain per unit time though factors also important essential nutrients caloric value necessary survival health
social predation offers possibility predators kill creatures larger members species could overpower singly lions hyenas wolves dholes african wild dogs piranhas kill large herbivores single animals species usually dont dispatch social predation allows animals organize hunts creatures would easily escape single predator thus chimpanzees prey upon colobus monkeys harriss hawks cut possible escapes doomed rabbit extreme specialization roles evident hunting requires cooperation predators different species humans aid falcons dogs fishing cormorants social predation often complex behavior social creatures example domestic cats perform even without complex intelligence instinct alone ant species destroy much larger creatures
sizeselective predation involves predators preferring prey certain size large prey may prove troublesome predator small prey might prove hard find case provide less reward led correlation size predators prey size may also act refuge large prey example adult elephants general safe predation lions juveniles vulnerable
observed wellfed predator animals lax captivity instance pet farm animals usually differentiate putative prey animals familiar coinhabitants human area wild ones outside area interaction range peaceful coexistence close companionship motivation ignore predatory instinct may result mutual advantage fear reprisal human masters made clear harming coinhabitants tolerated pet cats pet mice example may live together human residence without incident companions pet cats pet dogs human mastership often depend warmth companionship even protection particularly rural areas
antipredator adaptations
antipredator adaptations evolved prey populations due selective pressures predation long periods time
aggression
predatory animals often use usual methods attacking prey inflict threaten grievous injury predators electric eel uses electric current kill prey defend animals anacondas caimans egrets jaguars mountain lions giant otters humans dogs cats ordinarily prey upon fish similar electric eel size electric eel thus remains apex predator predatorrich environment predator small enough prey others domestic cat uses formidable teeth claws weapons animals might confuse cat easier prey many nonpredatory prey animals zebra give strong kick maim kill others charge tusks horns
mobbing behavior
mobbing behavior occurs members species drive away predator cooperatively attacking harassing frequently seen birds mobbing also seen social animals example nesting gull colonies widely seen attack intruders including humans costs mobbing behavior include risk engaging predators well energy expended process aid survival members species
mobbing evolved independently many species tends present whose young frequently preyed especially birds may complement cryptic behavior offspring camouflage hiding mobbing calls may made prior engagement harassment
mobbing interspecies activity common birds respond mobbing calls different species many birds show sight mobbing watch call participate also noted species ends mobbing attack crows frequently mobbed smaller songbirds prey eggs young birds nests crows cooperate smaller birds drive away hawks larger mammalian predators occasion birds mob animals pose threat
advertising unprofitability
thomsons gazelle seeing predator approach may start run away slow stot stotting jumping air legs straight stiff white rear fully visible stotting maladaptive outrunning predators evidence suggests stotting signals unprofitable chase example cheetahs abandon hunts gazelle stots event give chase far less likely make kill
aposematism organisms brightly colored warning predators antithesis camouflage organisms pose threat predatorsfor example may poisonous able harm physically aposematic coloring involves bright easily recognizable unique colors patterns example bright coloration variable checkerspot butterflies leads decreased predation attempts avian predators upon harmed eg stung prey appearance organism remembered something avoid particular prey organism may killed coloring benefits prey species whole
domestic cats animals similar size prey species rabbits make hissing sound reminiscent snake advertising put formidable defenses size deter confrontations harmful cat animal search small animals prey
chemical defense
organisms evolved chemical weapons effective deterrents predation common insects skunk particularly dramatic mammalian example examples include bombardier beetle accurately shoot predator stream boiling poison pacific beetle cockroach sprays quinone mixture modified spiracles ornate moth acquires toxins larval food plant deter predators
terrain fear factor
terrain fear factor idea assesses risks associated predatorprey encounters idea suggests prey change usual habits adjust terrain effect species predation example species may forage terrain lower predation risk opposed one high predation risk
population dynamics
fairly clear predators tend lower survival fecundity prey higher level organization populations predator prey species also interact obvious predators depend prey survival reflected predator populations affected changes prey populations obvious however predators affect prey populations eating prey organism may simply make room another prey population approaching carrying capacity
population dynamics predatorprey interactions modelled using lotkavolterra equations provide mathematical model cycling predator prey populations predators tend select young weak ill individuals
evolution predation
predation appears become major selection pressure shortly cambrian periodaround million years agoas evidenced almost simultaneous development calcification animals algae predationavoiding burrowing however predators grazing microorganisms since least million years ago
humans predation
predators
humans omnivorous hunt trap animals using weapons tools like snares clubs spears fishing gear firearms boats motor vehicles humans even use predatory species dogs cormorants falcons hunting fishing people even enlist nonpredatory beasts like horses camels elephants getting approaches prey
humans reshaped huge expanses world ranges farms raising livestock poultry fish eaten meat however debated whether harvesting livestock fits strictly definition predation
human raising eating livestock part agriculture involves feeding caring animals followed slaughtered appropriate tool cutting cooking many cultures animals hunted farmed specialists ranchers fishermen brought marketplace sold pieces people actually consume meat
prey
lone naked human physical disadvantage comparable apex predators areas speed bone density weight physical strength humans also lack innate weaponry claws without crafted weapons society cleverness lone human easily defeated fit predatory animals wild dogs big cats bears even recorded instances lone humans preyed upon large carnivores see maneater however humans solitary creatures social animals highly developed social behaviors furthermore humans ancestors homo erectus using stone tools weapons well million years anatomically modern humans apex predators since first evolved many species carnivorous megafauna actively avoid interacting humans primary environmental competitor human humans one subspecies carnivorous megafauna interact frequently humans predatory roles domestic dog usually partner predation especially hunt together cannibalism occurred various places among various cultures various reasons least people donner party said resorted desperation
conservation
predators important consideration matters relating conservation many cases predators apex predators also endangered species lower population sizes prey species much vulnerable extinction population size competition predators fluctuations prey populations
small population size characteristic almost universally inherent apex predators humans dogs far blatant exceptions low numbers wouldnt problem apex predators abundance prey competition niche overlap scenario rarely ever encountered wild competitive exclusion principle states two species ecological niches overlap high likelihood competition species direct competition resources factor alone could lead extirpation one species compounded added factor prey abundance
predators effect prey species hard see shortterm however observed longer period time seen population predator correlationally rise fall population prey cycle similar boom bust cycle economics predator overhunts prey prey population lower numbers scarce predators find cause predator population dip decreasing predation pressure prey population decrease predators allow small number prey left slowly increase population somewhere around previous abundance allow predator population increase response greater availability resources predator hunts prey species numbers low sustain population short term cause extinction extirpation prey also extinction species phenomenon known coextinction risk wildlife conservationists encounter introducing predators prey coevolved similar predators possibility depends largely well fast prey species able adapt introduced predator one way risk avoided predator finds alternative prey species alternative prey species introduced something ecologists environmentalists try avoid whenever possible alternative prey species would help lift predation pressure initial prey species giving population chance recover however guarantee initial prey species able recover initial prey population may hunted sustainable numbers complete extinction
biological pest control
predators may put use conservation efforts control introduced species although aim situation remove introduced species entirely keeping abundance often possibility predators natural range may introduced control populations though cases little effect may even cause unforeseen problems besides use conservation biology predators also important controlling pests agriculture natural predators environmentally friendly sustainable way reducing damage crops one alternative use chemical agents pesticides
