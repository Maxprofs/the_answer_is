characteristics theories
essential criteria
defining characteristic scientific knowledge including theories ability make falsifiable testable predictions relevance specificity predictions determine potentially useful theory wouldbe theory makes observable predictions scientific theory predictions sufficiently specific tested similarly useful cases term theory applicable
body descriptions knowledge usually called theory fulfills following criteria
makes falsifiable predictions consistent accuracy across broad area scientific inquiry mechanics
wellsupported many independent strands evidence rather single foundation ensures probably good approximation completely correct
consistent preexisting experimental results least accurate predictions preexisting theories
subjected minor adaptations account new data fit perfectly discovered thus increasing predictive capability time
among parsimonious explanations economical use proposed entities explanatory steps see occams razor since generally accepted objective definition parsimony strict criterion theories much less economical others
first three criteria important theories considered scientific meet least criteria ideally true established theories special general relativity quantum mechanics plate tectonics modern evolutionary synthesis etc
definitions scientific organizations
united states national academy sciences defines scientific theories follows
formal scientific definition theory quite different everyday meaning word refers comprehensive explanation aspect nature supported vast body evidence many scientific theories well established new evidence likely alter substantially example new evidence demonstrate earth orbit around sun heliocentric theory living things made cells cell theory matter composed atoms surface earth divided solid plates moved geological timescales theory plate tectonicsone useful properties scientific theories used make predictions natural events phenomena yet observed
american association advancement science

note term theory would appropriate describing untested intricate hypotheses even scientific models
formation theories
scientific method involves proposal testing hypotheses deriving predictions hypotheses results future experiments performing experiments see whether predictions valid provides evidence either hypothesis enough experimental results gathered particular area inquiry scientists may propose explanatory framework accounts many possible explanation also tested fulfills necessary criteria see explanation becomes theory take many years difficult complicated gather sufficient evidence
criteria met widely accepted scientists see scientific consensus best available explanation least phenomena made predictions phenomena previous theories could explain could predict accurately resisted attempts falsification strength evidence evaluated scientific community important experiments replicated multiple independent groups
theories perfectly accurate scientifically useful example predictions made classical mechanics known inaccurate relatistivic realm almost exactly correct comparatively low velocities common human experience chemistry many acidbase theories providing highly divergent explanations underlying nature acidic basic compounds useful predicting chemical behavior like knowledge science theory ever completely certain since possible future experiments might conflict theorys predictions however theories supported scientific consensus highest level certainty scientific knowledge example objects subject gravity life earth evolved common ancestor
acceptance theory require major predictions tested already supported sufficiently strong evidence example certain tests may unfeasible technically difficult result theories may make predictions yet confirmed proven incorrect case predicted results may described informally term theoretical predictions tested later time incorrect may lead revision rejection theory
modification improvement theories
experimental results contrary theorys predictions observed scientists first evaluate whether experimental design sound confirm results independent replication search potential improvements theory begins solutions may require minor major changes theory none satisfactory explanation found within theorys existing framework time successive modifications build top theories consistently improve greater predictive accuracy achieved since new version theory completely new theory must predictive explanatory power last scientific knowledge consistently becomes accurate time
modifications theory explanations seem insufficient account new results new theory may required since scientific knowledge usually durable occurs much less commonly modification furthermore theory proposed accepted previous theory retained still best available explanation many phenomena verified predictive power contexts example known observed perihelion precession mercury violated newtonian mechanics theory remained best explanation available relativity supported sufficient evidence also new theories may proposed single person many cycle modifications eventually incorporates contributions many different scientists
changes accepted theory explain phenomena greater predictive power changes would adopted new explanation open replacement modification theory require modification despite repeated tests implies theory accurate also means accepted theories continue accumulate evidence time length time theory principles remains accepted often indicates strength supporting evidence
unification theories
cases two theories may replaced single theory explains previous theories approximations special cases analogous way theory unifying explanation many confirmed hypotheses referred unification theories example electricity magnetism known two aspects phenomenon referred electromagnetism
predictions different theories appear contradict also resolved either evidence unification example physical theories th century implied sun could burning long enough allow certain geological changes well evolution life resolved discovery nuclear fusion main energy source sun contradictions also explained result theories approximating fundamental noncontradictory phenomena example atomic theory approximation quantum mechanics current theories describe three separate fundamental phenomena theories approximations potential unification sometimes called theory everything
example relativity
albert einstein published principle special relativity soon became theory special relativity predictively aligned newtonian principle galilean invariance also termed galilean relativity electromagnetic field omitting special relativity luminiferous aether einstein stated time dilation length contraction expected observer measuring object relative motion inertialthat objecting exhibiting constant velocity speed direction measured observerand thereby duplicated lorentz transformation lorentz contraction inserted electrodynamic theory dynamical consequences aethers properties hypothesized resolve experimental riddles elegant special relativity yielded consequences equivalence mass energy transforming one another resolution paradox excitation electromagnetic field could viewed one reference frame electricity another magnetism
einstein sought generalize invariance principle reference frames whether inertial accelerating rejecting newtonian gravitationa central force acting instantly distanceeinstein presumed gravitational field einsteins equivalence principle inferred free fall within uniform gravitational field equivalent inertial motion extending special relativitys effects three dimensions length contraction became space contraction general relativity whose d spacetime gravitational field local alters geometrically sets local objects pathways even massless energy exerts gravitational motion local objects curving geometrical surface d spacetime yet unless vast relativistic effects energy whether speed mass vicinitywhere space contracted time slowedare negligible merely predicting motion although general relativity embraced explanatory theory via scientific realism newtons theory remains successful merely predictive theory via instrumentalism calculate trajectories engineers nasa still uses newtons equations simpler operate
theories laws
scientific laws scientific theories produced scientific method formation testing hypotheses predict behavior natural world typically wellsupported observations andor experimental evidence however scientific laws descriptive accounts nature behave certain conditions scientific theories broader scope give overarching explanations nature works exhibits certain characteristics theories supported evidence many different sources may contain one several laws
common misconception scientific theories rudimentary ideas eventually graduate scientific laws enough data evidence accumulated theory change scientific law accumulation new better evidence theory always remain theory law always remain law theory valid long evidence dispute therefore theories disproven
theories laws also distinct hypotheses unlike hypotheses theories laws may simply referred scientific fact however science theories different facts even well supported example evolution theory fact
theories
theories axioms
logical positivists thought scientific theories statements formal language mathematics example formal language logical positivists envisaged similar scientific language addition scientific theories language also included observation sentences sun rises east definitions mathematical statements phenomena explained theories could directly observed senses example atoms radio waves treated theoretical concepts view theories function axioms predicted observations derived theories much like theorems derived euclidean geometry however predictions tested reality verify theories axioms revised direct result
phrase received view theories used describe approach terms commonly associated linguistic theories components language syntactic language rules symbols strung together problems defining kind language precisely eg objects seen microscopes observed theoretical objects led effective demise logical positivism
theories models
semantic view theories identifies scientific theories models rather propositions replaced received view dominant position theory formulation philosophy science model logical framework intended represent reality model reality similar way map graphical model represents territory city country
approach theories specific category models fulfill necessary criteria see one use language describe model however theory model collection similar models description model model solar system example might consist abstract objects represent sun planets objects associated properties eg positions velocities masses model parameters eg newtons law gravitation determine positions velocities change time model tested see whether accurately predicts future observations astronomers verify positions models objects time match actual positions planets planets newtonian models predictions accurate mercury slightly inaccurate model general relativity must used instead
word semantic refers way model represents real world representation literally representation describes particular aspects phenomenon manner interaction among set phenomena instance scale model house solar system clearly actual house actual solar system aspects actual house actual solar system represented scale model certain limited ways representative actual entity scale model house house someone wants learn houses analogous scientist wants understand reality sufficiently detailed scale model may suffice
example ptolemy
example theories models seen ptolemys theory planetary system model earth center planets sun made circular orbits around earth stars fixed sphere centered earth beyond planetary orbits retrograde motion planets explained smaller circular orbits individual planets based model mathematical calculations could made predicted planetary positions great degree accuracy model planetary system survived years time copernicus
illustrates theory explain certain scientific facts yet satisfactory picture reality another acceptable theory later replace previous model example ptolemaic theory contained numerous ad hoc assumptions copernican theory simple parsimonious also accurate
differences theory model
several commentators stated distinguishing characteristic theories explanatory well descriptive models descriptive although still predictive limited sense philosopher stephen pepper also distinguished theories models said general models theories predicated root metaphor constrains scientists theorize model phenomenon thus arrive testable hypotheses
engineering practice makes distinction mathematical models physical models cost fabricating physical model minimized first creating mathematical model using computer software package computer aided design tool component parts modelled fabrication tolerances specified exploded view drawing used lay fabrication sequence simulation packages displaying subassemblies allow parts rotated magnified realistic detail software packages creating bill materials construction allows subcontractors specialize assembly processes spreads cost manufacturing machinery among multiple customers see computeraided engineering computeraided manufacturing d printing
assumptions formulating theories
assumption axiom statement accepted without evidence example assumptions used premises logical argument isaac asimov described assumptions follows
incorrect speak assumption either true false since way proving either would longer assumption better consider assumptions either useful useless depending whether deductions made corresponded realitysince must start somewhere must assumptions least let us assumptions possible
certain assumptions necessary empirical claims eg assumption reality exists however theories generally make assumptions conventional sense statements accepted without evidence assumptions often incorporated formation new theories either supported evidence previously existing theories evidence produced course validating theory may simple observing theory makes accurate predictions evidence assumptions made outset correct approximately correct conditions tested
conventional assumptions without evidence may used theory intended apply assumption valid approximately valid example special theory relativity assumes inertial frame reference theory makes accurate predictions assumption valid make accurate predictions assumption valid assumptions often point older theories succeeded new ones general theory relativity works noninertial reference frames well

descriptions theories
philosophers science
karl popper described characteristics scientific theory follows
easy obtain confirmations verifications nearly every theoryif look confirmations
confirmations count result risky predictions say unenlightened theory question expected event incompatible theoryan event would refuted theory
every good scientific theory prohibition forbids certain things happen theory forbids better
theory refutable conceivable event nonscientific irrefutability virtue theory people often think vice
every genuine test theory attempt falsify refute testability falsifiability degrees testability theories testable exposed refutation others take greater risks
confirming evidence count except result genuine test theory means presented serious unsuccessful attempt falsify theory speak cases corroborating evidence
genuinely testable theories found false still upheld admirersfor example introducing ad hoc auxiliary assumption reinterpreting theory ad hoc way escapes refutation procedure always possible rescues theory refutation price destroying least lowering scientific status
popper summarized statements saying central criterion scientific status theory falsifiability refutability testability echoing stephen hawking states theory good theory satisfies two requirements must accurately describe large class observations basis model contains arbitrary elements must make definite predictions results future observations also discusses unprovable falsifiable nature theories necessary consequence inductive logic disprove theory finding even single observation disagrees predictions theory
several philosophers historians science however argued poppers definition theory set falsifiable statements wrong philip kitcher pointed one took strictly popperian view theory observations uranus first discovered would falsified newtons celestial mechanics rather people suggested another planet influenced uranus orbitand prediction indeed eventually confirmed
kitcher agrees popper surely something right idea science succeed fail also says scientific theories include statements cannot falsified good theories must also creative insists view scientific theories elaborate collection statements falsifiable othersthose calls auxiliary hypotheses
according kitcher good scientific theories must three features
unity science unified good theories consist one problemsolving strategy small family problemsolving strategies applied wide range problems
fecundity great scientific theory like newtons opens new areas research theory presents new way looking world lead us ask new questions embark new fruitful lines inquiry typically flourishing science incomplete time raises questions currently answer incompleteness vice contrary incompleteness mother fecundity good theory productive raise new questions presume questions answered without giving problemsolving strategies
auxiliary hypotheses independently testable auxiliary hypothesis ought testable independently particular problem introduced solve independently theory designed save example evidence existence neptune independent anomalies uranuss orbit
like definitions theories including poppers kitcher makes clear theory must include statements observational consequences like observation irregularities orbit uranus falsification one possible consequence observation production new hypotheses another possible equally important result
analogies metaphors theory
concept scientific theory also described using analogies metaphors instance logical empiricist carl gustav hempel likened structure scientific theory complex spatial network
terms represented knots threads connecting latter correspond part definitions part fundamental derivative hypotheses included theory whole system floats plane observation anchored rules interpretation might viewed strings part network link certain points latter specific places plane observation virtue interpretive connections network function scientific theory certain observational data may ascend via interpretive string point theoretical network thence proceed via definitions hypotheses points another interpretive string permits descent plane observation
michael polanyi made analogy theory map
theory something may set paper system rules truly theory completely put terms mathematical theory reaches highest perfection respect even geographical map fully embodies set strict rules finding ones way region otherwise uncharted experience indeed theory may regarded kind map extended space time
scientific theory also thought book captures fundamental information world book must researched written shared galileo galilei wrote
philosophy ie physics written grand book mean universe stands continually open gaze cannot understood unless one first learns comprehend language interpret characters written written language mathematics characters triangles circles geometrical figures without humanly impossible understand single word without one wandering around dark labyrinth
book metaphor could also applied following passage contemporary philosopher science ian hacking
prefer argentine fantasy god write book nature sort old europeans imagined wrote borgesian library book brief possible yet book inconsistent every book redundant every book humanly accessible bit nature book makes possible comprehension prediction influencing going onleibniz said god chose world maximized variety phenomena choosing simplest laws exactly best way maximize phenomena simplest laws laws inconsistent applying none applying
