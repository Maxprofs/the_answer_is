halflife used describe quantity undergoing exponential decay constant lifetime decaying quantity characteristic unit exponential decay equation term halflife may generically used refer period time quantity falls half even decay exponential table right shows reduction quantity number halflives elapsed general introduction description exponential decay see exponential decay general introduction description nonexponential decay see rate law converse halflife doubling time
probabilistic nature halflifeedit
halflife usually describes decay discrete entities radioactive atoms case work use definition halflife time required exactly half entities decay example radioactive atoms halflife one second atoms left one second
instead halflife defined terms probability halflife time required exactly half entities decay average words probability radioactive atom decaying within halflife
example image right simulation many identical atoms undergoing radioactive decay note one halflife exactly onehalf atoms remaining approximately random variation process nevertheless many identical atoms decaying right boxes law large numbers suggests good approximation say half atoms remain one halflife
various simple exercises demonstrate probabilistic decay example involving flipping coins running statistical computer program
formulas halflife exponential decayedit
exponential decay process described following three equivalent formulas
n initial quantity substance decay quantity may measured grams moles number atoms etc
nt quantity still remains yet decayed time
halflife decaying quantity
positive number called mean lifetime decaying quantity
positive number called decay constant decaying quantity
three parameters directly related following way
ln natural logarithm approximately
plugging manipulating relationships get following equivalent descriptions exponential decay terms halflife
regardless written plug formula get
expected definition initial quantity
expected definition halflife
ie amount approaches zero approaches infinity expected longer wait less remains
decay two processesedit
quantities decay two exponentialdecay processes simultaneously case actual halflife related halflives quantity would decay processes acted isolation
three processes analogous formula
proof formulas see exponential decaydecay two processes
examplesedit
halflife describing exponentialdecay process example
current flowing rc circuit rl circuit decays halflife respectively example term half time might used instead half life mean thing
firstorder chemical reaction halflife reactant reaction rate constant
radioactive decay halflife length time chance atom undergone nuclear decay varies depending atom type isotope usually determined experimentally see list nuclides
half life species time takes concentration substance fall half initial value
halflife nonexponential decayedit
decay many physical quantities exponentialfor example evaporation water puddle often chemical reaction molecule cases halflife defined way time elapsed half original quantity decayed however unlike exponential decay halflife depends initial quantity prospective halflife change time quantity decays
example radioactive decay carbon exponential halflife years quantity carbon decay half original amount average years regardless big small original quantity another years onequarter original remain hand time take puddle halfevaporate depends deep puddle perhaps puddle certain size evaporate half original volume one day second day reason expect onequarter puddle remain fact probably much less example halflife reduces time goes nonexponential decays increase instead
