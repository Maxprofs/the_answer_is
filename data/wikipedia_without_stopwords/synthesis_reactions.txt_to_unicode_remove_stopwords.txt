chemistry chemical synthesis purposeful execution chemical reactions obtain product several products happens physical chemical manipulations usually involving one reactions modern laboratory usage tends imply process reproducible reliable established work multiple laboratories
chemical synthesis begins selection compounds known reagents reactants various reaction types applied synthesize product intermediate product requires mixing compounds reaction vessel chemical reactor simple roundbottom flask many reactions require form workup procedure final product isolated
amount product chemical synthesis reaction yield typically chemical yields expressed weight grams laboratory setting percentage total theoretical quantity product could produced side reaction unwanted chemical reaction taking place diminishes yield desired product
word synthesis present day meaning first used chemist hermann kolbe
strategies
many strategies exist chemical synthesis go beyond converting reactant reaction product b single step multistep synthesis chemical compound synthesised though series individual chemical reactions workup example laboratory synthesis paracetamol consist three individual synthetic steps cascade reactions multiple chemical transformations take place within single reactant multicomponent reactions different reactants form single reaction product telescopic synthesis one reactant goes multiple transformations without isolation intermediates
organic synthesis
organic synthesis special branch chemical synthesis dealing synthesis organic compounds total synthesis complex product may take multiple steps synthesize product interest inordinate amounts time skill organic synthesis prized among chemists synthesis exceptionally valuable difficult compounds won chemists robert burns woodward nobel prize chemistry chemical synthesis starts basic laboratory compounds yields something new purely synthetic process starts product isolated plants animals proceeds new compounds synthesis described semisynthetic process
