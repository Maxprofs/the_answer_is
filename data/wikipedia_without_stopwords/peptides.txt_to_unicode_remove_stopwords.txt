peptides gr digested derived digest biologically occurring short chains amino acid monomers linked peptide amide bonds
covalent chemical bonds formed carboxyl group one amino acid reacts amino group another shortest peptides dipeptides consisting amino acids joined single peptide bond followed tripeptides tetrapeptides etc polypeptide long continuous unbranched peptide chain hence peptides fall broad chemical classes biological oligomers polymers alongside nucleic acids oligosaccharides polysaccharides etc
peptides distinguished proteins basis size arbitrary benchmark understood contain approximately fewer amino acids proteins consist one polypeptides arranged biologically functional way often bound ligands coenzymes cofactors another protein macromolecule dna rna etc complex macromolecular assemblies finally aspects lab techniques applied peptides versus polypeptides proteins differ eg specifics electrophoresis chromatography etc size boundaries distinguish peptides polypeptides proteins absolute long peptides amyloid beta referred proteins smaller proteins like insulin considered peptides
amino acids incorporated peptides termed residues due release either hydrogen ion amine end hydroxyl ion carboxyl end water molecule released formation amide bond peptides except cyclic peptides nterminal cterminal residue end peptide shown tetrapeptide image
peptide classesedit
peptides divided several classes depending produced
milk peptides
two naturally occurring milk peptides formed milk protein casein digestive enzymes break also arise proteinases formed lactobacilli fermentation milk
ribosomal peptides
ribosomal peptides synthesized translation mrna often subjected proteolysis generate mature form function typically higher organisms hormones signaling molecules organisms produce peptides antibiotics microcins since translated amino acid residues involved restricted utilized ribosome
however peptides frequently posttranslational modifications phosphorylation hydroxylation sulfonation palmitoylation glycosylation disulfide formation general linear although lariat structures observed exotic manipulations occur racemization lamino acids damino acids platypus venom
nonribosomal peptides
nonribosomal peptides assembled enzymes specific peptide rather ribosome common nonribosomal peptide glutathione component antioxidant defenses aerobic organisms nonribosomal peptides common unicellular organisms plants fungi synthesized modular enzyme complexes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases
complexes often laid similar fashion contain many different modules perform diverse set chemical manipulations developing product peptides often cyclic highly complex cyclic structures although linear nonribosomal peptides also common since system closely related machinery building fatty acids polyketides hybrid compounds often found presence oxazoles thiazoles often indicates compound synthesized fashion
peptones
see also tryptone
peptones derived animal milk meat digested proteolysis addition containing small peptides resulting spraydried material includes fats metals salts vitamins many biological compounds peptones used nutrient media growing bacteria fungi
peptide fragments
peptide fragments refer fragments proteins used identify quantify source protein often products enzymatic degradation performed laboratory controlled sample also forensic paleontological samples degraded natural effects

peptides molecular biologyedit
peptides received prominence molecular biology several reasons first peptides allow creation peptide antibodies animals without need purifying protein interest involves synthesizing antigenic peptides sections protein interest used make antibodies rabbit mouse protein
another reason peptides become instrumental mass spectrometry allowing identification proteins interest based peptide masses sequence case peptides often generated ingel digestion electrophoretic separation proteins
peptides recently used study protein structure function example synthetic peptides used probes see proteinpeptide interactions occur see page protein tags
inhibitory peptides also used clinical research examine effects peptides inhibition cancer proteins diseases example one promising application peptides target lhrh particular peptides act agonist meaning bind cell way regulates lhrh receptors process inhibiting cell receptors suggests peptides could beneficial treating prostate cancer however additional investigations experiments required cancerfighting attributes exhibited peptides considered definitive
