gross value added (gva) is the measure of the value of goods and services produced in an area industry or sector of an economy in economics in national accounts gva is output minus intermediate consumption it is a balancing item of the national accounts production account
== relationship to gross domestic productedit ==
gva is linked as a measurement to gross domestic product (gdp) as both are measures of output the relationship is defined as
gva + taxes on products - subsidies on products = gdp
as the total aggregates of taxes on products and subsidies on products are only available at whole economy level gross value added is used for measuring gross regional domestic product and other measures of the output of entities smaller than a whole economy restated
gva = gdp + subsidies - (direct sales) taxes
over-simplistically gva is the grand total of all revenues from final sales and (net) subsidies which are incomes into businesses those incomes are then used to cover expenses (wages & salaries dividends) savings (profits depreciation) and (indirect) taxes
