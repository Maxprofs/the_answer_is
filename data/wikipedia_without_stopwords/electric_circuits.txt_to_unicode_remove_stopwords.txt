equivalently

principle conservation energy implies
directed sum electrical potential differences voltage around closed network zero
simply sum emfs closed loop equivalent sum potential drops loop
algebraic sum products resistances conductors currents closed loop equal total emf available loop
similarly kcl stated
n total number voltages measured voltages may also complex
law based conservation energy whereby voltage defined energy per unit charge total amount energy gained per unit charge must equal amount energy lost per unit charge energy charge conserved

kcl kvl depend lumped element model applicable circuit question model applicable laws apply
kcl usual form dependent assumption current flows conductors whenever current flows one end conductor immediately flows end safe assumption highfrequency ac circuits lumped element model longer applicable often possible improve applicability kcl considering parasitic capacitances distributed along conductors significant violations kcl occur even hz high frequency
words kcl valid total electric charge remains constant region considered practical cases always kcl applied geometric point investigating finite region however possible charge density within region may change since charge conserved come flow charge across region boundary flow represents net current kcl violated
kvl based assumption fluctuating magnetic field linking closed loop safe assumption highfrequency shortwavelength ac circuits presence changing magnetic field electric field conservative vector field therefore electric field cannot gradient potential say line integral electric field around loop zero directly contradicting kvl
often possible improve applicability kvl considering parasitic inductances including mutual inductances distributed along conductors treated imaginary circuit elements produce voltage drop equal rateofchange flux
