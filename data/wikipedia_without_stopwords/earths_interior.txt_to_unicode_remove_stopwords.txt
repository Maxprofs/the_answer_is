mass
force exerted earths gravity used calculate mass estimating volume earth average density calculated astronomers also calculate earths mass orbit effects nearby planetary bodies
structure

layering earth inferred indirectly using time travel refracted reflected seismic waves created earthquakes core allow shear waves pass speed travel seismic velocity different layers changes seismic velocity different layers causes refraction owing snells law like light bending passes prism likewise reflections caused large increase seismic velocity similar light reflecting mirror
core
average density earth kgm since average density surface material around kgm must conclude denser materials exist within earths core seismic measurements show core divided two parts solid inner core radius km liquid outer core extending beyond radius km densities kgm outer core kgm inner core
inner core discovered inge lehmann generally believed composed primarily iron nickel necessarily solid able deflect seismic waves must behave solid fashion experimental evidence times critical crystal models core experimental studies show discrepancy high pressure diamond anvil static studies core pressures yield melting temperatures approximately k shock laser dynamic studies laser studies create plasma results suggestive constraining inner core conditions depend whether inner core solid plasma density solid area active research
early stages earths formation four half billion years ago melting would caused denser substances sink toward center process called planetary differentiation see also iron catastrophe lessdense materials would migrated crust core thus believed largely composed iron along nickel one light elements whereas dense elements lead uranium either rare significant tend bind lighter elements thus remain crust see felsic materials argued inner core may form single iron crystal

liquid outer core surrounds inner core believed composed iron mixed nickel trace amounts lighter elements
recent speculation suggests innermost part core enriched gold platinum siderophile elements

recent evidence suggested inner core earth may rotate slightly faster rest planet however recent studies found hypothesis inconclusive options remain core may oscillatory nature chaotic system august team geophysicists announced journal science according estimates earths inner core rotates approximately degrees per year faster relative rotation surface
