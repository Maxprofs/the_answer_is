denslow may have met baum at the chicago press club where both men were members besides the wonderful wizard of oz denslow also illustrated baum's books by the candelabra's glare father goose his book and dot and tot of merryland baum and denslow held the copyrights to most of these works jointly
after denslow quarreled with baum over royalty shares from the 1902 stage adaptation of the wizard of oz for which baum wrote the script and denslow designed the sets and costumes baum determined not to work with him again (as co-copyright-holder denslow demanded an equal share in royalties with baum and composer paul tietjens.) denslow illustrated an edition of traditional nursery rhymes titled denslow's mother goose (1901) along with denslow's night before christmas (1902) and the 18-volume denslow's picture books series (190304) he also used his copyright to the art of the baum books to create newspaper comic strips featuring father goose and the scarecrow and tin woodman during the first decade of the twentieth century he also created the comic strip billy bounce notable as one of the earliest comic strips in which the protagonist has some manner of super powers
the royalties from the print and stage versions of the wizard of oz were sufficient to allow denslow to purchase bluck's island bermuda and crown himself king denslow i
denslow wrote and illustrated a children's book called the pearl and the pumpkin

== later oz illustrations ==
john r neill illustrated the rest of baum's additions to the oz series he made many changes in the appearance of the characters not all at once following baum's death neill continued to illustrate the 19 oz books written by ruth plumly thompson and upon her retirement wrote and illustrated three of his own additions to the series he was succeeded by frank kramer in 1946 and 1949 for two additions to the series by jack snow dirk gringuis illustrated the next addition to the series by rachel cosgrove in 1951 the final addition to the original series was illustrated by dick martin for eloise jarvis mcgraw and lauren lynn mcgraw in 1963
in 1944 artist evelyn copelman became the next illustrator when she illustrated the 1944 bobbs-merrill edition of the wizard of oz although the book credit for the new illustrations reads adapted from the famous pictures by w.w denslow copelman's versions of the characters were largely based on the way they looked in the 1939 mgm technicolor film version although the cowardly lion looked quite different and dorothy had braids rather than long pigtails as judy garland did in the film
copelman's illustrations of the oz characters were much darker more realistic and less cartoon-like than those of her predecessors they were reprinted in 1956 in the edition of the wizard of oz published by grosset & dunlap as part of a series labeled the illustrated junior library 1956 was also the year that the mgm film came to television (see the wizard of oz on television)
this edition of the book was popular throughout the 1960s as showings of the wizard of oz on television gained an ever larger following the illustrated junior library edition of the wizard is still in print today though with a cover illustration by a different artist
in the 1990s donald abbott released several new oz books with illustrations that returned to the denslow style for the first time in nearly a century abbot's denslow-inspired books are how the wizard came to oz (1991) the magic chest of oz (1993) father goose in oz (1994) and the amber flute of oz (1998)
