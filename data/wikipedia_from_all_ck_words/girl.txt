=== usage for adults ===
the word girl is sometimes used to refer to an adult female usually a younger one this usage may be considered derogatory or disrespectful in professional or other formal contexts just as the term boy can be considered disparaging when applied to an adult man hence this usage is often deprecative it can also be used deprecatively when used to discriminate against children ("you're just a girl")
in casual context the word has positive uses as evidenced by its use in titles of popular music it has been used playfully for people acting in an energetic fashion (canadian singer nelly furtado's promiscuous girl") or as a way of unifying women of all ages on the basis of their once having been girls (american country singer martina mcbride's this one's for the girls") these positive uses mean gender rather than age

=== girls education ===
in ancient egypt the princess neferure grew up under the reign of her mother the woman pharaoh hatshepsut who had inherited the throne after the death of her husband thutmose ii women in ancient egypt had a relatively high status in society and as the daughter of the pharaoh neferura was provided with the best education possible her tutors were the most trusted advisors of her mother she grew up to take on an important role by taking on the duties of a queen while her mother was pharaoh despite the fact that women and men had a great deal of equality in ancient egypt there were still important divisions in gender roles men worked as scribes for the government for example whereas women would often work at occupations tied to the home such as farming baking bread and brewing beer however a large number of women particularly from the upper classes worked in business and traded at markets as perfumers and some women also worked in temples for this reason girls and boys education differed boys could attend formal schools to learn how to read write and do math while girls would be educated at home to learn the occupations of their mothers some women did become literate and were scholars however such as hypatia
girls formal education has traditionally been considered far less important than that of boys in europe exceptions were rare before the printing press and the reformation made literacy more widespread one notable exception to the general neglect of girls literacy is queen elizabeth i in her case as a child she was in a precarious position as a possible heir to the throne and her life was in fact endangered by the political scheming of other powerful members of the court following the execution of her mother anne boleyn elizabeth was considered illegitimate her education was for the most part ignored by henry viii remarkably henry viii's widow catherine parr took an interest in the high intelligence of elizabeth and supported the decision to provide her with an impressive education after henry's death starting when elizabeth was 9 elizabeth received an education equal to that of a prominent male aristocrat she was educated in latin greek spanish french philosophy history mathematics and music england reaped the reward of her rich education when circumstances resulted in her becoming a capable monarch
by the 18th century europeans recognized the value of literacy and schools were opened to educate the public in growing numbers education in the age of enlightenment in france led to up to a third of women becoming literate by the time of the french revolution contrasting with roughly half of men by that time however education was still not considered as important for girls as for boys who were being trained for professions that remained closed to women and girls were not admitted to secondary level schools in france until the late 19th century girls were not entitled to receive a baccalaureate diploma in france until the reforms of 1924 under education minister lon brard schools were segregated in france until the end of world war ii since then compulsory education laws have raised the education of girls and young women throughout europe

=== preparing girls for marriage ===
in many ancient societies girls upbringing had much to do with preparing them to be future wives in many cultures it was not the norm for women to be economically independent thus where a girl's future well-being depended upon marrying her to a man who was economically self-sufficient it was crucial to prepare her to meet whatever qualities or skills were popularly expected of wives
in cultures ranging from ancient greece to the 19th-century united states girls have been taught such essential domestic skills as sewing cooking gardening and basic hygiene and medical care such as preparing balms and salves and in some cases midwife skills these skills would be taught from generation to generation with the knowledge passed down orally from mother to daughter a well-known reference to these important women's skills is in the folk tale rumpelstiltskin which dates back to medieval germany and was collected in written form by the folklorists the brothers grimm the miller's daughter is valued as a potential wife because of her reputation for being able to spin straw into gold
in some parts of china beginning in the southern tang kingdom in nanjing (937-975) the custom of foot binding was associated with upper class women who were worthy of a life of leisure and husbands who could afford to spare them the necessity of work (which would require the ability to be mobile and spend the day on their feet) because of this belief parents hoping to ensure a good marriage for their daughters would begin binding their feet from about the age of seven years old to achieve the ideal appearance the tinier the feet the better the social rank of a future husband this practice did not end until the early years of the 20th century
china has had many customs tied to girls and their roles as future wives and mothers according to one custom a girl's way of wearing her hair would indicate her marital status an unmarried girl would wear her hair in two pigtails and once married she would wear her hair in one

in india by 2011 there were 91 girls younger than 6 for every 100 boys its 2011 census showed that the ratio of girls to boys under the age of 6 years old has dropped even during the past decade from 927 girls for every 1000 boys in 2001 to 918 girls for every 1000 boys in 2011 in china scholars report 794 baby girls for every 1000 baby boys in rural regions in azerbaijan last 20 years of birth data suggests 862 girls were born for every 1000 boys on average every year steven mosher president of the population research institute in washington d.c has said twenty-five million men in china currently cant find brides because there is a shortage of women [...] young men emigrate overseas to find brides. the gender imbalance in these regions is also blamed for spurring growth in the commercial sex trade the un's 2005 report states that up to 800,000 people being trafficked across borders each year and as many as 80 percent are women and girls
scholars are unclear and in dispute as to possible causes for variations in human sex ratios at birth deviations in sex ratio at birth can occur for natural causes for example in 2012 liechtenstein reported a sex ratio of 1.26 at birth (or 794 girls for every 1,000 boys)
== biology ==
girls develop female characteristics by inheriting two x chromosomes (xx) one from each parent
about one in a thousand girls have a 47,xxx karyotype and one in 2500 have a 45,x one

girls bodies undergo gradual changes during puberty puberty is the process of physical changes by which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction to enable fertilisation it is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads in response to the signals the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth function and transformation of the brain bones muscle blood skin hair breasts and sexual organs physical growthheight and weightaccelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when the child has developed an adult body until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the genitalia the penis and the vagina puberty is a process that usually takes place between the ages 1016 but these ages differ from girl to girl the major landmark of girls puberty is menarche the onset of menstruation which occurs on average between ages 1213
=== gender and environment ===
biological sex interacts with environment in ways not fully understood identical twin girls separated at birth and reunited decades later have shown both startling similarities and differences in 2005 kim wallen of emory university noted i think the nature versus nurture question is not meaningful because it treats them as independent factors whereas in fact everything is nature and nurture. wallen said gender differences emerge very early and come about through an underlying preference males and females have for their chosen activities
== girls education ==
girls equal access to education has been achieved in some countries but there are significant disparities in the majority there are gaps in access between different regions and countries and even within countries girls account for 60 per cent of children out of school in arab countries and 66 per cent of non-attendees in south and west asia however more girls than boys attend schools in many countries in latin america the caribbean north america and western europe research has measured the economic cost of this inequality to developing countries plan internationals analysis shows that a total of 65 low middle income and transition countries fail to offer girls the same secondary school opportunities as boys and in total these countries are missing out on annual economic growth of an estimated $92 billion
although the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights has asserted primary education shall be compulsory and available free to all girls are slightly less likely to be enrolled as students in primary and secondary schools (70%:74% and 59%:65%) worldwide efforts have been made to end this disparity (such as through the millennium development goals) and the gap has closed since 1990
=== educational environment and expectations ===
according to kim wallen expectations will nonetheless play a role in how girls perform academically for example if females skilled in math are told a test is gender neutral they achieve high scores but if they are told males outperformed females in the past the females will do much worse whats strange is, wallen observed according to the research all one apparently has to do is tell a woman who has a lifetime of socialization of being poor in math that a math test is gender neutral and all effects of that socialization go away. author judith harris has said that aside from their genetic contribution the nurturing provided by parents likely has less long-term influence over their offspring than other environmental aspects such as the children's peer group
in england studies by the national literacy trust have shown girls score consistently higher than boys in all scholastic areas from the ages of 7 through 16 with the most striking differences noted in reading and writing skills in the united states historically girls lagged on standardized tests in 1996 the average score of 503 for us girls from all races on the sat verbal test was 4 points lower than boys in math the average for girls was 492 which was 35 points lower than boys when girls take the exact same courses, commented wayne camara a research scientist with the college board that 35-point gap dissipates quite a bit. at the time leslie r wolfe president of the center for women policy studies said girls scored differently on the math tests because they tend to work the problems out while boys use test-taking tricks such as immediately checking the answers already given in multiple-choice questions wolfe said girls are steady and thorough while boys play this test like a pin-ball machine. wolfe also said although girls had lower sat scores they consistently get higher grades than boys across all courses in their first year in college by 2006 girls were outscoring boys on the verbal portion of the united states nationwide sat exam by 11 points a 2005 university of chicago study showed that a majority presence of girls in the classroom tends to enhance the academic performance of boys
