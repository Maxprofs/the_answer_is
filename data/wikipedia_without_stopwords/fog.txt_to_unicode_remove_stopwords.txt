fog complex atmospheric phenomenon visible mass consisting cloud water droplets ice crystals suspended air near earths surface fog considered type lowlying cloud heavily influenced nearby bodies water topography wind conditions even human activities turn fog affected many human activities shipping transport warfare culture
definition
term fog typically distinguished generic term cloud fog lowlying moisture fog often generated locally nearby body water like lake ocean nearby moist ground marshes
definition fog reduces visibility less kilometre mi whereas mist causes lesser impairment visibility
aviation purposes uk visibility less kilometres mi greater metres ft considered mist relative humidity greater haze reported
formation
fog forms difference air temperature dew point generally less c f
fog begins form water vapor condenses tiny liquid water droplets suspended air main ways water vapor added air wind convergence areas upward motion precipitation virga falling daytime heating evaporating water surface oceans water bodies wet land transpiration plants cool dry air moving warmer water lifting air mountains water vapor normally begins condense condensation nuclei dust ice salt order form clouds fog like elevated cousin stratus stable cloud deck tends form cool stable air mass trapped underneath warm air mass
fog normally occurs relative humidity near occurs either added moisture air falling ambient air temperature however fog form lower humidities fog sometimes fail form relative humidity reading relative humidity means air hold additional moisture air become supersaturated additional moisture added
fog form suddenly dissipate rapidly sudden formation fog known flash fog
fog commonly produces precipitation form drizzle light snow drizzle occurs humidity fog attains minute cloud droplets begin coalesce larger droplets occur fog layer lifted cooled sufficiently forcibly compressed descending air drizzle becomes freezing drizzle temperature surface drops freezing point
thickness fog layer largely determined altitude inversion boundary coastal oceanic locales also top marine layer airmass warmer drier inversion boundary varies altitude primarily response weight air measured terms atmospheric pressure marine layer fogbank may contain squashed pressure high conversely may expand upwards pressure lowering
visibility effects
depending concentration droplets visibility fog range appearance haze almost zero visibility many lives lost year worldwide accidents involving fog conditions highways including multiplevehicle collisions
aviation travel industry affected severity fog conditions even though modern autolanding computers put aircraft without aid pilot manning airport control tower must able see aircraft sitting runway awaiting takeoff thus extreme fog conditions safe landings impossible airports closed fog conditions improve
solution landing returning military aircraft developed second world war called fido fog investigation dispersal operation involved burning enormous amounts fuel alongside runways evaporate fog allow returning fighter bomber pilots sufficient visual aid see enough runway safely land aircraft high energy demands method limit use routine operations
shadows
shadows cast fog three dimensions fog dense enough illuminated light passes gaps structure tree thin enough let large quantity light pass illuminate points result object shadows appear beams oriented direction parallel light source voluminous shadows due cause crepuscular rays shadows clouds case shadows solid objects
sound propagation acoustic effects
sound typically travels fastest farthest solids liquids gases atmosphere distance water molecules temperature reasons sound affected fog condition
molecule effect though fog essentially water molecules barely touching high pitched sounds high frequency turn means short wavelength velocity f means transmit high frequency wave lots air moved back forth quickly consequently actually loss damping effect high pitched sounds wouldnt travel far might refracted separated water molecules make consistency fog contrast low pitched notes low frequency big wavelength moving air less fast less often losses reduced therefore lowpitched notes less affected fog also travel thus low pitched tone foghorn
temperature effect fog occurs temperature inversion cold air pooled surface helping create fog warmer air sits aloft reversed boundary cold air warm air able reflect sound waves back toward ground allowing sound would normally radiate escaping higher atmosphere bounce back travel near surface hence temperature inversion increases distance lower frequency sounds travel reflecting sound ground inversion layer
types
fog form number ways depending cooling caused condensation occurred
radiation fog formed cooling land sunset thermal radiation calm conditions clear sky cool ground produces condensation nearby air heat conduction perfect calm fog layer less meter deep turbulence promote thicker layer radiation fogs occur night usually last long sunrise persist day winter months especially areas bounded high ground vale york england radiation fog common autumn early winter examples phenomenon include tule fog
ground fog fog obscures less sky extend base overhead clouds however term usually synonym radiation fog shallow cases depth fog order tens centimetres certain kinds terrain absence wind
advection fog occurs moist air passes cool surface advection wind cooled common warm front passes area significant snowpack common sea moist air encounters cooler waters including areas cold water upwelling along california coast see san francisco fog
advection fog along california coastline propelled onto land one several processes cold front push marine layer coastward occurrence typical spring late fall summer months low pressure trough produced intense heating inland creates strong pressure gradient drawing dense marine layer also summer strong high pressure aloft desert southwest usually connection summer monsoon produces south southeasterly flow drive offshore marine layer coastline phenomenon known southerly surge typically following coastal heat spell however monsoonal flow sufficiently turbulent might instead break marine layer fog may contain moderate turbulence typically transform fog bank lifting breaking shallow convective clouds called stratocumulus
evaporation fog steam fog forms bodies water overlain much colder air situation also lead steam devils forming lake effect fog type sometimes combination causes like radiation fog tends differ advective fog formed land like lakeeffect snow convective phenomenon resulting fog quite bit denser deeper looks fluffy fog stratiform steam devils look like dust counterparts often seen situation
ice fog forms low temperatures result mechanisms mentioned even exhalation moist warm air herds animals associated diamond dust form precipitation small crystals ice form slowly fall often blue sky case mamy types haloes results refraction sunlight airborne crystals
freezing fog deposits rime composed droplets supercooled water freezes surfaces contact
precipitation fog frontal fog forms precipitation falls drier air cloud liquid droplets evaporate water vapor water vapor cools dewpoint condenses fog forms
hail fog sometimes occurs vicinity significant hail accumulations due decreased temperature increased moisture leading saturation shallow layer near surface often occurs warm humid layer atop hail wind light ground fog tends localized extremely dense abrupt may form shortly hail falls hail time cool air absorbs heat melting evaporating
upslope fog forms moist air going slope mountain hill condenses fog account adiabatic cooling lesser extent drop pressure altitude
freezing conditions
freezing fog occurs liquid fog droplets freeze surfaces forming white soft hard rime common mountain tops exposed low clouds equivalent freezing rain essentially ice forms inside freezer frostless frostfree type term freezing fog may also refer fog water vapor supercooled filling air small ice crystals similar light snow seems make fog tangible one could grab handful
western united states freezing fog may referred pogonip occurs commonly cold winter spells usually deep mountain valleys word pogonip derived shoshone word painappih means cloud old farmers almanac calendar december phrase beware pogonip regularly appears anthology smoke bellew jack london described pogonip surrounded main characters killing one
phenomenon also extremely common inland areas pacific northwest temperatures f c range columbia plateau experiences phenomenon years due temperature inversions sometimes lasting long three weeks fog typically begins forming around area columbia river expands sometimes covering land distances far away lapine oregon almost miles km due south river south central washington
frozen fog also known ice fog kind fog droplets frozen extremely tiny crystals ice midair generally requires temperatures c f making common near arctic antarctic regions often seen urban areas created freezing water vapor present automobile exhaust combustion products heating power generation urban ice fog become extremely dense persist day night temperature rises extremely small amounts ice fog falling sky form type precipitation called ice crystals often reported barrow alaska ice fog often leads visual phenomenon light pillars
topographical influences
upslope fog hill fog forms winds blow air slope called orographic lift adiabatically cooling rises causing moisture condense often causes freezing fog mountaintops cloud ceiling would otherwise low enough
valley fog forms mountain valleys often winter essentially radiation fog confined local topography last several days calm conditions californias central valley valley fog often referred tule fog
sea coastal fog
sea fog also known haar fret heavily influenced presence sea spray microscopic airborne salt crystals clouds types require minute hygroscopic particles upon water vapor condense ocean surface common particles salt salt spray produced breaking waves except areas storminess common areas breaking waves located near coastlines hence greatest densities airborne salt particles
condensation salt particles observed occur humidities low thus fog occur even relatively dry air suitable locations california coast typically lower humidity fog preceded transparent mistiness along coastline condensation competes evaporation phenomenon typically noticeable beachgoers afternoon another recently discovered source condensation nuclei coastal fog kelp seaweed researchers found stress intense sunlight strong evaporation etc kelp releases particles iodine turn become nuclei condensation water vapor causing fog diffuses direct sunlight
sea smoke also called steam fog evaporation fog localized form created cold air passing warmer water moist land often causes freezing fog sometimes hoar frost
arctic sea smoke similar sea smoke occurs air cold instead condensing water droplets water vapor desublimates directly ice crystals
garua fog near coast chile peru occurs typical fog produced sea travels inland suddenly meets area hot air causes water particles fog shrink evaporation producing transparent mist garua fog nearly invisible yet still forces drivers use windshield wipers deposition liquid water hard surfaces
