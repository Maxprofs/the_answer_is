a lynx (/lks/ plural lynx or lynxes) is any of the four species within the lynx genus of medium-sized wild cats the name lynx originated in middle english via latin from the greek word  derived from the indo-european root leuk- meaning light brightness in reference to the luminescence of its reflective eyes
neither the caracal sometimes called the desert lynx nor the jungle cat called the jungle lynx is a member of the lynx genus
== appearance ==
lynx have a short tail characteristic tufts of black hair on the tips of their ears large padded paws for walking on snow and long whiskers on the face under their neck they have a ruff which has black bars resembling a bow tie although this is often not visible
body colour varies from medium brown to goldish to beige-white and is occasionally marked with dark brown spots especially on the limbs all species of lynx have white fur on their chests bellies and on the insides of their legs fur which is an extension of the chest and belly fur the lynx's colouring fur length and paw size vary according to the climate in their range in the southwestern united states they are short-haired dark in colour and their paws are smaller and less padded lynx in colder northern climates have progressively thicker fur the colour gets lighter their paws are larger and become more padded (for snowy environments) their paws may be larger than a human hand or foot
the smallest species are the bobcat and the canada lynx while the largest is the eurasian lynx with considerable variations within species
== species ==
the four living species of the lynx genus are believed to have evolved from the issoire lynx which lived in europe and africa during the late pliocene to early pleistocene the pliocene felid felis rexroadensis from north america has been proposed as an even earlier ancestor however this was larger than any living species and is not currently classified as a true lynx
=== eurasian lynx ===
of the four lynx species the eurasian lynx (lynx lynx) is the largest in size it is native to european and siberian forests while its conservation status has been classified as least concern populations of eurasian lynx have been reduced or extirpated from europe where it is now being reintroduced
the eurasian lynx is the third largest predator in europe after the brown bear and the grey wolf it is a strict carnivore consuming about one or two kilograms of meat every day the eurasian lynx is one of the widest-ranging and is found in forests of europe russia and central asia
during the summer the eurasian lynx has a relatively short reddish or brown coat which is replaced by a much thicker silver-grey to greyish-brown coat during winter the lynx hunts by stalking and jumping its prey helped by the rugged forested country in which it resides a favorite prey for the lynx in its woodland habitat is roe deer it will feed however on whatever animal appears easiest as it is an opportunistic predator much like its cousins
=== canada lynx ===
the canada lynx (lynx canadensis) or canadian lynx is a north american felid that ranges in forest and tundra regions across canada and into alaska as well as some parts of the northern united states historically the canadian lynx ranged from alaska across canada and into many of the northern us states in the eastern states it resided in the transition zone in which boreal coniferous forests yielded to deciduous forests by 2010 after an 11-year effort it had been successfully reintroduced into colorado where it had become extirpated in the 1970s in 2000 the u.s fish and wildlife service designated the canada lynx a threatened species in the lower 48 states
the canada lynx is a good climber and swimmer it constructs rough shelters under fallen trees or rock ledges it has a thick coat and broad paws and is twice as effective as bobcats at supporting its weight on the snow the canada lynx's diet is almost exclusive to and dependent on snowshoe hares and their numbers it will also hunt medium-sized mammals and birds if hare numbers fall
=== iberian lynx ===
the iberian lynx (lynx pardinus) is a endangered species native to the iberian peninsula in southern europe it is the most endangered cat species in the world according to the portuguese conservation group sos lynx if this species dies out it will be the first feline extinction since the smilodon 10,000 years ago the species used to be classified as a subspecies of the eurasian lynx but is now considered a separate species both species occurred together in central europe in the pleistocene epoch being separated by habitat choice the iberian lynx is believed to have evolved from lynx issiodorensis
=== bobcat ===
the bobcat (lynx rufus) is a north american wild cat with 12 recognized subspecies the bobcat is common throughout southern canada the continental united states and northern mexico the bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits deciduous coniferous or mixed woodlands but unlike other lynx does not depend exclusively on the deep forest and ranges from swamps and desert lands to mountainous and agricultural areas its spotted coat serving as camouflage the population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey nonetheless the bobcat is often killed by larger predators such as coyotes
the bobcat resembles other species of the lynx genus but is on average the smallest of the four its coat is variable though generally tan to grayish brown with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail the ears are black-tipped and pointed with short black tufts there is generally an off-white color on the lips chin and underparts bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest-colored coats while those in the northern forested regions have the darkest
== behavior and diet ==
the lynx is usually solitary although a small group of lynx may travel and hunt together occasionally mating takes place in the late winter and once a year the female gives birth to between one and four kittens the gestation time of the lynx is about 70 days the young stay with the mother for one more winter a total of around nine months before moving out to live on their own as young adults the lynx creates its den in crevices or under ledges it feeds on a wide range of animals from white-tailed deer reindeer roe deer small red deer and chamois to smaller more usual prey snowshoe hares fish foxes sheep squirrels mice turkeys and other birds and goats it also eats ptarmigans voles and grouse
== distribution and habitat ==
the lynx inhabits high altitude forests with dense cover of shrubs reeds and tall grass although this cat hunts on the ground it can climb trees and can swim swiftly catching fish
=== europe and asia ===
the eurasian lynx ranges from central and northern europe across asia up to northern pakistan and india in iran they live in mount damavand area since the beginning of the 20th century the eurasian lynx was considered extinct in the wild in slovenia and croatia a resettlement project begun in 1973 has successfully reintroduced lynx to the slovenian alps and the croatian regions of gorski kotar and velebit including croatia's plitvice lakes national park and risnjak national park in both countries the lynx is listed as an endangered species and protected by law
several lynx resettlement projects begun in the 1970s have been successful in various regions of switzerland since the 1990s there have been numerous efforts to resettle the eurasian lynx in germany and since 2000 a small population can now be found in the harz mountains near bad lauterberg
the lynx is found in the biaowiea forest in northeastern poland in estonia and in the northern and western parts of china particularly the tibetan plateau in romania the numbers exceed 2,000 the largest population in europe outside of russia although most experts consider the official population numbers to be overestimated
the lynx is more common in northern europe especially in norway sweden estonia finland and the northern parts of russia the swedish population is estimated to be 12001500 individuals spread all over the country but more common in middle sweden and in the mountain range the lynx population in finland was 19002100 individuals in 2008 and the numbers have been increasing every year since 1992 the lynx population in finland is estimated currently to be larger than ever before lynx in britain were wiped out in the 17th century but there have been calls to reintroduce them to curb the numbers of deer
the critically endangered iberian lynx lives in southern spain and formerly in eastern portugal there is an iberian lynx reproduction center outside silves in the algarve in southern portugal
=== north america ===
the two lynx species in north america canada lynx and bobcats are both found in the temperate zone while the bobcat is common throughout southern canada the continental united states and northern mexico the canada lynx is present mainly in boreal forests of canada and alaska
== protection ==
=== legal status ===
the hunting of lynx is illegal in many countries the iberian lynx is almost extinct and killing it has been outlawed since the 1970s in spain and portugal
lynx trade is ruled by the cites (convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora) some of them are classified in appendix i (every kind of trade is forbidden) since 1990 others in appendix ii since 1977 the united states asked for deletion of bobcat from appendix ii in 2004 but it has been refused
bobcat hunting and trade is regulated domestically throughout its range (nowell and jackson 1996) in the united states bobcats are currently classified as game or furbearer species and subsequently harvested through regulation in 38 states the species is further protected by continuous closed hunting seasons in 9 states and is classified as a state endangered species in indiana ohio new jersey and iowa bobcats are classified and protected as a state threatened species in illinois
in mexico bobcat hunting is regulated in 5 states and shooting suspected livestock predators is permitted on a limited basis (nowell and jackson 1996) in canada bobcat hunting is also regulated
=== captive breeding ===
the iberian lynx has been handled by the european endangered species programme which attempts to coordinate breeding between zoos and maintain genetic diversity later they are meant to be reintroduced to the wild
=== reintroduction ===
fourteen projects of reintroduction have been set in europe between 1970 and 2006 which gave the best results in slovenia the swiss alps jura croatia germany and italy
several lynx resettlement attempts have been tried in the united states in new york and colorado
