stir was a st louis missouri musical group
== history ==
=== formation and major label signing ===
stir was founded in 1994 as a three piece band at the university of missouri and consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist andy schmidt bassist kevin gagnepain and drummer brad booker schmidt gagnepain and booker had been in another band previous to stir named the choice and decided to form the band when that band's lead singer rick smith decided to no longer pursue a career in music
the band released a self-produced independent lp titled until now in 1995 under its own label stir music later that year the band played at the south by southwest festival the band signed with the indie label aware records following the performance subsequently releasing their eponymous debut album stir in 1996 this record included much of the material from the independent release later signed up by major label capitol records the self-titled stir was re-released to wider distribution
under the capitol imprint they also released their second record holy dogs in 2000 and were praised by radio program directors as the new golden boys.
=== commercial efforts and successes ===
the band found some radio success in the alternative rock genre the highest charting single was looking for from the eponymous debut which peaked at number 8 in 1997 on the billboard mainstream rock chart however the follow-up single one angel was said to be their breakthrough song but failed to significantly chart during its release the two singles from holy dogs new beginning and climbing the walls also saw some success on the billboard charts in 2000 but were ill-supported by capitol while on tour with train five songs from the band's set including superstation were broadcast live on the westwood one radio network during this time the band also made two appearances on the nationally syndicated radio show rockline on may 12 1997 and march 13 2000 during support of holy dogs they made an appearance on then-popular vh1 show the list performing new beginning as well as a cover of the nirvana single in bloom live in the studio rumors and talks of a late night tv performance never blossomed although the band has stated they were close to appearing on the late show with david letterman
even with all of this self-promotion and the semi-success of the singles holy dogs failed to make a dent in the industry selling roughly 45,000 copies by the end of the album cycle
in late 2001/early 2002 andy and kevin entered a new song of theirs into the international songwriting competition an annual contest typically receiving 15,000+ entries from bands and artists around the globe featuring industry judges such as rob thomas of matchbox twenty arif mardin and many others their song skeletons won the grand prize out of all entries
this song plus others such as hold on and what you do were slated for release on the band's forthcoming album which capitol records had scheduled for release on april 22 2003
=== changes and setbacks ===
following the tour in support of holy dogs founding member and drummer brad booker left the band to pursue a solo career arranging compositions for some volkswagen and ncaa ads as well as joining up briefly with gravity kills and then apartment 26 (see notes below) in addition to his replacement on drums a second guitarist was added to the band at a concert in st louis on july 5 2002 the newly reformed stir appeared for the first time as a four piece now including
thom donovan guitarist (lapush)
john pessoni drummer (formerly of the urge)
stir debuted several new songs including not the only one first time and hold on. they also performed a cover of guns n roses sweet child o mine as well as the fan-favorite cover of ozzy osbourne's crazy train, which has been previously recorded for the westwood one in concert program all of the original songs also possibly including a studio cover of the who's baba o'riley were set to be released on the group's third major-label disc on april 22 2003 however weeks before the scheduled release date the album was shelved indefinitely due to a shift in the labels ownership and management
attributed to this change a falling out occurred with capitol records as everyone who was behind the band had either left or been fired by capitol leaving the group in limbo and the album of new material without official release the band was eventually dropped by capitol after extended talks but the label retained the rights to the unreleased material as well as the previous albums (both of which are now out of print but were made available on itunes in 2007) as posted to the band's message board bassist kevin gagnepain refers to the unreleased cd by the title untitled unmastered and unemployed since then much of the material has been released to the internet by the band and is also available at an unofficial site with a large amount of compiled live and unreleased material.[1]
== the end of stir ==
the band unofficially broke up in 2005 shortly after andy and kevin played an acoustic concert on 11/26 at the pageant in st louis in support of a local musicians showcase gagnepain has stated on numerous occasions that the band is not indefinitely finished however there is some rumor circulating within fan circles that schmidt has confirmed that the likelihood of any type of stir reunion or concert is very slim and probably won't happen.
during the extended hiatus as stir several members have established themselves in new musical efforts as solo artists or with new bands during the lull
brad booker after spending time in the groups gravity kills and apartment 26 currently writes solo music and has racked up credits as producer mixer and co-writer with acts such as piper and bloom j relic mic averich and apryl lauren he is also involved in the cover band wyld stallyns in addition he has played drums on chloe day's trip-hop hit kingpin
founding member and bassist kevin gagnepain was the bassist with tobi kai & the strays currently he plays bass in the tongue-in-cheek cover band joe dirt and the dirty boys band (using the stage moniker jethro dirt") and also with his new st louis based band shooting with annie
thom donovan founded the band lapush handling vocals and guitar in 2004 the band signed to carson daly's co-owned label fourfivesix (universal) lapush appeared on last call with carson daly on nbc (dec 2 2005) their debut album someplace closer to here was released on june 5 2005 the album went to #15 on the alternative/specialty chart and featured the singles quit you now and aurora aurora was also featured in the television show moonlight on cbs the band released their second album modern blues in 2007 songs from this release have appeared in several television shows on mtv including the hills and college life
thom lives in nashville and has a recurring role as a musician on nashville on abc his third studio album canon is due for release june 17 2014 and features a collaboration with wyclef jean and ruby amanfu the album was mixed by grammy winning engineer vance powell (jack white the white stripes) his music continues to appear in major tv shows including the good wife on cbs and body of proof on abc thom and ruby appeared live in new orleans at the voodoo music + arts festival with nine inch nails pearl jam and the cure
thom writes for kobalt music group
john pessoni is still active in the st louis music scene as part of joe dirt and the dirty boys band (using the stage moniker johnny dirt") as well as with the occasionally reuniting band the urge
kevin and john are involved in a pink floyd tribute show entitled wish you were here and perform under the name el monstero y los masked avengers four to six shows each year typically take place at the pageant in st louis during the week leading up to christmas through 2005 schmidt participated in the tribute band as well but has not been involved since
typically details of the whereabouts and on-goings of founder and frontman andy schmidt are more elusive from the online community than the rest of the band rumor has it that he is contracted by a well-known entertainment company chiefly in a song writing capacity he lives in the los angeles california area he does occasionally surface for solo performances as well but his location makes it difficult for extended prep needed for any type of stir concert
