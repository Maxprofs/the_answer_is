a point source of pollution is a single identifiable source of air water pollution thermal noise or light pollution a point source has negligible extent distinguishing it from other pollution source geometries the sources are called point sources because in mathematical modeling they can be approximated as a mathematical point to simplify analysis pollution point sources are identical to other physics engineering optics and chemistry point sources and include
air pollution from an industrial source rather than an airport or a road considered a line source or a forest fire which is considered an area source or volume source
water pollution from an oil refinery wastewater discharge outlet
noise pollution from a jet engine
disruptive seismic vibration from a localized seismic study
light pollution from an intrusive street light
thermal pollution from an industrial process outfall
radio emissions from an interference-producing electrical device
