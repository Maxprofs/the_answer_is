geology
north america era began deep sedimentary basins along eastern southeastern western sides continent interior dry land era proceeded marginal seas periodically washed stable interior leaving sedimentary deposits mark incursions early part era area exposed precambrian shield rocks central canada eroding supplying sediment basins interior beginning ordovician period mountain building intermittently proceeded eastern part appalachian region throughout rest era bringing new sediments sediments washing acadian mountains filled western part appalachian basins form famous coal swamps carboniferous period north america carboniferous generally used instead time divided mississippian pennsylvanian periods differences sedimentary rock deposited time mississippian characterized limey sediments deposited shallow seas typically abundant crinoidal fossils burlington formation pennsylvanian typically characterized terrestrial sediments sands shale importantly coal oil gas obtained pennsylvanian sediments stripped ozark domal region oil typically available

periods paleozoic
six periods paleozoic era cambrian ordovician silurian devonian carboniferous permian
cambrian
cambrian spans million years million years ago first period paleozoic phanerozoic eon cambrian sparks boom evolution event known cambrian explosion largest number creatures evolve history earth one period creatures like algae evolve water populated armored arthropods like trilobites almost marine phyla evolved period time supercontinent rodinia begins break becomes supercontinent gondwana
ordovician
ordovician spans million years million years ago ordovician time earths history many species still prevalent today evolved primitive fish cephalopods coral common forms life however trilobites snails shellfish importantly first arthropods went ashore colonize empty continent gondwana end period gondwana south pole early north america collided europe closing atlantic ocean glaciation africa resulted major drop sea level killing life staked claim along coastal gondwana glaciation caused snowball earth ordoviciansilurian extinction marine invertebrates families went extinct considered first mass extinction second deadliest extinction
silurian
silurian spans million years million years ago silurian saw healing earth recovered snowball earth period saw mass evolution fish jawless fish became numerous jawed fish evolved first freshwater fish evolved though arthropods sea scorpions still apex predators fully terrestrial life evolved included early arachnids fungi centipedes also evolution vascular plants cooksonia allowed plants gain foothold land early plants forerunners plant life land time four continents gondwana africa south america australia antarctica siberia laurentia north america baltica northern europe avalonia western europe recent rise sea levels provided many new species thrive water
devonian
devonian spans million years million years ago also known age fish devonian features huge diversification fish including armored fish like dunkleosteus lobefinned fish eventually evolved first tetrapods land plant groups diversified incredibly event known devonian explosion first trees evolved well seeds event also diversified arthropod life first amphibians also evolved fish top food chain near end devonian species went extinct event known late devonian extinction second mass extinction event world seen
carboniferous
carboniferous spans million million years ago time average global temperatures exceedingly high early carboniferous averaged degrees celsius cooled degrees middle carboniferous tropical swamps dominated earth large amounts trees created much carbon coal used today hence name carboniferous perhaps important evolutionary development time evolution amniotic eggs allowed amphibians head farther inland remained dominant vertebrae throughout duration period also first reptiles synapsids evolved swamps throughout carboniferous cooling pattern eventually led glaciation gondwana much situated around south pole event known permocarboniferous glaciation carboniferous rainforest collapse
permian
permian spans million million years ago last period paleozoic beginning continents joined together form supercontinent pangaea encircled one ocean called panthalassa earth dry time harsh seasons climate interior pangaea wasnt regulated large bodies water reptiles synapsids flourished new dry climate creatures dimetrodon edaphosaurus ruled new continent first conifers evolve dominate terrestrial landscape nearing end permian however pangaea got drier drier interior nothing dry deserts new species scutosaurus gorgonopsids filled empty desert eventually disappeared along life earth cataclysm known great dying third severe mass extinction world history
tectonic activity
geologically paleozoic starts shortly breakup supercontinent called pannotia throughout early paleozoic earths landmass broken substantial number continents towards end era continents gathered together supercontinent called pangaea included earths land area
climate
ordovician silurian periods warm greenhouse periods highest sea levels paleozoic m todays warm climate interrupted million years cool period early palaeozoic icehouse culminating hirnantian glaciation
early cambrian climate probably moderate first becoming warmer course cambrian secondgreatest sustained sea level rise phanerozoic got underway however offset trend gondwana moved south considerable speed ordovician time west gondwana africa south america lay directly south pole early paleozoic climate also strongly zonal result climate abstract sense became warmer living space organisms timethe continental shelf marine environmentbecame steadily colder however baltica northern europe russia laurentia eastern north america greenland remained tropical zone china australia lay waters least temperate early paleozoic ended rather abruptly short apparently severe late ordovician ice age cold spell caused secondgreatest mass extinction phanerozoic time time warmer weather moved paleozoic era
middle paleozoic time considerable stability sea levels dropped coincident ice age slowly recovered course silurian devonian slow merger baltica laurentia northward movement bits pieces gondwana created numerous new regions relatively warm shallow sea floor plants took hold continental margins oxygen levels increased carbon dioxide dropped although much less dramatically northsouth temperature gradient also seems moderated metazoan life simply became hardier event far southern continental margins antarctica west gondwana became increasingly less barren devonian ended series turnover pulses killed much middle paleozoic vertebrate life without noticeably reducing species diversity overall
late paleozoic time left us good many unanswered questions mississippian began spike atmospheric oxygen carbon dioxide plummeted unheardof lows destabilized climate led one perhaps two ice ages carboniferous far severe brief late ordovician ice time effects world biota inconsequential cisuralian oxygen carbon dioxide recovered normal levels hand assembly pangaea created huge arid inland areas subject temperature extremes lopingian associated falling sea levels increased carbon dioxide general climatic deterioration culminating devastation permian extinction
flora
macroscopic plant life appeared early paleozoic possibly late neoproterozoic mostly remained aquatic sometime silurian devonian began transition onto dry land terrestrial flora reached climax carboniferous towering lycopsid rainforests dominated tropical belt euramerica climate change caused carboniferous rainforest collapse fragmented habitat diminishing diversity plant life late carboniferous permian
fauna
noteworthy feature paleozoic life sudden appearance nearly invertebrate animal phyla great abundance beginning cambrian first vertebrates appeared form primitive fish greatly diversified silurian devonian first animals venture onto dry land arthropods fish lungs powerful bony fins also could crawl onto land bones fins eventually evolved legs became first tetrapods amphibians dominant tetrapods midcarboniferous climate change greatly reduced diversity later reptiles prospered continued increase number variety late permian
