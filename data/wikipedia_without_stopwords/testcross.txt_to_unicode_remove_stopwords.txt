genetics test cross first introduced gregor mendel involves breeding phenotypically dominant individual phenotypically recessive individual order determine zygosity former analyzing proportions offspring phenotypes zygosity either heterozygous homozygous heterozygous one dominant one recessive allele individuals homozygous dominant two dominant alleles homozygous recessive two recessive alleles
genotype offspring genes determined alleles inherited parents combination alleles result maternal paternal chromosomes contributed gamete fertilization offspring meiosis gametes homologous chromosomes experience genetic recombination segregate randomly haploid daughter cells unique combination maternally paternally coded genes dominant alleles override expression recessive alleles
test crosses used test individuals genotype crossing individual known genotype individuals show recessive phenotype known homozygous recessive genotype individuals show dominant phenotype however may either homozygous dominant heterozygous phenotypically dominant organism individual question test cross purpose test cross determine individual homozygous dominant heterozygous
test crosses involve breeding individual question another individual expresses recessive version trait analyzing proportions dominant recessive offspring determines individual question homozygous dominant heterozygous offspring test cross display dominant phenotype individual question homozygous dominant half offspring display dominant phenotypes half display recessive phenotypes individual heterozygous since homozygous recessive individual pass recessive alleles alleles individual question passes determine phenotypes offspring
