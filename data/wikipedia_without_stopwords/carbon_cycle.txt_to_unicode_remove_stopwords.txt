past two centuries human activities seriously altered global carbon cycle significantly atmosphere although carbon dioxide levels changed naturally past several thousand years human emissions carbon dioxide atmosphere exceed natural fluctuations changes amount atmospheric co considerably altering weather patterns indirectly influencing oceanic chemistry records ice cores shown although global temperatures change without changes atmospheric co levels co levels cannot change significantly without affecting global temperatures current carbon dioxide levels atmosphere exceed measurements last years levels rising faster ever recorded making critical importance better understand carbon cycle works effects global climate
main components
global carbon cycle usually divided following major reservoirs carbon interconnected pathways exchange
atmosphere
terrestrial biosphere
oceans including dissolved inorganic carbon living nonliving marine biota
sediments including fossil fuels fresh water systems nonliving organic material soil carbon
earths interior carbon earths mantle crust carbon stores interact components geological processes
carbon exchanges reservoirs occur result various chemical physical geological biological processes ocean contains largest active pool carbon near surface earth natural flows carbon atmosphere ocean sediments fairly balanced carbon levels would roughly stable without human influence
atmosphere
carbon earths atmosphere exists two main forms carbon dioxide methane gases absorb retain heat atmosphere partially responsible greenhouse effect methane produces large greenhouse effect per volume compared carbon dioxide exists much lower concentrations shortlived carbon dioxide making carbon dioxide important greenhouse gas two
carbon dioxide leaves atmosphere photosynthesis thus entering terrestrial oceanic biospheres carbon dioxide also dissolves directly atmosphere bodies water oceans lakes etc well dissolving precipitation raindrops fall atmosphere dissolved water carbon dioxide reacts water molecules forms carbonic acid contributes ocean acidity absorbed rocks weathering also acidify surfaces touches washed ocean
human activity past two centuries significantly increased amount carbon atmosphere mainly form carbon dioxide modifying ecosystems ability extract carbon dioxide atmosphere emitting directly eg burning fossil fuels manufacturing concrete
terrestrial biosphere
terrestrial biosphere includes organic carbon landliving organisms alive dead well carbon stored soils gigatons carbon stored ground plants living organisms soil holds approximately gigatons carbon carbon terrestrial biosphere organic carbon third soil carbon stored inorganic forms calcium carbonate organic carbon major component organisms living earth autotrophs extract air form carbon dioxide converting organic carbon heterotrophs receive carbon consuming organisms
carbon uptake terrestrial biosphere dependent biotic factors follows diurnal seasonal cycle co measurements cycle often called keeling curve strongest northern hemisphere hemisphere land mass southern hemisphere thus room ecosystems absorb emit carbon
carbon leaves terrestrial biosphere several ways different time scales combustion respiration organic carbon releases rapidly atmosphere also exported oceans rivers remain sequestered soils form inert carbon carbon stored soil remain thousands years washed rivers erosion released atmosphere soil respiration soil respiration increased per year global total co released soil reached roughly billion tonnes times carbon humans putting atmosphere year plausible explanations trend likely explanation increasing temperatures increased rates decomposition soil organic matter increased flow co length carbon sequestering soil dependent local climatic conditions thus changes course climate change preindustrial era terrestrial biosphere represented net source atmospheric co prior switching subsequently net sink
oceans
oceans contain greatest quantity actively cycled carbon world second lithosphere amount carbon store oceans surface layer holds large amounts dissolved organic carbon exchanged rapidly atmosphere deep layers concentration dissolved inorganic carbon dic higher surface layer dic stored deep layer much longer periods time thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon two layers
carbon enters ocean mainly dissolution atmospheric carbon dioxide converted carbonate also enter oceans rivers dissolved organic carbon converted organisms organic carbon photosynthesis either exchanged throughout food chain precipitated oceans deeper carbon rich layers dead soft tissue shells calcium carbonate circulates layer long periods time either deposited sediment eventually returned surface waters thermohaline circulation
oceanic absorption co one important forms carbon sequestering limiting humancaused rise carbon dioxide atmosphere however process limited number factors rate co dissolution ocean dependent weathering rocks process takes place slower current rates human greenhouse gas emissions ocean co uptake decrease future co absorption also makes water acidic affects ocean biosystems projected rate increasing oceanic acidity could slow biological precipitation calcium carbonates thus decreasing oceans capacity absorb carbon dioxide according study done dr grace saba rutgers university professor deborah steinberg virginia institute marine science marine organisms copepods small drifting organisms play key role biological pump feeding photosynthetic algae surface releasing carbon theyve ingested fecal pellets pellets rapidly sink bottom ocean releasing carbon deep sea
geological carbon cycle
geologic component carbon cycle operates slowly comparison parts global carbon cycle one important determinants amount carbon atmosphere thus global temperatures
earths carbon stored inertly earths lithosphere much carbon stored earths mantle stored earth formed deposited form organic carbon biosphere carbon stored geosphere limestone derivatives form sedimentation calcium carbonate stored shells marine organisms remaining stored kerogens formed sedimentation burial terrestrial organisms high heat pressure organic carbon stored geosphere remain millions years
carbon leave geosphere several ways carbon dioxide released metamorphosis carbonate rocks subducted earths mantle carbon dioxide released atmosphere ocean volcanoes hotspots also removed humans direct extraction kerogens form fossil fuels extraction fossil fuels burned release energy thus emitting carbon store atmosphere
human influence
since industrial revolution human activity modified carbon cycle changing components functions directly adding carbon atmosphere
largest direct human influence carbon cycle direct emissions burning fossil fuels transfers carbon geosphere atmosphere humans also influence carbon cycle indirectly changing terrestrial oceanic biosphere
past several centuries humancaused land use land cover change lucc led loss biodiversity lowers ecosystems resilience environmental stresses decreases ability remove carbon atmosphere directly often leads release carbon terrestrial ecosystems atmosphere deforestation agricultural purposes removes forests hold large amounts carbon replaces generally agricultural urban areas replacement land cover types store comparatively small amounts carbon net product process carbon stays atmosphere
humancaused changes environment change ecosystems productivity ability remove carbon atmosphere air pollution example damages plants soils many agricultural land use practices lead higher erosion rates washing carbon soils decreasing plant productivity
higher temperatures co levels atmosphere increase decomposition rates soil thus returning co stored plant material quickly atmosphere
however increased levels co atmosphere also lead higher gross primary production increases photosynthesis rates allowing plants efficiently use water longer need leave stomata open long periods time order absorb amount carbon dioxide type carbon dioxide fertilization affects mainly c plants c plants already concentrate co effectively
humans also affect oceanic carbon cycle current trends climate change lead higher ocean temperatures thus modifying ecosystems also acid rain polluted runoff agriculture industry change oceans chemical composition changes dramatic effects highly sensitive ecosystems coral reefs thus limiting oceans ability absorb carbon atmosphere regional scale reducing oceanic biodiversity globally
november nasa scientists reported humanmade carbon dioxide co continues increase levels seen hundreds thousands years currently half carbon dioxide released burning fossil fuels remains atmosphere absorbed vegetation oceans
