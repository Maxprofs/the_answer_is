writing in library journal psychiatrist james charney describes the book as the only useful critical look at the training zane berzins of the new york times book review characterizes the book as a calm and professionally informed view hearings held in 1979 before the united states house of representatives on a juvenile delinquents program depicted in scared straight cited the book for background on the est training as did psychologist gidi rubinstein in a 2005 study of the landmark forum published in the academic journal psychology and psychotherapy theory research and practice
== background ==
werner erhard (born john paul rosenberg) was originally from pennsylvania and migrated to california a former salesman training manager and executive in the encyclopedia business erhard created the erhard seminars training (est) course in 1971 est was a form of large group awareness training and was part of the human potential movement est was a four-day 60-hour self-help program given to groups of 250 people at a time the program was very intensive each day would contain 1520 hours of instruction during the training est personnel utilized jargon to convey key concepts and participants had to agree to certain rules which remained in effect for the duration of the course participants were taught that they were responsible for their life outcomes
est was controversial it had its critics and proponents a year after getting it was published over 100,000 people completed the est training including public figures and mental health professionals in 1985 werner erhard and associates repackaged the course as the forum a seminar focused on goal-oriented breakthroughs by 1988 approximately one million people had taken some form of the trainings in the early 1990s erhard faced family problems as well as tax problems that were eventually resolved in his favor a group of his associates formed the company landmark education in 1991

sheridan fenwick in her early thirties when getting it was published had graduated with a bachelor of arts degree from goucher college and received a doctorate in psychopathology and social psychology from cornell university her ph.d dissertation was published in 1975 fenwick served as the director of social policy in the department of city planning of chicago illinois as assistant attending psychologist at montefiore medical center and as a faculty member of columbia university's department of psychology
fenwick writes that although she had been trained as a clinical psychologist she avoided consciousness movements and never participated in transactional analysis or similar therapies including transcendental meditation esalen arica gestalt therapy and mind dynamics when she met with graduates of the est training and heard their testimonials and observed their level of self-confidence she considered taking the training
after some preliminary research fenwick decided to take the training as a participant rather than as a professional observer she paid the $250.00 course fee and enrolled in a four-day est program to examine its methods and its appeal she reports that the training was an extraordinary experience but that she had serious concerns about the implications of the est phenomenon and that people should know more about it the book was first published september 16 1976 by j b lippincott company a second edition was published by penguin books in 1977 fenwick went on to work as director of the behavioral medicine clinic at abbott northwestern hospital in minneapolis before retiring in 1993 to set up psybar an online service to provide psychological experts for court cases

the book is divided into two sections the first section describes fenwick's own experiences of the training the second analyzes the est program's methodology and effects in her analysis of the course she states while the consensus of informed opinion based on summaries of research findings is that interventions similar to the est training have only modestly positive effects i think that the existing research provides us with an underestimate of the effect of the est training this training represents a distillation of some of the most powerful techniques and central precepts for attitude and behavior change i would guess that the effects of the est training are substantial for a large proportion of people
in the latter portion of the book fenwick discusses comparisons of the est training to brainwashing and psychotherapy potential harmful effects of the course and the extent that positive benefit from the course may be attributed to a self-fulfilling prophecy fenwick sees est as a form of psychotherapy that utilizes in therapies and questions its suitability for certain individuals fenwick writes that the est training draws influences from synanon gestalt therapy encounter groups and scientology she discusses the potential positive and negative psychological effects that can occur subsequent to taking the est training she analyzes the rules of the training and the behavioral tools used by the trainers and points out that the est personnel are not qualified to assess psychopathology fenwick asserts that tactics including sensory deprivation and the large group setting of 250 people at a time help to make the training work she describes this as a compression chamber effect and asserts that it leads to the hysterical confessions and the euphoric testimonials she observed in the course
fenwick cites the secrecy of the est organization as an impediment to meaningful study and states that the studies cited by est itself are inadequate and inconclusive fenwick writes that a lack of sophisticated research designs limits the ability to properly determine long-term benefits or harm caused by the course and notes est uses techniques indiscriminately which in a certain proportion of the population are known to be harmful and potentially quite dangerous she concludes that it is difficult to determine whether est produces any more than a superficial catharsis or whether it might be harmful to certain people and states that the long-range effects of the training are unknown.she concludes that it is difficult to determine whether est produces any more than a superficial catharsis or whether it might be harmful to certain people and states that the long-range effects of the training are unknown she goes on to say that even if objective changes are not documented in people's lives it is noteworthy if people feel happier more satisfied more relaxed and more alive if you feel happier then you are happier objective circumstances notwithstanding subjective states are clearly an important component of our lives.

getting it received mixed but generally positive reviews one positive evaluation came from psychiatrist james charney in a 1976 review for library journal charney calls the book the only useful critical look at this essential issue referring to the est training he notes in particular that fenwick's analysis of the function of the group the restrictive rules and the enforced discomfort is convincing in a 1977 review in library journal edith crockett and ellis mount highly recommended the book commenting that a plethora of newspaper and magazine reports along with books written by graduates  have attempted to explain the phenomenon of this self-help program but none has done it as well or as objectively as this writer. kirkus reviews noted the precedent set by the analytical nature of the book writing finally here's someone who is willing to disclose the details of erhard seminars training and then go on to analyze them from a psychological point of view. zane berzins writing for the new york times book review in 1977 describes fenwick's work as a calm and professionally informed view berzins describes the book as a brave attempt at an analysis of est's appeal and concludes that it's hardly an incendiary expos but fenwick's open-minded scrutiny should deglamourize the est movement.
william mcgurk reviewed the book in contemporary psychology although mcgurk praises the book's description of the est seminars noting that it present[s] a clear picture of the process he also criticizes fenwick's subsequent analysis saying she sounds like a different person than in the first section mcgurk writes that it's as though she put on her psychoanalytically oriented professional hat and ran a tape that was far from being effective. a review in publishers weekly states that fenwick's inbred detachment may have kept her from the full impact of the experience the training was meant to be (and is for many) even so the review notes that fenwick scores heavily in the section where she questions the nature of the est training and erhard's background it recommends that getting it be read alongside luke rhinehart's the book of est
the book is recommended by james r lewis and j gordon melton's 1992 book perspectives on the new age where they describe it as a thorough discussion of est training methods and the psychology behind them other works that cite the book for background on est include snapping america's epidemic of sudden personality change by flo conway and jim siegelman and evaluating a large group awareness training a study commissioned by erhard's successor company to est werner erhard and associates
fenwick's work was cited in 1979 hearings before the united states house of representatives on a controversial program for juvenile delinquents which was depicted in the academy award-winning documentary film scared straight getting it is cited in background discussion of the est training fenwick has pointed out that sophisticated assessment of individual psychopathology is beyond the competence and training of the est personnel it is also outside the est value system since the training is held to be almost universally beneficial. psychologist gidi rubinstein cites the book as a reference in a 2005 study of the landmark forum a course descended from the est training which he presented in the academic journal psychology and psychotherapy theory research and practice
