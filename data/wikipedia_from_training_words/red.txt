red is the color at the end of the spectrum of visible light next to orange and opposite violet it is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength of roughly 620740 nm red is one of the additive primary colors of light along with green and blue which in rgb color systems are combined to create all the colors on a computer monitor or television screen it is also one of the subtractive primary colors along with yellow and blue of the ryb color space and traditional color wheel used by painters and artists
reds can vary in shade from very light pink to very dark maroon or burgundy and in hue from the bright orange-red scarlet or vermilion to the bluish-red crimson
red was widely used in prehistoric cave art made with red hematite or iron oxide or red ochre early civilizations in china the middle east and europe made red dyes from the madder plant or from a tiny insect called kermes vermilio civilizations in the americas made brilliant reds from another scale insect the cochineal ancient chinese artists during the han dynasty used dye from the madder plant to color silk and pigments from lead oxide to color pottery
in ancient rome red symbolized blood and courage roman soldiers wore red tunics and generals wore a scarlet cloak and had their bodies painted completely in red during ceremonial triumphs it also sometimes represented sin the book of revelation described the scarlet whore of babylon in the middle ages red was the color of majesty it was the color of the banners of the byzantine empire and the emperor charlemagne painted his palace red and wore red shoes as symbol of his authority in christianity it represented the blood of christ and the christian martyrs in 1295 it became the color worn by cardinals of the roman catholic church merchants and ordinary people wore clothing dyed with madder at celebrations nobles and merchants wore the more intense red made with kermes in the 16th century spanish merchants began to import cochineal into europe which made an even more brilliant red it became the fashion color of the aristocracy
red also played an important role in the culture of imperial china in chinese philosophy red represented fire one of the five elements during the zhou han jin song and ming dynasties red was considered a noble color and it was featured in all court ceremonies from coronations to sacrificial offerings and weddings the gates of imperial palaces were usually painted red chinese artisans used the mineral cinnabar to produce the famous vermilion or chinese red color of chinese lacquerware
during the french revolution some of the revolutionaries began to wear a red phrygian cap or liberty cap modeled after the caps worn by freed slaves in ancient rome and to carry red flags in the mid-19th century red became the color of a new political and social movement socialism it became the color of the worker's movement of the french revolution of 1848 of the paris commune in 1870 and of socialist parties across europe
in 1826 the organic compound alizarin the coloring ingredient of madder was discovered and in 1848 it was synthesized it was cheaper and made a more lasting color and quickly replaced natural vegetable dyes in the late 19th and early 20th century the german chemical industry invented two new synthetic red pigments cadmium red which was the color of natural vermilion and mars red which was a synthetic red ochre 19th century artists adopted the color alizarin crimson in the 19th century artists also began to use red to create specific emotions not just to imitate nature vincent van gogh wrote in 1888 i sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions
in the 20th century red was the color of revolution it was the color of the bolshevik revolution in 1917 and of the chinese revolution of 1949 and later of the cultural revolution red was the color of communist parties from eastern europe to cuba to vietnam
in nature the red color of blood comes from hemoglobin the iron-containing protein found in the red blood cells of all vertebrates the red color of the grand canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre both forms of iron oxide it also causes the red color of the planet mars the red sky at sunset and sunrise is caused by an optical effect known as rayleigh scattering which when the sun is low or below the horizon increases the red-wavelength light that reaches the eye the color of autumn leaves is caused by pigments called anthocyanins which are produced towards the end of summer when the green chlorophyll is no longer produced one to two percent of the human population has red hair the color is produced by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin
since red is the color of blood it has historically been associated with sacrifice danger and courage modern surveys in the united states and europe show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat activity passion sexuality anger love and joy in china and many other asian countries it is the color of happiness
== etymology and definitions ==
the word red is derived from the old english rad the word can be further traced to the proto-germanic rauthaz and the proto-indo european root rewd- in sanskrit the word rudhira means red or blood in the akkadian language of ancient mesopotamia and in the modern inuit language of inuit the word for red is the same word as like blood
the words for colored in latin (coloratus) and spanish (colorado) both also mean red. in portuguese the word for red is vermelho which comes from latin vermiculus meaning little worm
in the russian language the word for red (krasniy) comes from the same old slavic root as the words for beautiful (krasiviy) and excellent (prekrasniy) thus red square in moscow named long before the russian revolution meant simply beautiful square
in heraldry the word gules is used for red
== shades and varieties ==
red can vary in hue from orange-red to violet-red and for each hue there are a wide variety of shades and tints from very light pink to dark burgundy
(lists of shades of red and shades of pink are found at the end of this article.)
== history ==
=== in the ancient world ===
inside cave 13b at pinnacle point an archeological site found on the coast of south africa paleoanthropologists in 2000 found evidence that between 170,000 and 40,000 years ago late stone age people were scraping and grinding ochre a clay colored red by iron oxide probably with the intention of using it to color their bodies
red hematite powder was also found scattered around the remains at a grave site in a zhoukoudian cave complex near beijing the site has evidence of habitation as early as 700,000 years ago the hematite might have been used to symbolize blood in an offering to the dead
red black and white were the first colors used by artists in the upper paleolithic age probably because natural pigments such as red ochre and iron oxide were readily available where early people lived madder a plant whose root could be made into a red dye grew widely in europe africa and asia the cave of altamira in spain has a painting of a bison colored with red ochre that dates to between 15,000 and 16,500 bc
a red dye called kermes was made beginning in the neolithic period by drying and then crushing the bodies of the females of a tiny scale insect in the genus kermes primarily kermes vermilio the insects live on the sap of certain trees especially kermes oak trees near the mediterranean region jars of kermes have been found in a neolithic cave-burial at adaoutse bouches-du-rhne kermes from oak trees was later used by romans who imported it from spain a different variety of dye was made from porphyrophora hamelii (armenian cochineal) scale insects that lived on the roots and stems of certain herbs it was mentioned in texts as early as the 8th century bc and it was used by the ancient assyrians and persians
kermes is also mentioned in the bible in the book of exodus god instructs moses to have the israelites bring him an offering including cloth of blue and purple and scarlet. the term used for scarlet in the 4th century latin vulgate version of the bible passage is coccumque bis tinctum meaning colored twice with coccus. coccus from the ancient greek kokkos means a tiny grain and is the term that was used in ancient times for the kermes vermilio insect used to make the kermes dye this was also the origin of the expression dyed in the grain.
in ancient egypt red was associated with life health and victory egyptians would color themselves with red ochre during celebrations egyptian women used red ochre as a cosmetic to redden cheeks and lips and also used henna to color their hair and paint their nails
but like many colors it also had a negative association with heat destruction and evil a prayer to god isis said oh isis protect me from all things evil and red. the ancient egyptians began manufacturing pigments in about 4000 bc red ochre was widely used as a pigment for wall paintings particularly as the skin color of men an ivory painter's palette found inside the tomb of king tutankhamun had small compartments with pigments of red ochre and five other colors the egyptians used the root of the rubia or madder plant to make a dye later known as alizarin and also used it to color white power to use as a pigment which became known as madder lake alizarin or alizarin crimson
in ancient china artisans were making red and black painted pottery as early as the yangshao culture period (5000-3000 bc) a red-painted wooden bowl was found at a neolithic site in yuyao zhejiang other red-painted ceremonial objects have been found at other sites dating to the spring and autumn period (770221 bc)
during the han dynasty (200 bc to 200 ad) chinese craftsmen made a red pigment lead tetroxide which they called ch-ien tan by heating lead white pigment like the egyptians they made a red dye from the madder plant to color silk fabric for gowns and used pigments colored with madder to make red lacquerware
red lead or lead tetroxide pigment was widely used as the red in persian and indian miniature paintings as well as in european art where it was called minium
in india the rubia plant has been used to make dye since ancient times a piece of cotton dyed with rubia dated to the third millennium bc was found at an archaeological site at mohenjo-daro it has been used by indian monks and hermits for centuries to dye their robes
the early inhabitants of america had their own vivid crimson dye made from the cochineal an insect of the same family as the kermes of europe and the middle east which feeds on the opuntia or prickly pear cactus plant red-dyed textiles from the paracas culture (800100 bc) have been found in tombs in peru
red also featured in the burials of royalty in the maya city-states in the tomb of the red queen inside temple xiii in the ruined maya city of palenque (600700 ad) the skeleton and ceremonial items of a noble woman were completely covered with bright red powder made from cinnabar
in ancient greece and the minoan civilization of ancient crete red was widely used in murals and in the polychrome decoration of temples and palaces the greeks began using red lead as a pigment
in ancient rome tyrian purple was the color of the emperor but red had an important religious symbolism romans wore togas with red stripes on holidays and the bride at a wedding wore a red shawl called a flammeum red was used to color statues and the skin of gladiators red was also the color associated with army roman soldiers wore red tunics and officers wore a cloak called a paludamentum which depending upon the quality of the dye could be crimson scarlet or purple in roman mythology red is associated with the god of war mars the vexilloid of the roman empire had a red background with the letters spqr in gold a roman general receiving a triumph had his entire body painted red in honor of his achievement
the romans liked bright colors and many roman villas were decorated with vivid red murals the pigment used for many of the murals was called vermilion and it came from the mineral cinnabar a common ore of mercury it was one of the finest reds of ancient times the paintings have retained their brightness for more than twenty centuries the source of cinnabar for the romans was a group of mines near almadn southwest of madrid in spain working in the mines was extremely dangerous since mercury is highly toxic the miners were slaves or prisoners and being sent to the cinnabar mines was a virtual death sentence
=== in the middle ages ===
after the fall of the western roman empire the byzantine empire the princes of europe and the roman catholic church adapted red as a color of majesty and authority it also played an important part in the rituals of the catholic church - it symbolized the blood of christ and the christian martyrs - and it associated the power of the kings with the sacred rituals of the church
red was the color of the banner of the byzantine emperors in western europe emperor charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority and wore red shoes at his coronation kings princes and beginning in 1295 roman catholic cardinals began to wear red costumes when abbe suger rebuilt saint denis basilica outside paris in the early 12th century he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across france england and germany in medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures both christ and the virgin mary were commonly painted wearing red mantles
red clothing was a sign of status and wealth it was worn not only by cardinals and princes but also by merchants artisans and townpeople particularly on holidays or special occasions red dye for the clothing of ordinary people was made from the roots of the rubia tinctorum the madder plant this color leaned toward brick-red and faded easily in the sun or during washing the wealthy and aristocrats wore scarlet clothing dyed with kermes or carmine made from the carminic acid in tiny female scale insects which lived on the leaves of oak trees in eastern europe and around the mediterranean the insects were gathered dried crushed and boiled with different ingredients in a long and complicated process which produced a brilliant scarlet
brazilin was another popular red dye in the middle ages it came from the sapanwood tree which grew in india malaysia and sri lanka a similar tree brazilwood grew on the coast of south america the red wood was ground into sawdust and mixed with an alkaline solution to make dye and pigment it became one of the most profitable exports from the new world and gave its name to the nation of brazil
=== in the renaissance and baroque eras ===
in renaissance painting red was used to draw the attention of the viewer it was often used as the color of the cloak or costume of christ the virgin mary or another central figure in venice titian was the master of fine reds particularly vermilion he used many layers of pigment mixed with a semi-transparent glaze which let the light pass through to create a more luminous color
during the renaissance trade routes were opened to the new world to asia and the middle east and new varieties of red pigment and dye were imported into europe usually through venice genoa or seville and marseille venice was the major depot importing and manufacturing pigments for artists and dyers from the end of the 15th century the catalog of a venetian vendecolori or pigment seller from 1534 included vermilion and kermes
there were guilds of dyers who specialized in red in venice and other large europeans cities the rubia plant was used to make the most common dye it produced an orange-red or brick red color used to dye the clothes of merchants and artisans for the wealthy the dye used was kermes made from a tiny scale insect which fed on the branches and leaves of the oak tree for those with even more money there was polish cochineal also known as kermes vermilio or blood of saint john which was made from a related insect the margodes polonicus it made a more vivid red than ordinary kermes the finest and most expensive variety of red made from insects was the kermes of armenia (armenian cochineal also known as persian kirmiz) made by collecting and crushing porphyophora hamelii an insect which lived on the roots and stems of certain grasses the pigment and dye merchants of venice imported and sold all of these products and also manufactured their own color called venetian red which was considered the most expensive and finest red in europe its secret ingredient was arsenic which brightened the color
but early in the 16th century a brilliant new red appeared in europe when the spanish conquistador hernn corts and his soldiers conquered the aztec empire in 1519-1521 they discovered slowly that the aztecs had another treasure beside silver and gold they had the tiny cochineal a parasitic scale insect which lived on cactus plants which when dried and crushed made a magnificent red the cochineal in mexico was closely related to the kermes varieties of europe but unlike european kermes it could be harvested several times a year and it was ten times stronger than the kermes of poland it worked particularly well on silk satin and other luxury textiles in 1523 cortes sent the first shipment to spain soon cochineal began to arrive in european ports aboard convoys of spanish galleons
at first the guilds of dyers in venice and other cities banned cochineal to protect their local products but the superior quality of cochineal dye made it impossible to resist by the beginning of the 17th century it was the preferred luxury red for the clothing of cardinals bankers courtesans and aristocrats
the painters of the early renaissance used two traditional lake pigments made from mixing dye with either chalk or alum kermes lake made from kermes insects and madder lake made from the rubia tinctorum plant with the arrival of cochineal they had a third carmine which made a very fine crimson though it had a tendency to change color if not used carefully it was used by almost all the great painters of the 15th and 16th centuries including rembrandt vermeer rubens anthony van dyck diego velzquez and tintoretto later it was used by thomas gainsborough seurat and j.m.w turner
=== in the 18th and 19th centuries ===
during the french revolution red became a symbol of liberty and personal freedom used by the jacobins and other more radical parties many of them wore a red phrygian cap or liberty cap modeled after the caps worn by freed slaves in ancient rome during the height of the reign of terror women wearing red caps gathered around the guillotine to celebrate each execution they were called the furies of the guillotine the guillotines used during the reign of terror in 1792 and 1793 were painted red or made of red wood during the reign of terror a statue of a woman titled liberty painted red was placed in the square in front of the guillotine after the end of the reign of terror france went back to the blue white and red tricolor whose red was taken from the traditional color of saint denis the christian martyr and patron saint of paris
in the mid-19th century red became the color of a new political and social movement socialism it became the most common banner of the worker's movement of the french revolution of 1848 of the paris commune in 1870 and of socialist parties across europe (see red flags and revolution section below)
as the industrial revolution spread across europe chemists and manufacturers sought new red dyes that could be used for large-scale manufacture of textiles one popular color imported into europe from turkey and india in the 18th and early 19th century was turkey red known in france as rouge d'adrinople beginning in the 1740s this bright red color was used to dye or print cotton textiles in england the netherlands and france turkey red used madder as the colorant but the process was longer and more complicated involving multiple soaking of the fabrics in lye olive oil sheep's dung and other ingredients the fabric was more expensive but resulted in a fine bright and lasting red similar to carmine perfectly suited to cotton the fabric was widely exported from europe to africa the middle east and america in 19th century america it was widely used in making the traditional patchwork quilt
in 1826 the french chemist pierre-jean robiquet discovered the organic compound alizarin the powerful coloring ingredient of the madder root the most popular red dye of the time in 1868 german chemists carl graebe and liebermann were able to synthesize alizarin and to produce it from coal tar the synthetic red was cheaper and more lasting than the natural dye and the plantation of madder in europe and import of cochineal from latin america soon almost completely ceased
the 19th century also saw the use of red in art to create specific emotions not just to imitate nature it saw the systematic study of color theory and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other these studies were avidly followed by artists such as vincent van gogh describing his painting the night cafe to his brother theo in 1888 van gogh wrote i sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions the hall is blood red and pale yellow with a green billiard table in the center and four lamps of lemon yellow with rays of orange and green everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens.
=== in imperial china ===
red has been an important color in chinese culture religion industry fashion and court ritual since ancient times silk was woven and dyed as early as the han dynasty (25220 bc) china had a monopoly on the manufacture of silk until the 6th century ad when it was introduced into the byzantine empire in the 12th century it was introduced into europe
at the time of the han dynasty chinese red was a light red but during the tang dynasty new dyes and pigments were discovered the chinese used several different plants to make red dyes including the flowers of carthamus tinctorius the thorns and stems of a variety of sorghum plant called kao-liang and the wood of the sappanwood tree for pigments they used cinnabar which produced the famous vermillion or chinese red of chinese laquerware
red played an important role in chinese philosophy it was believed that the world was composed of five elements metal wood water fire and earth and that each had a color red was associated with fire each emperor chose the color that his fortune-tellers believed would bring the most prosperity and good fortune to his reign during the zhou han jin song and ming dynasties red considered a noble color and it was featured in all court ceremonies from coronations to sacrificial offerings and weddings
red was also a badge of rank during the song dynasty (9061279) officials of the top three ranks wore purple clothes those of the fourth and fifth wore bright red those of the sixth and seventh wore green and the eighth and ninth wore blue red was the color worn by the royal guards of honor and the color of the carriages of the imperial family when the imperial family traveled their servants and accompanying officials carried red and purple umbrellas of an official who had talent and ambition it was said he is so red he becomes purple.
red was also featured in chinese imperial architecture in the tang and song dynasties gates of palaces were usually painted red and nobles often painted their entire mansion red one of the most famous works of chinese literature a dream of red mansions by cao xueqin (17151763) was about the lives of noble women who passed their lives out of public sight within the walls of such mansions in later dynasties red was reserved for the walls of temples and imperial residences when the manchu rulers of the qing dynasty conquered the ming and took over the forbidden city and imperial palace in beijing all the walls gates beams and pillars were painted in red and gold
red is not often used in traditional chinese paintings which are usually black ink on white paper with a little green sometimes added for trees or plants but the round or square seals which contain the name of the artist are traditionally red
=== in the 20th and 21st century ===
in the 20th century red was the color of revolution it was the color of the bolshevik revolution in 1917 and of the chinese revolution of 1949 and later of the cultural revolution red was the color of communist parties from eastern europe to cuba to vietnam
in the late 19th and early 20th century the german chemical industry invented two new synthetic red pigments cadmium red which was the color of natural vermilion and mars red which was a synthetic red ochre the color of the very first natural red pigment
the french painter henri matisse (18691954) was one of the first prominent painters to use the new cadmium red he even tried without success to persuade the older and more traditional renoir his neighbor in the south of france to switch from vermilion to cadmium red
matisse was also one of the first 20th-century artists to make color the central element of the painting chosen to evoke emotions a certain blue penetrates your soul he wrote a certain red affects your blood pressure. he also was familiar with the way that complementary colors such as red and green strengthened each other when they were placed next to each other he wrote my choice of colors is not based on scientific theory it is based on observation upon feelings upon the real nature of each experience  i just try to find a color which corresponds to my feelings.
later in the century the american artist mark rothko (19031970) also used red in even simpler form in blocks of dark somber color on large canvases to inspire deep emotions rothko observed that color was only an instrument; his interest was in expressing human emotions tragedy ecstasy doom and so on.
rothko also began using the new synthetic pigments but not always with happy results in 1962 he donated to harvard university a series of large murals of the passion of christ whose predominant colors were dark pink and deep crimson he mixed mostly traditional colors to make the pink and crimson synthetic ultramarine cerulean blue and titanium white but he also used two new organic reds naphtol and lithol the naphtol did well but the lithol slowly changed color when exposed to light within five years the deep pinks and reds had begun to turn light blue and by 1979 the paintings were ruined and had to be taken down
== pigments and dyes ==
=== red lac red lake and crimson lake ===
red lac also called red lake crimson lake or carmine lake was an important red pigment in renaissance and baroque art since it was translucent thin layers of red lac were built up or glazed over a more opaque dark color to create a particularly deep and vivid color
unlike vermilion or red ochre made from minerals red lake pigments are made by mixing organic dyes made from insects or plants with white chalk or alum red lac was made from the gum lac the dark red resinous substance secreted by various scale insects particularly the laccifer lacca from india carmine lake was made from the cochineal insect from central and south america kermes lake came from a different scale insect kermes vermilio which thrived on oak trees around the mediterranean other red lakes were made from the rose madder plant and from the brazilwood tree
red lake pigments were an important part of the palette of 16th century venetian painters particularly titian but they were used in all periods since the red lakes were made from organic dyes they tended to be fugitive becoming unstable and fading when exposed to sunlight
=== food coloring ===
the most common synthetic food coloring today is allura red ac is a red azo dye that goes by several names including allura red food red 17 c.i 16035 fd&c red 40 it was originally manufactured from coal tar but now is mostly made from petroleum
in europe allura red ac is not recommended for consumption by children it is banned in denmark belgium france and switzerland and was also banned in sweden until the country joined the european union in 1994 the european union approves allura red ac as a food colorant but eu countries local laws banning food colorants are preserved
in the united states allura red ac is approved by the food and drug administration (fda) for use in cosmetics drugs and food it is used in some tattoo inks and is used in many products such as soft drinks children's medications and cotton candy on june 30 2010 the center for science in the public interest (cspi) called for the fda to ban red 40
because of public concerns about possible health risks associated with synthetic dyes many companies have switched to using natural pigments such as carmine made from crushing the tiny female cochineal insect this insect originating in mexico and central american was used to make the brilliant scarlet dyes of the european renaissance
== in science ==
=== seeing red ===
the human eye sees red when it looks at light with a wavelength between 620 and 740 nanometers light just past this range is called infrared or below red and cannot be seen by human eyes although it can be sensed as heat in the language of optics red is the color evoked by light that stimulates neither the s or the m (short and medium wavelength) cone cells of the retina combined with a fading stimulation of the l (long-wavelength) cone cells
primates can distinguish the full range of the colors of the spectrum visible to humans but many kinds of mammals such as dogs and cattle have dichromacy which means they can see blues and yellows but cannot distinguish red and green (both are seen as gray) bulls for instance cannot see the red color of the cape of a bullfighter but they are agitated by its movement (see color vision)
one theory for why primates developed sensitivity to red is that it allowed ripe fruit to be distinguished from unripe fruit and inedible vegetation this may have driven further adaptations by species taking advantage of this new ability such as the emergence of red faces
red light is used to help adapt night vision in low-light or night time as the rod cells in the human eye are not sensitive to red
red illumination was (and sometimes still is) used as a safelight while working in a darkroom as it does not expose most photographic paper and some films today modern darkrooms usually use an amber safelight
=== in color theory and on a computer screen ===
on the color wheel long used by painters and in traditional color theory red is one of the three primary colors along with blue and yellow painters in the renaissance mixed red and blue to make violet cennino cennini in his 15th century manual on painting wrote if you want to make a lovely violet colour take fine lac [red lake] ultramarine blue (the same amount of the one as of the other) with a binder he noted that it could also be made by mixing blue indigo and red hematite
in modern color theory also known as the rgb color model red green and blue are additive primary colors red green and blue light combined together makes white light and these three colors combined in different mixtures can produce nearly any other color this is the principle that is used to make all of the colors on your computer screen and your television for example purple on a computer screen is made by a similar formula to used by cennino cennini in the renaissance to make violet but using additive colors and light instead of pigment it is created by combining red and blue light at equal intensity on a black screen violet is made on a computer screen in a similar way but with a greater amount of blue light and less red light
so that the maximum number of colors can be accurately reproduced on your computer screen each color has been given a code number or srgb which tells your computer the intensity of the red green and blue components of that color the intensity of each component is measured on a scale of zero to 255 which means the complete list includes 16,777,216 distinct colors and shades the srgb number of pure red for example is 255 00 00 which means the red component is at its maximum intensity and there is no green or blue the srgb number for crimson is 220 20 60 which means that the red is slightly less intense and therefore darker there is some green which leans it toward orange and there is a larger amount of blue,which makes it slightly blue-violet
(see web colors and rgb color model)
=== why the sunset is red ===
as a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere to the eye some of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and airborne particles due to rayleigh scattering changing the final color of the beam that is seen colors with a shorter wavelength such as blue and green scatter more strongly and are removed from the light that finally reaches the eye at sunrise and sunset when the path of the sunlight through the atmosphere to the eye is longest the blue and green components are removed almost completely leaving the longer wavelength orange and red light the remaining reddened sunlight can also be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles which give the sky above the horizon its red glow
=== lasers ===
lasers emitting in the red region of the spectrum have been available since the invention of the ruby laser in 1960 in 1962 the red heliumneon laser was invented and these two types of lasers were widely used in many scientific applications including holography and in education red heliumneon lasers were used commercially in laserdisc players the use of red laser diodes became widespread with the commercial success of modern dvd players which use a 660 nm laser diode technology today red and red-orange laser diodes are widely available to the public in the form of extremely inexpensive laser pointers portable high-powered versions are also available for various applications more recently 671 nm diode-pumped solid state (dpss) lasers have been introduced to the market for all-dpss laser display systems particle image velocimetry raman spectroscopy and holography
red's wavelength has been an important factor in laser technologies red lasers used in early compact disc technologies are being replaced by blue lasers as red's longer wavelength causes the laser's recordings to take up more space on the disc than would blue-laser recordings
=== astronomy ===
mars is called the red planet because of the reddish color imparted to its surface by the abundant iron oxide present there
astronomical objects that are moving away from the observer exhibit a doppler red shift
jupiter's surface displays a great red spot caused by an oval-shaped mega storm south of the planet's equator
red giants are stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in their cores and switched to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in a shell that surrounds its core they have radii tens to hundreds of times larger than that of the sun however their outer envelope is much lower in temperature giving them an orange hue despite the lower energy density of their envelope red giants are many times more luminous than the sun due to their large size
red supergiants like betelgeuse and antares are the biggest variety of red giants they are huge in size with radii 200 to 800 times greater than our sun but relatively cool in temperature (3500-4500 k) causing their distinct red tint because they are shrinking rapidly in size they are surrounded by an envelope or skin much bigger than the star itself the envelope of betelgeuse is 250 times bigger than the star inside
a red dwarf is a small and relatively cool star which has a mass of less than half that of the sun and a surface temperature of less than 4,000 k red dwarfs are by far the most common type of star in the galaxy but due to their low luminosity from earth none is visible to the naked eye
=== fire ===
fire is often shown as red in art but flames are usually yellow orange or blue some elements exhibit a red color when burned calcium for example produces a brick-red when combusted
=== autumn leaves ===
the red of autumn leaves is produced by pigments called anthocyanins they are not present in the leaf throughout the growing season but are actively produced towards the end of summer they develop in late summer in the sap of the cells of the leaf and this development is the result of complex interactions of many influencesboth inside and outside the plant their formation depends on the breakdown of sugars in the presence of bright light as the level of phosphate in the leaf is reduced
during the summer growing season phosphate is at a high level it has a vital role in the breakdown of the sugars manufactured by chlorophyll but in the fall phosphate along with the other chemicals and nutrients moves out of the leaf into the stem of the plant when this happens the sugar-breakdown process changes leading to the production of anthocyanin pigments the brighter the light during this period the greater the production of anthocyanins and the more brilliant the resulting color display when the days of autumn are bright and cool and the nights are chilly but not freezing the brightest colorations usually develop
anthocyanins temporarily color the edges of some of the very young leaves as they unfold from the buds in early spring they also give the familiar color to such common fruits as cranberries red apples blueberries cherries strawberries and plums
anthocyanins are present in about 10% of tree species in temperate regions although in certain areasmost famously new englandup to 70% of tree species may produce the pigment in autumn forests they appear vivid in the maples oaks sourwood sweetgums dogwoods tupelos cherry trees and persimmons these same pigments often combine with the carotenoids colors to create the deeper orange fiery reds and bronzes typical of many hardwood species (see autumn leaf color)
=== blood and other reds in nature ===
oxygenated blood is red due to the presence of oxygenated hemoglobin that contains iron molecules with the iron components reflecting red light
when used to describe natural animal coloration red usually refers to a brownish reddish-brown or ginger color in this sense it is used to describe coat colors of reddish-brown cattle and dogs and in the names of various animal species or breeds such as red fox red squirrel red deer european robin red grouse red knot redstart redwing red setter red devon cattle etc this reddish-brown color is also meant when using the terms red ochre and red hair
