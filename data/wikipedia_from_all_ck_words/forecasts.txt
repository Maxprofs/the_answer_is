forecasting is the process of making predictions of the future based on past and present data and analysis of trends a commonplace example might be estimation of some variable of interest at some specified future date prediction is a similar but more general term both might refer to formal statistical methods employing time series cross-sectional or longitudinal data or alternatively to less formal judgmental methods usage can differ between areas of application for example in hydrology the terms forecast and forecasting are sometimes reserved for estimates of values at certain specific future times while the term prediction is used for more general estimates such as the number of times floods will occur over a long period
risk and uncertainty are central to forecasting and prediction it is generally considered good practice to indicate the degree of uncertainty attaching to forecasts in any case the data must be up to date in order for the forecast to be as accurate as possible
== categories of forecasting methods ==
=== qualitative vs quantitative methods ===
qualitative forecasting techniques are subjective based on the opinion and judgment of consumers experts they are appropriate when past data are not available they are usually applied to intermediate- or long-range decisions examples of qualitative forecasting methods are informed opinion and judgment the delphi method market research and historical life-cycle analogy
quantitative forecasting models are used to forecast future data as a function of past data they are appropriate to use when past numerical data is available and when it is reasonable to assume that some of the patterns in the data are expected to continue into the future these methods are usually applied to short- or intermediate-range decisions examples of quantitative forecasting methods are last period demand simple and weighted n-period moving averages simple exponential smoothing and multiplicative seasonal indexes
=== average approach ===
in this approach the predictions of all future values are equal to the mean of the past data this approach can be used with any sort of data where past data is available in time series notation
where is the past data
=== nave approach ===
nave forecasts are the most cost-effective forecasting model and provide a benchmark against which more sophisticated models can be compared in time series data using naive approach would produce forecasts that are equal to the last observed value this method works quite well for economic and financial time series which often have patterns that are difficult to reliably and accurately predict if the time series is believed to have seasonality seasonal naive approach may be more appropriate where the forecasts are equal to the value from last season the naive method may also use a drift which will take the last observation plus the average change from the first observation to the last observation in time series notation
=== drift method ===
a variation on the nave method is to allow the forecasts to increase or decrease over time where the amount of change over time (called the drift) is set to be the average change seen in the historical data so the forecast for time is given by
this is equivalent to drawing a line between the first and last observation and extrapolating it into the future
=== seasonal nave approach ===
the seasonal nave method accounts for seasonality by setting each prediction to be equal to the last observed value of the same season for example the prediction value for all subsequent months of april will be equal to the previous value observed for april the forecast for time is
where =seasonal period and is the smallest integer greater than 
the seasonal nave method is particularly useful for data that has a very high level of seasonality
=== time series methods ===
time series methods use historical data as the basis of estimating future outcomes
moving average
weighted moving average
kalman filtering
exponential smoothing
autoregressive moving average (arma)
autoregressive integrated moving average (arima)
e.g box-jenkins
seasonal arima or sarima
extrapolation
linear prediction
trend estimation
growth curve (statistics)
=== causal / econometric forecasting methods ===
some forecasting methods try to identify the underlying factors that might influence the variable that is being forecast for example including information about climate patterns might improve the ability of a model to predict umbrella sales forecasting models often take account of regular seasonal variations in addition to climate such variations can also be due to holidays and customs for example one might predict that sales of college football apparel will be higher during the football season than during the off season
several informal methods used in causal forecasting do not employ strict algorithms  but instead use the judgment of the forecaster some forecasts take account of past relationships between variables if one variable has for example been approximately linearly related to another for a long period of time it may be appropriate to extrapolate such a relationship into the future without necessarily understanding the reasons for the relationship
causal methods include
regression analysis includes a large group of methods for predicting future values of a variable using information about other variables these methods include both parametric (linear or non-linear) and non-parametric techniques
autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs (armax)
quantitative forecasting models are often judged against each other by comparing their in-sample or out-of-sample mean square error although some researchers have advised against this
=== judgmental methods ===
judgmental forecasting methods incorporate intuitive judgement opinions and subjective probability estimates judgmental forecasting is used in cases where there is lack of historical data or during completely new and unique market conditions
judgmental methods include
composite forecasts
cooke's method
delphi method
forecast by analogy
scenario building
statistical surveys
technology forecasting
=== artificial intelligence methods ===
artificial neural networks
group method of data handling
support vector machines
often these are done today by specialized programs loosely labeled
data mining
machine learning
pattern recognition
=== other methods ===
simulation
prediction market
probabilistic forecasting and ensemble forecasting
some socioeconomic forecasters often try to include a humanist factor they claim that humans through deliberate action can have a profound influence on the future they argue that it should be regarded a real possibility within our current socioeconomic system that its future may be influenced by to a varying degree individuals and small groups of individuals recent popular publications like capital in the twenty-first century are regarded as major contributors to the increasingly apparent possibility of such reality it is argued that the influence private and public investment have on our future can never be discomposed of the individual machiavelian human character all methods that disregard this factor can not only never accurately predict our socioeconomic future but can even be used as strong coercion tools such theories are generally regarded conspiracy theories but the increasingly worrying socioeconomic development in the world grants some of these theories a persistent credibility
== forecasting accuracy ==
the forecast error is the difference between the actual value and the forecast value for the corresponding period
where e is the forecast error at period t y is the actual value at period t and f is the forecast for period t
measures of aggregate error
business forecasters and practitioners sometimes use different terminology in the industry they refer to the pmad as the mape although they compute this as a volume weighted mape for more information see calculating demand forecast accuracy
limitations of errors
the two most popular measures of accuracy that incorporate the forecast error are the mean absolute error (mae) and the root mean squared error (rmse) thus these measures are considered to be scale-dependent that is they are on the same scale as the original data consequently these cannot be used to compare models of differing scales
percentage errors are simply forecast errors converted into percentages and are given by  a common accuracy measure that utilizes this is the mean absolute percentage error (mape) this allows for comparison between data on different scales however percentage errors are not quite meaningful when is close to or equal to zero which results in extreme values or simply being undefined

== seasonality and cyclic behaviour ==
=== seasonality ===
main article seasonality
seasonality is a characteristic of a time series in which the data experiences regular and predictable changes which recur every calendar year any predictable change or pattern in a time series that recurs or repeats over a one-year period can be said to be seasonal it is common in many situations such as grocery store or even in a medical examiners officethat the demand depends on the day of the week in such situations the forecasting procedure calculates the seasonal index of the season seven seasons one for each day which is the ratio of the average demand of that season (which is calculated by moving average or exponential smoothing using historical data corresponding only to that season) to the average demand across all seasons an index higher than 1 indicates that demand is higher than average an index less than 1 indicates that the demand is less than the average
=== cyclic behaviour ===
the cyclic behaviour of data takes place when there are regular fluctuations in the data which usually last for an interval of at least two years and when the length of the current cycle cannot be predetermined cyclic behavior is not to be confused with seasonal behavior seasonal fluctuations follow a consistent pattern each year so the period is always known as an example during the christmas period inventories of stores tend to increase in order to prepare for christmas shoppers as an example of cyclic behaviour the population of a particular natural ecosystem will exhibit cyclic behaviour when the population increases as its natural food source decreases and once the population is low the food source will recover and the population will start to increase again cyclic data cannot be accounted for using ordinary seasonal adjustment since it is not of fixed period
== applications ==
forecasting has applications in a wide range of fields where estimates of future conditions are useful not everything can be forecasted reliably if the factors that relate to what is being forecast are known and well understood and there is a significant amount of data that can be used very reliable forecasts can often be obtained if this is not the case or if the actual outcome is effected by the forecasts the reliability of the forecasts can be significantly lower
climate change and increasing energy prices have led to the use of egain forecasting for buildings this attempts to reduce the energy needed to heat the building thus reducing the emission of greenhouse gases forecasting is used in customer demand planning in everyday business for manufacturing and distribution companies
while the veracity of predictions for actual stock returns are disputed through reference to the efficient-market hypothesis forecasting of broad economic trends is common such analysis is provided by both non-profit groups as well as by for-profit private institutions (including brokerage houses and consulting companies)
forecasting has also been used to predict the development of conflict situations forecasters perform research that uses empirical results to gauge the effectiveness of certain forecasting models however research has shown that there is little difference between the accuracy of the forecasts of experts knowledgeable in the conflict situation and those by individuals who knew much less
similarly experts in some studies argue that role thinking does not contribute to the accuracy of the forecast the discipline of demand planning also sometimes referred to as supply chain forecasting embraces both statistical forecasting and a consensus process an important albeit often ignored aspect of forecasting is the relationship it holds with planning forecasting can be described as predicting what the future will look like whereas planning predicts what the future should look like there is no single right forecasting method to use selection of a method should be based on your objectives and your conditions (data etc.) a good place to find a method is by visiting a selection tree an example of a selection tree can be found here forecasting has application in many situations
supply chain management - forecasting can be used in supply chain management to ensure that the right product is at the right place at the right time accurate forecasting will help retailers reduce excess inventory and thus increase profit margin studies have shown that extrapolations are the least accurate while company earnings forecasts are the most reliable accurate forecasting will also help them meet consumer demand

== limitations ==
limitations pose barriers beyond which forecasting methods cannot reliably predict there are many events and values that cannot be forecast reliably events such as the roll of a die or the results of the lottery cannot be forecast because they are random events and there is no significant relationship in the data when the factors that lead to what is being forecast are not known or well understood such as in stock and foreign exchange markets forecasts are often inaccurate or wrong as there is not enough data about everything that effects these markets for the forecasts to be reliable in addition the outcomes of the forecasts of these markets change the behavior of those involved in the market further reducing forecast accuracy
=== performance limits of fluid dynamics equations ===
as proposed by edward lorenz in 1963 long range weather forecasts those made at a range of two weeks or more are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved extremely small errors in the initial input such as temperatures and winds within numerical models double every five days
=== complexity introduced by the technological singularity ===
the technological singularity is the hypothetical emergence of superintelligence through technological means since the capabilities of such intelligence would be difficult for an unaided human mind to comprehend the technological singularity is seen as an occurrence beyond which events cannot be predicted
ray kurzweil predicts the singularity will occur around 2045 while vernor vinge predicts it will happen some time before 2030
