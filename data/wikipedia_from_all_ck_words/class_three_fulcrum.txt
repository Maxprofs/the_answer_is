a lever (/livr/ or us /lvr/) is a machine consisting of a beam or rigid rod pivoted at a fixed hinge or fulcrum it is one of the six simple machines identified by renaissance scientists the word entered english about 1300 from old french in which the word was levier this sprang from the stem of the verb lever meaning to raise the verb in turn goes back to the latin levare itself from the adjective levis meaning light (as in not heavy") the word's ultimate origin is the proto-indo-european (pie) stem legwh- meaning light easy or nimble among other things the pie stem also gave rise to the english word light a lever amplifies an input force to provide a greater output force which is said to provide leverage the ratio of the output force to the input force is the mechanical advantage of the lever
== early use ==
the earliest remaining writings regarding levers date from the 3rd century bc and were provided by archimedes give me a place to stand and i shall move the earth with it is a remark of archimedes who formally stated the correct mathematical principle of levers (quoted by pappus of alexandria) the distance required to do this might be exemplified in astronomical terms as the approximate distance to the circinus galaxy (roughly 3.6 times the distance to the andromeda galaxy) - about 9 million light years
it is assumed that in ancient egypt constructors used the lever to move and uplift obelisks weighing more than 100 tons
== force and levers ==
a lever is a beam connected to ground by a hinge or pivot called a fulcrum the ideal lever does not dissipate or store energy which means there is no friction in the hinge or bending in the beam in this case the power into the lever equals the power out and the ratio of output to input force is given by the ratio of the distances from the fulcrum to the points of application of these forces this is known as the law of the lever
the mechanical advantage of a lever can be determined by considering the balance of moments or torque t about the fulcrum
where m1 is the input force to the lever and m2 is the output force the distances a and b are the perpendicular distances between the forces and the fulcrum
the mechanical advantage of the lever is the ratio of output force to input force
this relationship shows that the mechanical advantage can be computed from ratio of the distances from the fulcrum to where the input and output forces are applied to the lever assuming no losses due to friction flexibility or wear
== classes of levers ==
levers are classified by the relative positions of the fulcrum and the input and output forces it is common to call the input force the effort and the output force the load or the resistance this allows the identification of three classes of levers by the relative locations of the fulcrum the resistance and the effort
class 1 fulcrum in the middle the effort is applied on one side of the fulcrum and the resistance on the other side for example a seesaw a crowbar or a pair of scissors mechanical advantage may be greater or less than 1
class 2 resistance in the middle the effort is applied on one side of the resistance and the fulcrum is located on the other side for example a wheelbarrow a nutcracker a bottle opener or the brake pedal of a car mechanical advantage is always greater than 1
class 3 effort in the middle the resistance is on one side of the effort and the fulcrum is located on the other side for example a pair of tweezers or the human mandible mechanical advantage is always less than 1
these cases are described by the mnemonic fre 123 where the fulcrum is in the middle for the 1st class lever the resistance is in the middle for the 2nd class lever and the effort is in the middle for the 3rd class lever
== law of the lever ==
the lever is a movable bar that pivots on a fulcrum attached to a fixed point the lever operates by applying forces at different distances from the fulcrum or a pivot
assuming the lever does not dissipate or store energy the power into the lever must equal the power out of the lever as the lever rotates around the fulcrum points farther from this pivot move faster than points closer to the pivot therefore a force applied to a point farther from the pivot must be less than the force located at a point closer in because power is the product of force and velocity
if a and b are distances from the fulcrum to points a and b and the force fa applied to a is the input and the force fb applied at b is the output the ratio of the velocities of points a and b is given by a/b so we have the ratio of the output force to the input force or mechanical advantage is given by
this is the law of the lever which was proven by archimedes using geometric reasoning it shows that if the distance a from the fulcrum to where the input force is applied (point a) is greater than the distance b from fulcrum to where the output force is applied (point b) then the lever amplifies the input force on the other hand if the distance a from the fulcrum to the input force is less than the distance b from the fulcrum to the output force then the lever reduces the input force
the use of velocity in the static analysis of a lever is an application of the principle of virtual work
== virtual work and the law of the lever ==
a lever is modeled as a rigid bar connected to a ground frame by a hinged joint called a fulcrum the lever is operated by applying an input force fa at a point a located by the coordinate vector ra on the bar the lever then exerts an output force fb at the point b located by rb the rotation of the lever about the fulcrum p is defined by the rotation angle in radians
let the coordinate vector of the point p that defines the fulcrum be rp and introduce the lengths
which are the distances from the fulcrum to the input point a and to the output point b respectively
now introduce the unit vectors ea and eb from the fulcrum to the point a and b so
the velocity of the points a and b are obtained as
where ea and eb are unit vectors perpendicular to ea and eb respectively
the angle is the generalized coordinate that defines the configuration of the lever and the generalized force associated with this coordinate is given by
where fa and fb are components of the forces that are perpendicular to the radial segments pa and pb the principle of virtual work states that at equilibrium the generalized force is zero that is
thus the ratio of the output force fb to the input force fa is obtained as
which is the mechanical advantage of the lever
this equation shows that if the distance a from the fulcrum to the point a where the input force is applied is greater than the distance b from fulcrum to the point b where the output force is applied then the lever amplifies the input force if the opposite is true that the distance from the fulcrum to the input point a is less than from the fulcrum to the output point b then the lever reduces the magnitude of the input force
this is the law of the lever which was proven by archimedes using geometric reasoning
== using a rope as a lever ==
you understand what a lever is but can you use a rope as a lever you can if you are using is as shown in the figure arrange a strong column at a steep angle apply a firm attachment from the rope to the column and the object to be lifted and apply the force horizontally and get a great multiplier of force if one combines the mechanical advantage of pulleys in the horizontal force applier you could get even greater lifting force picture the application in the figure and in this case you could get great lift upward then add planks of wood to support the load at height reset and lift again and add more blocking and lift repeat this technology has been lost in history as the use of winches with low friction wheeled pulleys and reduction gearing powered by steam and then electricity (along with steel cable replacing rope) took over this primitive technology
