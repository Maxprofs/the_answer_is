diversity
estimates accepted described living species molluscs vary maximum species david nicol estimated probable total number living molluscs freshwater gastropods terrestrial bivalvia would comprise total five classes less living molluscs chapman estimated number described living species haszprunar estimated named species include named marine organisms molluscs second arthropods numbers living animal speciesfar behind arthropods well ahead chordates living species total estimated fossil species although total number mollusc species ever existed whether preserved must many times greater number alive today
molluscs varied forms animal phylum include snails slugs gastropods clams bivalves squids cephalopods lesserknown similarly distinctive subgroups majority species still live oceans seashores abyssal zone form significant part freshwater fauna terrestrial ecosystems molluscs extremely diverse tropical temperate regions found latitudes known mollusc species gastropods cephalopoda squid cuttlefish octopuses among neurologically advanced invertebrates giant squid recently observed alive adult form one largest invertebrates recently caught specimen colossal squid m ft long weighing kg lb may overtaken
freshwater terrestrial molluscs appear exceptionally vulnerable extinction estimates numbers nonmarine molluscs vary widely partly many regions thoroughly surveyed also shortage specialists identify animals one area species however iucn red list threatened species included nearly endangered nonmarine molluscs comparison great majority mollusc species marine appeared red list recorded extinctions since year molluscs consisting almost entirely nonmarine species
generalized mollusc
great range anatomical diversity among molluscs many textbooks start subject molluscan anatomy describing called archimollusc hypothetical generalized mollusc hypothetical ancestral mollusc ham illustrate common features found within phylum depiction rather similar modern monoplacophorans suggest may resemble early molluscs
generalized mollusc bilaterally symmetrical single limpetlike shell top shell secreted mantle covering upper surface underside consists single muscular foot visceral mass visceropallium soft nonmuscular metabolic region mollusc contains body organs
mantle mantle cavity
mantle cavity fold mantle encloses significant amount space lined epidermis exposed according habitat sea fresh water air cavity rear earliest molluscs position varies group group anus pair osphradia chemical sensors incoming lane hindmost pair gills exit openings nephridia kidneys gonads reproductive organs mantle cavity whole soft body bivalves lies within enlarged mantle cavity
shell
mantle edge secretes shell secondarily absent number taxonomic groups nudibranchs consists mainly chitin conchiolin protein hardened calcium carbonate except outermost layer almost cases conchiolin see periostracum molluscs never use phosphate construct hard parts questionable exception cobcrephora mollusc shells composed mainly aragonite gastropods lay eggs hard shell use calcite sometimes traces aragonite construct eggshells
shell consists three layers outer layer periostracum made organic matter middle layer made columnar calcite inner layer consisting laminated calcite often nacreous
foot
underside consists muscular foot adapted different purposes different classes foot carries pair statocysts act balance sensors gastropods secretes mucus lubricant aid movement forms top shell limpets foot acts sucker attaching animal hard surface vertical muscles clamp shell molluscs vertical muscles pull foot exposed soft parts shell bivalves foot adapted burrowing sediment cephalopods used jet propulsion tentacles arms derived foot
circulatory system
molluscs circulatory systems mainly open although molluscs coelomates coeloms reduced fairly small spaces enclosing heart gonads main body cavity hemocoel blood coelomic fluid circulate encloses internal organs hemocoelic spaces act efficient hydrostatic skeleton blood contains respiratory pigment hemocyanin oxygencarrier heart consists one pairs atria auricles receive oxygenated blood gills pump ventricle pumps aorta main artery fairly short opens hemocoel
atria heart also function part excretory system filtering waste products blood dumping coelom urine pair nephridia little kidneys rear connected coelom extracts reusable materials urine dumps additional waste products ejects via tubes discharge mantle cavity
respiration
molluscs one pair gills even one gill generally gills rather like feathers shape although species gills filaments one side divide mantle cavity water enters near bottom exits near top filaments three kinds cilia one drives water current mantle cavity two help keep gills clean osphradia detect noxious chemicals possibly sediment entering mantle cavity gills cilia may stop beating unwelcome intrusions ceased gill incoming blood vessel connected hemocoel outgoing one heart
eating digestion excretion
members mollusk family use intracellular digestion function molluscs muscular mouths radulae tongues bearing many rows chitinous teeth replaced rear wear radula primarily functions scrape bacteria algae rocks associated odontophore cartilaginous supporting organ radula unique molluscs equivalent animal
molluscs mouths also contain glands secrete slimy mucus food sticks beating cilia tiny hairs drive mucus towards stomach mucus forms long string called food string
tapered rear end stomach projecting slightly hindgut prostyle backwardpointing cone feces mucus rotated cilia acts bobbin winding mucus string onto mucus string reaches prostyle acidity stomach makes mucus less sticky frees particles
particles sorted yet another group cilia send smaller particles mainly minerals prostyle eventually excreted larger ones mainly food sent stomachs cecum pouch exit digested sorting process means perfect
periodically circular muscles hindguts entrance pinch excrete piece prostyle preventing prostyle growing large anus part mantle cavity swept outgoing lane current created gills carnivorous molluscs usually simpler digestive systems
head largely disappeared bivalves mouth equipped labial palps two side mouth collect detritus mucus
nervous system
molluscs two pairs main nerve cords three bivalves visceral cords serving internal organs pedal ones serving foot pairs run level gut include ganglia local control centers important parts body pairs corresponding ganglia sides body linked commissures relatively large bundles nerves ganglia gut cerebral ganglia sit esophagus gullet handle messages eyes pedal ganglia control foot esophagus commissure connections cerebral ganglia encircle esophagus nerve ring
brain species one encircles esophagus molluscs head eyes pair sensorcontaining tentacles also head detect chemicals vibrations touch
reproduction
simplest molluscan reproductive system relies external fertilization complex variations produce eggs may emerge trochophore larvae complex veliger larvae miniature adults two gonads sit next coelom small cavity surrounds heart shed ova sperm nephridia extract gametes coelom emit mantle cavity molluscs use system remain one sex lives rely external fertilization molluscs use internal fertilization andor hermaphrodites functioning sexes methods require complex reproductive systems
basic molluscan larva trochophore planktonic feeds floating food particles using two bands cilia around equator sweep food mouth uses cilia drive stomach uses cilia expel undigested remains anus new tissue grows bands mesoderm interior apical tuft anus pushed apart animal grows trochophore stage often succeeded veliger stage prototroch equatorial band cilia nearest apical tuft develops velum veil pair ciliabearing lobes larva swims eventually larva sinks seafloor metamorphoses adult form metamorphosis usual state molluscs cephalopods differ exhibiting direct development hatchling miniaturized form adult
ecology
feeding
molluscs herbivorous grazing algae filter feeders grazing two feeding strategies predominant feed microscopic filamentous algae often using radula rake comb filaments sea floor others feed macroscopic plants kelp rasping plant surface radula employ strategy plant large enough mollusc sit smaller macroscopic plants often eaten larger counterparts filter feeders molluscs feed straining suspended matter food particle water typically passing water gills bivalves filter feeders
cephalopods primarily predatory radula takes secondary role jaws tentacles food acquisition monoplacophoran neopilina uses radula usual fashion diet includes protists xenophyophore stannophyllum sacoglossan seaslugs suck sap algae using onerow radula pierce cell walls whereas dorid nudibranchs vetigastropoda feed sponges others feed hydroids extensive list molluscs unusual feeding habits available appendix graham molluscan diets journal molluscan studies
classification
opinions vary number classes molluscs example table shows eight living classes two extinct ones although unlikely form clade older works combine caudofoveata solenogasters one class aplacophora two commonly recognized classes known fossils
classification higher taxa groups remains problematic phylogenetic study suggests polyplacophora form clade monophyletic aplacophora additionally suggests sister taxon relationship exists bivalvia gastropoda
evolution
fossil record
good evidence exists appearance gastropods cephalopods bivalves cambrian period million years ago however evolutionary history emergence molluscs ancestral group lophotrochozoa diversification wellknown living fossil forms still vigorously debated
debate occurs whether ediacaran early cambrian fossils really molluscs kimberella million years ago described paleontologists mollusclike others unwilling go probable bilaterian even sharper debate whether wiwaxia million years ago mollusc much centers whether feeding apparatus type radula similar polychaete worms nicholas butterfield opposes idea wiwaxia mollusc written earlier microfossils million years ago fragments genuinely mollusclike radula appears contradict concept ancestral molluscan radula mineralized
however helcionellids first appear million years ago early cambrian rocks siberia china thought early molluscs rather snaillike shells shelled molluscs therefore predate earliest trilobites although helcionellid fossils millimeters long specimens centimeters long also found limpetlike shapes tiny specimens suggested juveniles larger ones adults

molluscs generally regarded members lophotrochozoa group defined trochophore larvae case living lophophorata feeding structure called lophophore members lophotrochozoa annelid worms seven marine phyla diagram right summarizes phylogeny presented
relationships members family tree uncertain difficult identify features inherited last common ancestor molluscs example uncertain whether ancestral mollusc metameric composed repeating unitsif would suggest origin annelidlike worm scientists disagree giribet colleagues concluded repetition gills foots retractor muscles later developments sigwart concluded ancestral mollusc metameric foot used creeping shell mineralized one particular branch family tree shell conchiferans thought evolved spicules small spines aplacophorans difficult reconcile embryological origins spicules
molluscan shell appears originated mucus coating eventually stiffened cuticle would impermeable thus forced development sophisticated respiratory apparatus form gills eventually cuticle would become mineralized using genetic machinery engrailed bilaterian skeletons first mollusc shell almost certainly reinforced mineral aragonite
evolutionary relationships within molluscs also debated diagrams show two widely supported reconstructions
morphological analyses tend recover conchiferan clade receives less support molecular analyses although results also lead unexpected paraphylies instance scattering bivalves throughout mollusc groups
however analysis using morphological molecular phylogenetics comparisons concluded molluscs monophyletic particular scaphopoda bivalvia separate monophyletic lineages unrelated remaining molluscan classes traditional phylum mollusca polyphyletic made monophyletic scaphopods bivalves excluded analysis managed recover traditional conchiferan aculiferan groups similarly concluded molluscs monophyletic time suggesting solenogastres closely related nonmolluscan taxa used outgroup molluscs current molecular data insufficient constrain molluscan phylogeny since methods used determine confidence clades prone overestimation risky place much emphasis even areas different studies agree rather eliminating unlikely relationships latest studies add new permutations internal molluscan relationships even bringing conchiferan hypothesis question
