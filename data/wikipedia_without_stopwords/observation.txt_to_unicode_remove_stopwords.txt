observation science
scientific method requires observations nature formulate test hypotheses consists steps
asking question natural phenomenon
making observations phenomenon
hypothesizing explanation phenomenon
predicting logical consequence hypothesis
testing hypothesis experiment observational study field study
creating conclusion data gathered experiment forming revisednew hypothesis repeating process
observations play role second fifth steps scientific method however need reproducibility requires observations different observers comparable human sense impressions subjective qualitative making difficult record compare theed shared observers counting many standard units comparable object measurement reduces observation number recorded two observations result number equal within resolution process
senses limited subject errors perception optical illusions scientific instruments developed magnify human powers observation weighing scales clocks telescopes microscopes thermometers cameras tape recorders also translate perceptible form events unobservable human senses indicator dyes voltmeters spectrometers infrared cameras oscilloscopes interferometers geiger counters xray machines radio receivers
one problem encountered throughout scientific fields observation may affect process observed resulting different outcome process unobserved called observer effect example normally possible check air pressure automobile tire without letting air thereby changing pressure however fields science possible reduce effects observation insignificance using better instruments
considered physical process forms observation human instrumental involve amplification thus thermodynamically irreversible processes increasing entropy
observational paradoxes
specific fields science results observation differ depending factors important everyday observation usually illustrated paradoxes event appears different observed two different points view seeming violate common sense
relativity relativistic physics deals velocities close speed light found different observers may observe different values length time rates mass many properties object depending observers velocity relative object example twin paradox one twin goes trip near speed light comes home younger twin stayed home paradox time passes slower rate measured frame moving respect object relativistic physics observation must always qualified specifying state motion observer reference frame
quantum mechanics quantum mechanics deals behavior small objects possible observe system without changing system observer must considered part system observed isolation quantum objects represented wave function often exists superposition mixture different states however observation made determine actual location state object always finds object single state mixture interaction observation process appears collapse wave function single state interaction isolated wave function external world results wave function collapse called observation measurement whether part deliberate observation process
biases
human senses function like video camcorder impartially recording observations human perception occurs complex unconscious process abstraction certain details incoming sense data noticed remembered rest forgotten kept thrown away depends internal model representation world called psychologists schema built entire lives data fitted schema later events remembered memory gaps may even filled plausible data mind makes fit model called reconstructive memory much attention various perceived data given depends internal value system judges important individual thus two people view event come away entirely different perceptions even disagreeing simple facts eyewitness testimony notoriously unreliable
several important ways observations affected human psychology given
confirmation bias
human observations biased toward confirming observers conscious unconscious expectations view world see expect see psychology called confirmation bias since object scientific research discovery new phenomena bias caused new discoveries overlooked one example discovery xrays also result erroneous scientific support widely held cultural myths example scientific racism supported ideas racial superiority early th century correct scientific technique emphasizes careful recording observations separating experimental observations conclusions drawn techniques blind double blind experiments minimize observational bias
cargo cult science
another bias become prevalent advent big science large rewards new discoveries bias favor researchers desired hypothesis outcome see want see called pathological science cargo cult science different deliberate falsification results happen goodfaith researchers researchers great incentive desire given outcome misinterpret misjudge results even persuade seen something havent possible examples mistaken discoveries caused bias martian canals n rays polywater cold fusion perpetual motion machines recent decades seen scientific scandals caused researchers playing fast loose observational methods order get pet theories published type bias rampant pseudoscience correct scientific techniques followed main defense bias besides correct research techniques peer review repetition experiment observation researchers incentive bias example emerging practice competitive field biotechnology require physical results experiments serums tissue cultures made available competing laboratories independent testing
processing bias
modern scientific instruments extensively process observations presented human senses particularly computerized instruments sometimes question data processing chain observing ends drawing conclusions begins recently become issue digitally enhanced images published experimental data papers scientific journals images enhanced bring features researcher wants emphasize also effect supporting researchers conclusions form bias difficult quantify scientific journals begun set detailed standards types image processing allowed research results computerized instruments often keep copy raw data sensors processing ultimate defense processing bias similarly scientific standards require preservation original unenhanced raw versions images used research data
observational bias
observational bias occurs researchers look think find positive results easy record observations called streetlight effect
observations philosophy
observe always everything result change get used thinking nothing nature loves well change existing forms make new ones like
observation philosophical terms process filtering sensory information thought process input received via hearing sight smell taste touch analyzed either rational irrational thought see parent beat child observe action either good bad deductions behaviors good bad may based way preferences building relationships study consequences resulting observed behavior passage time impressions stored consciousness many related observations together resulting relationships consequences permit individual build construct moral implications behavior
