replication transcriptionedit
shortly viral capsid enters cell enzyme called reverse transcriptase liberates singlestranded rna genome attached viral proteins copies complementary dna cdna molecule process reverse transcription extremely errorprone resulting mutations may cause drug resistance allow virus evade bodys immune system reverse transcriptase also ribonuclease activity degrades viral rna synthesis cdna well dnadependent dna polymerase activity creates sense dna antisense cdna together cdna complement form doublestranded viral dna transported cell nucleus integration viral dna host cells genome carried another viral enzyme called integrase
integrated viral dna may lie dormant latent stage hiv infection actively produce virus certain cellular transcription factors need present important nfb nf kappa b upregulated tcells become activated means cells likely killed hiv currently fighting infection

recombinationedit
two rna genomes encapsidated hiv particle see structure genome hiv upon infection replication catalyzed reverse transcriptase recombination two genomes occur recombination occurs singlestrand rna genomes reverse transcribed form dna reverse transcription nascent dna switch multiple times two copies viral rna form recombination known copychoice recombination events may occur throughout genome events per genome may occur replication cycle events rapidly shuffle genetic information transmitted parental progeny genomes
viral recombination produces genetic variation likely contributes evolution resistance antiretroviral therapy recombination may also contribute principle overcoming immune defenses host yet adaptive advantages genetic variation realized two viral genomes packaged individual infecting virus particles need arisen separate progenitor parental viruses differing genetic constitution unknown often mixed packaging occurs natural conditions
bonhoeffer et al suggested template switching reverse transcriptase acts repair process deal breaks ssrna genome addition hu temin suggested recombination adaptation repair damage rna genomes strand switching copychoice recombination reverse transcriptase could generate undamaged copy genomic dna two damaged ssrna genome copies view adaptive benefit recombination hiv could explain hiv particle contains two complete genomes rather one furthermore view recombination repair process implies benefit repair occur replication cycle benefit realized whether two genomes differ genetically view recombination hiv repair process generation recombinational variation would consequence cause evolution template switching
hiv infection causes chronic ongoing inflammation production reactive oxygen species thus hiv genome may vulnerable oxidative damages including breaks singlestranded rna hiv well viruses generally successful infection depends overcoming host defensive strategies often include production genomedamaging reactive oxygen thus michod et al suggested recombination viruses adaptation repair genome damages recombinational variation byproduct may provide separate benefit

diagnosisedit
many hivpositive people unaware infected virus example less sexually active urban population africa tested proportion even lower rural populations furthermore pregnant women attending urban health facilities counselled tested receive test results proportion even lower rural health facilities since donors may therefore unaware infection donor blood blood products used medicine medical research routinely screened hiv
hiv testing initially enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa detect antibodies hiv specimens nonreactive result initial elisa considered hivnegative unless new exposure infected partner partner unknown hiv status occurred specimens reactive elisa result retested duplicate result either duplicate test reactive specimen reported repeatedly reactive undergoes confirmatory testing specific supplemental test eg western blot less commonly immunofluorescence assay ifa specimens repeatedly reactive elisa positive ifa reactive western blot considered hivpositive indicative hiv infection specimens repeatedly elisareactive occasionally provide indeterminate western blot result may either incomplete antibody response hiv infected person nonspecific reactions uninfected person
although ifa used confirm infection ambiguous cases assay widely used general second specimen collected month later retested persons indeterminate western blot results although much less commonly available nucleic acid testing eg viral rna proviral dna amplification method also help diagnosis certain situations addition tested specimens might provide inconclusive results low quantity specimen situations second specimen collected tested hiv infection
modern hiv testing extremely accurate single screening test correct time chance falsepositive result standard twostep testing protocol estimated low risk population testing post exposure recommended initially six weeks three months six months
latest recommendations cdc show hiv testing must start immunoassay combination test hiv hiv antibodies p antigen negative result rules hiv exposure positive one must followed hiv antibody differentiation immunoassay detect present gives rise four possible scenarios
