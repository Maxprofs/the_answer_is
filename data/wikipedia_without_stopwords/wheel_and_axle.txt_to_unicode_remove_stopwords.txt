mechanical advantage
simple machine called wheel axle refers assembly formed two disks cylinders different diameters mounted rotate together around axis forces applied edges two disks cylinders provide mechanical advantage used wheel cart smaller cylinder axle wheel used windlass winch similar applications see medieval mining lift right smaller cylinder may separate axle mounted bearings cannot used separately
assuming wheel axle dissipate store energy power generated forces applied wheel must equal power axle wheel axle system rotates around bearings points circumference edge wheel move faster points circumference edge axle therefore force applied edge wheel must less force applied edge axle power product force velocity
let b distances center bearing edges wheel axle b input force fa applied edge wheel force fb edge axle b output ratio velocities points b given ab ratio output force input force mechanical advantage given
mechanical advantage simple machine like wheel axle computed ratio resistance effort larger ratio greater multiplication force torque created distance achieved varying radii axle andor wheel amount mechanical advantage may gained manner size wheel may increased inconvenient extent case system combination wheels often toothed gears used wheel axle type lever system wheels axles like compound lever
