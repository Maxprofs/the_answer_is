a kite is traditionally a tethered heavier-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag a kite consists of wings tethers and anchors kites have a bridle to guide the face of the kite at the correct angle so the wind can lift it a kite may have fixed or moving anchors
the lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air flows around the kite's surface producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings the interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind the resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of one or more of the lines or tethers to which the kite is attached the anchor point of the kite line may be static or moving (e.g. the towing of a kite by a running person boat free-falling anchors as in paragliders and fugitive parakites or vehicle)
the same principles of fluid flow apply in liquids and kites are also used under water
a hybrid tethered craft comprising both a lighter-than-air balloon as well as a kite lifting surface is called a kytoon
kites have a long and varied history and many different types are flown individually and at festivals worldwide kites may be flown for recreation art or other practical uses sport kites can be flown in aerial ballet sometimes as part of a competition power kites are multi-line steerable kites designed to generate large forces which can be used to power activities such as kite surfing kite landboarding kite fishing kite buggying and a new trend snow kiting even man-lifting kites have been made
== history ==
kites were invented in china where materials ideal for kite building were readily available silk fabric for sail material fine high-tensile-strength silk for flying line and resilient bamboo for a strong lightweight framework
the kite has been claimed as the invention of the 5th-century bc chinese philosophers mozi (also mo di) and lu ban (also gongshu ban) by 549 ad paper kites were certainly being flown as it was recorded that in that year a paper kite was used as a message for a rescue mission ancient and medieval chinese sources describe kites being used for measuring distances testing the wind lifting men signaling and communication for military operations the earliest known chinese kites were flat (not bowed) and often rectangular later tailless kites incorporated a stabilizing bowline kites were decorated with mythological motifs and legendary figures some were fitted with strings and whistles to make musical sounds while flying from china kites were introduced to cambodia india japan korea and the western world
after its introduction into india the kite further evolved into the fighter kite known as the patang in india where thousands are flown every year on festivals such as makar sankranti
kites were known throughout polynesia as far as new zealand with the assumption being that the knowledge diffused from china along with the people anthropomorphic kites made from cloth and wood were used in religious ceremonies to send prayers to the gods polynesian kite traditions are used by anthropologists get an idea of early primitive asian traditions that are believed to have at one time existed in asia
kites were late to arrive in europe although windsock-like banners were known and used by the romans stories of kites were first brought to europe by marco polo towards the end of the 13th century and kites were brought back by sailors from japan and malaysia in the 16th and 17th centuries although they were initially regarded as mere curiosities by the 18th and 19th centuries kites were being used as vehicles for scientific research
in 1750 benjamin franklin published a proposal for an experiment to prove that lightning was caused by electricity by flying a kite in a storm that appeared capable of becoming a lightning storm it is not known whether franklin ever performed his experiment but on may 10 1752 thomas-franois dalibard of france conducted a similar experiment (using a 40-foot (12 m) iron rod instead of a kite) and extracted electrical sparks from a cloud
kites were also instrumental in the research of the wright brothers when developing the first airplane in the late 1800s over the next 70 years many new kite designs were developed and often patented these included eddy's tail-less diamond kite the tetrahedral kite the flexible kite the sled kite and the parafoil kite which helped to develop modern hang-gliders in fact the period from 1860 to about 1910 became the golden age of kiting kites started to be used for scientific purposes especially in meteorology aeronautics wireless communications and photography many different designs of man-lifting kite were developed as well as power kites
the development of mechanically powered airplane diminished interest in kites world war ii saw a limited use of kites for military purposes (see focke achgelis fa 330 for an example) since then they are used mainly for recreation
== materials ==
designs often emulate flying insects birds and other beasts both real and mythical the finest chinese kites are made from split bamboo (usually golden bamboo) covered with silk and hand painted on larger kites clever hinges and latches allow the kite to be disassembled and compactly folded for storage or transport cheaper mass-produced kites are often made from printed polyester rather than silk
tails are used for some single-line kite designs to keep the kite's nose pointing into the wind spinners and spinsocks can be attached to the flying line for visual effect there are rotating wind socks which spin like a turbine on large display kites these tails spinners and spinsocks can be 50 feet (15 m) long or more
modern aerobatic kites use two or four lines to allow fine control of the kite's angle to the wind traction kites may have an additional line to de-power the kite and quick-release mechanisms to disengage flyer and kite in an emergency
== practical uses ==
kites have been used for human flight military applications science and meteorology photography lifting radio antennas generating power aerodynamics experiments and much more
=== military applications ===
kites have been used for military purposes in the past such as signaling delivery of munitions and for observation both by lifting an observer above the field of battle and by using kite aerial photography
according to samguk sagi in 637 kim yu-sin a korean general of silla rallied his troops to defeat rebels by lofting a kite with a straw man which looked like a burning ball flying to the sky
russian chronicles mention prince oleg of novgorod use of kites during the siege of constantinople in 906 and he crafted horses and men of paper armed and gilded and lifted them into the air over the city the greeks saw them and feared
kites were also used by admiral yi of the joseon dynasty (1392-1910) of korea during the japanese invasions of korea (15921598) admiral yi commanded his navy using kites his kites had specific markings directing his fleet to perform various orders
in the modern era the british army used kites to haul human lookouts into the air for observation purposes using the kites developed by samuel franklin cody barrage kites were used to protect shipping during the second world war kites were also used for anti-aircraft target practice kites and kytoons were used for lofting communications antenna submarines lofted observers in rotary kites
=== science and meteorology ===
kites have been used for scientific purposes such as benjamin franklin's famous experiment proving that lightning is electricity kites were the precursors to the traditional aircraft and were instrumental in the development of early flying craft alexander graham bell experimented with very large man-lifting kites as did the wright brothers and lawrence hargrave kites had a historical role in lifting scientific instruments to measure atmospheric conditions for weather forecasting
=== radio aerials and light beacons ===
kites can be used for radio purposes by kites carrying antennas for mf lf or vlf-transmitters this method was used for the reception station of the first transatlantic transmission by marconi captive balloons may be more convenient for such experiments because kite-carried antennas require a lot of wind which may be not always possible with heavy equipment and a ground conductor it must be taken into account during experiments that a conductor carried by a kite can lead to a high voltage toward ground which can endanger people and equipment if suitable precautions (grounding through resistors or a parallel resonant-circuit tuned to transmission frequency) are not taken
kites can be used to carry light effects such as lightsticks or battery powered lights
=== kite traction ===
kites can be used to pull people and vehicles downwind efficient foil-type kites such as power kites can also be used to sail upwind under the same principles as used by other sailing craft provided that lateral forces on the ground or in the water are redirected as with the keels center boards wheels and ice blades of traditional sailing craft in the last two decades several kite sailing sports have become popular such as kite buggying kite landboarding kite boating and kite surfing snow kiting has also become popular in recent years
kite sailing opens several possibilities not available in traditional sailing
wind speeds are greater at higher altitudes
kites may be manoeuvered dynamically which increases the force available dramatically
there is no need for mechanical structures to withstand bending forces vehicles or hulls can be very light or dispensed with all together
=== underwater kites ===
underwater kites are being developed to harvest renewable power from the flow of water
== cultural uses ==
kite festivals are a popular form of entertainment throughout the world they include large local events traditional festivals which have been held for hundreds of years and major international festivals which bring in kite flyers from britain to display their unique art kites and demonstrate the latest technical kites
=== asia ===
kite flying is popular in many asian countries where it often takes the form of kite fighting in which participants try to snag each other's kites or cut other kites down fighter kites are usually small flat flattened diamond-shaped kites made of paper and bamboo tails are not used on fighter kites so that agility and maneuverability are not compromised
in afghanistan kite flying is a popular game and is known in dari as gudiparan bazi some kite fighters pass their strings through a mixture of ground glass powder and glue which is legal the resulting strings are very abrasive and can sever the competitor's strings more easily the abrasive strings can also injure people during the taliban rule in afghanistan kite flying was banned among various other recreations

in vietnam kites are flown without tails instead small flutes are attached allowing the wind to hum a musical tune there are other forms of sound-making kites in bali large bows are attached to the front of the kites to make a deep throbbing vibration and in malaysia row of gourds with sound-slots are used to create a whistle as the kite flies malaysia has also the kite museum in malacca
kites are very popular in india with the states of bihar jharkhand gujarat west bengal rajasthan and punjab notable for their kite fighting festivals highly maneuverable single-string paper and bamboo kites are flown from the rooftops while using line friction in an attempt to cut each other's kite lines either by letting the cutting line loose at high speed or by pulling the line in a fast and repeated manner during the indian spring festival of makar sankranti near the middle of january millions of people fly kites all over northern india kite flying in hyderabad starts a month before this but kite flying/fighting is an important part of other celebrations including republic day independence day raksha bandhan viswakarma puja day in late september and janmashtami an international kite festival is held every year before uttarayan for three days in vadodara surat and ahmedabad
weifang shandong china is the kite capital of the world china is the oldest place probably with india where kites have been flown since antiquities it is home to the largest kite museum in the world the thousands of kites here have a display area of 8100 m2 weifang hosts an annual international kite festival on the large salt flats south of the city there are several kite museums in japan uk malaysia indonesia taiwan thailand and the usa

in chile kites are very popular especially during independence day festivities (september 18)
in colombia kites can be seen flown in parks and recreation areas during august which is known to be windy it is during this month that most people especially the young ones would fly kites
in guyana kites are flown at easter an activity in which all ethnic and religious groups participate kites are generally not flown at any other time of year kites start appearing in the sky in the weeks leading up to easter and school children are taken to parks for the activity it all culminates in a massive airborne celebration on easter monday especially in georgetown the capital and other coastal areas the history of the practice is not entirely clear but given that easter is a christian festival it is said that kite flying is symbolic of the risen lord moore describes the phenomenon in the 19th century as follows
a very popular creole pastime was the flying of kites easter monday a public holiday was the great kite-flying day on the sea wall in georgetown and on open lands in villages young and old alike male and female appeared to be seized by kite-flying mania easter 1885 serves as a good example the appearance of the sky all over georgetown but especially towards the sea wall was very striking the air being thick with kites of all shapes and sizes covered with gaily coloured paper all riding bravely on the strong wind.
(his quotation is from a letter to the creole newspaper of december 29 1858) the exact origins of the practice of kite flying (exclusively) at easter are unclear brereton and yelvington speculate that kite flying was introduced by chinese indentured immigrants to the then colony of british guiana in the mid 19th century the author of an article in the guyana chronicle newspaper of may 6 2007 is more certain
kite flying originated as a chinese tradition to mark the beginning of spring however because the plantation owners were suspicious of the planter class (read plantation workers") the chinese claimed that it represented the resurrection of jesus christ it was a clever argument as at that time christians celebrated easter to the glory of the risen christ the chinese came to guyana from 1853-1879
in brazil flying a kite is a very popular leisure activity for children teenagers and even young adults mostly these are boys and it is overwhelmingly kite fighting a game whose goal is to manoeuvre their own kites to cut the other persons kites strings during flight and followed by kite running where participants race through the streets to steal the free-drifting kites as in other countries with similar traditions injuries are common and motorcyclists in particular need to take precautions
== popular culture ==

mary poppins let's go fly a kite scene where the banks family sings while flying a kite mulan in the parade scene you'll see some kites flying
== general safety issues ==
there are safety issues involved in kite-flying more so with power kites kite lines can strike and tangle on electrical power lines causing power blackouts and running the risk of electrocuting the kite flier wet kite lines or wire can act as a conductor for static electricity and lightning when the weather is stormy kites with large surface area or powerful lift can lift kite fliers off the ground or drag them into other objects in urban areas there is usually a ceiling on how high a kite can be flown to prevent the kite and line infringing on the airspace of helicopters and light aircraft
