indian subcontinent history devastating earthquakes major reason high frequency intensity earthquakes indian plate driving asia rate approximately mmyear geographical statistics india show almost land vulnerable earthquakes world bank united nations report shows estimates around million city dwellers india exposed storms earthquakes latest version seismic zoning map india given earthquake resistant design code india part assigns four levels seismicity india terms zone factors words earthquake zoning map india divides india seismic zones zone unlike previous version consisted five six zones country according present zoning map zone expects highest level seismicity whereas zone associated lowest level seismicity
center seismology
center seismology ministry earth sciences nodal agency government india dealing various activities field seismology allied disciplines major activities currently pursued center seismology include earthquake monitoring x basis including real time seismic monitoring early warning tsunamis b operation maintenance national seismological network local networks c seismological data centre information services d seismic hazard risk related studies e field studies aftershock swarm monitoring site response studies f earthquake processes modelling etc msk medvedevsponheuerkarnik intensity broadly associated various seismic zones vi less vii viii ix zones respectively corresponding maximum considered earthquake mce code follows dual design philosophy low probability extreme earthquake events mce structure damage result total collapse b frequently occurring earthquake events structure suffer minor moderate structural damage specifications given design code based detailed assessment maximum ground acceleration zone using deterministic probabilistic approach instead zone factor represents effective period peak ground accelerations may generated maximum considered earthquake ground motion zone
zone indicates effects earthquake particular place based observations affected areas also described using descriptive scale like modified mercalli intensity scale medvedevsponheuerkarnik scale
zone
zone covers areas highest risks zone suffers earthquakes intensity msk ix greater code assigns zone factor zone structural designers use factor earthquake resistant design structures zone zone factor indicative effective zero period level earthquake zone referred high damage risk zone region kashmir western central himalayas north middle bihar northeast indian region rann kutch fall zone
generally areas trap rock basaltic rock prone earthquakes
zone
zone called high damage risk zone covers areas liable msk viii code assigns zone factor zone indogangetic basin capital country delhi jammu kashmir fall zone maharashtra patan area koyananager also zone bihar northern part state like raksaul near border india nepal also zone almost percent buildings delhi yield major quake case unfortunate disaster political hub india lutyens delhi glitz connaught place magnificence walled city come crumbling
saket suman statesman reported new delhis proximity major quake report
zone
andaman nicobar islands parts kashmir western himalayas fall zone zone classified moderate damage risk zone liable msk vii also code assigns zone factor zone
zone
region liable msk vi less classified low damage risk zone code assigns zone factor maximum horizontal acceleration experienced structure zone gravitational acceleration zone
zone
since current division india earthquake hazard zones use zone area india classed zone
future changes classification system may may return zone use
