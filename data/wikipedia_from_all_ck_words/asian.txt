ohio /oha.o/ is a state in the midwestern united states ohio is the 34th largest (by area) the 7th most populous and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 united states the state's capital and largest city is columbus
the state takes its name from the ohio river the name originated from the iroquois word ohi-yo meaning great river or large creek the state originally partitioned from the northwest territory was admitted to the union as the 17th state (and the first under the northwest ordinance) on march 1 1803 ohio is historically known as the buckeye state (relating to the ohio buckeye tree although there are conflicting narratives regarding the origin of the nickname) and ohioans are also known as buckeyes
the government of ohio is composed of the executive branch led by the governor the legislative branch which comprises the ohio general assembly and the judicial branch which is led by the supreme court currently ohio occupies 16 seats in the united states house of representatives ohio is known for its status as both a swing state and a bellwether in national elections owing to its strategic electoral importance six presidents of the united states have called ohio their home state
== geography ==
ohio's geographic location has proven to be an asset for economic growth and expansion because ohio links the northeast to the midwest much cargo and business traffic passes through its borders along its well-developed highways ohio has the nation's 10th largest highway network and is within a one-day drive of 50% of north america's population and 70% of north america's manufacturing capacity to the north lake erie gives ohio 312 miles (502 km) of coastline which allows for numerous cargo ports ohio's southern border is defined by the ohio river (with the border being at the 1793 low-water mark on the north side of the river) and much of the northern border is defined by lake erie ohio's neighbors are pennsylvania to the east michigan to the northwest ontario canada to the north indiana to the west kentucky on the south and west virginia on the southeast ohio's borders were defined by metes and bounds in the enabling act of 1802 as follows
bounded on the east by the pennsylvania line on the south by the ohio river to the mouth of the great miami river on the west by the line drawn due north from the mouth of the great miami aforesaid and on the north by an east and west line drawn through the southerly extreme of lake michigan running east after intersecting the due north line aforesaid from the mouth of the great miami until it shall intersect lake erie or the territorial line and thence with the same through lake erie to the pennsylvania line aforesaid
ohio is bounded by the ohio river but nearly all of the river itself belongs to kentucky and west virginia in 1980 the u.s supreme court held that based on the wording of the cessation of territory by virginia (which at that time included what is now kentucky and west virginia) the boundary between ohio and kentucky (and by implication west virginia) is the northern low-water mark of the river as it existed in 1792 ohio has only that portion of the river between the river's 1792 low-water mark and the present high-water mark
the border with michigan has also changed as a result of the toledo war to angle slightly northeast to the north shore of the mouth of the maumee river
much of ohio features glaciated plains with an exceptionally flat area in the northwest being known as the great black swamp this glaciated region in the northwest and central state is bordered to the east and southeast first by a belt known as the glaciated allegheny plateau and then by another belt known as the unglaciated allegheny plateau most of ohio is of low relief but the unglaciated allegheny plateau features rugged hills and forests
the rugged southeastern quadrant of ohio stretching in an outward bow-like arc along the ohio river from the west virginia panhandle to the outskirts of cincinnati forms a distinct socio-economic unit geologically similar to parts of west virginia and southwestern pennsylvania this area's coal mining legacy dependence on small pockets of old manufacturing establishments and distinctive regional dialect set this section off from the rest of the state in 1965 the united states congress passed the appalachian regional development act at attempt to address the persistent poverty and growing economic despair of the appalachian region. this act defines 29 ohio counties as part of appalachia while 1/3 of ohio's land mass is part of the federally defined appalachian region only 12.8% of ohioans live there (1.476 million people.)
significant rivers within the state include the cuyahoga river great miami river maumee river muskingum river and scioto river the rivers in the northern part of the state drain into the northern atlantic ocean via lake erie and the st lawrence river and the rivers in the southern part of the state drain into the gulf of mexico via the ohio river and then the mississippi
the worst weather disaster in ohio history occurred along the great miami river in 1913 known as the great dayton flood the entire miami river watershed flooded including the downtown business district of dayton as a result the miami conservancy district was created as the first major flood plain engineering project in ohio and the united states
grand lake st marys in the west central part of the state was constructed as a supply of water for canals in the canal-building era of 18201850 for many years this body of water over 20 square miles (52 km2) was the largest artificial lake in the world it should be noted that ohio's canal-building projects were not the economic fiasco that similar efforts were in other states some cities such as dayton owe their industrial emergence to location on canals and as late as 1910 interior canals carried much of the bulk freight of the state
=== climate ===
the climate of ohio is a humid continental climate (kppen climate classification dfa) throughout most of the state except in the extreme southern counties of ohio's bluegrass region section which are located on the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate and upland south region of the united states summers are typically hot and humid throughout the state while winters generally range from cool to cold precipitation in ohio is moderate year-round severe weather is not uncommon in the state although there are typically fewer tornado reports in ohio than in states located in what is known as the tornado alley severe lake effect snowstorms are also not uncommon on the southeast shore of lake erie which is located in an area designated as the snowbelt
although predominantly not in a subtropical climate some warmer-climate flora and fauna does reach well into ohio for instance a number of trees with more southern ranges such as the blackjack oak quercus marilandica are found at their northernmost in ohio just north of the ohio river also evidencing this climatic transition from a subtropical to continental climate several plants such as the southern magnolia (magnolia grandiflora) albizia julibrissin (mimosa) crape myrtle and even the occasional needle palm are hardy landscape materials regularly used as street yard and garden plantings in the bluegrass region of ohio but these same plants will simply not thrive in much of the rest of the state this interesting change may be observed while traveling through ohio on interstate 75 from cincinnati to toledo the observant traveler of this diverse state may even catch a glimpse of cincinnati's common wall lizard one of the few examples of permanent subtropical fauna in ohio

== history ==
=== native americans ===
archeological evidence suggests that the ohio valley was inhabited by nomadic people as early as 13,000 bc these early nomads disappeared from ohio by 1,000 bc but their material culture provided a base for those who followed them between 1,000 and 800 bc the sedentary adena culture emerged as ohio historian george w knepper notes this sophisticated culture was so named because evidences of their culture were excavated in 1902 on the grounds of adena thomas worthington's estate located near chillicothe the adena were able to establish semi-permanent villages because they domesticated plants which included squash sunflowers and perhaps corn cultivation of these in addition to hunting and gathering supported more settled complex villages the most spectacular remnant of the adena culture is the great serpent mound located in adams county ohio
around 100 bc the adena were joined in ohio country by the hopewell people who were named for the farm owned by captain m c hopewell where evidence of their unique culture was discovered like the adena the hopewell people participated in a mound-building culture their complex large and technologically sophisticated earthworks can be found in modern-day marietta newark and circleville the hopewell however disappeared from the ohio valley in about 600 ad little is known about the people who replaced them researchers have identified two additional distinct prehistoric cultures the fort ancient people and the whittlesey focus people both cultures apparently disappeared in the 17th century perhaps decimated by infectious diseases spread in epidemics from early european contact the native americans had no immunity to common european diseases some scholars believe that the fort ancient people were ancestors of the historic shawnee people or that at the very least the historic shawnees absorbed remnants of these older peoples.
american indians in the ohio valley were greatly affected by the aggressive tactics of the iroquois confederation based in central and western new york after the so-called beaver wars in the mid-17th century the iroquois claimed much of the ohio country as hunting and more importantly beaver-trapping ground after the devastation of epidemics and war in the mid-17th century which largely emptied the ohio country of indigenous people by the mid-to-late 17th century the land gradually became repopulated by the mostly algonquian-speaking descendants of its ancient inhabitants that is descendants of the adena hopewell and mississippian cultures many of these ohio-country nations were multi-ethnic (sometimes multi-linguistic) societies born out of the earlier devastation brought about by disease war and subsequent social instability they subsisted on agriculture (corn sunflowers beans etc.) supplemented by seasonal hunts by the 18th century they were part of a larger global economy brought about by european entry into the fur trade
the indigenous nations to inhabit ohio in the historical period included the miamis (a large confederation) wyandots (made up of refugees especially from the fractured huron confederacy) delawares (pushed west from their historic homeland in new jersey) shawnees (also pushed west although they may have been descended from the fort ancient people of ohio) ottawas (more commonly associated with the upper great lakes region) mingos (like the wyandot a group recently formed of refugees from iroquois) and eries (gradually absorbed into the new multi-ethnic republics, namely the wyandot) ohio country was also the site of indian massacres such as the yellow creek massacre gnadenhutten and pontiac's rebellion school massacre
=== colonial and revolutionary eras ===
during the 18th century the french set up a system of trading posts to control the fur trade in the region in 1754 france and great britain fought a war that was known in north america as the french and indian war and in europe as the seven years war as a result of the treaty of paris the french ceded control of ohio and the remainder of the old northwest to great britain
pontiac's rebellion in the 1760s however posed a challenge to british military control this came to an end with the colonists victory in the american revolution in the treaty of paris in 1783 britain ceded all claims to ohio country to the united states
=== northwest territory 17871803 ===
the united states created the northwest territory under the northwest ordinance of 1787 slavery was not permitted in the new territory settlement began with the founding of marietta by the ohio company of associates which had been formed by a group of american revolutionary war veterans following the ohio company the miami company (also referred to as the symmes purchase") claimed the southwestern section and the connecticut land company surveyed and settled the connecticut western reserve in present-day northeast ohio
the old northwest territory originally included areas previously known as ohio country and illinois country as ohio prepared for statehood the indiana territory was created reducing the northwest territory to approximately the size of present-day ohio plus the eastern half of the lower peninsula of michigan and the eastern tip of the upper peninsula
under the northwest ordinance areas of the territory could be defined and admitted as states once their population reached 60,000 although ohio's population numbered only 45,000 in december 1801 congress determined that the population was growing rapidly and ohio could begin the path to statehood the assumption was that it would exceed 60,000 residents by the time it was admitted as a state furthermore in regards to the leni lenape native americans living in the region congress decided that 10,000 acres on the muskingum river in the present state of ohio would be set apart and the property thereof be vested in the moravian brethren    or a society of the said brethren for civilizing the indians and promoting christianity.
=== statehood 1803present ===
on february 19 1803 us president thomas jefferson signed an act of congress that approved ohio's boundaries and constitution however congress had never passed a resolution formally admitting ohio as the 17th state the current custom of congress declaring an official date of statehood did not begin until 1812 with louisiana's admission as the 18th state although no formal resolution of admission was required when the oversight was discovered in 1953 ohio congressman george h bender introduced a bill in congress to admit ohio to the union retroactive to march 1 1803 the date on which the ohio general assembly first convened at a special session at the old state capital in chillicothe the ohio state legislature approved a new petition for statehood that was delivered to washington d.c on horseback on august 7 1953 (the year of ohio's 150th anniversary) president eisenhower signed a congressional joint resolution that officially declared march 1 1803 the date of ohio's admittance into the union
ohio has had three capital cities chillicothe zanesville and columbus chillicothe was the capital from 1803 to 1810 the capital was then moved to zanesville for two years as part of a state legislative compromise in order to get a bill passed the capital was then moved back to chillicothe which was the capital from 1812 to 1816 finally the capital was moved to columbus in order to have it near the geographic center of the state where it would be more accessible to most citizens
although many native americans had migrated west to evade american encroachment others remained settled in the state sometimes assimilating in part in 1830 under president andrew jackson the us government forced indian removal of most tribes to the indian territory west of the mississippi river
in 1835 ohio fought with michigan in the toledo war a mostly bloodless boundary war over the toledo strip congress intervened making michigan's admittance as a state conditional on ending the conflict in exchange for giving up its claim to the toledo strip michigan was given the western two-thirds of the upper peninsula in addition to the eastern third that was already considered part of the state
ohio's central position and its population gave it an important place during the civil war the ohio river was a vital artery for troop and supply movements as were ohio's railroads ohio contributed more soldiers per-capita than any other state in the union in 1862 the state's morale was badly shaken in the aftermath of the battle of shiloh a costly victory in which ohio forces suffered 2,000 casualties later that year when confederate troops under the leadership of stonewall jackson threatened washington d.c. ohio governor david tod still could recruit 5,000 volunteers to provide three months of service almost 35,000 ohioans died in the conflict and thirty thousand were physically wounded by the end of the civil war the union's top three generalsulysses s grant william tecumseh sherman and philip sheridanwere all from ohio
in 1912 a constitutional convention was held with charles b galbreath as secretary the result reflected the concerns of the progressive era it introduced the initiative and the referendum in addition it allowed the general assembly to put questions on the ballot for the people to ratify laws and constitutional amendments originating in the legislature under the jeffersonian principle that laws should be reviewed once a generation the constitution provided for a recurring question to appear on ohio's general election ballots every 20 years the question asks whether a new convention is required although the question has appeared in 1932 1952 1972 and 1992 it has never been approved instead constitutional amendments have been proposed by petition to the legislature hundreds of times and adopted in a majority of cases
eight us presidents hailed from ohio at the time of their elections giving rise to its nickname mother of presidents a sobriquet it shares with virginia it is also termed modern mother of presidents, in contrast to virginia's status as the origin of presidents earlier in american history seven presidents were born in ohio making it second to virginia's eight virginia-born william henry harrison lived most of his life in ohio and is also buried there harrison conducted his political career while living on the family compound founded by his father-in-law john cleves symmes in north bend ohio the seven presidents born in ohio were ulysses s grant rutherford b hayes james a garfield benjamin harrison (grandson of william henry harrison) william mckinley william howard taft and warren g harding
