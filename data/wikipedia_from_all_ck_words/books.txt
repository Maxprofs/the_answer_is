a book is a set of written printed illustrated or blank sheets made of ink paper parchment or other materials fastened together to hinge at one side a single sheet within a book is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page a set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book or e-book
books may also refer to works of literature or a main division of such a work in library and information science a book is called a monograph to distinguish it from serial periodicals such as magazines journals or newspapers the body of all written works including books is literature in novels and sometimes other types of books (for example biographies) a book may be divided into several large sections also called books (book 1 book 2 book 3 and so on) an avid reader of books is a bibliophile or colloquially bookworm
a shop where books are bought and sold is a bookshop or bookstore books can also be borrowed from libraries google has estimated that as of 2010 approximately 130,000,000 unique titles had been published in some wealthier nations printed books are giving way to the usage of electronic or e-books though sales of e-books declined in the first half of 2015
== etymology ==
the word book comes from old english bc which in turn comes from the germanic root *bk- cognate to beech similarly in slavic languages (for example russian bulgarian macedonian)  (bukva"letter") is cognate with beech in russian and in serbian and macedonian the word  (bukvar') or  (bukvar) refers specifically to a primary school textbook that helps young children master the techniques of reading and writing it is thus conjectured that the earliest indo-european writings may have been carved on beech wood similarly the latin word codex meaning a book in the modern sense (bound and with separate leaves) originally meant block of wood
== history of books ==
=== antiquity ===
when writing systems were created in ancient civilizations a variety of objects such as stone clay tree bark metal sheets might be used for writing the study of such inscriptions forms a major part of history the study of inscriptions is known as epigraphy alphabetic writing emerged in egypt the ancient egyptians would often write on papyrus a plant grown along the nile river at first the words were not separated from each other (scriptura continua) and there was no punctuation texts were written from right to left left to right or even so that alternate lines read in opposite directions the technical term for that last type of writing is boustrophedon which means literally ox-turning for the way a farmer drives an ox to plough his fields
==== tablet ====
a tablet might be defined as a physically robust writing medium suitable for casual transport and writing see also stylus
clay tablets were flattened and mostly dry pieces of clay that could be easily carried and impressed with a (possibly dampened) stylus they were used as a writing medium especially for writing in cuneiform throughout the bronze age and well into the iron age
wax tablets were pieces of wood covered in a thick enough coating of wax to record the impressions of a stylus they were the normal writing material in schools in accounting and for taking notes they had the advantage of being reusable the wax could be melted and reformed into a blank the custom of binding several wax tablets together (roman pugillares) is a possible precursor for modern books (i.e codex) the etymology of the word codex (block of wood) also suggests that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets
==== scroll ====
papyrus a thick paper-like material made by weaving the stems of the papyrus plant then pounding the woven sheet with a hammer-like tool was used for writing in ancient egypt perhaps as early as the first dynasty although the first evidence is from the account books of king nefertiti kakai of the fifth dynasty (about 2400 bc) papyrus sheets were glued together to form a scroll tree bark such as lime and other materials were also used
according to herodotus (history 5:58) the phoenicians brought writing and papyrus to greece around the 10th or 9th century bc the greek word for papyrus as writing material (biblion) and book (biblos) come from the phoenician port town byblos through which papyrus was exported to greece from greek we also derive the word tome (greek ) which originally meant a slice or piece and from there began to denote a roll of papyrus tomus was used by the latins with exactly the same meaning as volumen (see also below the explanation by isidore of seville)
whether made from papyrus parchment or paper scrolls were the dominant form of book in the hellenistic roman chinese hebrew and macedonian cultures the more modern codex book format form took over the roman world by late antiquity but the scroll format persisted much longer in asia
==== codex ====
isidore of seville (died 636) explained the then-current relation between codex book and scroll in his etymologiae (vi.13) a codex is composed of many books a book is of one scroll it is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks (codex) of trees or vines as if it were a wooden stock because it contains in itself a multitude of books as it were of branches. modern usage differs
a codex (in modern usage) is the first information repository that modern people would recognize as a book leaves of uniform size bound in some manner along one edge and typically held between two covers made of some more robust material the first written mention of the codex as a form of book is from martial in his apophoreta clxxxiv at the end of the first century where he praises its compactness however the codex never gained much popularity in the pagan hellenistic world and only within the christian community did it gain widespread use this change happened gradually during the 3rd and 4th centuries and the reasons for adopting the codex form of the book are several the format is more economical as both sides of the writing material can be used and it is portable searchable and easy to conceal a book is much easier to read to find a page that you want and to flip through a scroll is more awkward to use the christian authors may also have wanted to distinguish their writings from the pagan and judaic texts written on scrolls in addition some metal books were made that required smaller pages of metal instead of an impossibly long unbending scroll of metal a book can also be easily stored in more compact places or side by side in a tight library or shelf space
==== manuscripts ====
the fall of the roman empire in the 5th century a.d saw the decline of the culture of ancient rome papyrus became difficult to obtain due to lack of contact with egypt and parchment which had been used for centuries became the main writing material
monasteries carried on the latin writing tradition in the western roman empire cassiodorus in the monastery of vivarium (established around 540) stressed the importance of copying texts st benedict of nursia in his rule of saint benedict (completed around the middle of the 6th century) later also promoted reading the rule of saint benedict (ch xlviii) which set aside certain times for reading greatly influenced the monastic culture of the middle ages and is one of the reasons why the clergy were the predominant readers of books the tradition and style of the roman empire still dominated but slowly the peculiar medieval book culture emerged
before the invention and adoption of the printing press almost all books were copied by hand which made books expensive and comparatively rare smaller monasteries usually had only a few dozen books medium-sized perhaps a few hundred by the 9th century larger collections held around 500 volumes and even at the end of the middle ages the papal library in avignon and paris library of the sorbonne held only around 2,000 volumes
the scriptorium of the monastery was usually located over the chapter house artificial light was forbidden for fear it may damage the manuscripts there were five types of scribes
calligraphers who dealt in fine book production
copyists who dealt with basic production and correspondence
correctors who collated and compared a finished book with the manuscript from which it had been produced
illuminators who painted illustrations
rubricators who painted in the red letters
the bookmaking process was long and laborious the parchment had to be prepared then the unbound pages were planned and ruled with a blunt tool or lead after which the text was written by the scribe who usually left blank areas for illustration and rubrication finally the book was bound by the bookbinder
different types of ink were known in antiquity usually prepared from soot and gum and later also from gall nuts and iron vitriol this gave writing a brownish black color but black or brown were not the only colors used there are texts written in red or even gold and different colors were used for illumination for very luxurious manuscripts the whole parchment was colored purple and the text was written on it with gold or silver (for example codex argenteus)
irish monks introduced spacing between words in the 7th century this facilitated reading as these monks tended to be less familiar with latin however the use of spaces between words did not become commonplace before the 12th century it has been argued that the use of spacing between words shows the transition from semi-vocalized reading into silent reading
the first books used parchment or vellum (calfskin) for the pages the book covers were made of wood and covered with leather because dried parchment tends to assume the form it had before processing the books were fitted with clasps or straps during the later middle ages when public libraries appeared up to the 18th century books were often chained to a bookshelf or a desk to prevent theft these chained books are called libri catenati
at first books were copied mostly in monasteries one at a time with the rise of universities in the 13th century the manuscript culture of the time led to an increase in the demand for books and a new system for copying books appeared the books were divided into unbound leaves (pecia) which were lent out to different copyists so the speed of book production was considerably increased the system was maintained by secular stationers guilds which produced both religious and non-religious material
judaism has kept the art of the scribe alive up to the present according to jewish tradition the torah scroll placed in a synagogue must be written by hand on parchment and a printed book would not do though the congregation may use printed prayer books and printed copies of the scriptures are used for study outside the synagogue a sofer scribe is a highly respected member of any observant jewish community
==== middle east ====
people of various religious (jews christians zoroastrians muslims) and ethnic backgrounds (syriac coptic persian arab etc.) in the middle east also produced and bound books in the islamic golden age (mid 8th century to 1258) developing advanced techniques in islamic calligraphy miniatures and bookbinding a number of cities in the medieval islamic world had book production centers and book markets yaqubi (d 897) says that in his time baghdad had over a hundred booksellers book shops were often situated around the town's principal mosque as in marrakesh morocco that has a street named kutubiyyin or book sellers in english and the famous koutoubia mosque is named so because of its location in this street
the medieval muslim world also used a method of reproducing reliable copies of a book in large quantities known as check reading in contrast to the traditional method of a single scribe producing only a single copy of a single manuscript in the check reading method only authors could authorize copies and this was done in public sessions in which the copyist read the copy aloud in the presence of the author who then certified it as accurate. with this check-reading system an author might produce a dozen or more copies from a single reading, and with two or more readings more than one hundred copies of a single book could easily be produced.
by using as writing material the relatively cheap paper instead of parchment or papyrus the muslims in the words of pedersen accomplished a feat of crucial significance not only to the history of the islamic book but also to the whole world of books
==== wood block printing ====
in woodblock printing a relief image of an entire page was carved into blocks of wood inked and used to print copies of that page this method originated in china in the han dynasty (before 220 ad) as a method of printing on textiles and later paper and was widely used throughout east asia the oldest dated book printed by this method is the diamond sutra (868 ad)
the method (called woodcut when used in art) arrived in europe in the early 14th century books (known as block-books) as well as playing-cards and religious pictures began to be produced by this method creating an entire book was a painstaking process requiring a hand-carved block for each page and the wood blocks tended to crack if stored for long the monks or people who wrote them were paid highly
==== movable type and incunabula ====
the chinese inventor bi sheng made movable type of earthenware circa 1045 but there are no known surviving examples of his printing around 1450 in what is commonly regarded as an independent invention johannes gutenberg invented movable type in europe along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould this invention gradually made books less expensive to produce and more widely available
early printed books single sheets and images which were created before 1501 in europe are known as incunables or incunabula a man born in 1453 the year of the fall of constantinople could look back from his fiftieth year on a lifetime in which about eight million books had been printed more perhaps than all the scribes of europe had produced since constantine founded his city in a.d 330.
=== modern world ===
steam-powered printing presses became popular in the early 19th century these machines could print 1,100 sheets per hour but workers could only set 2,000 letters per hour
monotype and linotype typesetting machines were introduced in the late 19th century they could set more than 6,000 letters per hour and an entire line of type at once
the centuries after the 15th century were thus spent on improving both the printing press and the conditions for freedom of the press through the gradual relaxation of restrictive censorship laws see also intellectual property public domain copyright in mid-20th century european book production had risen to over 200,000 titles per year
== book manufacture in modern times ==
the methods used for the printing and binding of books continued fundamentally unchanged from the 15th century into the early 20th century while there was more mechanization a book printer in 1900 had much in common with gutenberg
gutenberg's invention was the use of movable metal types assembled into words lines and pages and then printed by letterpress to create multiple copies
modern paper books are printed on papers designed specifically for printed books traditionally book papers are off-white or low-white papers (easier to read) are opaque to minimise the show-through of text from one side of the page to the other and are (usually) made to tighter caliper or thickness specifications particularly for case-bound books different paper qualities are used depending on the type of book machine finished coated papers woodfree uncoated papers coated fine papers and special fine papers are common paper grades
today the majority of books are printed by offset lithography when a book is printed the pages are laid out on the plate so that after the printed sheet is folded the pages will be in the correct sequence books tend to be manufactured nowadays in a few standard sizes the sizes of books are usually specified as trim size the size of the page after the sheet has been folded and trimmed the standard sizes result from sheet sizes (therefore machine sizes) which became popular 200 or 300 years ago and have come to dominate the industry british conventions in this regard prevail throughout the english-speaking world except for the usa the european book manufacturing industry works to a completely different set of standards
=== current processes ===
some books particularly those with shorter runs (i.e fewer copies) will be printed on sheet-fed offset presses but most books are now printed on web presses which are fed by a continuous roll of paper and can consequently print more copies in a shorter time as the production line circulates a complete book is collected together in one stack next to another and another
a web press carries out the folding itself delivering bundles of signatures (sections) ready to go into the gathering line notice that when the book is being printed it is being printed one (or two) signatures at a time not one complete book at a time excess numbers are printed to make up for any spoilage due to make-readies or test pages to assure final print quality
a make-ready is the preparatory work carried out by the pressmen to get the printing press up to the required quality of impression included in make-ready is the time taken to mount the plate onto the machine clean up any mess from the previous job and get the press up to speed as soon as the pressman decides that the printing is correct all the make-ready sheets will be discarded and the press will start making books similar make readies take place in the folding and binding areas each involving spoilage of paper
after the signatures are folded and gathered they move into the bindery in the middle of last century there were still many trade binders stand-alone binding companies which did no printing specializing in binding alone at that time because of the dominance of letterpress printing typesetting and printing took place in one location and binding in a different factory when type was all metal a typical book's worth of type would be bulky fragile and heavy the less it was moved in this condition the better so printing would be carried out in the same location as the typesetting printed sheets on the other hand could easily be moved now because of increasing computerization of preparing a book for the printer the typesetting part of the job has flowed upstream where it is done either by separately contracting companies working for the publisher by the publishers themselves or even by the authors mergers in the book manufacturing industry mean that it is now unusual to find a bindery which is not also involved in book printing (and vice versa)
if the book is a hardback its path through the bindery will involve more points of activity than if it is a paperback
unsewn binding is now increasingly common the signatures of a book can also be held together by smyth sewing using needles mccain sewing using drilled holes often used in schoolbook binding or notch binding where gashes about an inch long are made at intervals through the fold in the spine of each signature the rest of the binding process is similar in all instances sewn and notch bound books can be bound as either hardbacks or paperbacks
=== finishing ===
making cases happens off-line and prior to the book's arrival at the binding line in the most basic case-making two pieces of cardboard are placed onto a glued piece of cloth with a space between them into which is glued a thinner board cut to the width of the spine of the book the overlapping edges of the cloth (about 5/8 all round) are folded over the boards and pressed down to adhere after case-making the stack of cases will go to the foil stamping area for adding decorations and type
== digital printing ==
recent developments in book manufacturing include the development of digital printing book pages are printed in much the same way as an office copier works using toner rather than ink each book is printed in one pass not as separate signatures digital printing has permitted the manufacture of much smaller quantities than offset in part because of the absence of make readies and of spoilage one might think of a web press as printing quantities over 2000 quantities from 250 to 2000 being printed on sheet-fed presses and digital presses doing quantities below 250 these numbers are of course only approximate and will vary from supplier to supplier and from book to book depending on its characteristics digital printing has opened up the possibility of print-on-demand where no books are printed until after an order is received from a customer
=== e-book ===
the term e-book is a contraction of electronic book it refers to a book-length publication in digital form an e-book is usually made available through the internet but also on cd-rom and other forms e-books may be read either via a computer or by means of a portable book display device known as an e-book reader such as the sony reader barnes & noble nook kobo ereader or the amazon kindle these devices attempt to mimic the experience of reading a print book
== information explosion ==
throughout the 20th century libraries have faced an ever-increasing rate of publishing sometimes called an information explosion the advent of electronic publishing and the internet means that much new information is not printed in paper books but is made available online through a digital library on cd-rom or in the form of e-books an on-line book is an e-book that is available online through the internet
though many books are produced digitally most digital versions are not available to the public and there is no decline in the rate of paper publishing there is an effort however to convert books that are in the public domain into a digital medium for unlimited redistribution and infinite availability this effort is spearheaded by project gutenberg combined with distributed proofreaders
there have also been new developments in the process of publishing books technologies such as pod or print on demand which make it possible to print as few as one book at a time have made self-publishing much easier and more affordable on-demand publishing has allowed publishers by avoiding the high costs of warehousing to keep low-selling books in print rather than declaring them out of print
== book design ==
book design is the art of incorporating the content style format design and sequence of the various components of a book into a coherent whole
in the words of jan tschichold book design though largely forgotten today methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve have been developed over centuries to produce perfect books these rules have to be brought back to life and applied. richard hendel describes book design as an arcane subject and refers to the need for a context to understand what that means
== sizes ==
the size of a modern book is based on the printing area of a common flatbed press the pages of type were arranged and clamped in a frame so that when printed on a sheet of paper the full size of the press the pages would be right side up and in order when the sheet was folded and the folded edges trimmed
the most common book sizes are
quarto (4to) the sheet of paper is folded twice forming four leaves (eight pages) approximately 11-13 inches (ca 30 cm) tall
octavo (8vo) the most common size for current hardcover books the sheet is folded three times into eight leaves (16 pages) up to 9  (ca 23 cm) tall
duodecimo (12mo) a size between 8vo and 16mo up to 7  (ca 18 cm) tall
sextodecimo (16mo) the sheet is folded four times forming 16 leaves (32 pages) up to 6  (ca 15 cm) tall
sizes smaller than 16mo are
24mo up to 5  (ca 13 cm) tall
32mo up to 5 (ca 12 cm) tall
48mo up to 4 (ca 10 cm) tall
64mo up to 3 (ca 8 cm) tall
small books can be called booklets
sizes larger than quarto are
folio up to 15 (ca 38 cm) tall
elephant folio up to 23 (ca 58 cm) tall
atlas folio up to 25 (ca 63 cm) tall
double elephant folio up to 50 (ca 127 cm) tall
the largest extant medieval manuscript in the world is codex gigas 92 50 22 cm the world's largest book is made of stone and is in kuthodaw pagoda (burma)
the longest book title in the world is 670 words long
== types ==
=== by content ===
a common separation by content are fiction and non-fiction books this simple separation can be found in most collections libraries and bookstores
==== fiction ====
many of the books published today are fiction meaning that they are in-part or completely untrue historically paper production was considered too expensive to be used for entertainment an increase in global literacy and print technology led to the increased publication of books for the purpose of entertainment and allegorical social commentary most fiction is additionally categorized by genre
the novel is the most common form of fiction book novels are stories that typically feature a plot setting themes and characters stories and narrative are not restricted to any topic a novel can be whimsical serious or controversial the novel has had a tremendous impact on entertainment and publishing markets a novella is a term sometimes used for fiction prose typically between 17,500 and 40,000 words and a novelette between 7,500 and 17,500 a short story may be any length up to 10,000 words but these word lengths vary
comic books or graphic novels are books in which the story is illustrated the characters and narrators use speech or thought bubbles to express verbal language
==== non-fiction ====
in a library a reference book is a general type of non-fiction book which provides information as opposed to telling a story essay commentary or otherwise supporting a point of view an almanac is a very general reference book usually one-volume with lists of data and information on many topics an encyclopedia is a book or set of books designed to have more in-depth articles on many topics a book listing words their etymology meanings and other information is called a dictionary a book which is a collection of maps is an atlas a more specific reference book with tables or lists of data and information about a certain topic often intended for professional use is often called a handbook books which try to list references and abstracts in a certain broad area may be called an index such as engineering index or abstracts such as chemical abstracts and biological abstracts
books with technical information on how to do something or how to use some equipment are called instruction manuals other popular how-to books include cookbooks and home improvement books
students typically store and carry textbooks and schoolbooks for study purposes elementary school pupils often use workbooks which are published with spaces or blanks to be filled by them for study or homework in us higher education it is common for a student to take an exam using a blue book
there is a large set of books that are made only to write private ideas notes and accounts these books are rarely published and are typically destroyed or remain private notebooks are blank papers to be written in by the user students and writers commonly use them for taking notes scientists and other researchers use lab notebooks to record their notes they often feature spiral coil bindings at the edge so that pages may easily be torn out
address books phone books and calendar/appointment books are commonly used on a daily basis for recording appointments meetings and personal contact information
books for recording periodic entries by the user such as daily information about a journey are called logbooks or simply logs a similar book for writing the owner's daily private personal events information and ideas is called a diary or personal journal
businesses use accounting books such as journals and ledgers to record financial data in a practice called bookkeeping
==== other types ====
there are several other types of books which are not commonly found under this system albums are books for holding a group of items belonging to a particular theme such as a set of photographs card collections and memorabilia one common example is stamp albums which are used by many hobbyists to protect and organize their collections of postage stamps such albums are often made using removable plastic pages held inside in a ringed binder or other similar smolder picture books are books for children with little text and pictures on every page
hymnals are books with collections of musical hymns that can typically be found in churches prayerbooks or missals are books that contain written prayers and are commonly carried by monks nuns and other devoted followers or clergy
=== by physical format ===
hardcover books have a stiff binding paperback books have cheaper flexible covers which tend to be less durable an alternative to paperback is the glossy cover otherwise known as a dust cover found on magazines and comic books spiral-bound books are bound by spirals made of metal or plastic examples of spiral-bound books include teachers manuals and puzzle books (crosswords sudoku)
publishing is a process for producing pre-printed books magazines and newspapers for the reader/user to buy
publishers may produce low-cost pre-publication copies known as galleys or bound proofs for promotional purposes such as generating reviews in advance of publication galleys are usually made as cheaply as possible since they are not intended for sale
== libraries ==
private or personal libraries made up of non-fiction and fiction books (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in archives) first appeared in classical greece in ancient world the maintaining of a library was usually (but not exclusively) the privilege of a wealthy individual these libraries could have been either private or public i.e for people who were interested in using them the difference from a modern public library lies in the fact that they were usually not funded from public sources it is estimated that in the city of rome at the end of the 3rd century there were around 30 public libraries public libraries also existed in other cities of the ancient mediterranean region (for example library of alexandria) later in the middle ages monasteries and universities had also libraries that could be accessible to general public typically not the whole collection was available to public the books could not be borrowed and often were chained to reading stands to prevent theft
the beginning of modern public library begins around 15th century when individuals started to donate books to towns the growth of a public library system in the united states started in the late 19th century and was much helped by donations from andrew carnegie this reflected classes in a society the poor or the middle class had to access most books through a public library or by other means while the rich could afford to have a private library built in their homes in the united states the boston public library 1852 report of the trustees established the justification for the public library as a tax-supported institution intended to extend educational opportunity and provide for general culture
the advent of paperback books in the 20th century led to an explosion of popular publishing paperback books made owning books affordable for many people paperback books often included works from genres that had previously been published mostly in pulp magazines as a result of the low cost of such books and the spread of bookstores filled with them (in addition to the creation of a smaller market of extremely cheap used paperbacks) owning a private library ceased to be a status symbol for the rich
in library and booksellers catalogues it is common to include an abbreviation such as crown 8vo to indicate the paper size from which the book is made
when rows of books are lined on a book holder bookends are sometimes needed to keep them from slanting
== identification and classification ==
during the 20th century librarians were concerned about keeping track of the many books being added yearly to the gutenberg galaxy through a global society called the international federation of library associations and institutions (ifla) they devised a series of tools including the international standard bibliographic description (isbd)
each book is specified by an international standard book number or isbn which is unique to every edition of every book produced by participating publishers world wide it is managed by the isbn society an isbn has four parts the first part is the country code the second the publisher code and the third the title code the last part is a check digit and can take values from 09 and x (10) the ean barcodes numbers for books are derived from the isbn by prefixing 978 for bookland and calculating a new check digit
commercial publishers in industrialized countries generally assign isbns to their books so buyers may presume that the isbn is part of a total international system with no exceptions however many government publishers in industrial as well as developing countries do not participate fully in the isbn system and publish books which do not have isbns
a large or public collection requires a catalogue codes called call numbers relate the books to the catalogue and determine their locations on the shelves call numbers are based on a library classification system the call number is placed on the spine of the book normally a short distance before the bottom and inside
institutional or national standards such as ansi/niso z39.41 - 1997 establish the correct way to place information (such as the title or the name of the author) on book spines and on shelvable book-like objects such as containers for dvds video tapes and software
one of the earliest and most widely known systems of cataloguing books is the dewey decimal system another widely known system is the library of congress classification system both systems are biased towards subjects which were well represented in us libraries when they were developed and hence have problems handling new subjects such as computing or subjects relating to other cultures
information about books and authors can be stored in databases like online general-interest book databases
metadata about a book may include its isbn or other classification number (see above) the names of contributors (author editor illustrator) and publisher its date and size and the language of the text
=== classification systems ===
bliss bibliographic classification (bc)
chinese library classification (clc)
colon classification
dewey decimal classification (ddc)
harvard-yenching classification
library of congress classification (lcc)

== uses ==
aside from the primary purpose of reading them books are also used for other ends
a book can be an artistic artifact a piece of art this is sometimes known as an artists book
a book may be evaluated by a reader or professional writer to create a book review
a book may be read by a group of people to use as a spark for social or academic discussion as in a book club
a book may be studied by students as the subject of a writing and analysis exercise in the form of a book report
books are sometimes used for their exterior appearance to decorate a room such as a study
== paper and conservation ==
paper was first made in china as early as 200 bc and reached europe through muslim territories at first made of rags the industrial revolution changed paper-making practices allowing for paper to be made out of wood pulp papermaking in europe began in the 11th century although vellum was also common there as page material up until the beginning of 16th century vellum being the more expensive and durable option printers or publishers would often issue the same publication on both materials to cater to more than one market
paper made from wood pulp became popular in the early 20th century because it was cheaper than linen or abaca cloth-based papers pulp-based paper made books less expensive to the general public this paved the way for huge leaps in the rate of literacy in industrialised nations and enabled the spread of information during the second industrial revolution
pulp paper however contains acid which eventually destroys the paper from within earlier techniques for making paper used limestone rollers which neutralized the acid in the pulp books printed between 1850 and 1950 are primarily at risk more recent books are often printed on acid-free or alkaline paper libraries today have to consider mass deacidification of their older collections in order to prevent decay
stability of the climate is critical to the long-term preservation of paper and book material good air circulation is important to keep fluctuation in climate stable the hvac system should be up to date and functioning efficiently light is detrimental to collections therefore care should be given to the collections by implementing light control general housekeeping issues can be addressed including pest control in addition to these helpful solutions a library must also make an effort to be prepared if a disaster occurs one that they cannot control time and effort should be given to create a concise and effective disaster plan to counteract any damage incurred through acts of god therefore an emergency management plan should be in place
