== types ==
=== small domestic sheds ===
the simplest and least-expensive sheds are available in kit form both shed kits and do-it-yourself plans are available for wooden and plastic sheds sheds are used to store home and garden tools and equipment such as lawn tractors and gardening supplies in addition sheds can be used to store items that are not suitable for indoor storage such as petrol (gasoline) pesticides or herbicides
for homes with small gardens or modest storage needs there are several types of very small sheds the sheds not only use less ground area but also have a low profile less likely to obstruct the view or clash with the landscaping
these small sheds include corner sheds which fit into a corner (3 ft tall 3 wide 2 deep or 0.91 m 0.91 m 0.61 m) vertical sheds (5 ft 3 ft 4 ft deep or 1.52 m 0.91 m 1.22 m) horizontal sheds (3 ft 5 ft 4 ft or 0.91 m 1.52 m 1.22 m) and toolsheds when a shed is used for tool storage shelves and hooks are often used to maximize the storage space gambrel-style roofed sheds (sometimes called baby barns) which resemble a dutch-style barn have a high sloping roofline which increases storage space in the loft area some gambrel-styles have no loft and offer the advantage of reduced overall height another style of small shed is the saltbox-style shed there is also pent and apex roofed sheds
=== larger domestic sheds ===
larger more-expensive sheds are typically constructed of wood and include features typically found in house construction such as windows a shingled roof and electrical outlets larger sheds provide more space for engaging in hobbies such as gardening small engine repair or tinkering some sheds have small porches or include furniture which allows them to be used for relaxation purposes in some cases teleworkers and homeworkers in general who live in mild climates use small to medium-sized wooden garden sheds as outdoor offices there is a growing industry in providing off the peg garden offices to cater for this demand particularly in the uk but also in the us
shed owners can customize wooden sheds to match the features (e.g. siding trim etc.) of the main house a number of decorative options can be added to sheds such as dormers shutters flowerboxes finials and weathervanes as well practical options can be added such as benches ramps ventilation systems (e.g. in cases where a swimming pool heater is installed in a shed) and electric lighting sheds designed for gardening called potting sheds often feature windows or skylights for illumination ventilation grilles and a potter's bench for mixing soil and re-potting plants
=== specific-use sheds ===
garden sheds the vast majority of sheds are garden sheds including allotment sheds this class of sheds also includes potting sheds and tool sheds most modern gardens are too small for more than a single shed containing garden tools and lawn mowers
bike sheds (also called bicycle sheds) usually contain a framework on which bikes can be supported and locked bike sheds range from little more than a supported roof to more-complex structures with walls and locking doors
boat sheds (also called boatsheds) are lockable wooden sheds built near a body of water to store small private boats bathing suits and related items boat sheds used for rowing clubs are large structures for storing skiffs
wood sheds are sheds used for storage of large quantities of firewood woodsheds help protect firewood from adverse weather and moisture especially in snowy or wet climates woodsheds are commonly in close proximity to buildings heated by a wood-burning stove such as a log cabin

== construction ==
the main types of shed construction are metal sheathing over a metal frame plastic sheathing and frame all-wood construction and vinyl-sided sheds built over a wooden frame each type has various advantages and disadvantages that a homeowner has to consider for example while metal sheds are fire and termite-resistant they can rust over time or be severely damaged by high winds the international building code(ibc) defines a shed as a building or structure of an accessory character it classifies them under utility and miscellaneous group u (chapter 3 section 312)
=== metal sheds ===
metal sheds made from thin sheet metal sheathing (galvanized steel aluminium or corrugated iron) attached to a metal frame metal sheds are a good choice when long-term strength and resistance to fire rot or termites is desired however metal sheds may rust over time particularly if they are constructed from steel that is not galvanized be aware that concrete is highly corrosive so care needs to be take when assembling your shed to avoid contact with the outside panels
as well some types of metal sheds that have thin walls are easily dented which may makes some types of thin metal sheds a poor choice for vandal-prone areas or for high-traffic activities such as small businesses in cold climates metal sheds with thin walls need to have snow and ice cleared from the roof because the thin metal may be damaged by a heavy accumulation since thin metal sheds weigh much less than wood or pvc plastic sheds thin metal sheds are more at risk of being damaged by heavy winds to prevent wind damage thin metal sheds should be attached to a concrete foundation with screws
in countries where the climate is generally mild such as australia very large metal sheds are used for many types of industry
=== plastic sheds ===
plastic shed kits utilizing heavy molded plastics such as pvc and polyethylene are less expensive than sheet-metal sheds pvc resins and high-impact uv light-resistant polyethylene make plastic outdoor sheds stronger lighter more durable and more resistant to denting and chipping than wood and tend to be more stable
plastic shed kits sided with vinyl are typically among the least-expensive types of shed construction higher-quality sheds use uv-resistant plastic and powder-coated metal frames many plastic sheds are modular to allow for easy extensions peg-boards shelving attic-storage windows skylights and other accessories to be added later
plastic sheds are not susceptible to termite or wood-boring insect damage and they require little maintenance being rot-proof they do not need to have preservative applied
unlike wooden or metal sheds which often require a permit to build in many areas plastic sheds do not however this is something you will need to verify a quick call to your council/town should do the trick
=== wooden sheds ===
wooden sheds have a natural look that can blend in well with garden environments despite the strength of wood over time untreated and neglected wood can rot split warp or become susceptible to mold and mildew so wood sheds should be treated for protection wood sheds need regular maintenance this includes keeping plant matter and debris from piling up beside the walls and on the roof and occasional rot-proofing with preservative sheds are sometimes also re-stained or varnished at times for aesthetic reasons fire and in some regions termite attack are also potential problems
stains and preservatives can be applied to wood sheds to prevent damage to the wood caused by exposure to rain damp ground uv light harsh climatic conditions fungal attack and wood-boring insects if a coloured preservative oil or stain is used a wooden shed can either be made to stand out as a feature within a garden or to blend in with its surroundings red cedar coloured stain is popular some types of wood such as cedar are more naturally resistant to water damage one advantage of using wood sheds is that it is easier to modify wooden sheds (i.e. than metal sheds) by adding windows doors shelving or exterior trim (etc.) because wood can be cut and drilled using commonly available tools some homeowners may prefer wood sheds because wood is a renewable resource
=== vinyl-sided sheds ===
vinyl-sided sheds are typically built with standard wood framing construction and oriented strand board (osb) on the walls covered with standard vinyl siding vinyl-sided sheds never need to be painted but they might require special scrubbing they are generally stronger than plastic or metal sheds and are usually built to conform with the local building codes they are not eco-friendly and they cost more than wooden metal or plastic sheds
=== asbestos sheds ===
in the early and middle years of the 20th century many garden sheds and domestic garages were made of asbestos-cement sheets supported on a very light angle-iron frame concerns about safety led to the practice being discontinued but they were cheap and long-lasting and many can still be seen in british gardens advice on continued use or disposal is available
=== tpr sheds ===
since 2013 garden sheds have been available in the uk made from tpr - a sustainable alternative to concrete they are typically coated in a marine gelcoat and are far stronger and more durable than traditional sheds a shed made from tpr became the first secured by design approved shed in 2014
