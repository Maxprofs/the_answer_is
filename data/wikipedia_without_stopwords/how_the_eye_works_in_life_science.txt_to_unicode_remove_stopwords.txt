evolution
photoreception phylogenetically old various theories phylogenesis common origin monophyly animal eyes widely accepted fact based upon shared genetic features eyes modern eyes varied origins protoeye believed evolved million years ago pax gene considered key factor majority advancements early eyes believed taken million years develop since first predator gain true imaging would touched arms race among species flee photopic environment prey animals competing predators alike would distinct disadvantage without capabilities would less likely survive reproduce hence multiple eye types subtypes developed parallel except groups vertebrates forced photopic environment late stage
eyes various animals show adaptation requirements example eye bird prey much greater visual acuity human eye cases detect ultraviolet radiation different forms eye example vertebrates molluscs examples parallel evolution despite distant common ancestry phenotypic convergence geometry cephalopod vertebrate eyes creates impression vertebrate eye evolved imaging cephalopod eye case reversed roles respective ciliary rhabdomeric opsin classes different lens crystallins show
earliest eyes called eyespots simple patches photoreceptor protein unicellular animals multicellular beings multicellular eyespots evolved physically similar receptor patches taste smell eyespots could sense ambient brightness could distinguish light dark direction light source

noncompound eyes
simple eyes rather ubiquitous lensbearing eyes evolved least seven times vertebrates cephalopods annelids crustaceans cubozoa
pit eyes
pit eyes also known stemma eyespots may set pit reduce angles light enters affects eyespot allow organism deduce angle incoming light found phyla basic forms probably precursors advanced types simple eye small comprising cells covering m directionality improved reducing size aperture incorporating reflective layer behind receptor cells filling pit refractile material
pit vipers developed pits function eyes sensing thermal infrared radiation addition optical wavelength eyes like vertebrates
spherical lensed eye
resolution pit eyes greatly improved incorporating material higher refractive index form lens may greatly reduce blur radius encounteredhence increasing resolution obtainable basic form seen gastropods annelids consists lens one refractive index far sharper image obtained using materials high refractive index decreasing edges decreases focal length thus allows sharp image form retina also allows larger aperture given sharpness image allowing light enter lens flatter lens reducing spherical aberration inhomogeneous lens necessary order focal length drop times lens radius radii
heterogeneous eyes evolved least nine times four times gastropods copepods annelids cephalopods chitons aragonite lenses aquatic organisms possess homogeneous lenses presumably evolutionary pressure heterogeneous lens great enough stage quickly outgrown
eye creates image sharp enough motion eye cause significant blurring minimise effect eye motion animal moves eyes stabilising eye muscles
ocelli insects bear simple lens focal point always lies behind retina consequently never form sharp image ocelli pittype eyes arthropods blur image across whole retina consequently excellent responding rapid changes light intensity across whole visual field fast response accelerated large nerve bundles rush information brain focusing image would also cause suns image focused receptors possibility damage intense light shielding receptors would block light thus reduce sensitivity fast response led suggestions ocelli insects used mainly flight used detect sudden changes way light especially uv light absorbed vegetation usually comes
multiple lenses
marine organisms bear one lens instance copepod pontella three outer parabolic surface countering effects spherical aberration allowing sharp image formed another copepod copilia two lenses eye arranged like telescope arrangements rare poorly understood represent alternative construction multiple lenses seen hunters eagles jumping spiders refractive cornea discussed next negative lens enlarging observed image receptor cells thus increasing optical resolution
refractive cornea
