a tuna is a saltwater finfish that belongs to the tribe thunnini a sub-grouping of the mackerel family (scombridae) which together with the tunas also includes the bonitos mackerels and spanish mackerels thunnini comprises fifteen species across five genera the sizes of which vary greatly ranging from the bullet tuna (max length 50 cm (1.6 ft) weight 1.8 kg (4 lb)) up to the atlantic bluefin tuna (max length 4.6 m (15 ft) weight 684 kg (1,508 lb)) the bluefin averages 2 m (6.6 ft) and is believed to live for up to 50 years
tuna and mackerel sharks are the only species of fish that can maintain a body temperature higher than that of the surrounding water an active and agile predator the tuna has a sleek streamlined body and is among the fastest-swimming pelagic fish the yellowfin tuna for example is capable of speeds of up to 75 km/h (47 mph) found in warm seas it is extensively fished commercially and is popular as a game fish as a result of over-fishing stocks of some tuna species such as the southern bluefin tuna have been reduced dangerously close to the point of extinction
== etymology ==
the term tuna ultimately derives from thunnus the middle latin form of the ancient greek (thnnos) tunny-fish which is in turn derived from (thn) rush dart along
however the immediate source for the word tuna in english is american spanish < spanish atn < andalusian arabic at-tn assimilated from al-tn [modern arabic ]  tuna fish < greco-latin thunnus mentioned above
== taxonomy ==
the thunnini tribe is a monophyletic clade comprising fifteen species in five genera
family scombridae
tribe thunnini the tunas
genus allothunnus slender tunas
genus auxis frigate tunas
genus euthynnus little tunas
genus katsuwonus skipjack tunas
genus thunnus albacores true tunas
subgenus thunnus (thunnus) bluefin group
subgenus thunnus (neothunnus) yellowfin group
the cladogram is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxons and is read left-to-right as if on a timeline the following cladogram illustrates the relationship between the tunas and other tribes of the family scombridae for example the cladogram illustrates that the skipjack tunas are more closely related to the true tunas than are the slender tunas (the most primitive of the tunas) and that the next nearest relatives of the tunas are the bonitos of the sardini tribe
=== true tuna species ===
the true tunas are those that belong to the genus thunnus until recently it was thought that there were seven thunnus species and that atlantic bluefin tuna and pacific bluefin tuna were subspecies of a single species in 1999 collette established that based on both molecular and morphological considerations they are in fact distinct species
the genus thunnus is further classified into two subgenera thunnus (thunnus) (the bluefin group) and thunnus (neothunnus) (the yellowfin group)
=== other tuna species ===
the thunnini tribe also includes seven additional species of tuna across four genera they are
== biology ==
=== description ===
the tuna is a sleek and streamlined fish adapted for speed it has two closely spaced dorsal fins on its back the first is depressible it can be laid down flush in a groove that runs along its back seven to 10 yellow finlets run from the dorsal fins to the tail which is lunate curved like a crescent moon and tapered to pointy tips the caudal peduncle to which the tail is attached is quite thin with three stabilizing horizontal keels on each side the tuna's dorsal side is generally a metallic dark blue while the ventral side or underside is silvery or whitish for camouflage
=== physiology ===
thunnus are widely but sparsely distributed throughout the oceans of the world generally in tropical and temperate waters at latitudes ranging between about 45 north and south of the equator all tunas are able to maintain the temperature of certain parts of their body above the temperature of ambient seawater for example bluefin can maintain a core body temperature of 2533 c (7791 f) in water as cold as 6 c (43 f) however unlike typical endothermic creatures such as mammals and birds tuna do not maintain temperature within a relatively narrow range
tunas achieve endothermy by conserving the heat generated through normal metabolism in all tunas the heart operates at ambient temperature as it receives cooled blood and coronary circulation is directly from the gills the rete mirabile ("wonderful net") the intertwining of veins and arteries in the body's periphery allows nearly all of the metabolic heat from venous blood to be re-claimed and transferred to the arterial blood via a counter-current exchange system thus mitigating the effects of surface cooling this allows the tuna to elevate the temperatures of the highly-aerobic tissues of the skeletal muscles eyes and brain which supports faster swimming speeds and reduced energy expenditure and which enables them to survive in cooler waters over a wider range of ocean environments than those of other fish
also unlike most fish which have white flesh the muscle tissue of tuna ranges from pink to dark red the red myotomal muscles derive their color from myoglobin an oxygen-binding molecule which tuna express in quantities far higher than most other fish the oxygen-rich blood further enables energy delivery to their muscles
for powerful swimming animals like dolphins and tuna cavitation may be detrimental because it limits their maximum swimming speed even if they have the power to swim faster dolphins may have to restrict their speed because collapsing cavitation bubbles on their tail are too painful cavitation also slows tuna but for a different reason unlike dolphins these fish do not feel the bubbles because they have bony fins without nerve endings nevertheless they cannot swim faster because the cavitation bubbles create a vapor film around their fins that limits their speed lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage
== fishing industry ==
=== commercial fishing ===
tuna is an important commercial fish the international seafood sustainability foundation (issf) compiled a detailed scientific report on the state of global tuna stocks in 2009 which includes regular updates according to the issf the most important species for commercial and recreational tuna fisheries are yellowfin (thunnus albacares) bigeye (t obesus) bluefin (t thynnus t orientalis and t macoyii) albacore (t alalunga) and skipjack (katsuwonus pelamis)
the report further states
between 1940 and the mid-1960s the annual world catch of the five principal market species of tunas rose from about 300 thousand tons to about 1 million tons most of it taken by hook and line with the development of purse-seine nets now the predominant gear catches have risen to more than 4 million tons annually during the last few years of these catches about 68 percent are from the pacific ocean 22 percent from the indian ocean and the remaining 10 percent from the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea skipjack makes up about 60 percent of the catch followed by yellowfin (24 percent) bigeye (10 percent) albacore (5 percent) and bluefin the remainder purse-seines take about 62 percent of the world production longline about 14 percent pole and line about 11 percent and a variety of other gears the remainder 3
the australian government alleged in 2006 that japan had illegally overfished southern bluefin by taking 12,000 to 20,000 tonnes per year instead of the agreed upon 6,000 tonnes the value of such overfishing would be as much as us$2 billion such overfishing has severely damaged bluefin stocks according to the wwf japan's huge appetite for tuna will take the most sought-after stocks to the brink of commercial extinction unless fisheries agree on more rigid quotas japan's fisheries research agency counters that australian and new zealand tuna fishing companies under-report their total catches of southern bluefin tuna and ignore internationally mandated total allowable catch totals
in recent years opening day fish auctions at tokyo's tsukiji fish market have seen record-setting prices for bluefin tuna reflecting market demand in each of 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 new record prices have been set for a single fish the current record is 155.4 million japanese yen (us $1.76 million) for a 221 kg (487 lb) bluefin or a unit price of jp 703,167/kg (us$ 3,603/lb) the opening auction price for 2014 plummeted to less than 5% of the previous year's price which had drawn complaints for climbing way out of line a summary of record-setting auctions are shown in the following table (highlighted values indicate new world records)
in november 2011 a different record was set when a fisherman in massachusetts caught an 881-pound tuna it was captured inadvertently using a dragnet due to the laws and restrictions on tuna fishing in the united states federal authorities impounded the fish because it was not caught with a rod and reel because of the tuna's deteriorated condition as a result of the trawl net the fish sold for just under $5,000
=== fishing methods ===
besides for edible purposes many species of tuna are caught frequently as a game fish often for recreation or for contests in which money is awarded depending on how heavy the fish weighs in at larger specimens are notorious for putting up a fight while hooked and have been known to injure people who try to catch them as well as damage their equipment
andalusian method of almadraba uses a maze of nets in sicily the same method is called tonnara
fish farming (cage system)
tuna ranching
longline fishing
purse seines
pole and line
harpoon gun
big game fishing
fish aggregating device
=== association with whaling ===
in 2005 nauru defending its vote from australian criticism at that year's meeting of the international whaling commission argued that some whale species have the potential to devastate nauru's tuna stocks and that nauru's food security and economy relies heavily on fishing despite this nauru does not permit whaling in its own waters and does not allow other fishing vessels to take or intentionally interact with marine mammals in its exclusive economic zone in 2010 and 2011 nauru supported australian proposals for a western pacific-wide ban on tuna purse-seining in the vicinity of marine mammals a measure which was agreed by the western and central pacific fisheries commission at its eighth meeting in march 2012
=== association with dolphins ===
dolphins swim beside several tuna species these include yellowfin tuna in the eastern pacific ocean but not albacore tuna schools are believed to associate themselves with dolphins for protection against sharks which are tuna predators
commercial fishing vessels used to exploit this association by searching for dolphin pods vessels would encircle the pod with nets to catch the tuna beneath however the nets were prone to entangling dolphins injuring or killing them public outcry and new government regulations which are now monitored by noaa have led to more dolphin friendly methods now generally involving lines rather than nets however there are neither universal independent inspection programs nor verification of dolphin safeness so these protections are not absolute according to consumers union the resulting lack of accountability means claims of tuna that is dolphin safe should be given little credence
fishery practices have changed to be dolphin friendly which has caused greater bycatch including sharks turtles and other oceanic fish fishermen no longer follow dolphins but concentrate their fisheries around floating objects such as fish aggregation devices also known as fads which attract large populations of other organisms measures taken thus far to satisfy the public demand to protect dolphins can be potentially damaging to other species as well
=== aquaculture ===
increasing quantities of high-grade tuna are reared in net pens and fed bait fish in australia former fishermen raise southern bluefin tuna thunnus maccoyii and another bluefin species farming its close relative the atlantic bluefin tuna thunnus thynnus is beginning in the mediterranean north america and japan hawaii approved permits for the first u.s offshore farming of bigeye tuna in water 1,300 feet (400 m) deep in 2009
japan is the biggest tuna consuming nation and is also the leader in tuna farming research japan first successfully farm-hatched and raised bluefin tuna in 1979 in 2002 it succeeded in completing the reproduction cycle and in 2007 completed a third generation the farm breed is known as kindai tuna kindai is the contraction of kinki university in japanese (kinki daigaku) in 2009 clean seas an australian company which has been receiving assistance from kinki university managed to breed southern bluefin tuna in captivity and was awarded the second place in world's best invention of 2009 by time magazine
== as food ==
tuna are widely regarded as a delicacy in most areas where they are shipped being prepared in a variety of ways for the sake of achieving specific flavors or textures when served as a steak the meat of most species is known for its thickness and somewhat tough texture some species (such as the bluefin) are also known for the sheer amount of blood they expel while being gutted
=== canned ===
canned tuna was first produced in australia in 1903 quickly becoming popular tuna is canned in edible oils in brine in water and in various sauces tuna may be processed to be chunked or flaked in the united states 52% of canned tuna is used for sandwiches 22% for salads and 15% for casseroles and dried and pre-packaged meal kits such as general mills's tuna helper line
in the united states only albacore can legally be sold in canned form as white meat tuna in other countries yellowfin is also acceptable while in the early 1980s canned tuna in australia was most likely southern bluefin as of 2003 it was usually yellowfin skipjack or tongol (labelled northern bluefin")
as tunas are often caught far from where they are processed poor interim conservation can lead to spoilage tuna is typically gutted by hand and later pre-cooked for prescribed times of 45 minutes to three hours the fish are then cleaned and filleted canned and sealed with the dark lateral blood meat often separately canned for pet food the sealed can is then heated under pressure (called retort cooking) for 2 to 4 hours this process kills any bacteria but retains the histamine that can produce rancid flavors the international standard sets the maximum histamine level at 200 milligrams per kilogram an australian study of 53 varieties of unflavored canned tuna found none to exceed the safe histamine level although some had off flavors
australian standards once required cans of tuna to contain at least 51% tuna but these regulations were dropped in 2003 the remaining weight is usually oil or water in the us the fda regulates canned tuna (see part c)
=== nutrition and health ===
tuna can be a good source of omega-3 fatty acids it can contain 300 milligrams (0.011 oz) per serving however the level of omega-3 oils found in canned tuna is highly variable since some common manufacturing methods destroy much of the omega-3 oils in the fish tuna is also a good source of protein
=== mercury levels ===
mercury content in tuna can vary widely for instance testing by rutgers university reportedly found that a can of starkist had 10 times more mercury than another can of similarly identified tuna this has prompted a rutgers university scientist whose staff conducted the mercury analysis to say that's one of the reasons pregnant women have to be really careful  if you happen to get a couple or three cans in the high range at a critical period when you are pregnant it would not be good. among those calling for improved warnings about mercury in tuna is the american medical association which adopted a policy that physicians should help make their patients more aware of the potential risks
a study published in 2008 found that mercury distribution in the meat of farmed tuna is inversely related to the lipid content suggesting that higher lipid concentration within edible tissues of tuna raised in captivity might other factors remaining equal have a diluting effect on mercury content these findings suggest that choosing to consume a type of tuna that has a relatively higher natural fat content might help reduce the amount of mercury intake compared to consuming tuna with a low fat content
due to their high position in the food chain and the subsequent accumulation of heavy metals from their diet mercury levels can be high in larger species such as bluefin and albacore
in 2009 a california appeals court upheld a ruling that canned tuna does not need warning labels as the methylmercury is naturally occurring
in march 2004 the united states fda issued guidelines recommending that pregnant women nursing mothers and children limit their intake of tuna and other predatory fish the environmental protection agency provides guidelines on how much canned tuna is safe to eat roughly speaking the guidelines recommend one 6-ounce (170 g) can of light tuna per week for individuals weighing less than 110 pounds (50 kg) and two cans per week for those who weigh more
in 2007 it was reported that some canned light tuna such as yellowfin tuna is significantly higher in mercury than skipjack and caused consumers union and other activist groups to advise pregnant women to refrain from consuming canned tuna
the eastern little tuna (euthynnus affinis) has been available for decades as a low-mercury less expensive canned tuna however of the five major species of canned tuna imported by the united states it is the least commercially attractive primarily due to its dark color and more pronounced fishy flavor its use has traditionally been restricted to institutional (non-retail) commerce
a january 2008 investigation conducted by the new york times found potentially dangerous levels of mercury in certain varieties of sushi tuna reporting levels so high that the food and drug administration could take legal action to remove the fish from the market.
a book by jane hightower diagnosis mercury money politics and poison published in 2008 discusses human exposure to mercury through eating large predatory fish such as large tuna
== management and conservation ==
the main tuna fishery management bodies are the western central pacific ocean fisheries commission the inter-american tropical tuna commission the indian ocean tuna commission the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas and the commission for the conservation of southern bluefin tuna the five gathered for the first time in kobe japan in january 2007 environmental organizations made submissions on risks to fisheries and species the meeting concluded with an action plan drafted by some 60 countries or areas concrete steps include issuing certificates of origin to prevent illegal fishing and greater transparency in the setting of regional fishing quotas the delegates were scheduled to meet at another joint meeting in january or february 2009 in europe
in 2010 greenpeace international added the albacore bigeye tuna pacific bluefin tuna atlantic bluefin tuna southern bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna to its seafood red list which are fish commonly sold in supermarkets around the world and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.
bluefin tuna have been widely accepted as being severely overfished with some stocks at risk of collapse according to the international seafood sustainability foundation (a global nonprofit partnership between the tuna industry scientists and the world wide fund for nature) indian ocean yellowfin tuna pacific ocean (eastern and western) bigeye tuna and north atlantic albacore tuna are all overfished in april 2009 no stock of skipjack tuna (which makes up roughly 60% of all tuna fished worldwide) was considered to be overfished however the bbc documentary south pacific which first aired in may 2009 stated that should fishing in the pacific continue at its current rate populations of all tuna species could collapse within five years it highlighted huge japanese and european tuna fishing vessels sent to the south pacific international waters after overfishing their own fish stocks to the point of collapse
a 2010 tuna fishery assessment report released in january 2012 by the secretariat of the pacific community supported this finding recommending that all tuna fishing should be reduced or limited to current levels and that limits on skipjack fishing be considered
