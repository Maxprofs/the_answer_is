termolecular reactionsedit
termolecular reactions solutions gas mixtures rare improbability three molecular entities simultaneously colliding however term termolecular also used refer three body association reactions type
m arrow denotes conserve energy momentum second reaction third body required initial bimolecular collision b energetically excited reaction intermediate formed collides m body second bimolecular reaction transferring excess energy
reaction explained two consecutive reactions
reactions frequently pressure temperature dependence region transition second third order kinetics
catalytic reactions often threecomponent practice complex starting materials first formed ratedetermining step reaction complex products adventitious collision two species catalyst example hydrogenation metal catalyst molecular dihydrogen first dissociates onto metal surface hydrogen atoms bound surface monatomic hydrogens react starting material also previously adsorbed onto surface
reactions higher molecularity observed due small probability simultaneous interaction molecules
difference molecularity order reactionedit
important distinguish molecularity order reaction order reaction empirical quantity determined experiment rate law reaction sum exponents rate law equation molecularity hand deduced mechanism elementary reaction used context elementary reaction number molecules taking part reaction

reaction unimolecular involves one reactant molecule bimolecular involves two reactant molecules
follows kinetic order elementary reaction equal molecularity rate elementary reaction therefore determined inspection molecularity
example elementary reaction bimolecular second order rate law form dadt krab
kinetic order complex reaction however cannot equated molecularity since molecularity describes elementary reactions
