gregor johann mendel july january germanspeaking moravian scientist augustinian friar gained posthumous fame founder modern science genetics though farmers known centuries crossbreeding animals plants could favor certain desirable traits mendels pea plant experiments conducted established many rules heredity referred laws mendelian inheritance
mendel worked seven characteristics pea plants plant height pod shape color seed shape color flower position color seed color showed yellow pea green pea bred together offspring plant always yellow however next generation plants green peas reappeared ratio explain phenomenon mendel coined terms recessive dominant reference certain traits preceding example green peas recessive yellow peas dominant published work demonstrating actions invisible factorsnow called genesin providing visible traits predictable ways
profound significance mendels work recognized turn th century three decades later independent rediscovery laws erich von tschermak hugo de vries carl correns william jasper spillman independently verified several mendels experimental findings ushering modern age genetics
biography
johann mendel born ethnic german family heinzendorf bei odrau moraviansilesian border austrian empire hynice czech republic son anton rosine schwirtlich mendel one older sister veronika one younger theresia lived worked farm owned mendel family least years childhood mendel worked gardener studied beekeeping later young man attended gymnasium opava take four months gymnasium studies due illness studied practical theoretical philosophy physics university olomouc faculty philosophy taking another year illness also struggled financially pay studies theresia gave dowry later helped support three sons two became doctors
became friar enabled obtain education without pay given name gregor joined augustinian friars
mendel entered faculty philosophy department natural history agriculture headed johann karl nestler conducted extensive research hereditary traits plants animals especially sheep upon recommendation physics teacher friedrich franz mendel entered augustinian st thomass abbey began training priest born johann mendel took name gregor upon entering religious life mendel worked substitute high school teacher failed oral part last three parts exams become certified high school teacher sent university vienna study sponsorship abbot c f napp could get formal education vienna professor physics christian doppler mendel returned abbey teacher principally physics took exam become certified teacher failed oral part replaced napp abbot monastery
elevated abbot scientific work largely ended mendel became consumed increased administrative responsibilities especially dispute civil government attempt impose special taxes religious institutions mendel died january age brno moravia austriahungary czech republic chronic nephritis czech composer leo janek played organ funeral death succeeding abbot burned papers mendels collection mark end disputes taxation
experiments plant hybridization
gregor mendel known father modern genetics inspired professors university olomouc friedrich franz johann karl nestler colleagues monastery franz diebl study variation plants napp authorized mendel investigation conducted study monasterys hectares acres experimental garden originally planted napp unlike nestler studied hereditary traits sheep mendel focused plants initial experiments pea plants mendel settled studying seven traits seemed inherit independently traits seed shape flower color seed coat tint pod shape unripe pod color flower location plant height first focused seed shape either angular round mendel cultivated tested pea plants pisum sativum study showed one four pea plants purebred recessive alleles two four hybrid one four purebred dominant experiments led make two generalizations law segregation law independent assortment later came known mendels laws inheritance
mendel presented paper versuche ber pflanzenhybriden experiments plant hybridization two meetings natural history society brno moravia february march received favorably generated reports several local newspapers mendels paper published verhandlungen des naturforschenden vereins brnn seen essentially hybridization rather inheritance little impact cited three times next thirtyfive years paper criticized time considered seminal work notably charles darwin unaware mendels paper envisaged genetics would much older science
experiments
mendel began studies heredity using mice st thomass abbey bishop like one friars studying animal sex mendel switched plants mendel also bred bees bee house built using bee hives designed also studied astronomy meteorology founding austrian meteorological society majority published works related meteorology
mendel also experimented hawkweed honeybees however none results survived except passing mention reports moravian apiculture society known definitely used cyprian carniolan bees particularly aggressive annoyance monks visitors monastery asked get rid contrast fondness bees refer dearest little animals
also described novel plant species denoted botanical author abbreviation mendel
rediscovery mendels work
mendels work rejected first scientific community widely accepted died lifetime biologists held idea characteristics passed next generation blending inheritance traits parent averaged together instances phenomenon explained action multiple genes quantitative effects charles darwin tried unsuccessfully explain inheritance theory pangenesis early th century importance mendels ideas realized
research aimed finding successful theory discontinuous inheritance rather blending inheritance led independent duplication work hugo de vries carl correns rediscovery mendels writings laws acknowledged mendels priority thought probable de vries understand results found reading mendel though erich von tschermak originally also credited rediscovery longer accepted understand mendels laws though de vries later lost interest mendelism biologists started establish genetics science three researchers different country published work rediscovering mendels work within twomonth span spring
mendels results quickly replicated genetic linkage quickly worked biologists flocked theory even though yet applicable many phenomena sought give genotypic understanding heredity felt lacking previous studies heredity focused phenotypic approaches prominent previous approaches biometric school karl pearson wfr weldon based heavily statistical studies phenotype variation strongest opposition school came william bateson perhaps early days publicising benefits mendels theory word genetics much disciplines terminology originated bateson debate biometricians mendelians extremely vigorous first two decades twentieth century biometricians claiming statistical mathematical rigor whereas mendelians claimed better understanding biology modern genetics shows mendelian heredity fact inherently biological process though genes mendels experiments yet understood
end two approaches combined especially work conducted r fisher early combination mendelian genetics darwins theory natural selection resulted modern synthesis evolutionary biology
controversy
mendels experimental results later object considerable dispute mendel used crosses truebreeding homozygous pea plants seven traits case offspring f would heterozygous would therefore display dominant state uniformly round green peas ra fisher reconstructed mendels experiments analyzed results f second filial generation found ratio dominant recessive phenotypes eg green versus yellow peas round versus wrinkled peas implausibly close expected ratio mendel allowed pea plants showing dominant phenotype selffertilize order determine ratio homozygotes heterozygotes occurrence recessive phenotype progeny fisher sceptical mendels ratio truebreeding homozygotes mixed progeny heterozygotes remarked mendels results good true particular fisher suggested mendel inferred parental phenotype examination progeny adjust expectation probability heterozygote parent could produce dominant phenotype offspring occurs frequency tests thus corrected one expect ratio quite different mendels results extremely close fit mendels incorrect expectation statistical interpretation taken ground criticising mendels works whole amounting accusation experimental fraud removing outliers tidying datasets repeating experiments fisher asserted data experiments falsified agree closely mendels expectations called mendels result abominable shocking cooked
fisher accused mendels experiments biased strongly direction agreement expectation give theory benefit doubt often cited example confirmation bias might arise detected approximate ratio early experiments small sample size cases ratio appeared deviate slightly continued collecting data results conformed nearly exact ratio jw porteous concluded mendels observations implausible however reproduction experiments demonstrated validity results daniel l hartl daniel j fairbanks suggested fisher incorrectly interpreted experiments found likely mendel scored progeny results matched expectation conclude fishers allegation deliberate falsification finally put rest closer analysis proved unsupported convincing evidence hartl fairbanks allan franklin awf edwards wrote comprehensive book concluded reasons assert mendel fabricated results fisher deliberately tried diminish mendels legacy reassessment statistical analyses also disprove notion confirmation bias mendels results
