an oak is a tree or shrub in the genus quercus (/kwrks/ latin oak tree") of the beech family fagaceae there are approximately 600 extant species of oaks the common name oak may also appear in the names of species in related genera notably lithocarpus the genus is native to the northern hemisphere and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in the americas asia europe and north africa north america contains the largest number of oak species with approximately 90 occurring in the united states mexico has 160 species of which 109 are endemic the second greatest center of oak diversity is china which contains approximately 100 species
oaks have spirally arranged leaves with lobate margins in many species some have serrated leaves or entire leaves with smooth margins many deciduous species are marcescent not dropping dead leaves until spring in spring a single oak tree produces both male flowers (in the form of catkins) and small female flowers the fruit is a nut called an acorn borne in a cup-like structure known as a cupule each acorn contains one seed (rarely two or three) and takes 618 months to mature depending on species the live oaks are distinguished for being evergreen but are not actually a distinct group and instead are dispersed across the genus
== classificationedit ==
oak trees are a flowering plant oaks may be divided into two genera (sometimes referred to as subgenera) and a number of sections
=== genus quercusedit ===
the genus quercus is divided into the following sections
sect quercus (synonyms lepidobalanus and leucobalanus) the white oaks of europe asia and north america styles are short acorns mature in 6 months and taste sweet or slightly bitter the inside of an acorn shell is hairless the leaves mostly lack a bristle on their lobe tips which are usually rounded the type species is quercus robur
sect mesobalanus hungarian oak and its relatives of europe and asia styles long acorns mature in about 6 months and taste bitter the inside of this acorn's shell is hairless the section mesobalanus is closely related to section quercus and sometimes included in it
sect cerris the turkey oak and its relatives of europe and asia styles long acorn mature in 18 months and taste very bitter the inside of the acorn's shell is hairless its leaves typically have sharp lobe tips with bristles at the lobe tip
sect protobalanus the canyon live oak and its relatives in southwest united states and northwest mexico styles short acorns mature in 18 months and taste very bitter the inside of the acorn shell appears woolly leaves typically have sharp lobe tips with bristles at the lobe tip
sect lobatae (synonym erythrobalanus) the red oaks of north america central america and northern south america styles long acorns mature in 18 months and taste very bitter the inside of the acorn shell appears woolly the actual nut is encased in a thin clinging papery skin leaves typically have sharp lobe tips with spiny bristles at the lobe
=== genus cyclobalanopsisedit ===
the ring-cupped oaks of eastern and southeastern asia evergreen trees growing 1040 m (33131 ft) tall they are distinct from subgenus quercus in that they have acorns with distinctive cups bearing concrescent rings of scales they commonly also have densely clustered acorns though this does not apply to all of the species iucn itis encyclopedia of life and flora of china treats cyclobalanopsis as a distinct genus but some taxonomists consider it a subgenus of quercus it contains about 150 species species of cyclobalanopsis are common in the evergreen subtropical laurel forests which extend from southern japan southern korea and taiwan across southern china and northern indochina to the eastern himalayas in association with trees of genus castanopsis and the laurel family (lauraceae)
== hybridizationedit ==
interspecific hybridization is quite common among oaks but usually between species within the same section only and most common in the white oak group (subgenus quercus section quercus see list of quercus species) inter-section hybrids except between species of sections quercus and mesobalanus are unknown recent systematic studies appear to confirm a high tendency of quercus species to hybridize because of a combination of factors white oaks are unable to discriminate against pollination by other species in the same section because they are wind pollinated and they have weak internal barriers to hybridization hybridization produces functional seeds and fertile hybrid offspring ecological stresses especially near habitat margins can also cause a breakdown of mate recognition as well as a reduction of male function (pollen quantity and quality) in one parent species
frequent hybridization among oaks has consequences for oak populations around the world most notably hybridization has produced large populations of hybrids with copious amounts of introgression and the evolution of new species frequent hybridization and high levels of introgression have caused different species in the same populations to share up to 50% of their genetic information having high rates of hybridization and introgression produces genetic data that often does not differentiate between two clearly morphologically distinct species but instead differentiates populations numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain how oak species are able to remain morphologically and ecologically distinct with such high levels of gene flow but the phenomenon is still largely a mystery to botanists
the fagaceae or beech family to which the oaks belong is a very slow evolving clade compared to other angiosperms and the patterns of hybridization and introgression in quercus pose a great challenge to the concept of a species since a species is often defined as a group of actually or potentially interbreeding populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups by this definition many species of quercus would be lumped together according to their geographic and ecological habitat despite clear distinctions in morphology and to a large extent genetic data
== usesedit ==
oak wood has a density of about 0.75 g/cm3 (0.43 oz/cu in) creating great strength and hardness the wood is very resistant to insect and fungal attack because of its high tannin content it also has very appealing grain markings particularly when quartersawn oak planking was common on high status viking longships in the 9th and 10th centuries the wood was hewn from green logs by axe and wedge to produce radial planks similar to quarter-sawn timber wide quarter-sawn boards of oak have been prized since the middle ages for use in interior panelling of prestigious buildings such as the debating chamber of the house of commons in london and in the construction of fine furniture oak wood from quercus robur and quercus petraea was used in europe for the construction of ships especially naval men of war until the 19th century and was the principal timber used in the construction of european timber-framed buildings today oak wood is still commonly used for furniture making and flooring timber frame buildings and for veneer production barrels in which wines sherry and spirits such as brandy irish whiskey scotch whisky and bourbon whiskey are aged are made from european and american oak the use of oak in wine can add many different dimensions to wine based on the type and style of the oak oak barrels which may be charred before use contribute to the colour taste and aroma of the contents imparting a desirable oaky vanillin flavour to these drinks the great dilemma for wine producers is to choose between french and american oakwoods french oaks (quercus robur q petraea) give the wine greater refinement and are chosen for the best wines since they increase the price compared to those aged in american oak wood american oak contributes greater texture and resistance to ageing but produces more powerful wine bouquets oak wood chips are used for smoking fish meat cheeses and other foods
japanese oak is used in the making of professional drums from the manufacturer yamaha drums the higher density of oak gives the drum a brighter and louder tone compared to traditional drum materials such as maple and birch in hill states of india besides fuelwood and timber the local people use oak wood for making agricultural implements the leaves are used as fodder during lean period and bedding for livestock
the bark of the cork oak is used to produce wine stoppers (corks) this species grows in the mediterranean sea region with portugal spain algeria and morocco producing most of the world's supply
of the north american oaks the northern red oak is the one of most prized of the red oak group for lumber much of which is marketed as red oak regardless of the species of origin it is not good for outdoor use due to its open capillaries unless the wood is treated if the wood is properly treated with preservatives it will not rot as quickly as cured white oak heartwood the closed cell structure of white oaks prevent them from absorbing preservatives with northern red oak one can blow air through an end grain piece 10 inches long to make bubbles come out in a glass of water these openings give fungus easy access when the finish deteriorates shumard oak a member of the red oak subgenus provides timber which is described as mechanically superior to northern red oak cherrybark oak is another type of red oak which provides excellent timber
the standard for the lumber of the white oak group all of which is marketed as white oak is the white oak white oak is often used to make wine barrels the wood of the deciduous pedunculate oak and sessile oak accounts for most of the european oak production but evergreen species such as holm oak and cork oak also produce valuable timber
the bark of the white oak is dried and used in medical preparations oak bark is also rich in tannin and is used by tanners for tanning leather acorns are used for making flour or roasted for acorn coffee
oak galls were used for centuries as a main ingredient in iron gall ink a kind of manuscript ink harvested at a specific time of year in korea oak bark is used to make shingles for traditional roof construction
oak has been listed as one of the 38 substances used to prepare bach flower remedies a kind of alternative medicine promoted for its effect on health however according to cancer research uk there is no scientific evidence to prove that flower remedies can control cure or prevent any type of disease including cancer
== biodiversity and ecologyedit ==
oaks are keystone species in a wide range of habitats from mediterranean semi-desert to subtropical rainforest for example oak trees are important components of hardwood forests and certain species are particularly known to grow in associations with members of the ericaceae in oak-heath forests a number of kinds of truffles including the two well known varieties the black prigord truffle and the white piedmont truffle have symbiotic relationships with oak trees the european pied flycatcher is an example of an animal species that often depends upon oak trees
many species of oaks are under threat of extinction in the wild largely due to land use changes livestock grazing and unsustainable harvesting for example over the past 200 years large areas of oak forest in the highlands of mexico central america and the northern andes have been cleared for coffee plantations and cattle ranching there is a continuing threat to these forests from exploitation for timber fuelwood and charcoal in the usa entire oak ecosystems have declined due to a combination of factors still imperfectly known but thought to include fire suppression increased consumption of acorns by growing mammal populations herbivory of seedlings and introduced pests in a recent survey 78 wild oak species have been identified as being in danger of extinction from a global total of over 500 species the proportion under threat may be much higher in reality as there is insufficient information about over 300 species making it near impossible to form any judgement of their status
in the himalayan region of india oak forests are being invaded by pine forests due to the increase in temperature the associated species of pine forest may cross frontiers and become new elements of the oak forests
in eastern north america rare species of oak trees include scarlet oak (quercus coccinea) chinkapin oak (quercus muehlenbergii) and post oak (quercus stellata)
== diseases and pestsedit ==
sudden oak death (phytophthora ramorum) is a water mould that can kill oaks within just a few weeks oak wilt caused by the fungus ceratocystis fagacearum (a fungus closely related to dutch elm disease) is also a lethal disease of some oaks particularly the red oaks (the white oaks can be infected but generally live longer) other dangers include wood-boring beetles as well as root rot in older trees which may not be apparent on the outside often being discovered only when the trees come down in a strong gale oak apples are galls on oaks made by the gall wasp the female kermes scale causes galls to grow on kermes oak oaks are used as food plants by the larvae of lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species such as the gypsy moth lymantria dispar which can defoliate oak and other broadleaved tree species in north america
a considerable number of galls are found on oak leaves buds flowers roots etc examples are oak artichoke gall oak marble gall oak apple gall knopper gall and spangle gall
a number of species of fungus cause powdery mildew on oak species in europe the species erysiphe alphitoides is the most common cause
a new and yet little understood disease of mature oaks acute oak decline has been reported in parts of the uk since 2009
oak processionary moth (thaumetopoea processionea) has become a serious threat in the uk since 2006 the caterpillars of this species defoliate the trees and are hazardous to human health their bodies are covered with poisonous hairs which can cause rashes and respiratory problems
== toxicityedit ==
the leaves and acorns of the oak tree are poisonous to cattle horses sheep and goats in large amounts due to the toxin tannic acid and cause kidney damage and gastroenteritis symptoms of poisoning include lack of appetite depression constipation diarrhea (which may contain blood) blood in urine and colic the exception to livestock and oak toxicity is the domestic pig which may be fed entirely on acorns in the right conditions and has traditionally been pastured in oak woodlands (such as the spanish dehesa and the english system of pannage) for hundreds of years
acorns are also edible to humans after leaching of the tannins
== cultural significanceedit ==
=== national symboledit ===
the oak is a common symbol of strength and endurance and has been chosen as the national tree of many countries already an ancient germanic symbol (in the form of the donar oak for instance) certainly since the early nineteenth century it stands for the nation of germany and oak branches are thus displayed on some german coins both of the former deutsche mark and the current euro currency in 2004 the arbor day foundation held a vote for the official national tree of the united states of america in november 2004 the united states congress passed legislation designating the oak as america's national tree

hark now i hear his mighty voice from far--
rise sons of odin and prepare for war
