a century (from the latin centum meaning one hundred abbreviated c.) is 100 years centuries are numbered ordinally in english and many other languages (e.g the 7th century ad/ce")
== start and end in the gregorian calendar ==
according to the gregorian calendar the 1st century ad/ce started on january 1 1 and ended on december 31 100 the 2nd century started at year 101 the 3rd at 201 etc the n-th century started/will start on the year (100 n) 99 and ends in 100 n a century will only include one year the centennial year that starts with the century's number (e.g 1900 is the final year in the 19th century)
== 1st century bc and ad ==
there is no zeroth century in between the 1st century bc and the 1st century ad also there is no year 0 ad the julian calendar jumps from 1 bc to 1 ad the first century bc includes the years 100 bc to 1 bc other centuries bc follow the same pattern
== dating units in other calendar systems ==
besides the gregorian calendar the julian calendar the aztec calendar and the hindu calendar have cycles of years that are used to delineate whole time periods the hindu calendar in particular summarizes its years into groups of 60 while the aztec calendar considers groups of 52
== centuries in astronomical year numbering ==
astronomical year numbering used by astronomers includes a year zero (0) consequently the 1st century in these calendars may designate the years 0 to 99 as the 1st century years 100 to 199 as the second etc however in order to regard 2000 as the first year of the 21st century according to the astronomical year numbering the astronomical year 0 has to correspond to the gregorian year 1 bc
== alternative naming systems ==
in swedish danish norwegian icelandic and finnish besides the ordinal naming of centuries another system is often used based on the hundreds part of the year and consequently centuries start at even multiples of 100 for example swedish nittonhundratalet (or 1900-talet) danish nittenhundredetallet (or 1900-tallet) norwegian nittenhundretallet (or 1900-tallet) and finnish tuhatyhdeksnsataaluku (or 1900-luku) refer unambiguously to the years 19001999
the same system is used informally in english for example the years 19001999 are sometimes referred to as the nineteen hundreds (1900s) this is similar to the english decade names (1980s meaning the years 19801989)
