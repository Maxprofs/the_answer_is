a relationship breakup often referred to simply as a breakup is the termination of an intimate relationship by any means other than death the act is commonly termed dumping [someone] in slang when it is initiated by one partner the term is less likely to be applied to a married couple where a breakup is typically called a separation or divorce when a couple engaged to be married breaks up it is typically called a broken engagement
susie orbach (1992) has argued that the dissolution of dating and cohabiting relationships can be as painful as or more painful than divorce because these nonmarital relationships are less socially recognized

== uncoupling theory ==
in 1976 sociologist diane vaughan proposed an uncoupling theory, where there exists a turning point in the dynamics of relationship breakup - a precise moment when they knew the relationship was over, when everything went dead inside" - followed by a transition period in which one partner unconsciously knows the relationship is going to end but holds on to it for an extended period even for years
vaughan considered that the process of breakup was asymmetrical for initiator and respondent the former has begun mourning the loss of the relationship and has undertaken something tantamount to a rehearsal mentally and to varying degrees experientially of a life apart from the partner the latter then has to play catch-up to make their own transition out of the relationship partners must redefine initiator and relationship negatively legitimating the dissolution
as a result for vaughan getting out of a relationship includes a redefinition of self at several levels in the private thoughts of the individual between partners and in the larger social context in which the relationship exists she considered that uncoupling is complete when the partners have defined themselves and are defined by others as separate and independent of each other - when being partners is no longer a major source of identity
