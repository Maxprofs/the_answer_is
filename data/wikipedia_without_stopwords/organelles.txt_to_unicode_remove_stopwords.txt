cell biology organelle rnl specialized subunit within cell specific function individual organelles usually separately enclosed within lipid bilayers
name organelle comes idea structures cells organ body hence name organelle suffix elle diminutive organelles identified microscopy also purified cell fractionation many types organelles particularly eukaryotic cells prokaryotes possess organelles per se contain proteinbased microcompartments thought act primitive organelles
history terminology
biology organs defined confined functional units within organism analogy bodily organs microscopic cellular substructures obvious even early works authors respective textbooks rarely elaborate distinction two
credited first use diminutive organ ie little organ cellular structures german zoologist karl august mbius used term organula plural organulum diminutive latin organum footnote published correction next issue journal justified suggestion call organs unicellular organisms organella since differently formed parts one cell contrast multicellular organs multicellular organisms
types organelles
cell biologists consider term organelle synonymous cell compartment cell biologists choose limit term organelle include dnacontaining originated formerly autonomous microscopic organisms acquired via endosymbiosis
definition would two broad classes organelles ie contain dna originated endosymbiotic bacteria
mitochondria almost eukaryotes
plastids eg plants algae protists
organelles also suggested endosymbiotic origins contain dna notably flagellum see evolution flagella
restricted definition membranebound structures parts cell qualify organelles nevertheless use organelle refer nonmembrane bound structures ribosomes common led texts delineate membranebound nonmembrane bound organelles nonmembrane bound organelles also called large biomolecular complexes large assemblies macromolecules carry particular specialized functions lack membrane boundaries cell structures include

eukaryotic organelles
eukaryotic cells structurally complex definition organized part interior compartments enclosed lipid membranes resemble outermost cell membrane larger organelles nucleus vacuoles easily visible light microscope among first biological discoveries made invention microscope
eukaryotic cells organelles listed exceptional organisms cells include organelles might otherwise considered universal eukaryotes mitochondria also occasional exceptions number membranes surrounding organelles listed tables eg listed doublemembrane sometimes found single triple membranes addition number individual organelles type found given cell varies depending upon function cell

prokaryotic organelles
prokaryotes structurally complex eukaryotes thought internal structures enclosed lipid membranes past often viewed little internal organization slowly details emerging prokaryotic internal structures early false turn idea developed bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes later shown artifacts produced chemicals used prepare cells electron microscopy
however recent research revealed least prokaryotes microcompartments carboxysomes subcellular compartments nm diameter enclosed shell proteins even striking description membranebound magnetosomes bacteria reported well nucleuslike structures planctomycetes surrounded lipid membranes reported
