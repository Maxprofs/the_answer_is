matrices allow arbitrary linear transformations represented consistent format suitable computation also allows transformations concatenated easily multiplying matrices
linear transformations ones represented matrices transformations nonlinear ndimensional euclidean space rn represented linear transformations ndimensional space rn include affine transformations translation projective transformations reason transformation matrices widely used d computer graphics ndimensional transformation matrices called depending application affine transformation matrices projective transformation matrices generally nonlinear transformation matrices respect ndimensional matrix ndimensional matrix described augmented matrix
physical sciences active transformation one actually changes physical position system makes sense even absence coordinate system whereas passive transformation change coordinate description physical system change basis distinction active passive transformations important default transformation mathematicians usually mean active transformations physicists could mean either
put differently passive transformation refers description object viewed two different coordinate frames
finding matrix transformationedit
one linear transformation functional form easy determine transformation matrix transforming vectors standard basis inserting result columns matrix words
example function linear transformation applying process suppose n case reveals
must noted matrix representation vectors operators depends chosen basis similar matrix result alternate basis nevertheless method find components remains
elaborate vector v represented basis vectors coordinates
express result transformation matrix upon given basis
elements matrix determined given basis e applying every observing response vector equation defines wanted elements jth column matrix
eigenbasis diagonal matrixedit
yet special basis operator components form diagonal matrix thus multiplication complexity reduces n diagonal means coefficients zeros leaving one term sum surviving diagonal elements known eigenvalues designated defining equation reduces resulting equation known eigenvalue equation eigenvectors eigenvalues derived via characteristic polynomial
diagonalization often possible translate eigenbases
examples d computer graphicsedit
common geometric transformations keep origin fixed linear including rotation scaling shearing reflection orthogonal projection affine transformation pure translation keeps point fixed point chosen origin make transformation linear two dimensions linear transformations represented using transformation matrix

shearingedit

reflections orthogonal projection onto line pass origin affine linear transformation
parallel projections also linear transformations represented simply matrix however perspective projections represent matrix homogeneous coordinates must used

one main motivations using matrices represent linear transformations transformations easily composed combined inverted
composition accomplished matrix multiplication b matrices two linear transformations effect applying first b vector x given
called associative property words matrix combined transformation followed b simply product individual matrices note multiplication done opposite order english sentence matrix followed b ba ab

using affine transformations homogeneous component coordinate vector normally called w never altered one therefore safely assume always ignore however true using perspective projections
perspective projectionedit
another type transformation importance d computer graphics perspective projection whereas parallel projections used project points onto image plane along parallel lines perspective projection projects points onto image plane along lines emanate single point called center projection means object smaller projection far away center projection larger projection closer
simplest perspective projection uses origin center projection z image plane functional form transformation express homogeneous coordinates
carrying matrix multiplication homogeneous component wc general equal therefore map back real plane must perform homogeneous divide perspective divide dividing component wc
complicated perspective projections composed combining one rotations scales translations shears move image plane center projection wherever desired
