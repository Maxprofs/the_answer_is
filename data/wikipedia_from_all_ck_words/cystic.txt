a cyst is a closed sac having a distinct membrane and division compared to the nearby tissue hence it is a cluster of cells that have grouped together to form a sac (not unlike the manner in which water molecules group together forming a bubble) however the distinguishing aspect of a cyst is that the cells forming the shell of such a sac are distinctly abnormal (in both appearance and behaviour) when compared to all surrounding cells for that given location it may contain air fluids or semi-solid material a collection of pus is called an abscess not a cyst once formed a cyst may sometimes resolve on its own when a cyst fails to resolve it may need to be removed by surgery but this will depend on what type of cyst it is and where in the body it has formed
== types ==
acne cyst pseudocysts associated with cystic acne actually an inflammatory nodule with or without an associated epidermoid inclusion cyst
arachnoid cyst (between the surface of the brain and the cranial base or on the arachnoid membrane)
baker's cyst or popliteal cyst (behind the knee joint)
bartholin's cyst (near the vagina)
breast cyst
buccal bifurcation cyst
calcifying odontogenic cyst
ceruminous cyst (ear)
chalazion cyst (eyelid)

choroid plexus cyst (in the brain)
colloid cyst (in the brain)
cysticercal cyst - an infection due to the larval stage of taenia sp (crain's backs)
dentigerous cyst (associated with the crowns of non-erupted teeth)
dermoid cyst (ovaries testes many other locations from head to tailbone)
epididymal cyst (found in the vessels attached to the testes)
fibrous cyst (breast)
ganglion cyst (hand/foot joints and tendons)
glandular odontogenic cyst
glial cyst (in the brain)
gartner's duct cyst (vaginal or vulvar cyst of embryological origin)
hydatid cyst (an infection in the liver or other parts of the body due to the larval stage of echinococcus granulosus (tapeworm))
hydrocele (testicle)
keratocyst (in the jaws these can appear solitary or associated with the gorlin-goltz or nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome the latest world health organization classification considers keratocysts as tumors rather than cysts)
liver cystic disease
meibomian cyst (eyelid)
mucoid cyst (ganglion cysts of the digits)
mucous cyst of the oral mucosa
myxoid cyst (cutaneous condition often characterized by nail plate depression and grooves)
nabothian cyst (cervix)
nasolabial duct cyst
odontogenic cyst (teeth)
ovarian cyst (ovaries functional and pathological)
pancreatic cyst
paradental cyst
parapelvic cyst (kidney)
paratubal cyst (fallopian tube)
periapical cyst - this cyst also known as radicular cyst is the most common odontogenic cyst
pericardial cyst
peritoneal cyst (lining of the abdominal cavity)
pilar cyst (cyst of the scalp)
pilonidal cyst (skin infection near tailbone)
renal cyst (kidneys)
polycystic ovary syndrome
pineal love (in the pineal gland in the brain)
radicular cyst - associated with the roots of non-vital teeth also known as periapical cyst
residual cyst
sebaceous cyst - sac below skin
skene's duct cyst a paraurethral cyst
spermatocele (testicle)
stafne static bone cyst (an anatomic variant with radiographic cystic appearance in the posterior mandible)
tarlov cyst (spine)
thyroglossal cyst
trichilemmal cyst same as a pilar cyst a familial cyst of the scalp
vocal fold cyst
the aneurysmal bone cyst is not a cyst but a neoplasm more specifically an aggressive lesion with radiographic cystic appearance
=== cystic fibrosis ===
despite being described in 1938 as the microscopic appearance of cysts in the pancreas cystic fibrosis is an example of a genetic disorder whose name is related to fibrosis of the cystic duct (which serves the gallbladder) and does not involve actual cysts
this is just one example of how the greek root cyst- which simply means a fluid-filled sac is also found in medical terms that relate to the urinary bladder and the gallbladder but that have nothing to do with cysts
== cystic neoplasm ==
most cysts in the body are benign (dysfunctional) tumors the result of plugged ducts or other natural body outlets for secretions however sometimes these masses are considered neoplasm
dermoid cyst
keratocystic odontogenic tumor
calcifying odontogenic cyst
== treatment ==
treatment ranges from simple enucleation of the cyst to curettage to resection there are cysts e.g. buccal bifurcation cyst with self-resolation nature in which close observation only can be employed unless the cyst is infected and symptomatic
== related structures ==
a pseudocyst is collection without a distinct membrane
a syrinx in the spinal cord or brainstem is sometimes inaccurately referred to as a cyst
