the skull is a bony structure in the head of most vertebrates (in particular craniates) that supports the structures of the face and forms a protective cavity for the brain the skull is composed of two parts the cranium and the mandible the skull forms the anterior most portion of the skeleton and is a product of encephalization housing the brain many sensory structures (eyes ears nasal cavity) and the feeding system
functions of the skull include protection of the brain fixing the distance between the eyes to allow stereoscopic vision and fixing the position of the ears to help the brain use auditory cues to judge direction and distance of sounds in some animals the skull also has a defensive function (e.g horned ungulates) the frontal bone is where horns are mounted
the english word skull is probably derived from old norse skalli meaning bald while the latin word cranium comes from the greek root (kranion)
the skull is made of a number of fused flat bones
== fish skulledit ==
the skull of fishes is formed from a series of only loosely connected bones lampreys and sharks only possess a cartilaginous endocranium with both the upper and lower jaws being separate elements bony fishes have additional dermal bone forming a more or less coherent skull roof in lungfish and holost fish the lower jaw defines a chin
the simpler structure is found in jawless fish in which the cranium is normally represented by a trough-like basket of cartilaginous elements only partially enclosing the brain and associated with the capsules for the inner ears and the single nostril distinctively these fish have no jaws
cartilaginous fish such as sharks and rays have also simple and presumably primitive skull structures the cranium is a single structure forming a case around the brain enclosing the lower surface and the sides but always at least partially open at the top as a large fontanelle the most anterior part of the cranium includes a forward plate of cartilage the rostrum and capsules to enclose the olfactory organs behind these are the orbits and then an additional pair of capsules enclosing the structure of the inner ear finally the skull tapers towards the rear where the foramen magnum lies immediately above a single condyle articulating with the first vertebra there are in addition at various points throughout the cranium smaller foramina for the cranial nerves the jaws consist of separate hoops of cartilage almost always distinct from the cranium proper
in ray-finned fishes there has also been considerable modification from the primitive pattern the roof of the skull is generally well formed and although the exact relationship of its bones to those of tetrapods is unclear they are usually given similar names for convenience other elements of the skull however may be reduced there is little cheek region behind the enlarged orbits and little if any bone in between them the upper jaw is often formed largely from the premaxilla with the maxilla itself located further back and an additional bone the symplectic linking the jaw to the rest of the cranium
although the skulls of fossil lobe-finned fish resemble those of the early tetrapods the same cannot be said of those of the living lungfishes the skull roof is not fully formed and consists of multiple somewhat irregularly shaped bones with no direct relationship to those of tetrapods the upper jaw is formed from the pterygoids and vomers alone all of which bear teeth much of the skull is formed from cartilage and its overall structure is reduced
== tetrapod skulledit ==
the skulls of the earliest tetrapods closely resembled those of their ancestors amongst the lobe-finned fishes the skull roof is formed of a series of plate-like bones including the maxilla frontals parietals and lacrimals among others it is overlaying the endocranium corresponding to the cartilaginous skull in sharks and rays the various separate bones that compose the temporal bone of humans are also part of the skull roof series a further plate composed of four pairs of bones forms the roof of the mouth these include the vomer and palatine bones the base of the cranium is formed from a ring of bones surrounding the foramen magnum and a median bone lying further forward these are homologous with the occipital bone and parts of the sphenoid in mammals finally the lower jaw is composed of multiple bones only the most anterior of which (the dentary) is homologous with the mammalian mandible
in living tetrapods a great many of the original bones have either disappeared or fused into one another in various arrangements
== fenestraeedit ==
living amphibians typically have greatly reduced skulls with many of the bones either absent or wholly or partly replaced by cartilage in mammals and birds in particular modifications of the skull occurred to allow for the expansion of the brain the fusion between the various bones is especially notable in birds in which the individual structures may be difficult to identify
ceratopsian dinosaurs may have fenestrae in their frills
=== temporal fenestraeedit ===
the temporal fenestrae are anatomical features of the skulls of several types of amniotes characterised by bilaterally symmetrical holes (fenestrae) in the temporal bone depending on the lineage of a given animal two one or no pairs of temporal fenestrae may be present above or below the postorbital and squamosal bones the upper temporal fenestrae are also known as the supratemporal fenestrae and the lower temporal fenestrae are also known as the infratemporal fenestrae the presence and morphology of the temporal fenestra are critical for taxonomic classification of the synapsids of which mammals are part
physiological speculation associates it with a rise in metabolic rates and an increase in jaw musculature the earlier amniotes of the carboniferous did not have temporal fenestrae but two more advanced lines did the synapsids (mammal-like reptiles) and the diapsids (most reptiles and later birds) as time progressed diapsids and synapsids temporal fenestrae became more modified and larger to make stronger bites and more jaw muscles dinosaurs which are diapsids have large advanced openings and their descendants the birds have temporal fenestrae which have been modified mammals which are synapsids possess no fenestral openings in the skull as the trait has been modified they do though still have the temporal orbit (which resembles an opening) and the temporal muscles it is a hole in the head and is situated to the rear of the orbit behind the eye
=== classificationedit ===
there are four types of amniote skull classified by the number and location of their fenestra these are
anapsida no openings
synapsida one low opening (beneath the postorbital and squamosal bones)
euryapsida one high opening (above the postorbital and squamosal bones) euryapsids actually evolved from a diapsid configuration losing their lower temporal fenestra
diapsida two openings
evolutionarily they are related as follows
amniota
class synapsida
order therapsida
class mammalia mammals
(unranked)sauropsida reptiles
subclass anapsida
(unranked) eureptilia
subclass diapsida
(unranked) euryapsida
class aves birds

for details and the constituent bones see human skull neurocranium and viscerocranium
in humans as in other mammals the aforementioned division of the skull into the cranium and mandible is not usually followed instead for the purposes of describing their anatomy and enumerating their bones mammalian and human skulls are divided differently they are deemed to consist of two categorical parts the neurocranium and the viscerocranium the neurocranium (or braincase) is a protective vault surrounding the brain the viscerocranium (also splanchnocranium or facial skeleton) is formed by the bones supporting the face both parts have different embryological origins
except for the mandible ear ossicles and hyoid all of the bones of the skull are joined together by sutures rigid articulations permitting very little movement
== bonesedit ==
the jugal is a skull bone found in most reptiles amphibians and birds in mammals the jugal is often called the malar or zygomatic
the prefrontal bone is a bone separating the lacrimal and frontal bones in many tetrapod skulls
== terminologyedit ==
chondrocranium a primitive cartilagionous skeletal structure
endocranium
epicranium
pericranium a membrane that lines the outer surface of the cranium
