lithobates is a subgenus of true frogs of the family ranidae the name was defined by hillis et al for a subgenus of four central and south american frogs within the genus rana the name is derived from litho- (stone) and the greek bates ( one who treads) meaning who treads on rock or rock climber
the name was later used by frost et al as the name of a separate genus of ranid frogs that also includes most of the north american frogs traditionally included in the genus rana including the american bullfrog and northern leopard frog frost used the name in this sense in the frog section of a north american common names list edited by crother (2008) this proposed change has since been rejected in all recent systematic reviews such as stuart (2008) and pauly et al (2009) amphibiaweb an online compendium of amphibian names also does not recognize lithobates as a distinct genus but amphibian species of the world 5.6 an online reference continues to use lithobates as a genus even though its recognition would render the rest of rana paraphyletic (hillis 2007 pauly et al. 2009)
