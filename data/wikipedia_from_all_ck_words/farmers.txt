=== advancements in technologyedit ===
in the u.s of the 1930s one farmer fed only himself and three other consumers the same farmer now feeds well over a hundred people however some authors consider this estimate as flawed as it does not take into account that farming requires energy and many other resources which have to be provided by additional workers so that the ratio of people fed to farmers is actually smaller than 100 to 1
