susie (motion captured by sonya leslie voiced by donna kimball) is the teacher at sid's school she begins the day with rug time, where she summons the children to sit in a circle and asks them if they have anything to share with the class or talk about (usually the topic brought up is what was discussed during sid's survey and what sid was thinking about earlier in the day) she conducts the experiments with her class she sings to the children during the singing with susie segment at the end of the school day
