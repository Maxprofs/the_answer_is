factors affecting reaction rate
nature reactants
depending upon substances reacting reaction rate varies acidbase reactions formation salts ion exchange fast reactions covalent bond formation takes place molecules large molecules formed reactions tend slow nature strength bonds reactant molecules greatly influence rate transformation products
physical state
physical state solid liquid gas reactant also important factor rate change reactants phase aqueous solution thermal motion brings contact however different phases reaction limited interface reactants reaction occur area contact case liquid gas surface fluid vigorous shaking stirring may needed bring reaction completion means finely divided solid liquid reactant greater surface area per unit volume contact reactant thus faster reaction make analogy example one starts fire one uses wood chips small branches one start large logs right away organic chemistry water reactions exception rule homogeneous reactions take place faster heterogeneous reactions
concentration
reactions due collisions reactant species frequency molecules ions collide depends upon concentrations crowded molecules likely collide react one another thus increase concentrations reactants usually result corresponding increase reaction rate decrease concentrations usually reverse effect example combustion occurs air oxygen occur rapidly pure oxygen
temperature
temperature usually major effect rate chemical reaction molecules higher temperature thermal energy although collision frequency greater higher temperatures alone contributes small proportion increase rate reaction much important fact proportion reactant molecules sufficient energy react energy greater activation energy e ea significantly higher explained detail maxwellboltzmann distribution molecular energies
rule thumb rate chemical reactions doubles every c temperature rise common misconception may generalized special case biological systems temperature coefficient often
reactions kinetics also studied temperature jump approach involves using sharp rise temperature observing relaxation time return equilibrium particularly useful form temperature jump apparatus shock tube rapidly jump gass temperature degrees
catalysts
catalyst substance accelerates rate chemical reaction remains chemically unchanged afterwards catalyst increases rate reaction providing different reaction mechanism occur lower activation energy autocatalysis reaction product catalyst reaction leading positive feedback proteins act catalysts biochemical reactions called enzymes michaelismenten kinetics describe rate enzyme mediated reactions catalyst affect position equilibria catalyst speeds backward forward reactions equally
certain organic molecules specific substituents influence reaction rate neighbouring group participation
pressure
increasing pressure gaseous reaction increase number collisions reactants increasing rate reaction activity gas directly proportional partial pressure gas similar effect increasing concentration solution
addition straightforward massaction effect rate coefficients change due pressure rate coefficients products many hightemperature gasphase reactions change inert gas added mixture variations effect called falloff chemical activation phenomena due exothermic endothermic reactions occurring faster heat transfer causing reacting molecules nonthermal energy distributions nonboltzmann distribution increasing pressure increases heat transfer rate reacting molecules rest system reducing effect
condensedphase rate coefficients also affected high pressure completely different effect falloff chemicalactivation often studied using diamond anvils
reactions kinetics also studied pressure jump approach involves making fast changes pressure observing relaxation time return equilibrium
experimental methods
experimental determination reaction rates involves measuring concentrations reactants products change time example concentration reactant measured spectrophotometry wavelength reactant product system absorbs light
reactions take least several minutes possible start observations reactants mixed temperature interest
fast reactions
faster reactions time required mix reactants bring specified temperature may comparable longer halflife reaction special methods start fast reactions without slow mixing step include
stopped flow methods reduce mixing time order millisecond
chemical relaxation methods temperature jump pressure jump premixed system initially equilibrium perturbed rapid heating depressurization longer equilibrium relaxation back equilibrium observed example method used study neutralization ho oh halflife less ordinary conditions
flash photolysis laser pulse produces highly excited species free radicals whose reactions studied
equilibrium
chemical kinetics concerned rate chemical reaction thermodynamics determines extent reactions occur reversible reaction chemical equilibrium reached rates forward reverse reactions equal principle detailed balance concentrations reactants products longer change demonstrated example haberbosch process combining nitrogen hydrogen produce ammonia chemical clock reactions belousovzhabotinsky reaction demonstrate component concentrations oscillate long time finally attaining equilibrium
free energy
general terms free energy change g reaction determines whether chemical change take place kinetics describes fast reaction reaction exothermic positive entropy change happen practice reaction slow reactant produce two different products thermodynamically stable one general form except special circumstances reaction said kinetic reaction control curtinhammett principle applies determining product ratio two reactants interconverting rapidly going different product possible make predictions reaction rate constants reaction freeenergy relationships
kinetic isotope effect difference rate chemical reaction atom one reactants replaced one isotopes
chemical kinetics provides information residence time heat transfer chemical reactor chemical engineering molar mass distribution polymer chemistry
