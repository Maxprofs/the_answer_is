background dna structure
dna usually exists doublestranded structure strands coiled together form characteristic doublehelix single strand dna chain four types nucleotides nucleotides dna contain deoxyribose sugar phosphate nucleobase four types nucleotide correspond four nucleobases adenine cytosine guanine thymine commonly abbreviated ac g adenine guanine purine bases cytosine thymine pyrimidines nucleotides form phosphodiester bonds creating phosphatedeoxyribose backbone dna double helix nucleobases pointing inward nucleotides bases matched strands hydrogen bonds form base pairs adenine pairs thymine two hydrogen bonds guanine pairs cytosine stronger three hydrogen bonds
dna strands directionality different ends single strand called threeprime end fiveprime end convention base sequence single strand dna given left end sequence end right end sequence end strands double helix antiparallel one opposite strand terms refer carbon atom deoxyribose next phosphate chain attaches directionality consequences dna synthesis dna polymerase synthesize dna one direction adding nucleotides end dna strand
pairing complementary bases dna hydrogen bonding means information contained within strand redundant nucleotides single strand used reconstruct nucleotides newly synthesized partner strand
dna polymerase
dna polymerases family enzymes carry forms dna replication dna polymerases general cannot initiate synthesis new strands extend existing dna rna strand paired template strand begin synthesis short fragment rna called primer must created paired template dna strand
dna polymerase adds new strand dna extending end existing nucleotide chain adding new nucleotides matched template strand one time via creation phosphodiester bonds energy process dna polymerization comes hydrolysis highenergy phosphate phosphoanhydride bonds three phosphates attached unincorporated base free bases attached phosphate groups called nucleotides particular bases three attached phosphate groups called nucleoside triphosphates nucleotide added growing dna strand formation phosphodiester bond proximal phosphate nucleotide growing chain accompanied hydrolysis highenergy phosphate bond release two distal phosphates pyrophosphate enzymatic hydrolysis resulting pyrophosphate inorganic phosphate consumes second highenergy phosphate bond renders reaction effectively irreversible
general dna polymerases highly accurate intrinsic error rate less one mistake every nucleotides added addition dna polymerases also proofreading ability remove nucleotides end growing strand order correct mismatched bases finally postreplication mismatch repair mechanisms monitor dna errors capable distinguishing mismatches newly synthesized dna strand original strand sequence together three discrimination steps enable replication fidelity less one mistake every nucleotides added

replication process
dna replication like biological polymerization processes proceeds three enzymatically catalyzed coordinated steps initiation elongation termination
initiation
