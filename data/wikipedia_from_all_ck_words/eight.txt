== in mathematics ==
8 is a composite number its proper divisors being 1 2 and 4 it is twice 4 or four times 2 eight is a power of two being (two cubed) and is the first number of the form  p being an integer greater than 1 it is also the first number which is neither prime nor semiprime it has an aliquot sum of 7 in the 4 member aliquot sequence (8,7,1,0) being the first member of 7-aliquot tree

the number 8 is involved with a number of interesting mathematical phenomena related to the notion of bott periodicity for example if is the direct limit of the inclusions of real orthogonal groups then  clifford algebras also display a periodicity of 8 for example the algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of 16 by 16 matrices with entries in  we also see a period of 8 in the k-theory of spheres and in the representation theory of the rotation groups the latter giving rise to the 8 by 8 spinorial chessboard all of these properties are closely related to the properties of the octonions
the spin group is the unique such group that exhibits the phenomenon of triality

== etymology ==
english eight from old english eahta hta proto-germanic *ahto is a direct continuation of proto-indo-european *ot(w)- and as such cognate with greek and latin octo- both of which stems are reflected by the english prefix oct(o)- as in the ordinal adjective octaval or octavary the distributive adjective is octonary the adjective octuple (latin octu-plus) may also be used as a noun meaning a set of eight items the diminutive octuplet is mostly used to refer to eight sibling delivered in one birth
the semitic numeral is based on a root *mn- whence akkadian smn- arabic mn- hebrew mn- etc the chinese numeral (pinyin b) is from an old chinese *prit- ultimately from sino-tibetan b-r-gyat or b-g-ryat which also yielded tibetan brgyat
it has been argued that as the cardinal number seven is the highest number of item that can universally be cognitively processed as a single set the etymology of the numeral eight might be the first to be considered composite either as twice four or as two short of ten or similar the turkic words for eight are from a proto-turkic stem *sekiz which has been suggested as originating as a negation of eki two as in without two fingers (i.e. two short of ten two fingers are not being held up") this same principle is found in finnic *kakte-ksa which conveys a meaning of two before (ten) the proto-indo-european reconstruction *ot(w)- itself has been argued as representing an old dual which would correspond to an original meaning of twice four proponents of this quaternary hypothesis adduce the numeral nine which might be built on the stem new- meaning new (indicating the beginning of a new set of numerals after having counted to eight)
== glyph ==
the modern 8 glyph like all modern hindu-arabic numerals (other than zero) originates with the brahmi numerals the brahmi numeral for eight by the 1st century was written in one stroke as a curve looking like an uppercase h with the bottom half of the left line and the upper half of the right line removed however the eight glyph used in india in the early centuries of the common era developed considerable variation and in some cases took the shape of a single wedge which was adopted into the perso-arabic tradition as (and also gave rise to the later devanagari numeral  the alternative curved glyph also existed as a variant in perso-arabic tradition where it came to look similar to our glyph 5
the numerals as used in al-andalus by the 10th century were a distinctive western variant of the glyphs used in the arabic-speaking world known as ghubr numerals (ghubr translating to sand table") in these numerals the line of the 5-like glyph used in indian manuscripts for eight came to be formed in ghubr as a closed loop which was the 8-shape that became adopted into european use in the 10th century
just as in most modern typefaces in typefaces with text figures the 8 character usually has an ascender as for example in 
the infinity symbol  described as sideways figure eight is unrelated to the 8 glyph in origin it is first used (in the mathematical meaning infinity") in the 17th century and it may be derived from the roman numeral for one thousand ci or alternatively from the final greek letter 
the numeral eight in greek numerals developed in classical greece by the 5th century bc was written as  the eight letter of the greek alphabet
the chinese numeral eight is written in two strokes  the glyph is also the 12th kangxi radical

eight ( hachi ya) is also considered a lucky number in japanese culture but the reason is different from that in chinese culture eight gives an idea of growing prosperous because the letter () broadens gradually
the japanese thought eight ( ya) as a holy number in the ancient times the reason is less well understood but it is thought that it is related to the fact they used eight to express large numbers vaguely such as manyfold ( yae hatae) (literally eightfold and twentyfold) many clouds ( yakumo) (literally eight clouds) millions and millions of gods ( yaoyorozu no kami) (literally eight millions of gods) etc it is also guessed that the ancient japanese gave importance to pairs so some researchers guess twice as four ( yo) which is also guessed to be a holy number in those times because it indicates the world (north south east and west) might be considered a very holy number
