lytic cycle one two cycles viral reproduction lysogenic cycle lytic cycle results destruction infected cell membrane key difference lytic lysogenic phage cycles lytic phage viral dna exists separate molecule within bacterial cell replicates separately host bacterial dna location viral dna lysogenic phage cycle within host dna therefore cases virusphage replicates using host dna machinery lytic phage cycle phage free floating separate molecule host dna
descriptionedit
viruses use lytic cycle called virulent viruses contrast temperate viruses lytic cycle sixstage cycle first stage called penetration virus injects nucleic acid host cell viruses genetic material circular mimics bacterial plasmid virus hijacks cells replication translation mechanisms using make viruses enough virions accumulated specialized viral proteins allowed dissolve bacterial cell wall cell bursts due high internal osmotic pressure water pressure longer constrained cell wall releases progeny virions surrounding environment go infect cells
penetrationedit
infect cell virus must first enter cell plasma membrane present cell wall viruses either attaching receptor cells surface simple mechanical force virus releases genetic material either single doublestranded rna dna cell cell becomes infected also targeted immune system
biosynthesisedit
virus nucleic acid uses host cells metabolic machinery make large amounts viral components case dna viruses dna transcribes messenger rna mrna molecules used direct cells ribosomes one first polypeptides translated destroys hosts dna retroviruses inject rna strand unique enzyme called reverse transcriptase transcribes viral rna dna transcribed rna viral dna taken control induces host cells machinery synthesize viral dna protein starts multiplying minutes initial infection approximately new bacteriophages formed bacterial cell bursts ie undergone lysis newly formed phages released infect bacteria another lytic cycle begins phage causes lysis host called lytic virulent phage biosynthesis eg regulated three phases mrna production followed phase protein production
early phase
enzymes modify hosts dna replication rna polymerase amongst modifications virus changes sigma factor host producing antisigma factor host promotors recognized recognize middle proteins protein synthesis shinedalgarno subsequence gagg dominates early genes translation
middle phase
virus nucleic acid dna rna depending virus type
late phase
structural proteins including head tail
gene regulation biochemistryedit
three classes genes phage genome regulate whether lytic lysogenic cycles emerge first immediate early genes second delayed early genes third late genes
immediate early genes genes code two transcription factors n cro n antitermination factor needed transcription delayed early genes cro two functions first function repress activity repressor needed go lysogeny note repressor coded ci gene needed repress lytic cycle taking place second function cro initiate transcription late genes needed lytic cycle go completion
delayed early genes immediate early gene n required express delayed early genes lytic cells delayed early gene important q genes also used express late genes
repressor repressor needed repress lytic cycle lysogeny proceed n domains bind dna via helix turn helix motif c domains dimerize stabilize protein
lysis inhibition tlike phages contain gene called ri delay completed phage progeny exiting impregnated cell suppressing expression holin gene products usually four hours exponential phase growing cultures rich media deletion ri cancels inhibition effect observed higher concentrations extracellular phage particles present
maturation lysisedit
many copies viral components made assembled complete viruses phage directs production lysin enzyme breaks bacterial cell wall allows extracellular fluid enter cell cell eventually becomes filled viruses typically liquid bursts lyses thus giving lytic cycle name new viruses free infect cells
lytic cycle without lysisedit
viruses escape host cell without bursting cell membrane rather budextrude taking portion membrane otherwise characteristic lytic cycle steps still belongs category although sometimes named productive cycle hiv influenza viruses infect eukaryotic organisms generally use method group includes viruses lipid membrane
