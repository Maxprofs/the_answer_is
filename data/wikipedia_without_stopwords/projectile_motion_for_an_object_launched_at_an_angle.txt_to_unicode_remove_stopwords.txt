projectile motion form motion object particle called projectile thrown near earths surface moves along curved path action gravity force significance acts object gravity acts downward cause downward acceleration horizontal forces needed maintain horizontal motion consistent concept inertia
initial velocity
projectile launched initial velocity written
components found angle known
projectiles range launch angle drop height known launch velocity found using newtons formula
launch angle usually expressed symbol theta often symbol alpha used
kinematic quantities projectile motion
projectile motion horizontal motion vertical motion independent neither motion affects
acceleration
since acceleration vertical direction velocity horizontal direction constant equal vertical motion projectile motion particle free fall acceleration constant equal components acceleration
velocity
horizontal component velocity object remains unchanged throughout motion vertical component velocity increases linearly acceleration due gravity constant accelerations directions integrated solve components velocity time follows
magnitude velocity pythagorean theorem triangle law
displacement
time projectiles horizontal vertical displacement
magnitude displacement
parabolic equation
consider equations
eliminated two equations following equation obtained
equation equation parabola since constants equation form
constants equation parabola path parabolic axis parabola vertical
time flight total time whole journey
total time projectile remains air called time flight
flight projectile returns horizontal axis y
note neglected air resistance projectile
maximum height projectile
highest height object reach known peak objects motion increase height last
time reach maximum height
vertical displacement maximum height projectile
relation horizontal range maximum height
relation range horizontal plane maximum height reached
maximum distance projectile
important note range maximum height projectile depend upon mass trajected body hence range maximum height equal bodies thrown velocity direction air resistance affect displacement projectile
horizontal range d projectile horizontal distance projectile travelled returns initial height y
reach ground
horizontal displacement maximum distance projectile
note maximum value
necessarily corresponds
application work energy theorem
according workenergy theorem vertical component velocity listed
