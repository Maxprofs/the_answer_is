skepticism or scepticism (see spelling differences) is generally any questioning attitude towards unempirical knowledge or opinions/beliefs stated as facts or doubt regarding claims that are taken for granted elsewhere
philosophical skepticism is a systematic approach that questions the notion that absolutely certain knowledge is possible classical philosophical skepticism derives from the skeptikoi a school who asserted nothing adherents of pyrrhonism (and more recently partially synonymous with fallibilism) for instance suspend judgment in investigations skeptics may even doubt the reliability of their own senses religious skepticism on the other hand is doubt concerning basic religious principles (such as immortality providence and revelation) scientific skepticism is about testing beliefs for reliability by subjecting them to systematic investigation using the scientific method to discover empirical evidence for them

in philosophical skepticism pyrrhonism is a position that refrains from making truth claims a philosophical skeptic does not claim that truth is impossible (which itself would be a truth claim) instead it recommends suspending belief the term is commonly used to describe philosophies which are similar to philosophical skepticism such as academic skepticism an ancient variant of platonism that claimed knowledge of truth was impossible empiricism is a closely related but not identical philosophy to philosophical skepticism empiricists claim empiricism is a pragmatic compromise between philosophical skepticism and nomothetic science philosophical skepticism is in turn sometimes referred to as radical empiricism.
western philosophical skepticism originated in ancient greek philosophy the greek sophists of the 5th century bc were partially skeptics
pyrrho of elis (365275 bc) is usually credited with founding the school of skepticism he traveled to india and studied with the gymnosophists (naked lovers of wisdom) which could have been any number of indian sects from there he brought back the idea that nothing can be known for certain the senses are easily fooled and reason follows too easily our desires pyrrhonism was a school of skepticism founded by his follower aenesidemus in the first century bc and recorded by sextus empiricus in the late 2nd century or early 3rd century ad subsequently in the new academy arcesilaus (c 315241 bc) and carneades (c 213129 bc) developed more theoretical perspectives by which conceptions of absolute truth and falsity were refuted as uncertain carneades criticized the claims of the dogmatists especially supporters of stoicism asserting that absolute certainty of knowledge is impossible sextus empiricus (c ad 200) the main authority for greek skepticism developed the philosophy further incorporating aspects of empiricism into the basis for asserting knowledge
greek skeptics criticized the stoics accusing them of dogmatism for the skeptics the logical mode of argument was untenable as it relied on propositions which could not be said to be either true or false without relying on further propositions this was the regress argument whereby every proposition must rely on other propositions in order to maintain its validity (see the five tropes of agrippa the sceptic) in addition the skeptics argued that two propositions could not rely on each other as this would create a circular argument (as p implies q and q implies p) for the skeptics such logic was thus an inadequate measure of truth and could create as many problems as it claimed to have solved truth was not however necessarily unobtainable but rather an idea which did not yet exist in a pure form although skepticism was accused of denying the possibility of truth in fact it appears to have mainly been a critical school which merely claimed that logicians had not discovered truth
in islamic philosophy skepticism was established by al-ghazali (10581111) known in the west as algazel as part of the ash'ari school of islamic theology whose method of skepticism shares many similarities with descartes method
in an effort to avoid skepticism ren descartes begins his meditations on first philosophy attempting to find indubitable truth on which to base his knowledge he later recognizes this truth as i think therefore i am, but before he finds this truth he briefly entertains the skeptical arguments from dreaming and radical deception
david hume has also been described as a skeptic
pierre le morvan (2011) has distinguished between three philosophical approaches to skepticism the first he terms the foil approach. according to this approach skepticism is treated as a problem to be solved or challenge to be met or threat to be parried skepticism's value according to this method insofar as it is deemed to have one accrues from its role as a foil contrastively illuminating what is required for knowledge and justified belief the second he calls the bypass approach according to which skepticism is bypassed as a major concern of epistemology le morvan advocates a third approachhe dubs it the health approach"that explores when skepticism is healthy and when it is not or when it is virtuous and when it is vicious
== scientific skepticismedit ==
a scientific (or empirical) skeptic is one who questions beliefs on the basis of scientific understanding most scientists being scientific skeptics test the reliability of certain kinds of claims by subjecting them to a systematic investigation using some form of the scientific method as a result a number of claims are considered pseudoscience if they are found to improperly apply or ignore the fundamental aspects of the scientific method scientific skepticism may discard beliefs pertaining to things outside perceivable observation and thus outside the realm of systematic empirical falsifiability/testability
== religious skepticismedit ==
religious skepticism generally refers to doubting given religious beliefs or claims historically religious skepticism can be traced back to socrates who doubted many religious claims of the time modern religious skepticism typically emphasizes scientific and historical methods or evidence with michael shermer writing that it is a process for discovering the truth rather than general non-acceptance for this reason a religious skeptic might believe that jesus existed while questioning claims that he was the messiah or performed miracles (see historicity of jesus) religious skepticism is not the same as atheism or agnosticism though these often do involve skeptical attitudes toward religion and philosophical theology (for example towards divine omnipotence) religious people are generally skeptical about claims of other religions at least when the two denominations conflict concerning some stated belief additionally they may also be skeptical of the claims made by atheists the historian will durant writes that plato was as skeptical of atheism as of any other dogma.
