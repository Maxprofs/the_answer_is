a stratigraphic unit is a volume of rock of identifiable origin and relative age range that is defined by the distinctive and dominant easily mapped and recognizable petrographic lithologic or paleontologic features (facies) that characterize it
units must be mappable and distinct from one another but the contact need not be particularly distinct for instance a unit may be defined by terms such as when the sandstone component exceeds 75%
== lithostratigraphic units ==
sequences of sedimentary and volcanic rocks are subdivided on the basis of their lithology going from smaller to larger in scale the main units recognised are bed member formation group and supergroup
=== bed ===
a bed is a lithologically distinct layer within a member or formation and is the smallest recognisable stratigraphic unit these are not normally named but may be in the case of a marker horizon
=== member ===
a member is a named lithologically distinct part of a formation not all formations are subdivided in this way and even where they are recognised they may only form part of the formation
=== formation ===
formations are the primary units used in the subdivision of a sequence and may vary in scale from tens of centimetres to kilometres they should be distinct lithologically from other formations although the boundaries do not need to be sharp to be formally recognised a formation must have sufficient extent to be useful in mapping an area
=== group ===
a group is an aggregate of two or more formations that share certain lithological characteristics a group may be made up of different formations in different geographical areas and individual formations may appear in more than one group
=== supergroup ===
a supergroup is an aggregate of two or more associated groups and/or formations that share certain lithological characteristics a supergroup may be made up of different groups in different geographical areas
== biostratigraphic units ==
a sequence of fossil-bearing sedimentary rocks can be subdivided on the basis of the occurrence of particular fossil taxa a unit defined in this way is known as a biostratigraphic unit generally shortened to biozone the five commonly used types of biozone are assemblage range abundance interval and lineage zones
an assemblage zone is a stratigraphic interval characterised by an assemblage of three or more coexisting fossil taxa that distinguish it from surrounding strata
a range zone is a stratigraphic interval that represents the occurrence range of a specific fossil taxon based on the localities where it has been recognised
an abundance zone is a stratigraphic interval in which the abundance of a particular taxon (or group of taxa) is significantly greater than seen in neighbouring parts of the succession
an interval zone is a stratigraphic interval whose top and base are defined by horizons that mark the first or last occurrence of two different taxa
a lineage zone is a stratigraphic interval that contains fossils that represent parts of the evolutionary lineage of a particular fossil group this is a special case of a range zone
