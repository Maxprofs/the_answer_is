fermentation metabolic process converts sugar acids gases alcohol occurs yeast bacteria also oxygenstarved muscle cells case lactic acid fermentation fermentation also used broadly refer bulk growth microorganisms growth medium often goal producing specific chemical product french microbiologist louis pasteur often remembered insights fermentation microbial causes science fermentation known zymology
fermentation takes place lack oxygen electron transport chain unusable becomes cells primary means atp energy production turns nadh pyruvate produced glycolysis step nad various small molecules depending type fermentation see examples presence o nadh pyruvate used generate atp respiration called oxidative phosphorylation generates much atp glycolysis alone reason cells generally benefit avoiding fermentation oxygen available exception obligate anaerobes cannot tolerate oxygen
first step glycolysis common fermentation pathways

oxidative phosphorylation energy atp formation derived electrochemical proton gradient generated across inner mitochondrial membrane case bacteria plasma membrane via electron transport chain glycolysis substratelevel phosphorylation atp generated directly point reaction
humans used fermentation produce food beverages since neolithic age example fermentation used preservation process produces lactic acid found sour foods pickled cucumbers kimchi yogurt see fermentation food processing well producing alcoholic beverages wine see fermentation winemaking beer fermentation even occur within stomachs animals humans autobrewery syndrome rare medical condition stomach contains brewers yeast break starches ethanol enters blood stream
definitionsedit
many people fermentation simply means production alcohol grains fruits fermented produce beer wine food soured one might say fermented definitions fermentation range informal general usage scientific definitions
preservation methods food via microorganisms general use
process produces alcoholic beverages acidic dairy products general use
largescale microbial process occurring without air common definition used industry
energyreleasing metabolic process takes place anaerobic conditions becoming scientific
metabolic process releases energy sugar organic molecules require oxygen electron transport system uses organic molecule final electron acceptor scientific
examplesedit
fermentation necessarily carried anaerobic environment example even presence abundant oxygen yeast cells greatly prefer fermentation aerobic respiration long sugars readily available consumption phenomenon known crabtree effect antibiotic activity hops also inhibits aerobic metabolism yeast
fermentation reacts nadh endogenous organic electron acceptor usually pyruvate formed sugar glycolysis step fermentation pyruvate metabolized various compounds several processes
ethanol fermentation aka alcoholic fermentation production ethanol carbon dioxide
lactic acid fermentation refers two means producing lactic acid
homolactic fermentation production lactic acid exclusively
heterolactic fermentation production lactic acid well acids alcohols
sugars common substrate fermentation typical examples fermentation products ethanol lactic acid carbon dioxide hydrogen gas h however exotic compounds produced fermentation butyric acid acetone yeast carries fermentation production ethanol beers wines alcoholic drinks along production large quantities carbon dioxide fermentation occurs mammalian muscle periods intense exercise oxygen supply becomes limited resulting creation lactic acid
chemistryedit
fermentation products contain chemical energy fully oxidized considered waste products since cannot metabolized without use oxygen
ethanol fermentationedit
chemical equation shows alcoholic fermentation glucose whose chemical formula cho one glucose molecule converted two ethanol molecules two carbon dioxide molecules
cho choh co
choh chemical formula ethanol
fermentation takes place one glucose molecule broken two pyruvate molecules known glycolysis
lactic acid fermentationedit
homolactic fermentation producing lactic acid simplest type fermentation pyruvate glycolysis undergoes simple redox reaction forming lactic acid unique one respiration processes produce gas byproduct overall one molecule glucose sixcarbon sugar converted two molecules lactic acid cho chchohcooh
occurs muscles animals need energy faster blood supply oxygen also occurs kinds bacteria lactobacilli fungi type bacteria converts lactose lactic acid yogurt giving sour taste lactic acid bacteria carry either homolactic fermentation endproduct mostly lactic acid
heterolactic fermentation lactate metabolized results ethanol carbon dioxide via phosphoketolase pathway acetate metabolic products eg cho chchohcooh choh co
lactose fermented yogurts cheeses first converted glucose galactose sixcarbon sugars atomic formula cho ho cho
heterolactic fermentation sense intermediate lactic acid fermentation types eg alcoholic fermentation see reasons go convert lactic acid anything else
acidity lactic acid impedes biological processes beneficial fermenting organism drives competitors unadapted acidity result food longer shelflife part reason foods purposely fermented first place however beyond certain point acidity starts affecting organism produces
high concentration lactic acid final product fermentation drives equilibrium backwards le chateliers principle decreasing rate fermentation occur slowing growth
ethanol lactic acid easily converted volatile readily escape allowing reaction proceed easily co also produced however weakly acidic even volatile ethanol
acetic acid another conversion product acidic volatile ethanol however presence limited oxygen creation lactic acid releases lot additional energy lighter molecule lactic acid forms fewer hydrogen bonds surroundings due fewer groups form bonds thus volatile also allow reaction move forward quickly
propionic acid butyric acid longer monocarboxylic acids produced see mixed acid fermentation amount acidity produced per glucose consumed decrease ethanol allowing faster growth
aerobic respirationedit
aerobic respiration pyruvate produced glycolysis oxidized completely generating additional atp nadh citric acid cycle oxidative phosphorylation however occur presence oxygen oxygen toxic organisms obligate anaerobes required facultative anaerobic organisms absence oxygen one fermentation pathways occurs order regenerate nad lactic acid fermentation one pathways
hydrogen gas production fermentationedit
hydrogen gas produced many types fermentation mixed acid fermentation butyric acid fermentation caproate fermentation butanol fermentation glyoxylate fermentation way regenerate nad nadh electrons transferred ferredoxin turn oxidized hydrogenase producing h hydrogen gas substrate methanogens sulfate reducers keep concentration hydrogen low favor production energyrich compound hydrogen gas fairly high concentration nevertheless formed flatus
example mixed acid fermentation bacteria clostridium pasteurianum ferment glucose producing butyrate acetate carbon dioxide hydrogen gas reaction leading acetate
cho ho chcoo hco h h
glucose could theoretically converted co h global reaction releases little energy
methane gas production fermentationedit
acetic acid also undergo dismutation reaction produce methane carbon dioxide
chcoo h ch co g kjreaction
disproportionation reaction catalysed methanogen archaea fermentative metabolism one electron transferred carbonyl function e donor carboxylic group methyl group e acceptor acetic acid respectively produce co methane gas
