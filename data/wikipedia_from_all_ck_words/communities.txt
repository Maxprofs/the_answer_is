a community is a social unit of any size that shares common values or that is situated in a given geographical area (e.g a village or town) it is a group of people who are connected by durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties and who mutually define that relationship as important to their social identity and practice although communities are usually small community may also refer to large groups such as national communities international communities and virtual communities
the word community is derived from the old french comunet which comes from the latin communitas (from latin communis things held in common)
in human communities intent belief resources preferences needs and risks may be shared in common affecting the identity of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness
== perspectives from various disciplines ==
=== community studies ===
community studies is an academic field drawing on both sociology and anthropology and the social research methods of ethnography and participant observation in the study of community in academic settings around the world community studies is variously a sub-discipline of anthropology or sociology or an independent discipline it is often interdisciplinary and geared toward practical applications rather than purely theoretical perspectives community studies is sometimes combined with other fields i.e. urban and community studies, health and community studies, or family and community studies.
=== internet studies ===
internet studies is an interdisciplinary field studying the social psychological pedagogical political technical cultural artistic and other dimensions of the internet and associated information and communication technologies while studies of the internet are now widespread across academic disciplines there is a growing collaboration among these investigations in recent years internet studies have become institutionalized as courses of study at several institutions of higher learning including the university of oxford curtin university of technology brandeis university endicott college hebrew university of jerusalem appalachian state university and the university of minnesota cognates are found in departments of a number of other names including departments of digital culture new media or convergent media various ischools or programs like media in transition at mit on the research side internet studies intersects with studies of cyberculture human-computer interaction and science and technology studies a number of academic journals are central to communicating research in the field including bad subjects convergence the journal of research into new media technologies ctheory cyber psychology + behaviour computers in human behavior first monday information communication and society the information society journal of computer-mediated communication m/c new media & society triplec journal for a global sustainable information society fibreculture journal and teknokultura but research relating to internet studies appears in a diverse range of venues and disciplines
=== philosophy of social science ===
the philosophy of social science is the study of the logic and method of the social sciences such as sociology anthropology and political science philosophers of social science are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the natural sciences causal relationships between social phenomena the possible existence of social laws and the ontological significance of structure and agency
=== anthropology ===
==== cultural anthropology ====
cultural anthropology is a branch of anthropology focused on the study of cultural variation among humans and is in contrast to social anthropology which perceives cultural variation as a subset of the anthropological constant
a variety of methods are part of anthropological methodology including participant observation (often called fieldwork because it involves the anthropologist spending an extended period of time at the research location) interviews and surveys
one of the earliest articulations of the anthropological meaning of the term culture came from sir edward tylor who writes on the first page of his 1897 book culture or civilization taken in its broad ethnographic sense is that complex whole which includes knowledge belief art morals law custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society. the term civilization later gave way to definitions by v gordon childe with culture forming an umbrella term and civilization becoming a particular kind of culture
the anthropological concept of culture reflects in part a reaction against earlier western discourses based on an opposition between culture and nature according to which some human beings lived in a state of nature anthropologists have argued that culture is human nature and that all people have a capacity to classify experiences encode classifications symbolically (i.e in language) and teach such abstractions to others
since humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and socialization people living in different places or different circumstances develop different cultures anthropologists have also pointed out that through culture people can adapt to their environment in non-genetic ways so people living in different environments will often have different cultures much of anthropological theory has originated in an appreciation of and interest in the tension between the local (particular cultures) and the global (a universal human nature or the web of connections between people in distinct places/circumstances)
the rise of cultural anthropology occurred within the context of the late 19th century when questions regarding which cultures were primitive and which were civilized occupied the minds of not only marx and freud but many others colonialism and its processes increasingly brought european thinkers in contact directly or indirectly with primitive others. the relative status of various humans some of whom had modern advanced technologies that included engines and telegraphs while others lacked anything but face-to-face communication techniques and still lived a paleolithic lifestyle was of interest to the first generation of cultural anthropologists
parallel with the rise of cultural anthropology in the united states social anthropology in which sociality is the central concept and which focuses on the study of social statuses and roles groups institutions and the relations among themdeveloped as an academic discipline in britain and in france an umbrella term socio-cultural anthropology makes reference to both cultural and social anthropology traditions
=== archaeology ===
in archaeological studies of social communities the term community is used in two ways paralleling usage in other areas the first is an informal definition of community as a place where people used to live in this sense it is synonymous with the concept of an ancient settlement whether a hamlet village town or city the second meaning is similar to the usage of the term in other social sciences a community is a group of people living near one another who interact socially social interaction on a small scale can be difficult to identify with archaeological data most reconstructions of social communities by archaeologists rely on the principle that social interaction is conditioned by physical distance therefore a small village settlement likely constituted a social community and spatial subdivisions of cities and other large settlements may have formed communities archaeologists typically use similarities in material culturefrom house types to styles of potteryto reconstruct communities in the past this is based on the assumption that people or households will share more similarities in the types and styles of their material goods with other members of a social community than they will with outsiders
=== ecology ===
in ecology a community is an assemblage of populations of different species interacting with one another community ecology is the branch of ecology that studies interactions between and among species it considers how such interactions along with interactions between species and the abiotic environment affect community structure and species richness diversity and patterns of abundance species interact in three ways competition predation and mutualism competition typically results in a double negativethat is both species lose in the interaction predation is a win/lose situation with one species winning mutualism on the other hand involves both species cooperating in some way with both winning
=== psychology ===
==== community psychology ====
community psychology studies the individuals contexts within communities and the wider society and the relationships of the individual to communities and society community psychologists seek to understand the quality of life of individuals communities and society their aim is to enhance quality of life through collaborative research and action
community psychology employ various perspectives within and outside of psychology to address issues of communities the relationships within them and related people's attitudes and behaviour
rappaport (1977) discusses the perspective of community psychology as an ecological perspective on the personenvironment fit (this is often related to work environments) being the focus of study and action instead of attempting to change the personality of individual or the environment when an individual is seen as having a problem
closely related disciplines include ecological psychology environmental psychology cross-cultural psychology social psychology political science public health sociology social work applied anthropology and community development
community psychology grew out of the community mental health movement but evolved dramatically as early practitioners incorporated their understandings of political structures and other community contexts into perspectives on client services
=== sociology ===
==== computational sociology ====
computational sociology is a branch of sociology that uses computationally intensive methods to analyze and model social phenomena using computer simulations artificial intelligence complex statistical methods and analytic approaches like social network analysis computational sociology develops and tests theories of complex social processes through bottom-up modeling of social interactions
it involves the understanding of social agents the interaction among these agents and the effect of these interactions on the social aggregate although the subject matter and methodologies in social science differ from those in natural science or computer science several of the approaches used in contemporary social simulation originated from fields such as physics and artificial intelligence some of the approaches that originated in this field have been imported into the natural sciences such as measures of network centrality from the fields of social network analysis and network science
in relevant literature computational sociology is often related to the study of social complexity social complexity concepts such as complex systems non-linear interconnection among macro and micro process and emergence have entered the vocabulary of computational sociology a practical and well-known example is the construction of a computational model in the form of an artificial society, by which researchers can analyze the structure of a social system
==== social capital ====
social capital is a form of economic and cultural capital in which social networks are central transactions are marked by reciprocity trust and cooperation and market agents produce goods and services not mainly for themselves but for a common good
the term generally refers to (a) resources and the value of these resources both tangible (public spaces private property) and intangible ("actors human capital people) (b) the relationships among these resources and (c) the impact that these relationships have on the resources involved in each relationship and on larger groups it is generally seen as a form of capital that produces public goods for a common good
social capital has been used to explain improved performance of diverse groups the growth of entrepreneurial firms superior managerial performance enhanced supply chain relations the value derived from strategic alliances and the evolution of communities
== key concepts ==
=== gemeinschaft and gesellschaft ===
in gemeinschaft und gesellschaft (1887) german sociologist ferdinand tnnies described two types of human association gemeinschaft (usually translated as community") and gesellschaft ("society or association") tnnies proposed the gemeinschaftgesellschaft dichotomy as a way to think about social ties no group is exclusively one or the other gemeinschaft stress personal social interactions and the roles values and beliefs based on such interactions gesellschaft stress indirect interactions impersonal roles formal values and beliefs based on such interactions
=== internet communities ===
groups of people are complex in ways that make those groups hard to form and hard to sustain much of the shape of traditional institutions is a response to those difficulties new social tools relieve some of those burdens allowing for new kinds of group-forming like using simple sharing to anchor the creation of new groups
one simple form of cooperation almost universal with social tools is conversation when people are in one another's company even virtually they like to talk conversation creates more of a sense of community than sharing does
collaborative production is a more involved form of cooperation as it increases the tension between individual and group goals the litmus test for collaborative production is simple no one person can take credit for what gets created and the project could not come into being without the participation of many
an online community builds weaker bonds and allows users to be anonymous clay shirky a researcher on digital media states in reference to the audience of an online community an audience isnt just a big community it can be more anonymous with many fewer ties among users a community isnt just a small audience either it has a social density that audiences lack. the sites that offer online communities like myspace twitter facebook instagram tumblr and pinterest allow users to stalk their community and act anonymously
=== organizational communication ===
effective communication practices in group and organizational settings are very important to the formation and maintenance of communities the ways that ideas and values are communicated within communities are important to the induction of new members the formulation of agendas the selection of leaders and many other aspects organizational communication is the study of how people communicate within an organizational context and the influences and interactions within organizational structures group members depend on the flow of communication to establish their own identity within these structures and learn to function in the group setting although organizational communication as a field of study is usually geared toward companies and business groups these may also be seen as communities the principles of organizational communication can also be applied to other types of communities
=== public administration ===
public administration is the province of local state and federal governments with local governments responsible for units in towns cities villages and counties among others the most well known community department is housing and community development which has responsibility for both economic development initiatives and as public housing and community infrastructure (e.g. business development)
=== sense of community ===
in a seminal 1986 study mcmillan and chavis identify four elements of sense of community
membership
influence
integration and fulfillment of needs
shared emotional connection
they give the following example of the interplay between these factors
someone puts an announcement on the dormitory bulletin board about the formation of an intramural dormitory basketball team people attend the organizational meeting as strangers out of their individual needs (integration and fulfillment of needs) the team is bound by place of residence (membership boundaries are set) and spends time together in practice (the contact hypothesis) they play a game and win (successful shared valent event) while playing members exert energy on behalf of the team (personal investment in the group) as the team continues to win team members become recognized and congratulated (gaining honor and status for being members) influencing new members to join and continue to do the same someone suggests that they all buy matching shirts and shoes (common symbols) and they do so (influence)
a sense of community index (sci) has been developed by chavis and colleagues and revised and adapted by others although originally designed to assess sense of community in neighborhoods the index has been adapted for use in schools the workplace and a variety of types of communities
studies conducted by the appa show substantial evidence that young adults who feel a sense of belonging in a community particularly small communities develop fewer psychiatric and depressive disorders than those who do not have the feeling of love and belonging
=== socialization ===
the process of learning to adopt the behavior patterns of the community is called socialization the most fertile time of socialization is usually the early stages of life during which individuals develop the skills and knowledge and learn the roles necessary to function within their culture and social environment for some psychologists especially those in the psychodynamic tradition the most important period of socialization is between the ages of one and ten but socialization also includes adults moving into a significantly different environment where they must learn a new set of behaviors
socialization is influenced primarily by the family through which children first learn community norms other important influences include schools peer groups people mass media the workplace and government the degree to which the norms of a particular society or community are adopted determines one's willingness to engage with others the norms of tolerance reciprocity and trust are important habits of the heart, as de tocqueville put it in an individual's involvement in community
== community development ==
community development is often linked with community work or community planning and may involve stakeholders foundations governments or contracted entities including non-government organisations (ngos) universities or government agencies to progress the social well-being of local regional and sometimes national communities more grassroots efforts called community building or community organizing seek to empower individuals and groups of people by providing them with the skills they need to effect change in their own communities these skills often assist in building political power through the formation of large social groups working for a common agenda community development practitioners must understand both how to work with individuals and how to affect communities positions within the context of larger social institutions public administrators in contrast need to understand community development in the context of rural and urban development housing and economic development and community organizational and business development
formal accredited programs conducted by universities as part of degree granting institutions are often used to build a knowledge base to drive curricula in public administration sociology and community studies the general social survey from the national opinion research center at the university of chicago and the saguaro seminar at the john f kennedy school of government at harvard university are examples of national community development in the united states the maxwell school of citizenship and public affairs at syracuse university in new york state offers core courses in community and economic development and in areas ranging from non-profit development to us budgeting (federal to local community funds) in the united kingdom oxford university has led in providing extensive research in the field through its community development journal used worldwide by sociologists and community development practitioners
at the intersection between community development and community building are a number of programs and organizations with community development tools one example of this is the program of the asset based community development institute of northwestern university the institute makes available downloadable tools to assess community assets and make connections between non-profit groups and other organizations that can help in community building the institute focuses on helping communities develop by mobilizing neighborhood assets building from the inside out rather than the outside in in the disability field community building was prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s with roots in john mcknight's approaches
=== community building and organizing ===
in the different drum community-making and peace scott peck argues that the almost accidental sense of community that exists at times of crisis can be consciously built peck believes that conscious community building is a process of deliberate design based on the knowledge and application of certain rules he states that this process goes through four stages
pseudocommunity the beginning stage when people first come together this is the stage where people try to be nice and present what they feel are their most personable and friendly characteristics
chaos when people move beyond the inauthenticity of pseudo-community and feel safe enough to present their shadow selves this stage places great demands upon the facilitator for greater leadership and organization but peck believes that organizations are not communities and this pressure should be resisted
emptiness this stage moves beyond the attempts to fix heal and convert of the chaos stage when all people become capable of acknowledging their own woundedness and brokenness common to us all as human beings out of this emptiness comes
true community the process of deep respect and true listening for the needs of the other people in this community this stage peck believes can only be described as glory and reflects a deep yearning in every human soul for compassionate understanding from one's fellows
more recently peck remarked that building a sense of community is easy but maintaining this sense of community is difficult in the modern world community building can use a wide variety of practices ranging from simple events such as potlucks and small book clubs to larger-scale efforts such as mass festivals and construction projects that involve local participants rather than outside contractors
community building that is geared toward citizen action is usually termed community organizing. in these cases organized community groups seek accountability from elected officials and increased direct representation within decision-making bodies where good-faith negotiations fail these constituency-led organizations seek to pressure the decision-makers through a variety of means including picketing boycotting sit-ins petitioning and electoral politics the arise detroit coalition and the toronto public space committee are examples of activist networks committed to shielding local communities from government and corporate domination and inordinate influence
community organizing is sometimes focused on more than just resolving specific issues organizing often means building a widely accessible power structure often with the end goal of distributing power equally throughout the community community organizers generally seek to build groups that are open and democratic in governance such groups facilitate and encourage consensus decision-making with a focus on the general health of the community rather than a specific interest group the three basic types of community organizing are grassroots organizing coalition building and institution-based community organizing, (also called broad-based community organizing, an example of which is faith-based community organizing or congregation-based community organizing)
if communities are developed based on something they share in common whether that be location or values then one challenge for developing communities is how to incorporate individuality and differences indeed as rebekah nathan suggests in her book my freshman year we are actually drawn to developing communities totally based on sameness despite stated commitments to diversity such as those found on university websites nathan states that certain commonalities allow college students to cohere what holds students together really is age pop culture a handful of (recent) historical events and getting a degree (qtd in barrios 229) universities may try to create community through all freshman reads freshman seminars and school pride however nathan argues students will only form communities based on the attributes such as age and pop culture that they bring with them to college nathan's point then is that people come to college and don't expand their social horizons and cultural tolerance which can prevent the development of your social community (barrios barclay emerging contemporary readings for writers new york bedford st martins 2010.)
==== community currencies ====
some communities have developed their own local exchange trading systems (lets) and local currencies such as the ithaca hours system to encourage economic growth and an enhanced sense of community community currencies have recently proven valuable in meeting the needs of people living in various south american nations particularly argentina that recently suffered as a result of the collapse of the argentinian national currency
=== community services ===
community services is a term that refers to a wide range of community institutions governmental and non-governmental services voluntary third sector organizations and grassroots and neighborhood efforts in local communities towns cities and suburban-exurban areas in line with governmental and community thinking volunteering and unpaid services are often preferred (e.g. altruism beneficence) to large and continued investments in infrastructure and community services personnel with private-public partnerships often common
non-profit organizations from youth services to family and neighborhood centers recreation facilities civic clubs and employment housing and poverty agencies are often the foundation of community services programs but it may also be undertaken under the auspices of government (which funds all ngos) one or more businesses or by individuals or newly formed collaboratives community services is also the broad term given to health and human services in local communities and was specifically used as the framework for deinstitutionalization and community integration to homes families and local communities (e.g. community residential services)
in a broad discussion of community services schools hospitals clinics rehabilitation and criminal justice institutions also view themselves as community planners and decisionmakers together with governmental leadership (e.g. city and county offices state-regional offices) however while many community services are voluntary some may be part of alternative sentencing approaches in a justice system and it can be required by educational institutions as part of internships employment training and post-graduation plans
community services may be paid for through different revenue streams which include targeted federal funds taxpayer contributions state and local grants and contracts voluntary donations medicaid or health care funds community development block grants targeted education funds and so forth in the 2000s the business sector began to contract with government and also consult on government policies and has shifted the framework of community services to the for-profit domains
however by the 1990s the call was to return to community and to go beyond community services to belonging relationships community building and welcoming new population groups and diversity in community life

== types of community ==
a number of ways to categorize types of community have been proposed one such breakdown is as follows
location-based communities range from the local neighbourhood suburb village town or city region nation or even the planet as a whole these are also called communities of place
identity-based communities range from the local clique sub-culture ethnic group religious multicultural or pluralistic civilisation or the global community cultures of today they may be included as communities of need or identity such as disabled persons or frail aged people
organizationally based communities range from communities organized informally around family or network-based guilds and associations to more formal incorporated associations political decision making structures economic enterprises or professional associations at a small national or international scale
the usual categorizations of community relations have a number of problems 1 they tend to give the impression that a particular community can be defined as just this kind or another 2 they tend to conflate modern and customary community relations 3 they tend to take sociological categories such as ethnicity or race as given forgetting that different ethnically defined persons live in different kinds of communities grounded interest-based diasporic etc
in response to these problems paul james and his colleagues have developed a taxonomy that maps community relations and recognizes that actual communities can be characterized by different kinds of relations at the same time
1 grounded community relations this involves enduring attachment to particular places and particular people it is the dominant form taken by customary and tribal communities in these kinds of communities the land is fundamental to identity
2 life-style community relations this involves giving give primacy to communities coming together around particular chosen ways of life such as morally charged or interest-based relations or just living or working in the same location hence the following sub-forms
community-life as morally bounded a form taken by many traditional faith-based communities
community-life as interest-based including sporting leisure-based and business communities which come together for regular moments of engagement
community-life as proximately-related where neighbourhood or commonality of association forms a community of convenience or a community of place (see below)
3 projected community relations
this is where a community is self-consciously treated as an entity to be projected and re-created it can be projected as through thin advertising slogan for example gated community or can take the form of ongoing associations of people who seek political integration communities of practice based on professional projects associative communities which seek to enhance and support individual creativity autonomy and mutuality a nation is one of the largest forms of projected or imagined community
in these terms communities can be nested and/or intersecting one community can contain anotherfor example a location-based community may contain a number of ethnic communities both lists above can used in a cross-cutting matrix in relation to each other
=== location ===
possibly the most common usage of the word community indicates a large group living in close proximity examples of local community include
a municipality is an administrative local area generally composed of a clearly defined territory and commonly referring to a town or village
although large cities are also municipalities they are often thought of as a collection of communities due to their diversity
a neighborhood is a geographically localized community often within a larger city or suburb
a planned community is one that was designed from scratch and expanded more or less following the plan several of the world's capital cities are planned cities notably washington d.c. in the united states canberra in australia and braslia in brazil it was also common during the european colonization of the americas to build according to a plan either on fresh ground or on the ruins of earlier amerindian cities community service is a free service
=== identity ===
in some contexts community indicates a group of people with a common identity other than location members often interact regularly common examples in everyday usage include
a professional community is a group of people with the same or related occupations some of those members may join a professional society making a more defined and formalized group these are also sometimes known as communities of practice
a virtual community is a group of people primarily or initially communicating or interacting with each other by means of information technologies typically over the internet rather than in person these may be either communities of interest practice or communion research interest is evolving in the motivations for contributing to online communities
these communities are key to our modern day society because we have the ability to share information with millions in a matter of seconds
=== overlaps ===
some communities share both location and other attributes members choose to live near each other because of one or more common interests
a retirement community is designated and at least usually designed for retirees and seniorsoften restricted to those over a certain age such as 56 it differs from a retirement home which is a single building or small complex by having a number of autonomous households
an intentional community is a deliberate residential community with a much higher degree of social communication than other communities the members of an intentional community typically hold a common social political or spiritual vision and share responsibilities and resources intentional communities include amish villages ashrams cohousing communes ecovillages housing cooperatives kibbutzim and land trusts
== special nature of human community ==
definitions of community as organisms inhabiting a common environment and interacting with one another, while scientifically accurate do not convey the richness diversity and complexity of human communities their classification likewise is almost never precise untidy as it may be community is vital for humans m scott peck expresses this in the following way there can be no vulnerability without risk there can be no community without vulnerability there can be no peace and ultimately no life without community.
