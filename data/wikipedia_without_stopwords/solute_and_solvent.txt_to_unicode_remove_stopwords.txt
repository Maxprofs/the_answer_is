enthalpy solution enthalpy dissolution heat solution enthalpy change associated dissolution substance solvent constant pressure resulting infinite dilution
enthalpy solution often expressed kjmol constant temperature energy change regarded made three parts endothermic breaking bonds within solute within solvent formation attractions solute solvent ideal solution enthalpy solution zero nonideal solution excess molar quantity

dissolution gases exothermic gas dissolves liquid solvent energy released heat warming system ie solution surroundings temperature solution decreases surroundings equilibrium gas separate phase gas solution therefore le chteliers principle shift favour gas going solution temperature decreased thus decreasing temperature increases solubility gas saturated solution gas heated gas comes solution
steps dissolutionedit
dissolution viewed occurring three steps
breaking solutesolute attractions endothermic see instance lattice energy salts
breaking solventsolvent attractions endothermic instance hydrogen bonding
forming solventsolute attractions exothermic solvation
value enthalpy solution sum individual steps dissolving ammonium nitrate water endothermic energy released solvation ammonium ions nitrate ions less energy absorbed breaking ammonium nitrate ionic lattice attractions water molecules dissolving potassium hydroxide exothermic energy released solvation used breaking solute solvent
