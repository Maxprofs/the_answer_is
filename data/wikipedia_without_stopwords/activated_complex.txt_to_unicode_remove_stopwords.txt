chemistry activated complex defined international union pure applied chemistry assembly atoms corresponds arbitrary infinitesimally small region near col saddle point potential energy surface words refers collection intermediate structures chemical reaction persist bonds breaking new bonds forming therefore represents one defined state rather range transient configurations collection atoms passes clearly defined products reactants
subject transition state theory also known activated complex theory studies kinetics reactions pass defined intermediate state standard gibbs free energy formation g state represented double dagger symbol known transition state represents exact configuration equal probability forming either reactants products given reaction
activated complex often confused transition state used interchangeably many textbooks however differs transition state transition state represents highest potential energy configuration atoms reaction activated complex refers range configurations near transition state atoms pass transformation products reactants visualized terms reaction coordinate transition state molecular configuration peak diagram activated complex refer point near maximum
