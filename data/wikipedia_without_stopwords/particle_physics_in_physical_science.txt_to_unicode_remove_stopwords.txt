particle physics branch physics studies nature particles constitute matter particles mass radiation massless particles although word particle refer various types small objects eg protons gas particles even household dust particle physics usually investigates irreducibly smallest detectable particles irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary explain current understanding elementary particles excitations quantum fields also govern interactions currently dominant theory explaining fundamental particles fields along dynamics called standard model thus modern particle physics generally investigates standard model various possible extensions eg newest known particle higgs boson even oldest known force field gravity
subatomic particles
modern particle physics research focused subatomic particles including atomic constituents electrons protons neutrons protons neutrons composite particles called baryons made quarks produced radioactive scattering processes photons neutrinos muons well wide range exotic particles dynamics particles also governed quantum mechanics exhibit waveparticle duality displaying particlelike behaviour certain experimental conditions wavelike behaviour others technical terms described quantum state vectors hilbert space also treated quantum field theory following convention particle physicists term elementary particles applied particles according current understanding presumed indivisible composed particles
particles interactions observed date described almost entirely quantum field theory called standard model standard model currently formulated elementary particles elementary particles combine form composite particles accounting hundreds species particles discovered since standard model found agree almost experimental tests conducted date however particle physicists believe incomplete description nature fundamental theory awaits discovery see theory everything recent years measurements neutrino mass provided first experimental deviations standard model

standard model

theory
theoretical particle physics attempts develop models theoretical framework mathematical tools understand current experiments make predictions future experiments see also theoretical physics several major interrelated efforts made theoretical particle physics today one important branch attempts better understand standard model tests extracting parameters standard model experiments less uncertainty work probes limits standard model therefore expands understanding natures building blocks efforts made challenging difficulty calculating quantities quantum chromodynamics theorists working area refer phenomenologists may use tools quantum field theory effective field theory others make use lattice field theory call lattice theorists
