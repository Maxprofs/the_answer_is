w (named double-u plural double-ues) is the 23rd letter in the modern english alphabet and the iso basic latin alphabet
== historyedit ==
the sounds /w/ (spelled v) and /b/ (spelled b) of classical latin developed into a bilabial fricative // between vowels in early medieval latin therefore v no longer represented adequately the labial-velar approximant sound /w/ of germanic phonology
the germanic /w/ phoneme was therefore written as vv or uu (u and v becoming distinct only by the early modern period) by the 7th or 8th century by the earliest writers of old english and old high german gothic (not latin-based) by contrast simply used a letter based on the greek for the same sound the digraph vv/uu was also used in medieval latin to represent germanic names including gothic ones like wamba
it is from this uu digraph that the modern name double u derives the digraph was commonly used in the spelling of old high german but only sporadically in old english where the /w/ sound was usually represented by the runic wynn in early middle english following the 11th-century norman conquest uu gained popularity and by 1300 it had taken wynn's place in common use
scribal realization of the digraph could look like a pair of vs whose branches crossed in the middle an obsolete cursive form found in the nineteenth century in both english and german was in the form of an n whose rightmost branch curved around as in a cursive v
the shift from the digraph vv to the distinct ligature w is thus gradual and is only apparent in abecedaria explicit listings of all individual letters it was probably considered a separate letter by the 14th century in both middle english and middle german orthography although it remained an outsider not really considered part of the latin alphabet proper as expressed by valentin ickelshamer in the 16th century who complained that
poor w is so infamous and unknown that many barely know either its name or its shape not those who aspire to being latinists as they have no need of it nor do the germans not even the schoolmasters know what to do with it or how to call it some call it we [ others] call it uu [...] the swabians call it auwawau
in middle high german (and possibly already in late old high german) the west germanic phoneme /w/ became realized as [v] this is why the german w today represents that sound there is no phonological distinction between [w] and [v] in contemporary german

english uses w to represent /w/ there are also a number of words beginning with a written w that is silent in most dialects before a (pronounced) r remaining from usage in old english in which the w was pronounced wreak wrap wreck wrench wroth wrinkle etc certain dialects of scottish english still distinguish this digraph
=== other languagesedit ===
in europe there are only a few languages that use w in native words and all are located in a central-western european zone between cornwall and poland english german low german dutch frisian welsh cornish breton walloon polish kashubian sorbian and resian use w in native words german polish and kashubian use it for the voiced labiodental fricative /v/ (with polish and related kashubian using for /w/) and dutch uses it for // unlike its use in other languages the letter is used in welsh and cornish to represent the vowel /u/ as well as the related approximant consonant /w/
modern german dialects generally have only [v] or [] for west germanic /w/ but [w] or [] remains heard allophonically for w especially in the clusters schw zw and qu some bavarian dialects preserve a light initial [w] in words like wuoz (standard german wei [vas] [i] know') the classical latin [] is heard in the southern german greeting servus ('hello or goodbye')
in dutch w became a labiodental approximant // (with the exception of words with -eeuw which have /e/ or other diphthongs containing -uw) in many dutch speaking areas such as flanders and suriname the // pronunciation is used at all times
in finnish w is se'en as a variant of v and not a separate letter it is however recognised and maintained in the spelling of some old names reflecting an earlier german spelling standard and in some modern loan words in all cases it is pronounced /v/
in danish norwegian and swedish w is named double-v and not double-u in these languages the letter only exists in old names loanwords and foreign words (foreign words are distinguished from loanwords by having a significantly lower level of integration in the language.) it is usually pronounced /v/ but in some words of english origin it may be pronounced /w/ the letter was officially introduced in the danish and swedish alphabets as late as 1980 and 2006 respectively despite having been in use for much longer it was recognized since the conception of modern norwegian with the earliest official orthography rules of 1907 w was earlier seen as a variant of v and w as a letter (double-v) is still commonly replaced by v in speech (e.g wc being pronounced as vc www as vvv who as vho etc.) the two letters were sorted as equals before w was officially recognized and that practice is still recommended when sorting names in sweden in modern slang some native speakers may pronounce w more closely to the origin of the loanword than the official /v/ pronunciation
in the alphabets of most modern romance languages (excepting far northern french and walloon) w is used mostly in foreign names and words recently borrowed (le week-end il watt el kiwi) the digraph ou is used for /w/ in native french words oi is /wa/ or /w/ in spanish italian and portuguese [w] is a non-syllabic variant of /u/ spelled u
the japanese language uses w pronounced /daburu/ as an ideogram meaning double
in italian while the letter w is not considered part of the standard italian alphabet the character is often used in place of viva (hooray for...) while the same symbol written upside down indicates abbasso (down with...)
in vietnamese w is called v p from the french double v it is not included in the standard vietnamese alphabet but it is often used as a substitute for qu- in literary dialect and very informal writing

double u is the only english letter name with more than one syllable except for the occasionally used though somewhat archaic (its name is pronounced similar to ethel) the formerly common in print & ampersand and the archaic pronunciation of z izzard the initialism www for the world wide web thus perhaps ironically has three times as many syllables as the full name
some speakers therefore shorten the name double u into dub only for example university of wisconsin university of washington university of wyoming university of waterloo university of the western cape and university of western australia are all known colloquially as u dub and the automobile company volkswagen abbreviated vw is sometimes pronounced v-dub the fact that many website urls still require a www. prefix has likewise given rise to a shortened version of the original three-syllable pronunciation with the arguable exception of the letter h w is currently the only english letter whose name is not pronounced with any of the sounds that the letter typically makes many others however pronounce the w as dub-u reducing it to two syllables for example www would be six syllables rather than nine being pronounced dub-u dub-u dub-u
in other germanic languages including german its name is similar to that of english v in many languages its name literally means double v portuguese duplo v spanish doble ve (though it can be spelled uve doble) french double v icelandic tvfalt vaff czech dvojit v finnish kaksois-vee etc
george w bush has been given the nickname dubya after the colloquial pronunciation of the name of w in texas
