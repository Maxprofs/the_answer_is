the lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails in mammals and most other vertebrates two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere in a process of gas exchange respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species mammals reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing in early tetrapods air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping a mechanism still seen in amphibians in humans the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm
humans have two lungs a right lung and a left lung they are situated within the thoracic cavity of the chest the right lung is bigger than the left lung as the left lung shares space in the chest with the heart the lungs together weigh approximately 1.3 kilograms (2.9 lb) with the right lung weighing more than the left the lungs are part of the lower respiratory tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and bronchioles and which receive air breathed in via the conducting zone these divide until air reaches microscopic alveoli which is where the process of gas exchange takes place together the lungs contain approximately 2,400 kilometres (1,500 mi) of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli the lungs are enclosed within a sac called the pleural sac which allows the inner and outer walls to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place without much friction this sac encloses each lung and also divides each lung into sections called lobes the right lung has three lobes whilst the left lung only has two the lobes are further divided into bronchopulmonary segments and lobules the lungs have a unique blood supply receiving deoxygenated blood sent from the heart for the purposes of receiving oxygen (the pulmonary circulation) and a separate blood supply of oxygenated blood (the bronchial circulation) the tissue of the lungs can be affected by a number of diseases including pneumonia and lung cancer chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema can be related to smoking or exposure to harmful substances diseases such as bronchitis can also affect the respiratory tract
in fetal life the lungs develop as an outpouching of the foregut a tube which goes on to form the upper part of the digestive system at this time the fetus is situated in the amniotic sac and so the lungs do not function to breathe blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus at birth however air begins to pass through the lungs and the diversionary duct closes so that the lungs can begin to respire the lungs only fully develop in early childhood
medical terms related to the lung often begin with pulmo- from the latin pulmonarius (of the lungs) as in pulmonology or with pneumo- (from greek lung") as in pneumonia
== structure ==
=== gross anatomy ===
the lungs are located in the chest on either side of the heart in the rib cage they are conical in shape with a narrow apex at the top and a broad base that rests on the diaphragm they stretch from close to the backbone in the rib cage to the front of the chest and downwards from the lower part of the trachea to the diaphragm the left lung shares space with the heart with an angular notch in its anterior border called the cardiac notch in addition on the mediastinal surface of each lung there is a concavity called the cardiac impression at the level of the heart the cardiac impression on the left lung is wider and deeper than that of the right lung because of this and the cardiac notch the right lung is larger in volume total capacity and weight despite being about 5 cm shorter in height than the left
both lungs have a central recession called the hilum at the root of the lung where the blood vessels and airways pass into the lungs there are also bronchopulmonary lymph nodes on the hilum the costal surface along the rib cage is smooth and convex with slight grooves corresponding to indentations by the ribs
the lungs are surrounded by the pulmonary pleurae the pleurae are two serous membranes the outer parietal pleura lines the inner wall of the rib cage and the inner visceral pleura directly lines the surface of the lungs between the pleurae is a potential space called the pleural cavity containing pleural fluid each lung is divided into lobes by the invaginations of the pleura as fissures the fissures are double folds of pleura that section the lungs these sections help in the expansion of the lungs
the lobes of the lungs are further divided into bronchopulmonary segments based on the locations of bronchioles segments for the left and right lung are shown in the table the segmental anatomy is useful clinically for localizing disease processes in the lungs
=== borders ===
each lung has three borders the anterior border of the lung is thin and sharp and overlaps the front of the pericardium the anterior border of the right lung is almost vertical and projects into the costodiaphragmatic recess that of the left lung presents below an angular cardiac notch in which the pericardium is exposed opposite this notch the anterior margin of the left lung is situated some little distance lateral to the line of reflection of the corresponding part of the pleura the cardiac notch lies along the fifth and sixth intercostal space and the spaces can be used to access the heart in pericardiocentesis to relieve cardiac tamponade
the posterior border of the lung is broad and rounded and is received into the deep concavity on either side of the vertebral column it is much longer than the anterior border and projects below into the costodiaphragmatic recess
the inferior border of the lung is thin and sharp where it separates the base from the costal surface and extends into the costodiaphragmatic recess medially where it divides the base from the mediastinal surface it is blunt and rounded
=== right lung ===
the right lung has both more lobes and segments than the left it is divided into three lobes an upper middle and a lower by two fissures one oblique and one horizontal the upper horizontal fissure separates the upper from the middle lobe it begins in the lower oblique fissure near the posterior border of the lung and running horizontally forward cuts the anterior border on a level with the sternal end of the fourth costal cartilage on the mediastinal surface it may be traced backward to the hilum
the lower oblique fissure separates the lower from the middle and upper lobes and is closely aligned with the oblique fissure in the left lung its direction is however more vertical and it cuts the lower (inferior) border about 7.5 cm behind its anterior extremity
it has a deep concavity on its inner surface called the cardiac impression at the level of the heart this is not as pronounced as that on the left lung where the heart projects further
on this inner surface above the hilum is an arched groove at the level of the azygos vein while running superiorly and then arching laterally some little distance below the apex is a wide groove for the superior vena cava and right innominate vein behind this and proximal to the apex is a groove for the innominate artery behind the hilum and the attachment of the pulmonary ligament is a vertical groove for the esophagus this groove becomes less distinct below owing to the inclination of the lower part of the esophagus to the left of midline
in front and to the right of the lower part of the esophageal groove is a deep concavity for the extrapericardiac portion of the thoracic part of the inferior vena cava
=== left lung ===
the left lung is divided into two lobes an upper and a lower by the oblique fissure which extends from the costal to the mediastinal surface of the lung both above and below the hilum the left lung unlike the right does not have middle lobe though it does have a homologous feature a projection of the upper lobe termed the lingula its name means little tongue the lingula on the left serves as an anatomic parallel to the right middle lobe with both areas being predisposed to similar infections and anatomic complications there are two bronchopulmonary segments of the lingula superior and inferior it is thought that the lingula of the left lung is the remnant of the middle lobe which has been lost in the course of evolution
as seen on the surface this fissure begins on the mediastinal surface of the lung at the upper and posterior part of the hilum and runs backward and upward to the posterior border which it crosses at a point about 6 cm below the apex it then extends downward and forward over the costal surface and reaches the lower border a little behind its anterior extremity and its further course can be followed upward and backward across the mediastinal surface as far as the lower part of the hilum it has an angular indentation on the inner surface of its anterior border called the cardiac notch and a concavity called the cardiac impression at the level of the heart this is deeper and larger than that on the right at which level the heart projects to the left
on the same surface immediately above the hilum is a well-marked curved groove produced by the aortic arch running upward from this toward the apex is a groove at the level of the left subclavian artery a slight impression in front of the latter and close to the margin of the lung lodges the left innominate vein behind the hilum and pulmonary ligament is a vertical groove produced by the descending aorta in front of this near the base of the lung there is a shallow impression at the level of the lower esophagus
=== respiratory system ===
the lung is part of the respiratory system and contains the majority of the lower respiratory tract after the trachea the trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place where it splits (the carina) into a right and left bronchus these supply air to the right and left lungs splitting progressively into the secondary and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs and into smaller and smaller bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles these in turn supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli where the exchange of gasses take place oxygen diffuses through the walls of the alveoli into the capillaries (small blood vessels) nearby
estimates of the total surface area of lungs vary from 30-50 square metres to up to 70-100 square metres (1076.39 sq ft) (8,4 x 8,4 m) in adults which might be roughly the same area as one side of a tennis court however such estimates may be of limited use unless qualified by a statement of scale at which they are taken (see coastline paradox and menger sponge) furthermore if all of the capillaries that surround the alveoli were unwound and laid end to end they would extend for about 992 kilometres (616 mi)
the parts of the respiratory system that conduct oxygen to the alveoli is called conducting zone which is part of the respiratory tract that conducts air into the lungs this comprises the air passageways with gas exchange only taking place in the alveoli of the respiratory system
the bronchi in the conducting zone are reinforced with hyaline cartilage in order to hold open the airways the bronchioles have no cartilage and are surrounded instead by smooth muscle air is warmed to 37 c (99 f) humidified and cleansed by the conduction zone particles from the air being removed by the cilia which are located on the walls of all the passageways
=== blood supply ===
being an organ of respiration the human lung has a dual blood supply
the tissue of the lungs receive oxygenated blood via the bronchial circulation a series of arteries that leave the aorta and are part of the systemic circulation
the lungs also receive deoxygenated blood from the heart and supply it with oxygen in a process known as respiration in this process venous blood in the body collects in the right atrium and is pumped from the right ventricle through the pulmonary trunk and the pulmonary arteries into the left and right lungs blood passes through small capillaries next to the alveoli in the lung receives oxygen and travels back to the heart this is called the pulmonary circulation the oxygenated blood is then pumped to the rest of the body blood that leaves the heart is then returned to supply the tissues of the lung via the bronchial circulation mentioned above
=== microanatomy ===
underneath the serous visceral pleura surrounding the lung is a subserous layer of areolar tissue and beneath this is the lung parenchyma areolar tissue is a type of loose connective tissue characterised by a sparcity of fibroblasts with an abundance of interstitial fluid this type of tissue acts as a reservoir of fluid containing nutrients for the adjacent tissues which may be avascular the parenchyma refers usually just to the alveolar tissue
the lobule is the smallest microscopic unit of the lung a lobule consists of a respiratory bronchiole an alveolar duct an alveolar sac and alveoli alveolar septa as membranes separate each alveolus the septa consist of an epithelial lining and associated basement membranes
== development ==
the development of the human lungs arise from the laryngotracheal groove and develop to maturity over several weeks inside the foetus and for several months following birth the larynx trachea bronchi and lungs begin to form during the fourth week of embryogenesis at this time the lung bud appears ventrally to the caudal portion of the foregut the location of the lung bud along the gut tube is directed by various signals from the surrounding mesenchyme including fibroblast growth factors at the same time as the lung bud grows the future trachea separates from the foregut through the formation of tracheoesophageal ridges which fuse to form the tracheoesophageal septum
the lung bud divides into two the right and left primary bronchial buds during the fifth week the right bud branches into three secondary bronchial buds and the left branches into two secondary bronchial buds these give rise to the lobes of the lungs three on the right and two on the left over the following week the secondary buds branch into tertiary buds about ten on each side from the sixth week to the sixteenth week the major elements of the lungs appear except the alveoli from week 16 to week 26 the bronchi enlarge and lung tissue becomes highly vascularised bronchioles and alveolar ducts also develop during the period covering the 26th week until birth the important blood-air barrier is established specialised type i alveolar cells where gas exchange will take place together with the type ii alveolar cells that secrete pulmonary surfactant appear the surfactant reduces the surface tension at the air-alveolar surface which allows expansion of the terminal saccules these saccules form at the end of the bronchioles and their appearance marks the point at which limited respiration would be possible
=== first breath ===
at birth the baby's lungs are filled with fluid secreted by the lungs and are not inflated when the newborn is expelled from the birth canal its central nervous system reacts to the sudden change in temperature and environment this triggers it to take the first breath within about 10 seconds after delivery the newborn lung is far from being a miniaturized version of the adult lung it has only about 20,000,000 to 50,000,000 alveoli or 6 to 15 percent of the full adult complement although it was previously thought that alveolar formation could continue to the age of eight years and beyond it is now accepted that the bulk of alveolar formation is concluded much earlier probably before the age of two years the newly formed inter alveolar septa still contain a double capillary network instead of the single one of the adult lungs this means that the pulmonary capillary bed must be completely reorganized during and after alveolar formation it has to mature only after full microvascular maturation which is terminated sometime between the ages of two and five years is the lung development completed and the lung can enter a phase of normal growth
== function ==
=== respiration ===
the respiratory system's alveoli are the sites of gas exchange with blood
in humans the trachea divides into the two main bronchi that enter the roots of the lungs the bronchi continue to divide within the lung and after multiple divisions give rise to bronchioles the bronchial tree continues branching until it reaches the level of terminal bronchioles which lead to respiratory bronchioles and alveolar sacs alveolar sacs are made up of clusters of alveoli like individual grapes within a bunch the individual alveoli are tightly wrapped in blood vessels and it is here that gas exchange actually occurs deoxygenated blood from the heart is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs where oxygen diffuses into blood and is exchanged for carbon dioxide in the hemoglobin of the erythrocytes the oxygen-rich blood returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins to be pumped back into systemic circulation
the sympathetic nervous system via noradrenaline acting on the beta receptors causes bronchodilation
the parasympathetic nervous system is through the vagus nerve via acetylcholine which acts on the m-3 muscarinic receptors maintains the resting tone of the bronchiolar smooth muscle this action is related although considered distinct from bronchoconstriction
many other non-autonomic nervous and biochemical stimuli including carbon dioxide and oxygen (acting on the respiratory centers) are also involved in the regulation process
there is also a relationship noted between the pressures in the lung in the alveoli in the arteries and in the veins this is conceptualised into the lung being divided into three vertical regions called the zones of the lung
=== other ===
in addition to their function in respiration the lungs also
help in the regulation of blood pressure as part of the renin-angiotensin system the lungs convert angiotensin i to angiotensin ii in addition they remove several blood-borne substances such as a few types of prostaglandins leukotrienes serotonin and bradykinin
balance the ph of blood by facilitating alterations in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide
filter out small blood clots (and gas micro-bubbles formed during decompression) from veins
influence the concentration of some biologic substances and drugs used in medicine in blood
may serve as a layer of soft shock-absorbent protection for the heart which the lungs flank and nearly enclose
immunoglobulin-a is secreted in the bronchial secretion and protects against respiratory infections
maintain sterility by producing mucus containing antimicrobial compounds mucus contains glycoproteins e.g. mucins lactoferrin lysozyme lactoperoxidase we find also on the epithelium dual oxidase 2 proteins generating hydrogen peroxide useful for hypothiocyanite endogenous antimicrobial synthesis function not in place in cystic fibrosis patient lungs
mucociliary clearance is an important defence system against air-borne infection the dust particles and bacteria in the inhaled air are caught in the mucous layer present at the mucosal surface of respiratory passages and are moved up towards pharynx by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia
provide airflow for the creation of vocal sounds
the lungs serve as a reservoir of blood in the body the blood volume of the lungs is about 450 milliliters on average about 9 percent of the total blood volume of the entire circulatory system this quantity can easily fluctuate from between one-half and twice the normal volume loss of blood from the body due to hemorrhage can be partially compensated for by shunting blood from the lungs into the systemic circulatory vessels
== clinical significance ==
human lungs can be affected by a variety of diseases the environment of the lung is moist which makes it very hospitable to microorganisms many respiratory illnesses are due to infections from bacteria or viruses tuberculosis is a serious infection as is bacterial pneumonia pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lungs caused by infection pleurisy is an inflammatory condition of the pleurae surrounding the lungs usually caused by a viral infection from the lungs
a pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that becomes lodged in the lung a ventilation/perfusion scan using scintigraphy may be used to detect this
lung diseases can arise suddenly such as a pneumothorax or hemothorax in which air or blood is trapped in the pleural cavity and compresses the lung the accumulation of blood and other types of fluid in the pleural cavity can cause various types of pleural effusion which results in breathing difficulties
diseases can also be chronic such as bronchitis and asthma both of which are inflammatory diseases and emphysema a common complication of smoking caused by inflammation and the progressive inability of alveoli to expand and contract with respiration pulmonary fibrosis can occur when the lung is inflamed for a long period of time this can be due to an occupational disease such as coalworker's pneumoconiosis or more rarely to a reaction to medication fibrosis in the lung is the replacement of lung tissue by fibrous connective tissue which causes irreversible lung scarring and can prove fatal
asthma chronic bronchitis bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction bitter taste receptors have been identified in lung tissue which cause airways to relax when a bitter substance is encountered this mechanism is believed to be evolutionary adaptive since it helps to clear lung infections and could be exploited to treat asthma and copd
lung cancer can often be incurable also cancers in other parts of the body can be spread via the bloodstream and end up in the lungs where the malignant cells can metastasise
a rare disease of the autoimmune system called goodpasture syndrome usually affects both the lungs and the kidneys though sometimes only the lungs are affected
congenital disorders include pulmonary hypoplasia an incomplete development of the lungs and infant respiratory distress syndrome caused by a deficiency in lung surfactant an azygos lobe is a congenital anatomical variation which though usually without effect can cause problems in thoracoscopic procedures
=== lung volumes ===
lungs have a tremendous reserve volume as compared to the oxygen exchange requirements when at rest such excess capacity is one of the reasons that individuals can smoke for years without having a noticeable decrease in lung function while still or moving slowly in situations like these only a small portion of the lungs are actually perfused with blood for gas exchange destruction of too many alveoli over time leads to the condition emphysema which is associated with extreme shortness of breath as oxygen requirements increase due to exercise a greater volume of the lungs is perfused allowing the body to match its carbon dioxide-oxygen exchange requirements additionally due to the excess capacity it is possible for humans to live with only one lung with the one compensating for the other's loss
lung volumes and lung capacities include inspiratory reserve volume tidal volume functional residual capacity expiratory reserve volume and residual volume pulmonary plethysmographs are used to measure functional residual capacity the total lung capacity depends on the person's age height weight and sex and normally ranges between 4,000 and 6,000 cm3 (4 to 6 l) females tend to have a 2025% lower capacity than males tall people tend to have a larger total lung capacity than shorter people smokers have a lower capacity than nonsmokers lung capacity is also affected by altitude people who are born and live at sea level will have a smaller lung capacity than people who spend their lives at a high altitude in addition to the total lung capacity the tidal volume is also measured this is the volume breathed in with an average breath which is about 500 cm3
another measure is the respiratory minute volume which is the volume of air which can be inhaled or exhaled from a person's lungs in one minute this is normally registered when a person has a ventilator supporting breathing due to a sickness or injury other lung function tests include spirometry measuring the amount (volume) and flow of air that can be inhaled and exhaled the maximum volume of breath that can be exhaled is called the vital capacity these tests can help to determine whether a disease is restrictive or obstructive
== other animals ==
=== birds ===
the lungs of birds are relatively small but are connected to 89 air sacs that extend through much of the body and are in turn connected to air spaces within the bones on inspiration air travels through the trachea of a bird into the 8-9 air sacs air then travels continuously from the air sacs at the back of the bird through the lungs of the bird and to the air sacs at the front of the bird from here air is expelled this type of lung construction is called a circulatory lung as distinct from the bellows lung possessed by other animals this means that they are able to extract a greater concentration of oxygen from inhaled air birds are thus equipped to fly at altitudes at which mammals would succumb to hypoxia this also allows them to sustain a higher metabolic rate than most equivalent weight mammals
the lungs of birds are honey-comb-like and contain millions of tiny passages called parabronchi small sacs called called atria radiate from the walls of the tiny passages and are the site of gas exchange gas exchange occurs by diffusion in these walls as gas travels between the lumen of each parabronchus and blood vessels
the air sacs which hold air do not contribute much to gas exchange despite being thin-walled as they are poorly vascularized the air sacs expand and contract due to changes in the volume in a bird's thorax and abdomen this volume change is caused by the movement of the sternum and ribs and this movement is often synchronized with movement of the flight muscles
this typical system is one of two types of parabronchi found in birds called paleopulmonic parabronchi and is found in all birds some bird species also have a lung structure where the air flow is bidirectional called neopulmonic parabronchi
=== reptiles ===
the lung of most reptiles has a single bronchus running down the centre from which numerous branches reach out to individual pockets throughout the lungs these pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals but much larger and fewer in number these give the lung a sponge-like texture in tuataras snakes and some lizards the lungs are simpler in structure similar to that of typical amphibians
snakes and limbless lizards typically possess only the right lung as a major respiratory organ the left lung is greatly reduced or even absent amphisbaenians however have the opposite arrangement with a major left lung and a reduced or absent right lung
both crocodilians and monitor lizards have developed lungs similar to those of birds providing an unidirectional airflow and even possessing air sacs the now extinct pterosaurs have seemingly even further refined this type of lung extending the airsacs into the wing membranes and in the case of pteranodontia the hindlimbs
reptilian lungs typically receive air via expansion and contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping crocodilians also rely on the hepatic piston method in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) which in turn pulls the bottom of the lungs backward expanding them turtles which are unable to move their ribs instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air in and out of the lungs
=== amphibians ===
the lungs of most frogs and other amphibians are simple and balloon-like with gas exchange limited to the outer surface of the lung this is not very efficient but amphibians have low metabolic demands and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin in water and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method amphibians employ a positive pressure system to get air to their lungs forcing air down into the lungs by buccal pumping this is distinct from most higher vertebrates who use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where the lungs are inflated by expanding the rib cage in buccal pumping the floor of the mouth is lowered filling the mouth cavity with air the throat muscles then presses the throat against the underside of the skull forcing the air into the lungs
due to the possibility of respiration across the skin combined with small size all known lungless tetrapods are amphibians the majority of salamander species are lungless salamanders which respirate through their skin and tissues lining their mouth this necessarily restrict their size all are small and rather thread-like in appearance maximizing skin surface relative to body volume the only other known lungless tetrapods are the bornean flat-headed frog (barbourula kalimantanensis) and atretochoana eiselti a caecilian
the lungs of amphibians typically have a few narrow internal walls (septa) of soft tissue around the outer walls increasing the respiratory surface area and giving the lung a honey-comb appearance in some salamanders even these are lacking and the lung has a smooth wall in caecilians as in snakes only the right lung attains any size or development
=== lungfish ===
the lungs of lungfish are similar to those of amphibians with few if any internal septa in the australian lungfish there is only a single lung albeit divided into two lobes other lungfish and polypterus however have two lungs which are located in the upper part of the body with the connecting duct curving round and above the esophagus the blood supply also twists around the esophagus suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body as in other vertebrates
=== invertebrates ===
some invertebrates have lungs that serve a similar respiratory purpose as but are not evolutionarily related to vertebrate lungs some arachnids the spiders and the scorpions have structures called book lungs used for atmospheric gas exchange some species of spider have four pairs of book lungs but most have two pairs the scorpion has spiracles on its body for the entrance of air to the book lungs
the coconut crab is terrestrial and uses structures called branchiostegal lungs to breathe air they cannot swim and would drown in water they can breathe on land and hold their breath underwater the branchiostegal lungs are seen as a developmental adaptive stage from water-living to enable land-living or from fish to amphibian.the crabs also have a rudimentary set of gills
pulmonates are mostly land snails and slugs that have developed a simple lung from the mantle cavity an externally located opening called the pneumostome allows air to be taken into the mantle cavity lung
== function ==
the lungs of mammals including those of humans have a soft spongelike texture and are honeycombed with epithelium having a much larger surface area in total than the outer surface area of the lung itself
breathing is largely driven by the muscular diaphragm at the bottom of the thorax contraction of the diaphragm pulls the bottom of the cavity in which the lung is enclosed downward increasing volume and thus decreasing pressure causing air to flow into the airways air enters through the oral and nasal cavities it flows through the pharynx then the larynx and into the trachea which branches out into the main bronchi and then subsequent divisions during normal breathing exhalation is passive and no muscles are contracted (the diaphragm relaxes) the rib cage itself is also able to expand and contract to some degree through the use of the intercostal muscles together with the action of other respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles as a result air is transported into or expelled out of the lungs this type of lung is known as a bellows lung as it resembles a blacksmith's bellows
thermoregulation via panting is seen in some animals but not humans
== evolutionary origins ==
the lungs of today's terrestrial vertebrates and the gas bladders of today's fish are believed to have evolved from simple sacs as outpocketings of the esophagus that allowed early fish to gulp air under oxygen-poor conditions these outpocketings first arose in the bony fish in most of the ray-finned fish the sacs evolved into closed off gas bladders while a number of carps trouts herrings catfish eels have retained the physostome condition with the sack being open to the esophagus in more basal bony fish such as the gar bichir bowfin and the lobe-finned fish the bladders have evolved to primarily function as lungs the lobe-finned fish gave rise to the land-based tetrapods thus the lungs of vertebrates are homologous to the gas bladders of fish (but not to their gills) this is reflected by the fact that the lungs of a fetus also develop from an outpocketing of the esophagus and in the case of the physostome gas bladders which can serve as both buoyancy organ and with the pneumatic duct to the gut also serve as lungs this condition is found in more primitive teleosts and is lost in the higher orders (this is an instance of correlation between ontogeny and phylogeny.) no known animals have both a gas bladder and lungs
