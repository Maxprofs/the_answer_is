== criteriaedit ==
the criteria for failure are heavily dependent on context of use and may be relative to a particular observer or belief system a situation considered to be a failure by one might be considered a success by another particularly in cases of direct competition or a zero-sum game similarly the degree of success or failure in a situation may be differently viewed by distinct observers or participants such that a situation that one considers to be a failure another might consider to be a success a qualified success or a neutral situation
it may also be difficult or impossible to ascertain whether a situation meets criteria for failure or success due to ambiguous or ill-defined definition of those criteria finding useful and effective criteria or heuristics to judge the success or failure of a situation may itself be a significant task
