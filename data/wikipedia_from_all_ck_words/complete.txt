a billion is a number with two distinct definitions
1,000,000,000 i.e one thousand million or 109 (ten to the ninth power) as defined on the short scale this is now generally the meaning in both british and american english
1,000,000,000,000 i.e one million million or 1012 (ten to the twelfth power) as defined on the long scale this is one thousand times larger than the short scale billion and equivalent to the short scale trillion
american english always uses the short scale definition but british english has employed both versions historically the united kingdom used the long scale billion but since 1974 official uk statistics have used the short scale since the 1950s the short scale has been increasingly used in technical writing and journalism although the long scale definition still enjoys common usage
other countries use the word billion (or words cognate to it) to denote either the long scale or short scale billion for details see long and short scales current usage
another word for one thousand million is milliard but this is used much less often in english than billion some languages such as french or german use milliard (or a related word) for the short scale billion and billion (or a related word) for the long scale billion thus the french or german billion is a thousand times larger than the modern english billion
== history ==
according to the oxford english dictionary the word billion was formed in the 16th century (from million and the prefix bi- two") meaning the second power of a million (1012) this long scale definition was similarly applied to trillion quadrillion and so on the words were originally french and entered english around the end of the 17th century later french arithmeticians changed the words meanings adopting the short scale definition whereby three zeros rather than six were added at each step so a billion came to denote a thousand million (109) a trillion 1012 and so on this new convention was adopted in the united states in the 19th century but britain retained the original long scale use france in turn reverted to the long scale in 1948
in britain however under the influence of american usage the short scale came to be increasingly used in 1974 prime minister harold wilson confirmed that the government would use the word billion only in its short scale meaning (one thousand million) in a written answer to robin maxwell-hyslop mp who asked whether official usage would conform to the traditional british meaning of a million million wilson stated no the word billion is now used internationally to mean 1,000 million and it would be confusing if british ministers were to use it in any other sense i accept that it could still be interpreted in this country as 1 million million and i shall ask my colleagues to ensure that if they do use it there should be no ambiguity as to its meaning.
