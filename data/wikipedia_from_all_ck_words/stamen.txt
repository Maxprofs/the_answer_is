the stamen (plural stamina or stamens) is the pollen-producing reproductive organ of a flower
== morphology and terminologyedit ==
a stamen typically consists of a stalk called the filament and an anther which contains microsporangia most commonly anthers are two-lobed and are attached to the filament either at the base or in the middle portion the sterile tissue between the lobes is called the connective a pollen grain develops from a microspore in the microsporangium and contains the male gametophyte
the stamens in a flower are collectively called the androecium the androecium in various species of plants form a great variety of patterns some of them highly complex it surrounds the gynoecium and is surrounded by the perianth a few members of the family triuridaceae particularly lacandonia schismatica are exceptional in that their gynoecia surround their androecia
== etymologyedit ==
stamen is the latin word meaning thread (originally thread of the warp in weaving)
filament derives from classical latin filum meaning thread
anther derives from french anthre from classical latin anthera meaning medicine extracted from the flower in turn from ancient greek  feminine of  flowery from  flower
androecium derives from ancient greek meaning man and meaning house or chamber/room
== variation in morphologyedit ==
depending on the species of plant some or all of the stamens in a flower may be attached to the petals or to the floral axis they also may be free-standing or fused to one another in many different ways including fusion of some but not all stamens the filaments may be fused and the anthers free or the filaments free and the anthers fused rather than there being two locules one locule of a stamen may fail to develop or alternatively the two locules may merge late in development to give a single locule extreme cases of stamen fusion occur in some species of cyclanthera in the family cucurbitaceae and in section cyclanthera of genus phyllanthus (family euphorbiaceae) where the stamens form a ring around the gynoecium with a single locule
== pollen productionedit ==
a typical anther contains four microsporangia the microsporangia form sacs or pockets (locules) in the anther the two separate locules on each side of an anther may fuse into a single locule each microsporangium is lined with a nutritive tissue layer called the tapetum and initially contains diploid pollen mother cells these undergo meiosis to form haploid spores the spores may remain attached to each other in a tetrad or separate after meiosis each microspore then divides mitotically to form an immature microgametophyte called a pollen grain
the pollen is eventually released when the anther forms openings (dehisces) these may consist of longitudinal slits pores as in the heath family (ericaceae) or by valves as in the barberry family (berberidaceae) in some plants notably members of orchidaceae and asclepiadoideae the pollen remains in masses called pollinia which are adapted to attach to particular pollinating agents such as birds or insects more commonly mature pollen grains separate and are dispensed by wind or water pollinating insects birds or other pollination vectors
pollen of angiosperms must be transported to the stigma the receptive surface of the carpel of a compatible flower for successful pollination to occur after arriving the pollen grain (an immature microgametophyte) typically completes its development it may grow a pollen tube and undergoing mitosis to produce two sperm nuclei
== sexual reproduction in plantsedit ==
in the typical flower (that is in the majority of flowering plant species) each flower has both carpels and stamens in some species however the flowers are unisexual with only carpels or stamens (monoecious = both types of flowers found on the same plant dioecious = the two types of flower found only on different plants) a flower with only stamens is called androecious a flower with only carpels is called gynoecious
a flower having only functional stamens and lacking functional carpels is called a staminate flower or (inaccurately) male a plant with only functional carpels is called pistillate or (inaccurately) female
an abortive or rudimentary stamen is called a staminodium or staminode such as in scrophularia nodosa
the carpels and stamens of orchids are fused into a column the top part of the column is formed by the anther which is covered by an anther cap
== descriptive termsedit ==
a column formed from the fusion of multiple filaments is known as an androphore
the anther can be attached to the filament's connective in two ways
basifixed attached at its base to the filament
pseudobasifixed a somewhat misnomer configuration where connective tissue extends in a tube around the filament
dorsifixed attached at its center to the filament usually versatile (able to move)
stamens can be connate (fused or joined in the same whorl)
extrorse anther dehiscence directed away from the centre of the flower cf introrse directed inwards and latrorse towards the side
monadelphous fused into a single compound structure
declinate curving downwards then up at the tip (also - declinate-descending)
diadelphous joined partially into two androecial structures
pentadelphous joined partially into five androecial structures
synandrous only the anthers are connate (such as in the asteraceae) the fused stamens are referred to as a synandrium
stamens can also be adnate (fused or joined from more than one whorl)
epipetalous adnate to the corolla
epiphyllous adnate to undifferentiated tepals (as in many liliaceae)
they can have different lengths from each other
didymous two equal pairs
didynamous occurring in two pairs a long pair and a shorter pair
tetradynamous occurring as a set of six stamens with four long and two shorter ones
or respective to the rest of the flower (perianth)
exserted extending beyond the corolla
included not extending beyond the corolla
they may be arranged in one of two different patterns
spiral or
whorled one or more discrete whorls (series)
they may be arranged with respect to the petals
diplostemonous in two whorls the outer alternating with the petals while the inner is opposite the petals
obdiplostemonous in two whorls the outer opposite the petals
