evidence broadly construed is anything presented in support of an assertion this support may be strong or weak the strongest type of evidence is that which provides direct proof of the truth of an assertion at the other extreme is evidence that is merely consistent with an assertion but does not rule out other contradictory assertions as in circumstantial evidence
in law rules of evidence govern the types of evidence that are admissible in a legal proceeding types of legal evidence include testimony documentary evidence and physical evidence the parts of a legal case which are not in controversy are known in general as the facts of the case. beyond any facts that are undisputed a judge or jury is usually tasked with being a trier of fact for the other issues of a case evidence and rules are used to decide questions of fact that are disputed some of which may be determined by the legal burden of proof relevant to the case evidence in certain cases (e.g capital crimes) must be more compelling than in other situations (e.g minor civil disputes) which drastically affects the quality and quantity of evidence necessary to decide a case
scientific evidence consists of observations and experimental results that serve to support refute or modify a scientific hypothesis or theory when collected and interpreted in accordance with the scientific method
in philosophy the study of evidence is closely tied to epistemology which considers the nature of knowledge and how it can be acquired
== burden of proofedit ==
the burden of proof is the obligation of a party in an argument or dispute to provide sufficient evidence to shift the other party's or a third party's belief from their initial position the burden of proof must be fulfilled by both establishing confirming evidence and negating oppositional evidence conclusions drawn from evidence may be subject to criticism based on a perceived failure to fulfill the burden of proof
two principal considerations are
on whom does the burden of proof rest
to what degree of certitude must the assertion be supported
the latter question depends on the nature of the point under contention and determines the quantity and quality of evidence required to meet the burden of proof
in a criminal trial in the united states for example the prosecution carries the burden of proof since the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt similarly in most civil procedures the plaintiff carries the burden of proof and must convince a judge or jury that the preponderance of the evidence is on their side other legal standards of proof include reasonable suspicion probable cause (as for arrest) prima facie evidence credible evidence substantial evidence and clear and convincing evidence
in a philosophical debate there is an implicit burden of proof on the party asserting a claim since the default position is generally one of neutrality or unbelief each party in a debate will therefore carry the burden of proof for any assertion they make in the argument although some assertions may be granted by the other party without further evidence if the debate is set up as a resolution to be supported by one side and refuted by another the overall burden of proof is on the side supporting the resolution
== evidence in scienceedit ==
in scientific research evidence is accumulated through observations of phenomena that occur in the natural world or which are created as experiments in a laboratory or other controlled conditions scientific evidence usually goes towards supporting or rejecting a hypothesis
one must always remember that the burden of proof is on the person making a contentious claim within science this translates to the burden resting on presenters of a paper in which the presenters argue for their specific findings this paper is placed before a panel of judges where the presenter must defend the thesis against all challenges
when evidence is contradictory to predicted expectations the evidence and the ways of making it are often closely scrutinized (see experimenter's regress) and only at the end of this process is the hypothesis rejected this can be referred to as refutation of the hypothesis the rules for evidence used by science are collected systematically in an attempt to avoid the bias inherent to anecdotal evidence
== evidence in lawedit ==
evidence forms the very foundation of any legal system without which law would be subject to the whims of those with power
in law the production and presentation of evidence depends first on establishing on whom the burden of proof lies admissible evidence is that which a court receives and considers for the purposes of deciding a particular case two primary burden-of-proof considerations exist in law the first is on whom the burden rests in many especially western courts the burden of proof is placed on the prosecution in criminal cases and the plaintiff in civil cases the second consideration is the degree of certitude proof must reach depending on both the quantity and quality of evidence these degrees are different for criminal and civil cases the former requiring evidence beyond a reasonable doubt the latter considering only which side has the preponderance of evidence or whether the proposition is more likely true or false the decision maker often a jury but sometimes a judge decides whether the burden of proof has been fulfilled
after deciding who will carry the burden of proof evidence is first gathered and then presented before the court
=== gathering evidenceedit ===
in criminal investigation rather than attempting to prove an abstract or hypothetical point the evidence gatherers attempt to determine who is responsible for a criminal act the focus of criminal evidence is to connect physical evidence and reports of witnesses to a specific person
=== evidence before the courtedit ===
presenting evidence before the court differs from the gathering of evidence in important ways gathering evidence may take many forms presenting evidence that tend to prove or disprove the point at issue is strictly governed by rules failure to follow these rules leads to any number of consequences in law certain policies allow (or require) evidence to be excluded from consideration based either on indicia relating to reliability or broader social concerns testimony (which tells) and exhibits (which show) are the two main categories of evidence presented at a trial or hearing in the united states evidence in federal court is admitted or excluded under the federal rules of evidence
