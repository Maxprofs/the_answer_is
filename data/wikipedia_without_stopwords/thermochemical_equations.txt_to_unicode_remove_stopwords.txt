thermochemical equation balanced stoichiometric chemical equation includes enthalpy change h variable form thermochemical equation would look like
b c
h
b c usual agents chemical equation coefficients positive negative numerical value usually units kj
understanding aspects thermochemical equations
enthalpy h transfer energy reaction chemical reactions form heat h change enthalpy h state function state function means h independent processes initial final states words matter steps take get initial reactants final productsthe h always hrxn change enthalpy reaction value h thermochemical equation units kjmol enthalpy change per moles particular substance equation values h determined experimentally standard conditions atm c k
discussed earlier h positive negative sign positive sign means system uses heat endothermic negative value means heat produced system exothermic
endothermic b heat c h
exothermic b c heat h
since enthalpy state function h given particular reaction true exact reaction physical states reactants products matter molar concentrations
matter h dependent physical state molar concentration means thermochemical equations must stoichiometrically correct one agent equation changed multiplication agents must proportionally changed including h see manipulating thermochemical equations
thermochemical equations multiplicative property largely due first law thermodynamics says energy neither created destroyed concept commonly known conservation energy holds true physical molecular scale
manipulating thermochemical equations
coefficient multiplication
thermochemical equations changed mentioned multiplying numerical coefficient agents must multiplied including h using thermochemical equation variables get following example
b c
h
lets say need multiply two order use thermochemical equation addition must multiply agents reaction coefficient like
b c
h
logical first law thermodynamics considered twice much product produced twice much heat removed given
also noted division coefficients works way
hesss law addition thermochemical equations
hesss law states sum energy changes thermochemical equations included overall reaction equal overall energy change since h state function dependent reactants become products use several steps form several thermochemical equations find h overall reaction
example
reaction cgraphite og cog
reaction comes via two steps reaction sequence
cgraphite og cog
h kj
cog og cog
h kj
want add two reactions together get reaction find h check make sure agents reaction sequence present cancel example cog cancels add reaction sequence together
cgraphite og og cog
cgraphite og cog reaction
figure h add h two equations reaction sequence
kj kj kj h reaction
things remember
reverse reaction get things cancel sign h must also reversed
multiply agent get cancel agents h must also multiplied number
generally h values given tables atm c k aware conditions reaction
find values h
values h experimentally determined available table form general chemistry textbooks appendixes including common h values several online tables available extensive information software offered active thermochemical tables atct available online
