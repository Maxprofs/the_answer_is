synthetic radioisotope radionuclide found nature natural process mechanism exists produces unstable decays away short period time examples include technetium promethium many found harvested spent nuclear fuel assemblies must manufactured particle accelerators
production
synthetic radioisotopes extracted spent nuclear reactor fuel rods contain various fission products example estimated tbq metric ton technetium produced nuclear reactors far dominant source terrestrial technetium however fraction production used commercially synthetic isotopes produced significant quantities fission yet reclaimed isotopes manufactured neutron irradiation parent isotopes nuclear reactor example tc made neutron irradiation ru bombarding parent isotopes high energy particles particle accelerator
uses
synthetic radioisotopes extremely radioactive short halflife though health hazard radioactive materials many medical industrial uses
nuclear medicine
general field nuclear medicine covers use radioisotopes diagnosis treatment
diagnosis
radioactive tracer compounds used observe function various organs body systems compounds use chemical tracer attracted concentrated activity studied chemical tracer incorporates short lived radioactive isotope usually one emits gamma ray energetic enough travel body captured outside gamma camera map concentrations gamma cameras similar detectors highly efficient tracer compounds generally effective concentrating areas interest total amounts radioactive material needed small
metastable nuclear isomer tcm gammaemitter widely used medical diagnostics short halflife hours easily made hospital using technetiumcow
treatment
radiopharmaceuticals number compounds using radioisotope medical treatment usually bringing radioactive isotope high concentration body near particular organ example iodine used treating disorders tumors thyroid gland
industrial radiation sources
alpha particle beta particle gamma ray radioactive emissions industrially useful sources synthetic radioisotopes
