leveling effect solvent leveling refers effect solvent properties acids bases strength strong acid limited leveled basicity solvent similarly strength strong base leveled acidity solvent strong acid dissolved water reacts form hydronium ion ho example would following reaction ha strong acid
ha ho ho
acid stronger ho reacts ho form ho therefore acid stronger ho exists ho similarly ammonia solvent strongest acid ammonium nh thus hcl super acid exert acidifying effect
argument applies bases water oh strongest base thus even though sodium amide nanh exceptional base pka nh water good sodium hydroxide hand nanh far basic reagent ammonia naoh
ph range allowed particular solvent called acidbase discrimination window
leveling differentiating solvents
differentiating solvent various acids dissociate different degrees thus different strengths leveling solvent several acids completely dissociated thus strength weakly basic solvent less tendency strongly basic one accept proton similarly weak acid less tendency donate protons strong acid result strong acid perchloric acid exhibits strongly acidic properties weak acid acetic acid dissolved weakly basic solvent hand acids tend become indistinguishable strength dissolved strongly basic solvents owing greater affinity strong bases protons called leveling effect strong bases leveling solvents acids weak bases differentiating solvents acids leveling effect common solvents studies super acids conducted solvents weakly basic sulfur dioxide liquefied soclf
types solvent basis proton interaction basis proton interaction solvents four types
protophilic solvents solvents greater tendency accept protons ie water alcohol liquid ammonia etc
ii protogenic solvents solvents tendency produce protons ie water liquid hydrogen chloride glacial acetic acid etc
iii amphiprotic solvents solvents act protophilic protogenic eg water ammonia ethyl alcohol etc
iv aprotic solvents solvents neither donate accept protons eg benzene carbon tetrachloride carbon disulphide etc
hcl acts acid ho stronger acid nh weak acid chcooh neutral ch weak base hf
