a plan is typically any diagram or list of steps with timing and resources used to achieve an objective see also strategy it is commonly understood as a temporal set of intended actions through which one expects to achieve a goal for spatial or planar topologic or topographic sets see map
plans can be formal or informal
structured and formal plans used by multiple people are more likely to occur in projects diplomacy careers economic development military campaigns combat sports games or in the conduct of other business in most cases the absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects for example a non-robust project plan can cost the organization time and money
informal or ad hoc plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits
the most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth time frame and specificity however these planning classifications are not independent of one another for instance there is a close relationship between the short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories
it is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use more formal plans as used for business and military purposes while initially created with and as an abstract thought are likely to be written down drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space this allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan

the term planning implies the working out of sub-components in some degree of elaborate detail broader-brush enunciations of objectives may qualify as metaphorical roadmaps planning literally just means the creation of a plan it can be as simple as making a list it has acquired a technical meaning however to cover the area of government legislation and regulations related to the use of resources
planning can refer to the planned use of any and all resources as in the succession of five-year plans through which the government of the soviet union sought to develop the country however the term is most frequently used in relation to planning for the use of land and related resources for example in urban planning transportation planning etc
thus in a governmental context planning without any qualification is most likely to mean the regulation of land use see also zoning

=== methodologyedit ===
the discipline of planning has occupied great minds and theoreticians concepts such as top-down planning (as opposed to bottom-up planning) reveal similarities with the systems thinking behind the top-down model
the subject touches such broad fields as psychology game theory communications and information theory which inform the planning methods that people seek to use and refine as well as logic and science (i.e methodological naturalism) which serve as a means of testing different parts of a plan for reliability or consistency
the specific methods used to create and refine plans depends on who is to make it who is to put it to use and what resources are available for the task the methods used by an individual in their mind or personal organizer may be very different from the collection of planning techniques found in a corporate board-room and the planning done by a project manager has different priorities and uses different tools to the planning done by an engineer or industrial designer

a very basic example of a plan perhaps you want to go see a movie at a specific time that is the plan the procedure to accomplish the plan would define the steps to be taken in order first you would look on a web site for listings of movies in your area then you would decide which one looks good (if any) then you would secure transportation thereto optionally but almost certainly also inviting one or more acquaintances to join you you may have to adjust your time to when the movie actually starts a plan defines what you are going to do this can be done by choosing from what you haven't done yet a procedure defines how you are going to do it this can be done by choosing from how it will have been accepted then
