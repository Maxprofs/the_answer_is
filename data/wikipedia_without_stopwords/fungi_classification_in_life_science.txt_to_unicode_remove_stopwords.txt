estimation methodologiesedit
accurate estimate number humans ever lived difficult produce numerous reasons firstly set specific characteristics define human matter definition open debate members early homo sapiens earlier related species homo include estimate see also sorites paradox even scientific community reached broad consensus regarding characteristics distinguished human beings would nearly impossible pinpoint time first appearance even nearest millennium due scarcity fossil evidence however small size world population prehistoric times compared current size makes uncertainty limited importance
importantly robust population data exist last two three centuries late th century governments ever performed accurate census many early attempts ancient egypt persian empire focus counting merely subset population purposes taxation military service thus significant margin error estimating ancient global populations
another critical factor estimate life expectancy depends significantly infant mortality rates figures difficult estimate ancient times due lack accurate records haubs estimates suggest around ever lived survive beyond first birthday haub also stated life expectancy birth probably averaged ten years human history
