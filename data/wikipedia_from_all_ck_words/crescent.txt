in art and symbolism a crescent (us /krsnt/ uk /krznt/) is generally the shape produced when a circular disk has a segment of another circle removed from its edge so that what remains is a shape enclosed by two circular arcs of different diameters which intersect at two points (usually in such a manner that the enclosed shape does not include the center of the original circle)
in astronomy a crescent is the shape of the lit side of a spherical body (most notably the moon) that appears to be less than half illuminated by the sun as seen by the viewer mathematically assuming the terminator lies on a great circle such a crescent will actually be the figure bounded by a half-ellipse and a half-circle with the major axis of the ellipse coinciding with a diameter of the semicircle the direction in which the horns (the points at the intersection of the two arcs) face indicates whether a crescent is waxing (also young or increasing) or waning (also old or decreasing) eastward pointing horns (pointing to the left as seen from the northern hemisphere) indicate a waxing crescent whereas westward pointing horns (pointing to the right as seen from the northern hemisphere) indicate a waning crescent note that the directions the horns point relative to the observer are reversed in the southern hemisphere
the word crescent is derived etymologically from the present participle of the latin verb crescere to grow thus meaning waxing or increasing and so was originally applied to the form of the waxing moon (luna crescens) the english word is now commonly used to refer to either the waxing or waning shape in the technical language of blazoning used in heraldry the word increscent refers to a crescent shape with its horns to the left and decrescent refers to one with its horns to the right

=== in the ancient worldedit ===
the crescent is one of the oldest symbols known to humanity together with the sun it appeared on akkadian seals as early as 2300 bc and from at least the second millennium bc it was the symbol of the mesopotamian moon gods nanna in sumer and sin in babylonia sin being the lamp of heaven and earth the crescent was well known in the middle east and was transplanted by the phoenicians in the 8th century bc as far as carthage (now in tunisia) the crescent and star also appears on pre-islamic coins of south arabia
=== under the byzantine empireedit ===
the crescent was in use in the ancient greek colony of byzantium subsequently it became one of the symbols of the byzantine empire and especially of constantinople indeed during the byzantine-ottoman wars the crescent was used simultaneously by both the byzantines and the ottoman sultans
anna notaras daughter of the last megas doux of the byzantine empire loukas notaras after the fall of constantinople and her emigration to italy made a seal with her coat of arms which included two lions holding above the crescent a cross or a sword
=== pre-islamic and islamic usesedit ===
before islam the crescent was the symbol of sassanids in the 12th century the crescent and star were adopted by the turks and since then the crescent has been a frequent symbol used by powerful muslim empires such as the ottomans and the mughals it is a historical symbol of the turks associated especially with the ottoman empire but pre-islamic turkic nations such as the gktrks used the crescent and star figure on their coins
the kingdom of aksum of modern ethiopia practiced a polytheistic religion and after conversion to christianity in 330 ad they replaced the crescent in their coin with the cross
the oldest representations of flags with the crescent are on 14th-century navigational charts or portolanos and manuscript of a franciscan friar there are discrepancies between these sources as far as the colours of fields or crescents are concerned however an account of flags from the middle east and north africa by the author of libro del conoscimiento confirms the widespread use of the crescent on flags in that region these include the flags of the kings of damascus and lucha (yellow with a white crescent) cairo (white with a blue crescent) mahdia in tunisia (white with a purple crescent) tunis (white with a black crescent) and buda (white with a red crescent) some of the 14 and 15th-century portolanos show the flag of tunis as red with one or two crescents which is presented on several portolanos as a symbol of the ottoman empire from 16th to the 18th centuries this flag is usually shown with three white crescents in 1793 the number of crescents was reduced to one and an eight-pointed star was later added on when the rule of the ottoman empire ended turkey was the only muslim state regarded as a world power at the time its flag was known from west africa to the far east and helped to popularize the crescent and star among the muslim populations of many countries of asia and africa muhammad ali who became pasha of egypt in 1805 introduced the first national flag of egypt red with three white crescents each accompanied by a white star this flag in turn influenced the design of the first flag of independent egypt which was green with a white crescent and three white stars to symbolize the peaceful co-existence of muslims christians and jews during the past two centuries the crescent and star has featured on the flags of other muslim countries
though the crescent was originally a secular symbol of authority for muslim rulers it is now often used to symbolize the islamic faith however the crescent was not a symbol used for islam by muhammad or any other early muslim rulers as the islamic religion is in fact against appointing holy symbols (so that during the early centuries of islam muslim authorities simply didn't want any geometric symbols to be used to symbolize islam in the way that the cross symbolizes christianity the menorah was a commonly occurring symbol of judaism etc.) this is why early islamic coins were covered with arabic writing but contained no visual symbols
despite this mixed history many islamic nations and charities use the crescent symbol on their flags or logos (e.g turkey the red crescent etc though currently none of the arab states in arabia or the mashreq have crescents on their flags)
note that in the case of an astronomical crescent such as the moon observed in the sky the outer arc will be 180 (a half-circle as previously mentioned) while the islamic crescent symbol (arabic hill) is often shown with an outer arc significantly greater than 180 (as seen in the illustrations below)
