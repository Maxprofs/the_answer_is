flower sometimes known bloom blossom reproductive structure found flowering plants plants division magnoliophyta also called angiosperms biological function flower effect reproduction usually providing mechanism union sperm eggs flowers may facilitate outcrossing fusion sperm eggs different individuals population allow selfing fusion sperm egg flower flowers produce diaspores without fertilization parthenocarpy flowers contain sporangia site gametophytes develop flowers give rise fruit seeds many flowers evolved attractive animals cause vectors transfer pollen
addition facilitating reproduction flowering plants flowers long admired used humans beautify environment also objects romance ritual religion medicine source food
morphology
floral parts
essential parts flower considered two parts vegetative part consisting petals associated structures perianth reproductive sexual parts stereotypical flower consists four kinds structures attached tip short stalk kinds parts arranged whorl receptacle four main whorls starting base flower lowest node working upwards follows
vegetative perianth
collectively calyx corolla form perianth see diagram
calyx outermost whorl consisting units called sepals typically green enclose rest flower bud stage however absent prominent petallike species
corolla next whorl toward apex composed units called petals typically thin soft colored attract animals help process pollination
reproductive
androecium greek andros oikia mans house next whorl sometimes multiplied several whorls consisting units called stamens stamens consist two parts stalk called filament topped anther pollen produced meiosis eventually dispersed
gynoecium greek gynaikos oikia womans house innermost whorl flower consisting one units called carpels carpel multiple fused carpels form hollow structure called ovary produces ovules internally ovules megasporangia turn produce megaspores meiosis develop female gametophytes give rise egg cells gynoecium flower also described using alternative terminology wherein structure one sees innermost whorl consisting ovary style stigma called pistil pistil may consist single carpel number carpels fused together sticky tip pistil stigma receptor pollen supportive stalk style becomes pathway pollen tubes grow pollen grains adhering stigma relationship gynoecium receptacle described hypogynous beneath superior ovary perigynous surrounding superior ovary epigynous inferior ovary
structure
although arrangement described considered typical plant species show wide variation floral structure modifications significance evolution flowering plants used extensively botanists establish relationships among plant species
four main parts flower generally defined positions receptacle function many flowers lack parts parts may modified functions andor look like typically another part families like ranunculaceae petals greatly reduced many species sepals colorful petallike flowers modified stamens petallike double flowers peonies roses mostly petaloid stamens flowers show great variation plant scientists describe variation systematic way identify distinguish species
specific terminology used describe flowers parts many flower parts fused together fused parts originating whorl connate fused parts originating different whorls adnate parts fused free petals fused tube ring falls away single unit sympetalous also called gamopetalous connate petals may distinctive regions cylindrical base tube expanding region throat flaring outer region limb sympetalous flower bilateral symmetry upper lower lip bilabiate flowers connate petals sepals may various shaped corolla calyx including campanulate funnelform tubular urceolate salverform rotate
referring fusion commonly done appears questionable least processes involved may nonfusion processes example addition intercalary growth base primordia floral appendages sepals petals stamens carpels may lead common base result fusion
many flowers symmetry perianth bisected central axis point symmetrical halves produced forming radial symmetry flowers also known actinomorphic regular eg rose trillium flowers bisected produce one line produces symmetrical halves flower said irregular zygomorphic eg snapdragon orchids
flowers may directly attached plant base sessilethe supporting stalk stem highly reduced absent stem stalk subtending flower called peduncle peduncle supports one flower stems connecting flower main axis called pedicels apex flowering stem forms terminal swelling called torus receptacle
inflorescence
species one flower axis collective cluster flowers termed inflorescence inflorescences composed many small flowers arranged formation resembles single flower common example members large composite asteraceae group single daisy sunflower example flower flower headan inflorescence composed numerous flowers florets inflorescence may include specialized stems modified leaves known bracts
floral diagrams floral formulae
floral formula way represent structure flower using specific letters numbers symbols presenting substantial information flower compact form represent taxon usually giving ranges numbers different organs particular species floral formulae developed early th century use declined since prenner et al devised extension existing model broaden descriptive capability formula format floral formulae differs different parts world yet convey information
structure flower also expressed means floral diagrams use schematic diagrams replace long descriptions complicated drawings tool understanding floral structure evolution diagrams may show important features flowers including relative positions various organs including presence fusion symmetry well structural details
development
flower develops modified shoot axis determinate apical meristem determinate meaning axis grows set size compressed internodes bearing structures classical plant morphology interpreted highly modified leaves detailed developmental studies however shown stamens often initiated less like modified stems caulomes cases may even resemble branchlets taking account whole diversity development androecium flowering plants find continuum modified leaves phyllomes modified stems caulomes modified branchlets shoots
flowering transition
transition flowering one major phase changes plant makes life cycle transition must take place time favorable fertilization formation seeds hence ensuring maximal reproductive success meet needs plant able interpret important endogenous environmental cues changes levels plant hormones seasonable temperature photoperiod changes many perennial biennial plants require vernalization flower molecular interpretation signals transmission complex signal known florigen involves variety genes including constans flowering locus c flowering locus florigen produced leaves reproductively favorable conditions acts buds growing tips induce number different physiological morphological changes
first step transition transformation vegetative stem primordia floral primordia occurs biochemical changes take place change cellular differentiation leaf bud stem tissues tissue grow reproductive organs growth central part stem tip stops flattens sides develop protuberances whorled spiral fashion around outside stem end protuberances develop sepals petals stamens carpels process begins plants cannot reversed stems develop flowers even initial start flower formation event dependent environmental cue process begins even cue removed stem continue develop flower
organ development
molecular control floral organ identity determination appears fairly well understood species simple model three gene activities interact combinatorial manner determine developmental identities organ primordia within floral meristem gene functions called b cgene functions first floral whorl agenes expressed leading formation sepals second whorl bgenes expressed leading formation petals third whorl b c genes interact form stamens center flower cgenes alone give rise carpels model based upon studies homeotic mutants arabidopsis thaliana snapdragon antirrhinum majus example loss bgene function mutant flowers produced sepals first whorl usual also second whorl instead normal petal formation third whorl lack b function presence cfunction mimics fourth whorl leading formation carpels also third whorl see also abc model flower development
genes central model belong madsbox genes transcription factors regulate expression genes specific floral organ
floral function
principal purpose flower reproduction individual species flowering plants heterosporous producing two types spores microspores produced meiosis inside anthers megaspores produced inside ovules inside ovary fact anthers typically consist four microsporangia ovule integumented megasporangium types spores develop gametophytes inside sporangia heterosporous plants gametophytes also develop inside spores endosporic
majority species individual flowers functional carpels stamens botanists describe flowers perfect bisexual species hermaphroditic flowers lack one reproductive organ called imperfect unisexual unisex flowers found individual plant different locations species said monoecious type unisex flower found separate individuals plant dioecious
flower specialization pollination
flowering plants usually face selective pressure optimize transfer pollen typically reflected morphology flowers behaviour plants pollen may transferred plants via number vectors plants make use abiotic vectors namely wind anemophily much less commonly water hydrophily others use biotic vectors including insects entomophily birds ornithophily bats chiropterophily animals plants make use multiple vectors many highly specialised
cleistogamous flowers selfpollinated may may open many viola salvia species known types flowers
flowers plants make use biotic pollen vectors commonly glands called nectaries act incentive animals visit flower flowers patterns called nectar guides show pollinators look nectar flowers also attract pollinators scent color still flowers use mimicry attract pollinators species orchids example produce flowers resembling female bees color shape scent flowers also specialized shape arrangement stamens ensures pollen grains transferred bodies pollinator lands search attractant nectar pollen mate pursuing attractant many flowers species pollinator transfers pollen stigmasarranged equally pointed precisionof flowers visits
anemophilous flowers use wind move pollen one flower next examples include grasses birch trees ragweed maples need attract pollinators therefore tend showy flowers male female reproductive organs generally found separate flowers male flowers number long filaments terminating exposed stamens female flowers long featherlike stigmas whereas pollen animalpollinated flowers tends largegrained sticky rich protein another reward pollinators anemophilous flower pollen usually smallgrained light little nutritional value animals
pollination
primary purpose flower reproduction since flowers reproductive organs plant mediate joining sperm contained within pollen ovules contained ovary pollination movement pollen anthers stigma joining sperm ovules called fertilization normally pollen moved one plant another many plants able self pollinate fertilized ovules produce seeds next generation sexual reproduction produces genetically unique offspring allowing adaptation flowers specific designs encourages transfer pollen one plant another species many plants dependent upon external factors pollination including wind animals especially insects even large animals birds bats pygmy possums employed period time process take place flower fully expanded functional called anthesis study pollination insects called anthecology
pollen
types pollen commonly cause allergic reactions produced plainlooking plants trees grasses weeds showy flowers plants make small light dry pollen grains custommade wind transport
type allergens pollen main factor determines whether pollen likely cause hay fever example pine tree pollen produced large amounts common tree would make good candidate causing allergy however relatively rare cause allergy types allergens pine pollen appear make less allergenic
among north american plants weeds prolific producers allergenic pollen ragweed major culprit important sources sagebrush redroot pigweed lambs quarters russian thistle tumbleweed english plantain
much confusion role flowers allergies example showy entomophilous goldenrod solidago frequently blamed respiratory allergies innocent since pollen cannot airborne instead allergen usually pollen contemporary bloom anemophilous ragweed ambrosia drift many kilometers
scientists collected samples ragweed pollen miles sea miles high air single ragweed plant generate million grains pollen per day
common hear people say allergic colorful scented flowers like roses fact florists gardeners others prolonged close contact flowers likely sensitive pollen plants people little contact large heavy waxy pollen grains flowering plants type pollen carried wind insects butterflies bees
attraction methods
plants cannot move one location another thus many flowers evolved attract animals transfer pollen individuals dispersed populations flowers insectpollinated called entomophilous literally insectloving greek highly modified along pollinating insects coevolution flowers commonly glands called nectaries various parts attract animals looking nutritious nectar birds bees color vision enabling seek colorful flowers
flowers patterns called nectar guides show pollinators look nectar may visible ultraviolet light visible bees insects flowers also attract pollinators scent scents pleasant sense smell flower scents appealing humans number flowers pollinated insects attracted rotten flesh flowers smell like dead animals often called carrion flowers including rafflesia titan arum north american pawpaw asimina triloba flowers pollinated night visitors including bats moths likely concentrate scent attract pollinators flowers white
flowers use mimicry attract pollinators species orchids example produce flowers resembling female bees color shape scent male bees move one flower another search mate
pollination mechanism
pollination mechanism employed plant depends method pollination utilized
flowers divided two broad groups pollination methods
entomophilous flowers attract use insects bats birds animals transfer pollen one flower next often specialized shape arrangement stamens ensures pollen grains transferred bodies pollinator lands search attractant nectar pollen mate pursuing attractant many flowers species pollinator transfers pollen stigmasarranged equally pointed precisionof flowers visits many flowers rely simple proximity flower parts ensure pollination others sarracenia ladyslipper orchids elaborate designs ensure pollination preventing selfpollination
anemophilous flowers use wind move pollen one flower next examples include grasses birch trees ragweed maples need attract pollinators therefore tend grow large blossoms whereas pollen entomophilous flowers tends largegrained sticky rich protein another reward pollinators anemophilous flower pollen usually smallgrained light little nutritional value insects though may still gathered times dearth honeybees bumblebees actively gather anemophilous corn maize pollen though little value
flowers selfpollinated use flowers never open selfpollinated flowers open flowers called cleistogamous many viola species salvia types flowers
flowerpollinator relationships
many flowers close relationships one specific pollinating organisms many flowers example attract one specific species insect therefore rely insect successful reproduction close relationship often given example coevolution flower pollinator thought developed together long period time match others needs
close relationship compounds negative effects extinction extinction either member relationship would mean almost certain extinction member well endangered plant species shrinking pollinator populations
fertilization dispersal
flowers stamens pistil capable selffertilization increase chance producing seeds limits genetic variation extreme case selffertilization occurs flowers always selffertilize many dandelions conversely many species plants ways preventing selffertilization unisexual male female flowers plant may appear mature time pollen plant may incapable fertilizing ovules latter flower types chemical barriers pollen referred selfsterile selfincompatible
evolution
land plants existed million years first ones reproduced simple adaptation aquatic counterparts spores sea plantsand animalscan simply scatter genetic clones float away grow elsewhere early plants reproduced plants soon evolved methods protecting copies deal drying abuse even likely land sea protection became seed though yet evolved flower early seedbearing plants include ginkgo conifers earliest fossil flowering plant archaefructus liaoningensis dated million years old
several groups extinct gymnosperms particularly seed ferns proposed ancestors flowering plants continuous fossil evidence showing exactly flowers evolved apparently sudden appearance relatively modern flowers fossil record posed problem theory evolution called abominable mystery charles darwin recently discovered angiosperm fossils archaefructus along discoveries fossil gymnosperms suggest angiosperm characteristics may acquired series steps
recent dna analysis molecular systematics shows amborella trichopoda found pacific island new caledonia sister group rest flowering plants morphological studies suggest features may characteristic earliest flowering plants
general assumption function flowers start involve animals reproduction process pollen scattered without bright colors obvious shapes would therefore liability using plants resources unless provide benefit one proposed reason sudden fully developed appearance flowers evolved isolated setting like island chain islands plants bearing able develop highly specialized relationship specific animal wasp example way many island species develop today symbiotic relationship hypothetical wasp bearing pollen one plant another much way fig wasps today could eventually resulted plants partners developing high degree specialization island genetics believed common source speciation especially comes radical adaptations seem required inferior transitional forms note wasp example incidental bees apparently evolved specifically symbiotic plant relationships descended wasps
likewise fruit used plant reproduction comes enlargement parts flower fruit frequently tool depends upon animals wishing eat thus scattering seeds contains
many symbiotic relationships remain fragile survive competition mainland organisms flowers proved unusually effective means production spreading whatever actual origin become dominant form land plant life
hard proof flowers existing million years ago circumstantial evidence exist million years ago chemical used plants defend flowers oleanane detected fossil plants old including gigantopterids evolved time bear many traits modern flowering plants though known flowering plants stems prickles found preserved detail one earliest examples petrification
similarity leaf stem structure important flowers genetically adaptation normal leaf stem components plants combination genes normally responsible forming new shoots primitive flowers thought variable number flower parts often separate contact flowers would tended grow spiral pattern bisexual plants means male female parts flower dominated ovary female part flowers grew advanced variations developed parts fused together much specific number design either specific sexes per flower plant least ovary inferior
flower evolution continues present day modern flowers profoundly influenced humans many cannot pollinated nature many modern domesticated flowers used simple weeds sprouted ground disturbed tended grow human crops prettiest get plucked beauty developing dependence upon special adaptation human affection
color
many flowering plants reflect much light possible within range visible wavelengths pollinator plant intends attract flowers reflect full range visible light generally perceived white human observer important feature white flowers reflect equally across visible spectrum many flowering plants use white attract pollinators use color also widespread even within species color allows flowering plant specific pollinator seeks attract color model used human color reproduction technology cmyk relies modulation pigments divide spectrum broad areas absorption flowering plants contrast able shift transition point wavelength absorption reflection assumed visual systems pollinators view visible spectrum circular may said flowering plants produce color absorbing light one region spectrum reflecting light region cmyk color produced function amplitude broad regions absorption flowering plants contract produce color modifying frequency rather wavelength light reflected flowers absorb light blue yellow region spectrum reflect light green red region spectrum many species flowering plant transition point characterizes color produce color may modulated shifting transition point absorption reflection way flowering plant may specify pollinator seeks attract
flowering plants also limited ability modulate areas absorption typically precise control wavelength humans observers perceive degrees saturation amount white color
symbolism
many flowers important symbolic meanings western culture practice assigning meanings flowers known floriography common examples include
red roses given symbol love beauty passion
poppies symbol consolation time death united kingdom new zealand australia canada red poppies worn commemorate soldiers died times war
iriseslily used burials symbol referring resurrectionlife also associated stars sun petals bloomingshining
daisies symbol innocence
flowers within art also representative female genitalia seen works artists georgia okeeffe imogen cunningham veronica ruiz de velasco judy chicago fact asian western classical art many cultures around world marked tendency associate flowers femininity
great variety delicate beautiful flowers inspired works numerous poets especially thth century romantic era famous examples include william wordsworths wandered lonely cloud william blakes ah sunflower
varied colorful appearance flowers long favorite subject visual artists well celebrated paintings wellknown painters flowers van goghs sunflowers series monets water lilies flowers also dried freeze dried pressed order create permanent threedimensional pieces flower art
symbolism dreams also discussed possible interpretations including blossoming potential
roman goddess flowers gardens season spring flora greek goddess spring flowers nature chloris
hindu mythology flowers significant status vishnu one three major gods hindu system often depicted standing straight lotus flower apart association vishnu hindu tradition also considers lotus spiritual significance example figures hindu stories creation
usage
modern times people sought ways cultivate buy wear otherwise around flowers blooming plants partly agreeable appearance smell around world people use flowers wide range events functions cumulatively encompass ones lifetime
new births christenings
corsage boutonniere worn social functions holidays
tokens love esteem
wedding flowers bridal party decorations hall
brightening decorations within home
gift remembrance bon voyage parties welcomehome parties thinking gifts
funeral flowers expressions sympathy grieving
worshiping goddesses hindu culture adherents commonly bring flowers gift temples
people therefore grow flowers around homes dedicate entire parts living space flower gardens pick wildflowers buy flowers florists depend entire network commercial growers shippers support trade
flowers provide less food major plants parts seeds fruits roots stems leaves provide several important foods spices flower vegetables include broccoli cauliflower artichoke expensive spice saffron consists dried stigmas crocus flower spices cloves capers hops flowers used flavor beer marigold flowers fed chickens give egg yolks golden yellow color consumers find desirable dried ground marigold flowers also used spice colouring agent georgian cuisine flowers dandelion elder often made wine bee pollen pollen collected bees considered health food people honey consists beeprocessed flower nectar often named type flower eg orange blossom honey clover honey tupelo honey
hundreds fresh flowers edible widely marketed food often used add color flavor salads squash flowers dipped breadcrumbs fried edible flowers include nasturtium chrysanthemum carnation cattail honeysuckle chicory cornflower canna sunflower edible flowers sometimes candied daisy rose violet one may also come across candied pansy
flowers also made herbal teas dried flowers chrysanthemum rose jasmine camomile infused tea fragrance medical properties sometimes also mixed tea leaves added fragrance
flowers used since far back years funeral rituals many cultures draw connection flowers life death seasonal return flowers also suggest rebirth may explain many people place flowers upon graves ancient times greeks would place crown flowers head deceased well cover tombs wreaths flower petals rich powerful women ancient egypt would wear floral headdresses necklaces upon death representations renewal joyful afterlife mexicans day use flowers prominently day dead celebrations way aztec ancestors
