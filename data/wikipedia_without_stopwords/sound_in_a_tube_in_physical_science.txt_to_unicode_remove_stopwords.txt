history
early steps
idea combining motion pictures recorded sound nearly old concept cinema february couple days photographic pioneer eadweard muybridge gave lecture far laboratory thomas edison two inventors privately met muybridge later claimed occasion six years first commercial motion picture exhibition proposed scheme sound cinema would combine imagecasting zoopraxiscope edisons recordedsound technology agreement reached within year edison commissioned development kinetoscope essentially peepshow system visual complement cylinder phonograph two devices brought together kinetophone individual cabinet viewing motion pictures soon outmoded successes film projection projected soundfilm system known cinemacrophonograph phonorama based primarily work swissborn inventor franois dussaud exhibited paris similar kinetophone system required individual use earphones improved cylinderbased system phonocinmathtre developed clmentmaurice gratioulet henri lioret france allowing short films theater opera ballet excerpts presented paris exposition appear first publicly exhibited films projection image recorded sound phonorama yet another soundfilm systemthtroscopewere also presented exposition
three major problems persisted leading motion pictures sound recording largely taking separate paths generation primary issue synchronization pictures sound recorded played back separate devices difficult start maintain tandem sufficient playback volume also hard achieve motion picture projectors soon allowed film shown large theater audiences audio technology development electric amplification could project satisfactorily fill large spaces finally challenge recording fidelity primitive systems era produced sound low quality unless performers stationed directly front cumbersome recording devices acoustical horns part imposing severe limits sort films could created liverecorded sound
cinematic innovators attempted cope fundamental synchronization problem variety ways increasing number motion picture systems relied gramophone recordsknown soundondisc technology records often referred berliner discs one primary inventors field germanamerican emile berliner lon gaumont demonstrated soundondisc chronophone involving electrical connection recently patented french photographic society four years later gaumont introduced elgphone compressedair amplification system based auxetophone developed british inventors horace short charles parsons despite high expectations gaumonts sound innovations limited commercial successthough improvements still satisfactorily address three basic issues sound film expensive well years american inventor e e nortons cameraphone primary competitor gaumont system sources differ whether cameraphone disc cylinderbased ultimately failed many reasons held back chronophone
edison introduced new cylinderbased synchsound apparatus known like system kinetophone instead films shown individual viewers kinetoscope cabinet projected onto screen phonograph connected intricate arrangement pulleys film projector allowingunder ideal conditionsfor synchronization however conditions rarely ideal new improved kinetophone retired little year mids groundswell commercial sound motion picture exhibition subsided beginning photodrama creation promoting jehovahs witnesses conception mankinds genesis screened around united states eight hours worth projected visuals involving slides live action synchronized separately recorded lectures musical performances played back phonograph
meanwhile innovations continued another significant front frenchborn londonbased eugene laustewho worked edisons lab awarded first patent soundonfilm technology involving transformation sound light waves photographically recorded direct onto celluloid described historian scott eyman
double system sound different piece film picture essence sound captured microphone translated light waves via light valve thin ribbon sensitive metal tiny slit sound reaching ribbon would converted light shivering diaphragm focusing resulting light waves slit would photographed side film strip tenth inch wide
though soundonfilm would eventually become universal standard synchronized sound cinema lauste never successfully exploited innovations came effective dead end finnish inventor eric tigerstedt granted german patent soundonfilm work year apparently demonstrated film made process audience scientists berlin hungarian engineer denes mihaly submitted soundonfilm projectofon concept royal hungarian patent court patent award published four years later whether sound captured cylinder disc film none available technology adequate bigleague commercial purposes many years heads major hollywood film studios saw little benefit producing sound motion pictures
crucial innovations
number technological developments contributed making sound cinema commercially viable late two involved contrasting approaches synchronized sound reproduction playback
advanced soundonfilm

sam warner warner bros small hollywood studio big ambitions saw demonstration western electric soundondisc system sufficiently impressed persuade brothers agree experiment using system new yorks vitagraph studios recently purchased tests convincing warner brothers executives picture companies witnessed consequently april western electric company entered contract warner brothers w j rich financier giving exclusive license recording reproducing sound pictures western electric system exploit license vitaphone corporation organized samuel l warner president vitaphone system called publicly introduced august premiere nearly threehourlong juan first featurelength movie employ synchronized sound system type throughout soundtrack contained musical score added sound effects recorded dialoguein words staged shot silent film accompanying juan however eight shorts musical performances mostly classical well fourminute filmed introduction h hays president motion picture association america liverecorded sound first true sound films exhibited hollywood studio warner bros better ole technically similar juan followed october
soundonfilm would ultimately win soundondisc number fundamental technical advantages
synchronization interlock system completely reliable sound could fall synch due disc skipping minute changes film speed requiring constant supervision frequent manual adjustment
editing discs could directly edited severely limiting ability make alterations accompanying films original release cut
distribution phonograph discs added expense complication film distribution
wear tear physical process playing discs degraded requiring replacement approximately twenty screenings
nonetheless early years soundondisc edge soundonfilm two substantial ways
production capital cost generally less expensive record sound onto disc onto film exhibition systemsturntableinterlockprojectorwere cheaper manufacture complex imageandaudiopatternreading projectors required soundonfilm
audio quality phonograph discs vitaphones particular superior dynamic range soundonfilm processes day least first playings soundonfilm tended better frequency response outweighed greater distortion noise
