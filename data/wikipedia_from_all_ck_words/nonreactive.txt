a nonstress test (nst) is a screening test used in pregnancy a cardiotocograph is used to monitor the fetal heart rate
== premiseedit ==
the premise of the nst is that a well-oxygenated non-acidemic fetus will spontaneously have temporary increases in the fetal heart rate (fhr)
vibroacoustic stimulation can wake the fetus and is sometimes used to speed up the test or to facilitate further evaluation of a nonreactive nonstress test
== interpretationedit ==
classified as normal/atypical/abnormal normal - baseline heart rate between 110-160 with moderate variability (5-25 interbeat variability) and 2 qualifying accelerations in 20 minutes with no decelerations
previous terminology reactive/non-reactive *reactive (normal) - presence of two or more fetal heart rate accelerations within a 20-minute period with or without fetal movement discernible by the woman accelerations are defined as 15 bpm above baselines for at least 15 seconds if beyond 32 weeks gestation or 10 bpm for at least 10 seconds if at or below 32 weeks
nonreactive - presence of less than two fetal heart rate accelerations within a 20-minute period over a 40-minute testing period
