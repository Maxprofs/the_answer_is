essays are generally scholarly pieces of writing giving the author's own argument but the definition is vague overlapping with those of an article a pamphlet and a short story
essays can consist of a number of elements including literary criticism political manifestos learned arguments observations of daily life recollections and reflections of the author almost all modern essays are written in prose but works in verse have been dubbed essays (e.g alexander pope's an essay on criticism and an essay on man) while brevity usually defines an essay voluminous works like john locke's an essay concerning human understanding and thomas malthus's an essay on the principle of population are counterexamples in some countries (e.g. the united states and canada) essays have become a major part of formal education secondary students are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills admission essays are often used by universities in selecting applicants and in the humanities and social sciences essays are often used as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams
the concept of an essay has been extended to other mediums beyond writing a film essay is a movie which often incorporates documentary film making styles and which focuses more on the evolution of a theme or an idea a photographic essay is an attempt to cover a topic with a linked series of photographs it may or may not have an accompanying text or captions
== definitions ==
an essay has been defined in a variety of ways one definition is a prose composition with a focused subject of discussion or a long systematic discourse it is difficult to define the genre into which essays fall aldous huxley a leading essayist gives guidance on the subject he notes that the essay is a literary device for saying almost everything about almost anything and adds that by tradition almost by definition the essay is a short piece furthermore huxley argues that essays belong to a literary species whose extreme variability can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame of reference these three poles (or worlds in which the essay may exist) are
the personal and the autobiographical the essayists that feel most comfortable in this pole write fragments of reflective autobiography and look at the world through the keyhole of anecdote and description
the objective the factual and the concrete-particular the essayists that write from this pole do not speak directly of themselves but turn their attention outward to some literary or scientific or political theme their art consists on setting forth passing judgement upon and drawing general conclusions from the relevant data
the abstract-universal in this pole we find those essayists who do their work in the world of high abstractions who are never personal and who seldom mention the particular facts of experience
huxley adds that the most richly satisfying essays are those which make the best not of one not of two but of all the three worlds in which it is possible for the essay to exist
the word essay derives from the french infinitive essayer to try or to attempt in english essay first meant a trial or an attempt and this is still an alternative meaning the frenchman michel de montaigne (15331592) was the first author to describe his work as essays he used the term to characterize these as attempts to put his thoughts into writing and his essays grew out of his commonplacing inspired in particular by the works of plutarch a translation of whose uvres morales (moral works) into french had just been published by jacques amyot montaigne began to compose his essays in 1572 the first edition entitled essais was published in two volumes in 1580 for the rest of his life he continued revising previously published essays and composing new ones francis bacon's essays published in book form in 1597 1612 and 1625 were the first works in english that described themselves as essays ben jonson first used the word essayist in english in 1609 according to the oxford english dictionary
== history ==
=== europe ===
english essayists included robert burton (15771641) and sir thomas browne (16051682) in france michel de montaigne's three volume essais in the mid 1500s contain over 100 examples widely regarded as the predecessor of the modern essay in italy baldassare castiglione wrote about courtly manners in his essay il libro del cortegiano in the 17th century the jesuit baltasar gracin wrote about the theme of wisdom during the age of enlightenment essays were a favored tool of polemicists who aimed at convincing readers of their position they also featured heavily in the rise of periodical literature as seen in the works of joseph addison richard steele and samuel johnson in the 18th and 19th centuries edmund burke and samuel taylor coleridge wrote essays for the general public the early 19th century in particular saw a proliferation of great essayists in english william hazlitt charles lamb leigh hunt and thomas de quincey all penned numerous essays on diverse subjects in the 20th century a number of essayists tried to explain the new movements in art and culture by using essays (e.g. t.s eliot) whereas some essayists used essays for strident political themes robert louis stevenson and willa cather wrote lighter essays virginia woolf edmund wilson and charles du bos wrote literary criticism essays
=== japan ===
as with the novel essays existed in japan several centuries before they developed in europe with a genre of essays known as zuihitsu loosely connected essays and fragmented ideas zuihitsu have existed since almost the beginnings of japanese literature many of the most noted early works of japanese literature are in this genre notable examples include the pillow book (c 1000) by court lady sei shnagon and tsurezuregusa (1330) by particularly renowned japanese buddhist monk yoshida kenk kenk described his short writings similarly to montaigne referring to them as nonsensical thoughts written in idle hours another noteworthy difference from europe is that women have traditionally written in japan though the more formal chinese-influenced writings of male writers were more prized at the time
== as an educational tool ==
in countries like the united states and the united kingdom essays have become a major part of a formal education in the form of free response questions secondary students in these countries are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills and essays are often used by universities in these countries in selecting applicants (see admissions essay) in both secondary and tertiary education essays are used to judge the mastery and comprehension of material students are asked to explain comment on or assess a topic of study in the form of an essay during some courses university students will often be required to complete one or more essays that are prepared over several weeks or months in addition in fields such as the humanities and social sciences mid-term and end of term examinations often require students to write a short essay in two or three hours
in these countries so-called academic essays which may also be called papers are usually more formal than literary ones they may still allow the presentation of the writer's own views but this is done in a logical and factual manner with the use of the first person often discouraged longer academic essays (often with a word limit of between 2,000 and 5,000 words) are often more discursive they sometimes begin with a short summary analysis of what has previously been written on a topic which is often called a literature review
longer essays may also contain an introductory page in which words and phrases from the title are tightly defined most academic institutions will require that all substantial facts quotations and other porting material used in an essay be referenced in a bibliography or works cited page at the end of the text this scholarly convention allows others (whether teachers or fellow scholars) to understand the basis of the facts and quotations used to support the essay's argument and thereby help to evaluate to what extent the argument is supported by evidence and to evaluate the quality of that evidence the academic essay tests the student's ability to present their thoughts in an organized way and is designed to test their intellectual capabilities
one essay guide of a us university makes the distinction between research papers and discussion papers the guide states that a research paper is intended to uncover a wide variety of sources on a given topic as such research papers tend to be longer and more inclusive in their scope and with the amount of information they deal with. while discussion papers also include research they tend to be shorter and more selective in their approach...and more analytical and critical whereas a research paper would typically quote a wide variety of sources a discussion paper aims to integrate the material in a broader fashion
one of the challenges facing us universities is that in some cases students may submit essays which have been purchased from an essay mill (or paper mill") as their own work an essay mill is a ghostwriting service that sells pre-written essays to university and college students since plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty or academic fraud universities and colleges may investigate papers suspected to be from an essay mill by using internet plagiarism detection software which compares essays against a database of known mill essays and by orally testing students on the contents of their papers
