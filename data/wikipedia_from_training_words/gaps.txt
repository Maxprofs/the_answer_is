== rules ==
the cards are dealt into four rows of thirteen the aces are removed and discarded from further play the gaps that they leave behind are filled by cards that are the same suit and a rank higher than the card on the left of the gap (for example 4 can be placed beside 3.) however any gap at the right of a king is considered dead and no card can fill it
any gap on the left hand side of the row should be placed by a deuce and the row should be built up by suit beside the deuce (i e 2-3-4-5 etc.) it is the discretion of the player on which suit would occupy which row
