general principlesedit
reaction catalysed enzyme uses exactly reactants produces exactly products uncatalysed reaction like catalysts enzymes alter position equilibrium substrates products however unlike uncatalysed chemical reactions enzymecatalysed reactions display saturation kinetics given enzyme concentration relatively low substrate concentrations reaction rate increases linearly substrate concentration enzyme molecules largely free catalyse reaction increasing substrate concentration means increasing rate enzyme substrate molecules encounter one another however relatively high substrate concentrations reaction rate asymptotically approaches theoretical maximum enzyme active sites almost occupied reaction rate determined intrinsic turnover rate enzyme substrate concentration midway two limiting cases denoted km
two important kinetic properties enzyme quickly enzyme becomes saturated particular substrate maximum rate achieve knowing properties suggests enzyme might cell show enzyme respond changes conditions
