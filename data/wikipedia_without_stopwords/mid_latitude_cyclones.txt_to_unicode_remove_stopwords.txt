terminologyedit
extratropical cyclones encompass class storms many names term cyclone applies numerous types low pressure areas descriptor extratropical signifies type cyclone generally occurs outside tropics middle latitudes earth term midlatitude cyclones may used form posttropical cyclones extratropical transition occurred weather forecasters general public often describe depressions lows terms like frontal cyclone frontal depression frontal low extratropical low nontropical low hybrid low often used well
extratropical cyclones classified mainly baroclinic form along zones temperature dewpoint gradient known frontal zones become barotropic late life cycle distribution heat around cyclone becomes fairly uniform radius
