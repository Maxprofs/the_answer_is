interphase phase cell cycle typical cell spends life interphase daily living metabolic phase cell cell obtains nutrients metabolizes grows reads dna conducts normal cell functions majority eukaryotic cells spend time interphase phase formerly called resting phase however interphase describe cell merely resting rather cell actively living preparing later cell division name changed common misconception interphase first stage mitosis however since mitosis division nucleus prophase actually first stage
interphase cell gets ready mitosis meiosis somatic cells normal diploid cells body go mitosis order reproduce cell division whereas diploid germ cells ie primary spermatocytes primary oocytes go meiosis order create haploid gametes ie sperm ova purpose sexual reproduction chromosomes copied
stages interphase
three stages interphase phase ending cellular checkpoint checks accuracy stages completion proceeding next stages interphase
g gap cell grows functions normally time high amount protein synthesis occurs cell grows double original size organelles produced volume cytoplasm increases mitochondria chloroplasts divide cell divide enter g
synthesis cell duplicates dna via semiconservative replication also known swanson phase
g gap cell resumes growth preparation division
addition cells divide often ever enter stage called g gap zero either stage separate interphase extended g
duration time spent interphase stage interphase variable depends type cell species organism belongs cells adult mammals spend hours interphase accounts total time involved cell division interphase includes g g phases mitosis cytokinesis however separate interphase
interphase within sequences cellular processes
interphase cell cycle
g completed cell enters relatively brief period nuclear cellular division composed mitosis cytokinesis respectively successful completion mitosis cytokinesis resulting daughter cells reenter g interphase
cell cycle interphase preceded telophase cytokinesis m phase alternative fashion interphase sometimes interrupted g phase circumstances may end followed remaining stages interphase successful completion g checkpoint final checkpoint interphase cell proceeds prophase plants preprophase first stage mitosis
g phase viewed either extended g phase cell neither dividing preparing divide distinct quiescent stage occurs outside cell cycle

gamete production interphase succeeded meiosis programmed cell death interphase followed preempted apoptosis
