== reception ==
the game received generally positive reviews with the general consensus being that the advertisement of los angeles being one big level as opposed to the previous games series of levels was a false disappointment since the one level was a series of levels accessible from one another via bland corridors that simply masked the necessary loading times jeff gerstmann of gamespot took note of how shocking easy the game was compared to previous entries in the series and how most of the game feels like a tutorial adding that the game really seems bent on holding your hand every step of the way. although others have viewed this in a light that showcased the game's hefty amount of possibilities tricks and techniques that the player character can perform in comparison to previous games many critics also noted the general lack of evolution in the series although many saw this as a good thing since the original gameplay was so popular to begin with and didn't need unnecessary tampering
many critics praised the game on its story chris roper of ign praised neversoft's decision to go back to its roots and make a game about skating as opposed to the chaos and destruction of the underground games. jeff gerstmann of gamespot stated the saving grace of the story mode is that the story it tells is actually pretty good it follows the standard ragtag group of misfits struggles to save the place they call home from evil real estate moguls plot that drove such classic films as breakin 2 electric boogaloo. adding that along the way the characters become a little endearing
