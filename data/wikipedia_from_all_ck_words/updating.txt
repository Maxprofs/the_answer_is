ochthoeca is a genus of birds in the tyrannidae family
in recent times it has usually contained the following species
brown-backed chat-tyrant ochthoeca fumicolor
white-browed chat-tyrant ochthoeca leucophrys
piura chat-tyrant ochthoeca piurae
d'orbigny's chat-tyrant ochthoeca oenanthoides
rufous-breasted chat-tyrant ochthoeca rufipectoralis
slaty-backed chat-tyrant ochthoeca cinnamomeiventris
maroon-belted chat-tyrant ochthoeca cinnamomeiventris thoracica
crowned chat-tyrant ochthoeca frontalis
kalinowski's chat-tyrant ochthoeca frontalis spodionota
jelski's chat-tyrant ochthoeca jelskii
yellow-bellied chat-tyrant ochthoeca diadema
golden-browed chat-tyrant ochthoeca pulchella
but it has turned out that the last three which some had considered to belong in silvicultrix may form a distinct genus however they are anatomically very similar and the genetic data may to be inconsistent so the question is not fully resolved
