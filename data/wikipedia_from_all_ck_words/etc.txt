the tour kicked off in hiroshima japan on april 9 2005 and ended vancouver canada on september 10
regardless destiny's child embarked on this world tour sponsored by mcdonald's corporation and performed hits such as no no no survivor say my name independent women and lose my breath in addition to renditions of the group's recorded material they also performed songs from each singer's solo careers most notably numbers from beyonc's debut album dangerously in love the stage design afforded 360 degree viewing within the typical arena show venue several interludes by the show's dancers allowed for the expected costume changes those costumes often glittering gowns were designed by tina knowles beyonc's mother and manufactured by house of deron a special set of outfits were designed as a tribute to the broadway musical dreamgirls hinting at the play's one night only (disco) scene where deena jones & the dreams wear the same color pants suits
=== split-up announcementedit ===
during the last stop of their european tour in barcelona on june 11 2005 kelly rowland suddenly announced this is the last time you would see us on stage as destiny's child
the announcement was surprising not least because the trio had downplayed rumors of a split in the wake of knowles success although prior plans had called for the members to focus on solo projects at the end of the tour
