much current research early st century optical microscope techniques focused development superresolution analysis fluorescently labeled samples structured illumination improve resolution around two four times techniques like stimulated emission depletion microscopy approaching resolution electron microscopes
types
microscopes separated several different classes one grouping based interacts sample generate image ie light photons optical microscopes electrons electron microscopes probe scanning probe microscopes alternatively microscopes classed whether analyse sample via scanning point confocal optical microscopes scanning electron microscopes scanning probe microscopes analyse sample wide field optical microscope transmission electron microscopes
wide field optical microscopes transmission electron microscopes use theory lenses optics light microscopes electromagnet lenses electron microscopes order magnify image generated passage wave transmitted sample reflected sample waves used electromagnetic optical microscopes electron beams electron microscopes resolution microscopes limited wavelength radiation used image sample shorter wavelengths allow higher resolution
scanning optical electron microscopes like confocal microscope scanning electron microscope use lenses focus spot light electrons onto sample analyze reflected transmitted waves point scanned sample analyze rectangular region magnification image achieved displaying data scanning physically small sample area relatively large screen microscopes resolution limit wide field optical probe electron microscopes

ultraviolet light enables resolution microscopic features well image samples transparent eye near infrared light used visualize circuitry embedded bonded silicon devices since silicon transparent region wavelengths
fluorescence microscopy many wavelengths light ranging ultraviolet visible used cause samples fluoresce allow viewing eye use specifically sensitive cameras
phase contrast microscopy optical microscopy illumination technique small phase shifts light passing transparent specimen converted amplitude contrast changes image use phase contrast require staining view slide microscope technique made possible study cell cycle live cells
traditional optical microscope recently evolved digital microscope addition instead directly viewing object eyepieces type sensor similar used digital camera used obtain image displayed computer monitor sensors may use cmos chargecoupled device ccd technology depending application
