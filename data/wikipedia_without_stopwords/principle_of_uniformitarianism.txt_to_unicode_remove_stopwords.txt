lyells uniformitarianism
according reijer hooykaas lyells uniformitarianism family four related propositions single idea
uniformity law laws nature constant across time space
uniformity methodology appropriate hypotheses explaining geological past analogy today
uniformity kind past present causes kind energy produce effects
uniformity degree geological circumstances remained time
none connotations requires another equally inferred uniformitarians
gould explained lyells propositions times arrow times cycle stating lyell conflated two different types propositions pair methodological assumptions pair substantive hypotheses four together make lyells uniformitarianism
methodological assumptions
two methodological assumptions accepted true majority scientists geologists gould claims philosophical propositions must assumed proceed scientist science cannot go rocky outcrop observe either constancy natures laws working unknown processes works way around first assume propositions go crop rock
uniformity law across time space natural laws constant across space time
axiom uniformity law necessary order scientists extrapolate inductive inference unobservable past constancy natural laws must assumed study past else cannot meaningfully study
uniformity process across time space natural processes constant across time space
though similar uniformity law second priori assumption shared vast majority scientists deals geological causes physicochemical laws past explained processes acting currently time space rather inventing extra esoteric unknown processes without good reason otherwise known parsimony occams razor
substantive hypotheses
substantive hypotheses controversial cases accepted hypotheses judged true false empirical grounds scientific observation repeated experimental data contrast previous two philosophical assumptions come one science cannot tested falsified science
uniformity rate across time space change typically slow steady gradual
uniformity rate gradualism people including geologists think hear word uniformitarianism confusing hypothesis entire definition late lemon textbook stratigraphy affirmed uniformitarian view earth history held geologic processes proceed continuously slow pace
gould explained huttons view uniformity rate mountain ranges grand canyons built accumulation nearly insensible changes added vast time major events floods earthquakes eruptions occur catastrophes strictly local neither occurred past shall happen future greater frequency extent display present particular whole earth never convulsed
uniformity state across time space change evenly distributed throughout space time
uniformity state hypothesis implies throughout history earth progress inexorable direction planet almost always looked behaved change continuous leads nowhere earth balance dynamic steady state
th century
stephen jay goulds first scientific paper uniformitarianism necessary reduced four interpretations two dismissed first principle asserted spatial temporal invariance natural laws longer issue debate rejected third uniformity rate unjustified limitation scientific inquiry constrains past geologic rates conditions present lyellian uniformitarianism unnecessary
modern uniformitarianism includes periodic catastrophes
uniformitarianism originally proposed contrast catastrophism states distant past consisted epochs paroxysmal catastrophic action interposed periods comparative tranquility especially late th early th centuries geologists took interpretation mean catastrophic events important geologic time one example debate formation channeled scablands due catastrophic missoula glacial outburst floods important result debate others reclarification principles operate geologic time catastrophic events infrequent human timescales important consequences geologic history derek ager noted geologists deny uniformitarianism true sense say interpreting past means processes seen going present day long remember periodic catastrophe one processes periodic catastrophes make showing stratigraphical record hitherto assumed
even charles lyell thought ordinary geological processes would cause niagara falls move upstream lake erie within years leading catastrophic flooding large part north america
modern geologists apply uniformitarianism way lyell question rates processes uniform time values measured history geology accepted present may long enough key penetrate deep lock past geologic processes may active different rates past humans observed force popularity uniformity rate persisted present day century lyells rhetoric conflating axiom hypotheses descended unmodified form many geologists stifled belief proper methodology includes priori commitment gradual change preference explaining largescale phenomena concatenation innumerable tiny changes
current consensus earths history slow gradual process punctuated occasional natural catastrophic events affected earth inhabitants practice reduced lyells conflation simply two philosophical assumptions also known principle geological actualism states past geological action like present geological action principle actualism cornerstone paleoecology
