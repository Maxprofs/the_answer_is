north is a noun adjective or adverb indicating direction or geography north is one of the four cardinal directions or compass points it is the opposite of south and is perpendicular to east and west
== etymology ==
the word north is related to the old high german nord both descending from the proto-indo-european unit ner- meaning down (or under") (presumably a natural primitive description of its concept is to the left of the rising sun".)
the latin word borealis comes from the greek boreas north wind north which according to ovid was personified as the son of the river-god strymon the father of calais and zetes septentrionalis is from septentriones the seven plow oxen a name of ursa maior the greek arktikos is named for the same constellation and is the derivation of the english word arctic
other languages have sometimes more interesting derivations for example in lezgian kefer can mean both disbelief and north since to the north of the muslim lezgian homeland there are areas formerly inhabited by non-muslim caucasian and turkic peoples in many languages of mesoamerica north also means up in hungarian the word for north is szak which is derived from jszaka ("night") since above the tropic of cancer the sun never shines from the north
== mapping ==
by convention the top side of a map is often north
to go north using a compass for navigation set a bearing or azimuth of 0 or 360
north is specifically the direction that in western culture is treated as the fundamental direction
north is used (explicitly or implicitly) to define all other directions
the (visual) top edges of maps usually correspond to the northern edge of the area represented unless explicitly stated otherwise or landmarks are considered more useful for that territory than specific directions
on any rotating non-astronomical object north denotes the side appearing to rotate counter-clockwise when viewed from afar along the axis of rotation
== magnetic north and declination ==
magnetic north is of interest because it is the direction indicated as north on a properly functioning (but uncorrected) magnetic compass the difference between it and true north is called the magnetic declination (or simply the declination where the context is clear) for many purposes and physical circumstances the error in direction that results from ignoring the distinction is tolerable in others a mental or instrument compensation based on assumed knowledge of the applicable declination can solve all the problems but simple generalizations on the subject should be treated as unsound and as likely to reflect popular misconceptions about terrestrial magnetism
maps intended for usage in orienteering by compass will clearly indicate the local declination for easy correction to true north maps may also indicate grid north which is a navigational term referring to the direction northwards along the grid lines of a map projection
== roles of north as prime direction ==
the visible rotation of the night sky around the visible celestial pole provides a vivid metaphor of that direction corresponding to up thus the choice of the north as corresponding to up in the northern hemisphere or of south in that role in the southern is prior to world-wide communication anything but an arbitrary one on the contrary it is of interest that chinese and islamic culture even considered south as the proper top end for maps
in western culture
maps tend to be drawn for viewing with either true north or magnetic north at the top
globes of the earth have the north pole at the top or if the earth's axis is represented as inclined from vertical (normally by the angle it has relative to the axis of the earth's orbit) in the top half
maps are usually labelled to indicate which direction on the map corresponds to a direction on the earth
usually with a single arrow oriented to the map's representation of true north
occasionally with a single arrow oriented to the map's representation of magnetic north or two arrows oriented to true and magnetic north respectively
occasionally with a compass rose but if so usually on a map with north at the top and usually with north decorated more prominently than any other compass point
up is a metaphor for north the notion that north should always be up and east at the right was established by the greek astronomer ptolemy the historian daniel boorstin suggests that perhaps this was because the better-known places in his world were in the northern hemisphere and on a flat map these were most convenient for study if they were in the upper right-hand corner
== roles of east and west as inherently subsidiary directions ==
while the choice of north over south as prime direction reflects quite arbitrary historical factors east and west are not nearly as natural alternatives as first glance might suggest their folk definitions are respectively where the sun rises and where it sets except on the equator however these definitions taken together would imply that
east and west would not be 180 degrees apart but instead would differ from that by up to twice the degrees of latitude of the location in question and
they would each move slightly from day to day and in the temperate zones markedly over the course of the year
reasonably accurate folk astronomy such as is usually attributed to stone age peoples or later celts would arrive at east and west by noting the directions of rising and setting (preferably more than once each) and choosing as prime direction one of the two mutually opposite directions that lie halfway between those two the true folk-astronomical definitions of east and west are the directions a right angle from the prime direction that are closest to the rising and setting respectively of the sun (or moon)
== cultural references ==
being the default direction on the compass north is referred to frequently in western popular culture some examples include
the phrase north of x is often used by americans to mean more than x or greater than x i.e the world population is north of 7 billion people or north of 40 [years old]
