history
population dynamics traditionally dominant branch mathematical biology history years although recently scope mathematical biology greatly expanded first principle population dynamics widely regarded exponential law malthus modeled malthusian growth model early period dominated demographic studies work benjamin gompertz pierre franois verhulst early th century refined adjusted malthusian demographic model
general model formulation proposed fj richards expanded simon hopkins models gompertz verhulst also ludwig von bertalanffy covered special cases general formulation lotkavolterra predatorprey equations another famous example well alternative arditiginzburg equations computer game simcity mmorpg ultima online among others tried simulate population dynamics
past years population dynamics complemented evolutionary game theory developed first john maynard smith dynamics evolutionary biology concepts may take deterministic mathematical form population dynamics overlap another active area research mathematical biology mathematical epidemiology study infectious disease affecting populations various models viral spread proposed analyzed provide important results may applied health policy decisions
intrinsic rate increase
rate population increases size densitydependent forces regulating population known intrinsic rate increase
rate increase population n population size r intrinsic rate increase therefore theoretical maximum rate increase population per individual concept commonly used insect population biology determine environmental factors affect rate pest populations increase see also exponential population growth logistic population growth
common mathematical models
exponential population growth
exponential growth describes unregulated reproduction unusual see nature last years human population growth appeared exponential long run however likely paul ehrlich thomas malthus believed human population growth would lead overpopulation starvation due scarcity resources believed human population would grow rate exceed ability humans find food future humans would unable feed large populations biological assumptions exponential growth per capita growth rate constant growth limited resource scarcity predation
simple discrete time exponential model
discretetime per capita growth rate get linear line discretetime per capita growth rate zero get decrease per capita growth rate get increase per capita growth rate get extinction species
continuous time version exponential growth
species continuous reproduction
rate population growth per unit time r maximum per capita growth rate n population size
r increase per capita growth rate r per capita growth rate zero r decrease per capita growth rate
logistic population growth
logistics comes french word logistique means compute population regulation densitydependent process meaning population growth rates regulated density population think analogy thermostat temperature hot thermostat turns ac decrease temperature back homeostasis temperature cold thermostat turns heater increase temperature back homeostasis likewise density dependence whether population density high low population dynamics returns population density homeostasis homeostasis set point carrying capacity defined k
continuoustime model logistic growth
density dependence n number population k set point homeostasis carrying capacity logistic model population growth rate highest k population growth rate zero around k optimum harvesting rate close rate k population grow fastest k population growth rate negative logistic models also shows density dependence meaning per capita population growth rates decline population density increases wild cant get pattern emerge without simplification negative density dependence allows population overshoots carrying capacity decrease back carrying capacity k
according rkselectiontheory organisms may specialised rapid growth stability closer carrying capacity
discrete time logistical model
equation uses r instead per capita growth rate zero r r gets high oscillations deterministic chaos deterministic chaos large changes population dynamics small r makes hard make predictions high r values small r error results massive error population dynamics
population always density dependent even severe density independent event cannot regulate populate although may cause go extinct
population models necessarily negative density dependent allee effect allows positive correlation population density per capita growth rate communities small populations example fish swimming likely eaten fish swimming among school fish pattern movement school fish likely confuse stun predator
examples individualbased models
fisheries wildlife management
fisheries wildlife management population affected three dynamic rate functions
natality birth rate often recruitment means reaching certain size reproductive stage usually refers age fish caught counted nets
population growth rate measures growth individuals size length important fisheries population often measured biomass
mortality includes harvest mortality natural mortality natural mortality includes nonhuman predation disease old age
n number individuals time
n number individuals time b number individuals born d number died number immigrated e number emigrated time time
measure rates many time intervals determine populations density changes time immigration emigration present usually measured
measured determine harvestable surplus number individuals harvested population without affecting longterm population stability average population size harvest within harvestable surplus termed compensatory mortality harvest deaths substituted deaths would occurred naturally harvest level termed additive mortality adds number deaths would occurred naturally terms necessarily judged good bad respectively population management example fish game agency might aim reduce size deer population additive mortality bucks might targeted increase buck competition might targeted reduce reproduction thus overall population size
