metric prefix unit prefix precedes basic unit measure indicate multiple fraction unit metric prefixes common use today decadic historically number binary metric prefixes well prefix unique symbol prepended unit symbol prefix kilo example may added gram indicate multiplication one thousand one kilogram equal one thousand grams prefix milli likewise may added metre indicate division one thousand one millimetre equal one thousandth metre
decimal multiplicative prefixes feature forms metric system six dating back systems introduction metric prefixes even prepended nonmetric units si prefixes standardized use international system units si international bureau weights measures bipm resolutions dating since formed part international system quantities
list si prefixes
bipm specifies twenty prefixes international system units si
metric system introduced several metric prefixes however six adopted si prefixes th cgpm conference whereas myria well double demi adopted micro mega recommended british association advancement science dates relate recognition resolution cgpm
prefix name symbol used combination symbols units measure example symbol kilo k used produce km kg kw kilometre kilogram kilowatt respectively
prefixes may used combination also applies mass si base unit kilogram already contains prefix example milligram mg used instead microkilogram kg
arithmetic measurements prefixed units prefixes must expanded numeric multiplier except adding subtracting values identical units hence mv ma v w w
prefixes corresponding integer power one thousand generally preferred hence m preferred hm hectometre dam decametres prefixes hecto deca deci centi commonly used everyday purposes especially centimetre cm common however modern building codes require millimetre used preference centimetre use centimetres leads extensive usage decimal points confusion
units occur exponentiation example square cubic forms multiplication prefix must considered part unit thus included exponentiation
km means one square kilometre area square m m square metres
mm means two cubic megametres volume two cubes m m m m cubic metres m
examples
cm m m m
km m m m m m

application units measurement
use prefixes traced back introduction metric system long introduction si prefixes including introduced used metric unit whether officially included si eg millidynes milligauss metric prefixes may also used nonmetric units
choice prefixes given unit usually dictated convenience use unit prefixes amounts much larger smaller actually encountered seldom used though remain valid combinations contexts common combinations established standard
mass
kilogram gram milligram microgram smaller fairly common however megagram gigagram teragram etc rarely used tonnes kilotonnes megatonnes etc scientific notation used instead megagram occasionally used disambiguate metric tonne various nonmetric tons exception pollution emission rates typically order tgyr sometimes one element denoted emission tg cyr tg nyr intercomparisons different compounds easier
volume
litre millilitre equal cubic centimetre microlitre smaller common europe centilitre often used packaged products decilitre less frequently latter two items include prefixes corresponding exponent divisible three
larger volumes usually denoted kilolitres megalitres gigalitres else cubic metres cubic metre kilolitre cubic kilometres cubic kilometre teralitre
length
kilometre metre centimetre millimetre smaller common however decimetre rarely used micrometre often referred nonsi term micron fields chemistry angstrom equal nm historically competed nanometre femtometre used mainly particle physics usually called fermi large scales megametre gigametre larger rarely used instead nonmetric units used astronomical units light years parsecs astronomical unit mentioned si standards accepted nonsi unit
time angles
second millisecond microsecond shorter common kilosecond megasecond also use though longer times one usually uses either scientific notation minutes hours
official policies use prefixes vary slightly bureau international des poids et mesures bipm american national institute standards technology nist policies bodies variance everyday practice instance nist advises avoid confusion prefix symbols prefixes used timerelated unit symbols names min minute h hour d day anglerelated symbols names degree minute second
bipms position use si prefixes units time larger second nist position regard angles differs state however astronomers use milliarcsecond denote mas microarcsecond use units measuring small angles
temperature
official policy also varies common practice degree celsius c nist states prefix symbols may used unit symbol c prefixes may used unit name degree celsius example mc millidegrees celsius acceptable practice common prefixes used kelvin desirable denote extremely large small absolute temperatures temperature differences thus temperatures star interiors may given units mk megakelvins molecular cooling may described mk millikelvins
energy
exist number definitions nonsi unit calorie gram calories kilogram calories one kilogram calorie equals one thousand gram calories often appears capitalized without prefix ie cal referring dietary calories food common apply metric prefixes gram calorie kilogram calorie thus example kcal cal cal
nonmetric units
metric prefixes widely used outside system metric units common examples include megabyte decibel metric prefixes rarely appear imperial us units except special cases eg microinch kilofoot kilopound kip also used specialized units used particular fields eg megaelectronvolt gigaparsec millibarn also occasionally used currency units eg gigadollar mainly people familiar prefixes scientific usage
presentation
pronunciation
prefix giga usually pronounced sometimes d according american writer kevin self german committee member international electrotechnical commission proposed giga prefix drawing verse humorous poet christian morgenstern appeared third edition galgenlieder gallows songs suggests hard german g originally intended pronunciation self unable ascertain d soft g pronunciation accepted current practice returned hard g
si prefix affixed root word prefix carries stress root drops stress retains full vowel syllable stressed root word stands alone example gigabyte bat stress first syllable however words common use outside scientific community may follow idiosyncratic stress rules english speaking countries kilometre often pronounced klmtr reduced vowels syllables metre

obsolete metric prefixes
prefixes formerly used metric system fallen disuse adopted si decimal prefix myria sometimes also written myrio ten thousand well binary prefixes double demi denoting factor one half respectively parts original metric system adopted france retained si prefixes internationally adopted th cgpm conference halving doubling prefixes dropped neither decimal symmetrical
double prefixes
double prefixes used past micromillimetres millimicrons nanometres micromicrofarads picofarads kilomegatons gigatons hectokilometres kilometres derived adjective hectokilometric typically used qualifying fuel consumption measures disallowed introduction si
obsolete double prefixes included decimilli contracted dimi standardized france
hella prefix proposal
uc davis student austin sendek started petition designate hella si prefix one octillion petition gathered supporters circulating facebook receiving significant amount media coverage although consultative committee units considered proposal ultimately rejected however hella adopted certain websites google calculator wolfram alpha
x w v
brian c lacki follows z y adopted prefixes x w v mean respectively thus continuing inverse alphabetical order
similar symbols abbreviations
written english symbol k often used informally mean multiple thousand many contexts example one may talk k salary call year problem yk problem cases uppercase k often used informal postfix read spoken thousand grand k never kilo despite origin letter
financial general news media mostly use mm bb tt abbreviations million billion trillion large quantities typically currency population
medical automotive fields united states use abbreviations cc ccm cubic centimetres cubic centimetre equivalent millilitre nations use millilitres preference cubic centimetres
nearly century electrical construction industry used abbreviation mcm designate thousand circular mils specifying thicknesses large electrical cables since mids kcmil adopted official designation thousand circular mils designation mcm still remains wide use similar system used natural gas sales united states m m thousands mm mm millions british thermal units therms oil industry mmbbl symbol millions barrels
binary prefixes
fields information technology common designate nondecimal multiples based powers rather si prefixes kilo mega giga contrary definitions international system units si practice sanctioned industry associations including jedec international electrotechnical commission iec standardized system binary prefixes kibi mebi gibi etc purpose
