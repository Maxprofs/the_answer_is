in volcanology a lava dome or volcanic dome is a roughly circular mound-shaped protrusion resulting from the slow extrusion of viscous lava from a volcano the geochemistry of lava domes can vary from basalt to rhyolite although most preserved domes tend to have high silica content the characteristic dome shape is attributed to high viscosity that prevents the lava from flowing very far this high viscosity can be obtained in two ways by high levels of silica in the magma or by degassing of fluid magma since viscous basaltic and andesitic domes weather fast and easily break apart by further input of fluid lava most of the preserved domes have high silica content and consist of rhyolite or dacite
existence of lava domes was also suggested for some domical structures on the martian surface in the western western part of arcadia planitia and within terra sirenum
== dome dynamicsedit ==
lava domes evolve unpredictably due to non-linear dynamics caused by crystallization and outgassing of the highly viscous lava in the dome's conduit domes undergo various processes such as growth collapse solidification and erosion
lava domes grow by endogenic dome growth or exogenic dome growth the former implies dome interior expansion to accommodate new lava and the latter refers to superficial piling up of lava it is the high viscosity of the lava that prevents it from flowing far from the vent from which it extrudes creating a dome-like shape of sticky lava that then cools slowly in situ domes may reach heights of several hundred meters and can grow slowly and steadily for months (e.g unzen volcano) years (e.g soufrire hills volcano) or even centuries (e.g mount merapi volcano) the sides of these structures are composed of unstable rock debris due to the intermittent buildup of gas pressure erupting domes can often experience episodes of explosive eruption over time if part of a lava dome collapses while it is still molten it can produce pyroclastic flows one of the most lethal forms of volcanic event other hazards associated with lava domes are the destruction of property forest fires and lahars triggered by pyroclastic flows near mud snow and ice lava domes are one of the principal structural features of many stratovolcanoes worldwide lava domes are prone to unusually dangerous explosions since they contain rhyolitic silica-rich lava
characteristics of lava dome eruptions include shallow long-period and hybrid seismicity which is attributed to excess fluid pressures in the contributing vent chamber other characteristics of lava domes include their hemispherical dome shape cycles of dome growth over long periods and sudden onsets of violent explosive activity the average rate of dome growth may be used as a rough indicator of magma supply but it shows no systematic relationship to the timing or characteristics of lava dome explosions

=== cryptodomesedit ===
a cryptodome (from greek  kryptos hidden secret") is a dome-shaped structure created by accumulation of viscous magma at a shallow depth one example of a cryptodome was in the may 1980 eruption of mount st helens where the explosive eruption began after a landslide caused the side of the volcano to fall leading to explosive decompression of the subterranean cryptodome
=== lava coulesedit ===
coules (or coulees) are lava domes that have experienced some flow away from their original position thus resembling both lava domes and lava flows
the world's largest known dacite flow is the chao dacite dome complex a huge coule flow-dome between two volcanoes in northern chile this flow is over 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) long has obvious flow features like pressure ridges and a flow front 400 metres (1,300 ft) tall (the dark scalloped line at lower left) there is another prominent coule flow on the flank of llullaillaco volcano in argentina and other examples in the andes
