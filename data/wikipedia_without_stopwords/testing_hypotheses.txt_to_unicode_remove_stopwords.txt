statistical hypothesis hypothesis testable basis observing process modeled via set random variables statistical hypothesis test method statistical inference commonly two statistical data sets compared data set obtained sampling compared synthetic data set idealized model hypothesis proposed statistical relationship two data sets compared alternative idealized null hypothesis proposes relationship two data sets comparison deemed statistically significant relationship data sets would unlikely realization null hypothesis according threshold probabilitythe significance level hypothesis tests used determining outcomes study would lead rejection null hypothesis prespecified level significance process distinguishing null hypothesis alternative hypothesis aided identifying two conceptual types errors type type specifying parametric limits eg much type error permitted
alternative framework statistical hypothesis testing specify set statistical models one candidate hypothesis use model selection techniques choose appropriate model common selection techniques based either akaike information criterion bayes factor
statistical hypothesis testing sometimes called confirmatory data analysis contrasted exploratory data analysis may prespecified hypotheses
variations subclasses
statistical hypothesis testing key technique frequentist inference bayesian inference although two types inference notable differences statistical hypothesis tests define procedure controls fixes probability incorrectly deciding default position null hypothesis incorrect procedure based likely would set observations occur null hypothesis true note probability making incorrect decision probability null hypothesis true whether specific alternative hypothesis true contrasts possible techniques decision theory null alternative hypothesis treated equal basis
one naive bayesian approach hypothesis testing base decisions posterior probability fails comparing point continuous hypotheses approaches decision making bayesian decision theory attempt balance consequences incorrect decisions across possibilities rather concentrating single null hypothesis number approaches reaching decision based data available via decision theory optimal decisions desirable properties hypothesis testing though dominant approach data analysis many fields science extensions theory hypothesis testing include study power tests ie probability correctly rejecting null hypothesis given false considerations used purpose sample size determination prior collection data
testing process
statistics literature statistical hypothesis testing plays fundamental role usual line reasoning follows
initial research hypothesis truth unknown
first step state relevant null alternative hypotheses important misstating hypotheses muddy rest process
second step consider statistical assumptions made sample test example assumptions statistical independence form distributions observations equally important invalid assumptions mean results test invalid
decide test appropriate state relevant test statistic
derive distribution test statistic null hypothesis assumptions standard cases wellknown result example test statistic might follow students distribution normal distribution
select significance level probability threshold null hypothesis rejected common values
distribution test statistic null hypothesis partitions possible values null hypothesis rejectedthe socalled critical regionand probability critical region
compute observations observed value tobs test statistic
decide either reject null hypothesis favor alternative reject decision rule reject null hypothesis h observed value tobs critical region accept fail reject hypothesis otherwise
alternative process commonly used
compute observations observed value tobs test statistic
calculate pvalue probability null hypothesis sampling test statistic least extreme observed
reject null hypothesis favor alternative hypothesis pvalue less significance level selected probability threshold
two processes equivalent former process advantageous past tables test statistics common probability thresholds available allowed decision made without calculation probability adequate classwork operational use deficient reporting results
latter process relied extensive tables computational support always available explicit calculation probability useful reporting calculations trivially performed appropriate software
difference two processes applied radioactive suitcase example
geigercounter reading limit check suitcase
geigercounter reading high safe suitcases lower readings limit check suitcase
former report adequate latter gives detailed explanation data reason suitcase checked
important note difference accepting null hypothesis simply failing reject fail reject terminology highlights fact null hypothesis assumed true start test lack evidence simply continues assumed true phrase accept null hypothesis may suggest proved simply disproved logical fallacy known argument ignorance unless test particularly high power used idea accepting null hypothesis may dangerous nonetheless terminology prevalent throughout statistics meaning well understood
processes described perfectly adequate computation seriously neglect design experiments considerations
particularly critical appropriate sample sizes estimated conducting experiment
phrase test significance coined statistician ronald fisher
interpretation
pvalue less required significance level equivalently observed test statistic critical region say null hypothesis rejected given level significance rejection null hypothesis conclusion like guilty verdict criminal trial evidence sufficient reject innocence thus proving guilt might accept alternative hypothesis research hypothesis
pvalue less required significance level equivalently observed test statistic outside critical region test result evidence insufficient support conclusion like jury fails reach verdict researcher typically gives extra consideration cases pvalue close significance level
lady tasting tea example fisher required lady properly categorize cups tea justify conclusion result unlikely result chance defined critical region case alone region defined probability null hypothesis correct less
whether rejection null hypothesis truly justifies acceptance research hypothesis depends structure hypotheses rejecting hypothesis large paw print originated bear immediately prove existence bigfoot hypothesis testing emphasizes rejection based probability rather acceptance requires extra steps logic
probability rejecting null hypothesis function five factors whether test one two tailed level significance standard deviation amount deviation null hypothesis number observations factors source criticism factors control experimenteranalyst give results appearance subjectivity
use importance
statistics helpful analyzing collections data equally true hypothesis testing justify conclusions even scientific theory exists lady tasting tea example obvious difference existed milk poured tea tea poured milk data contradicted obvious
real world applications hypothesis testing include
testing whether men women suffer nightmares
establishing authorship documents
evaluating effect full moon behavior
determining range bat detect insect echo
deciding whether hospital carpeting results infections
selecting best means stop smoking
checking whether bumper stickers reflect car owner behavior
testing claims handwriting analysts
statistical hypothesis testing plays important role whole statistics statistical inference example lehmann review fundamental paper neyman pearson says nevertheless despite shortcomings new paradigm formulated paper many developments carried within framework continue play central role theory practice statistics expected foreseeable future
significance testing favored statistical tool experimental social sciences articles journal applied psychology early fields favored estimation parameters eg effect size significance testing used substitute traditional comparison predicted value experimental result core scientific method theory capable predicting sign relationship directional onesided hypothesis test configured statistically significant result supports theory form theory appraisal heavily criticized application hypothesis testing
cautions
government required statistical procedures carry warning labels like drugs inference methods would long labels indeed caution applies hypothesis tests alternatives
successful hypothesis test associated probability typei error rate conclusion might wrong
conclusion test solid sample upon based design experiment critical number unexpected effects observed including
clever hans effect horse appeared capable simple arithmetic
hawthorne effect industrial workers productive better illumination productive worse
placebo effect pills medically active ingredients remarkably effective
statistical analysis misleading data produces misleading conclusions issue data quality subtle forecasting example agreement measure forecast accuracy absence consensus measurement decision based measurements without controversy
book lie statistics popular book statistics ever published much consider hypothesis testing cautions applicable including many claims made basis samples small convince report mention sample size doubtful
hypothesis testing acts filter statistical conclusions results meeting probability threshold publishable economics also acts publication filter results favorable author funding source may submitted publication impact filtering publication termed publication bias related problem multiple testing sometimes linked data mining variety tests variety possible effects applied single data set yielding significant result reported often dealt using multiplicity correction procedures control family wise error rate fwer false discovery rate fdr
making critical decisions based results hypothesis test prudent look details rather conclusion alone physical sciences results fully accepted independently confirmed general advice concerning statistics figures never lie liars figure anonymous
examples
lady tasting tea
famous example hypothesis testing known lady tasting tea female colleague fisher claimed able tell whether tea milk added first cup fisher proposed give eight cups four variety random order one could ask probability getting number got correct chance null hypothesis lady ability test statistic simple count number successes selecting cups critical region single case successes possible based conventional probability criterion fisher asserted alternative hypothesis ever required lady correctly identified every cup would considered statistically significant result
courtroom trial
statistical test procedure comparable criminal trial defendant considered guilty long guilt proven prosecutor tries prove guilt defendant enough charging evidence defendant convicted
start procedure two hypotheses defendant guilty defendant guilty first one called null hypothesis time accepted second one called alternative hypothesis hypothesis one hopes support
hypothesis innocence rejected error unlikely one doesnt want convict innocent defendant error called error first kind ie conviction innocent person occurrence error controlled rare consequence asymmetric behaviour error second kind acquitting person committed crime often rather large
criminal trial regarded either two decision processes guilty vs guilty evidence vs threshold beyond reasonable doubt one view defendant judged view performance prosecution bears burden proof judged hypothesis test regarded either judgment hypothesis judgment evidence
philosophers beans
following example produced philosopher describing scientific methods generations hypothesis testing formalized popularized
beans handful white
beans bag white
therefore probably beans taken another bag
hypothetical inference
beans bag population handful sample null hypothesis sample originated population criterion rejecting nullhypothesis obvious difference appearance informal difference mean interesting result consideration real population real sample produced imaginary bag philosopher considering logic rather probability real statistical hypothesis test example requires formalities probability calculation comparison probability standard
simple generalization example considers mixed bag beans handful contain either many white beans generalization considers extremes requires calculations comparisons arrive formal answer core philosophy unchanged composition handful greatly different bag sample probably originated another bag original example termed onesided onetailed test generalization termed twosided twotailed test
statement also relies inference sampling random someone picking bag find white beans would explain handful many white beans also explain number white beans bag depleted although bag probably intended assumed much larger ones hand
clairvoyant card game
person subject tested clairvoyance shown reverse randomly chosen playing card times asked four suits belongs number hits correct answers called x

null hypothesis valid thing test person guess every card probability relative frequency single suit appearing alternative valid test subject predict suit correctly probability greater call probability guessing correctly p hypotheses
null hypothesis guessing
alternative hypothesis true clairvoyant
test subject correctly predicts cards consider clairvoyant reject null hypothesis thus also hits hits hand cause consider hits hits critical number c hits point consider subject clairvoyant determine critical value c obvious choice c ie accept clairvoyance cards predicted correctly critical c first case almost test subjects recognized clairvoyant second case certain number pass test practice one decides critical one one decides often one accepts error first kind false positive type error c probability error

radioactive suitcase
example consider determining whether suitcase contains radioactive material placed geiger counter produces counts per minute null hypothesis radioactive material suitcase measured counts due ambient radioactivity typical surrounding air harmless objects calculate likely would observe counts per minute null hypothesis true null hypothesis predicts say average counts per minute according poisson distribution typical radioactive decay chance recording counts thus say suitcase compatible null hypothesis guarantee radioactive material dont enough evidence suggest hand null hypothesis predicts counts per minute poisson distribution predicts chance recording counts suitcase compatible null hypothesis likely factors responsible produce measurements
test directly assert presence radioactive material successful test asserts claim radioactive material present unlikely given reading therefore double negative disproving null hypothesis method confusing using counterexample disprove standard mathematical practice attraction method practicality know experience expected range counts ambient radioactivity present say measurement unusually large statistics formalizes intuitive using numbers instead adjectives probably know characteristics radioactive suitcases assume produce larger readings

origins early controversy
significance testing largely product karl pearson pvalue pearsons chisquared test william sealy gosset students tdistribution ronald fisher null hypothesis analysis variance significance test hypothesis testing developed jerzy neyman egon pearson son karl ronald fisher began life statistics bayesian zabell fisher soon grew disenchanted subjectivity involved namely use principle indifference determining prior probabilities sought provide objective approach inductive inference
fisher agricultural statistician emphasized rigorous experimental design methods extract result samples assuming gaussian distributions neyman teamed younger pearson emphasized mathematical rigor methods obtain results many samples wider range distributions modern hypothesis testing inconsistent hybrid fisher vs neymanpearson formulation methods terminology developed early th century hypothesis testing popularized early th century evidence use found much earlier laplace considered statistics almost half million births statistics showed excess boys compared girls concluded calculation pvalue excess real unexplained effect
fisher popularized significance test required nullhypothesis corresponding population frequency distribution sample familiar calculations determined whether reject nullhypothesis significance testing utilize alternative hypothesis concept type ii error
pvalue devised informal objective index meant help researcher determine based knowledge whether modify future experiments strengthen ones faith null hypothesis hypothesis testing type iii errors devised neyman pearson objective alternative fishers pvalue also meant determine researcher behaviour without requiring inductive inference researcher
neyman pearson considered different problem called hypothesis testing initially considered two simple hypotheses frequency distributions calculated two probabilities typically selected hypothesis associated higher probability hypothesis likely generated sample method always selected hypothesis also allowed calculation types error probabilities
fisher neymanpearson clashed bitterly neymanpearson considered formulation improved generalization significance testingthe defining paper abstract mathematicians generalized refined theory decades fisher thought applicable scientific research often course experiment discovered initial assumptions null hypothesis questionable due unexpected sources error believed use rigid rejectaccept decisions based models formulated data collected incompatible common scenario faced scientists attempts apply method scientific research would lead mass confusion
dispute fisher neymanpearson waged philosophical grounds characterized philosopher dispute proper role models statistical inference
events intervened neyman accepted position western hemisphere breaking partnership pearson separating disputants occupied building much planetary diameter world war ii provided intermission debate dispute fisher neyman terminated unresolved years fishers death neyman wrote wellregarded eulogy neymans later publications reported pvalues significance levels
modern version hypothesis testing hybrid two approaches resulted confusion writers statistical textbooks predicted fisher beginning signal detection example still uses neymanpearson formulation great conceptual differences many caveats addition mentioned ignored neyman pearson provided stronger terminology rigorous mathematics consistent philosophy subject taught today introductory statistics similarities fishers method history explains inconsistent terminology example null hypothesis never accepted region acceptance
sometime around apparent effort provide researchers noncontroversial way cake eat authors statistical text books began anonymously combining two strategies using pvalue place test statistic data test neymanpearson significance level thus researchers encouraged infer strength data null hypothesis using pvalues also thinking retaining postdata collection objectivity provided hypothesis testing became customary null hypothesis originally realistic research hypothesis used almost solely strawman nil hypothesis one treatment effect regardless context
comparison fisherian frequentist neymanpearson
early choices null hypothesis
paul meehl argued epistemological importance choice null hypothesis gone largely unacknowledged null hypothesis predicted theory precise experiment severe test underlying theory null hypothesis defaults difference effect precise experiment less severe test theory motivated performing experiment examination origins latter practice may therefore useful
pierre laplace compares birthrates boys girls multiple european cities states natural conclude possibilities nearly ratio thus laplaces null hypothesis birthrates boys girls equal given conventional wisdom

null hypothesis statistical significance testing vs hypothesis testing
example neymanpearson hypothesis testing made change radioactive suitcase example suitcase actually shielded container transportation radioactive material test might used select among three hypotheses radioactive source present one present two present test could required safety actions required case neymanpearson lemma hypothesis testing says good criterion selection hypotheses ratio probabilities likelihood ratio simple method solution select hypothesis highest probability geiger counts observed typical result matches intuition counts imply source many counts imply two sources intermediate counts imply one source
neymanpearson theory accommodate prior probabilities costs actions resulting decisions former allows test consider results earlier tests unlike fishers significance tests latter allows consideration economic issues example well probabilities likelihood ratio remains good criterion selecting among hypotheses
two forms hypothesis testing based different problem formulations original test analogous truefalse question neymanpearson test like multiple choice view tukey former produces conclusion basis strong evidence latter produces decision basis available evidence two tests seem quite different mathematically philosophically later developments lead opposite claim consider many tiny radioactive sources hypotheses become grains radioactive sand little distinction none radiation fisher grains radioactive sand versus alternatives neymanpearson major neymanpearson paper also considered composite hypotheses ones whose distribution includes unknown parameter example proved optimality students ttest better test hypothesis consideration p neymanpearson theory proving optimality fisherian methods inception
