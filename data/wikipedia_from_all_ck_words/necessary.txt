the tail is the section at the rear end of an animal's body in general the term refers to a distinct flexible appendage to the torso it is the part of the body that corresponds roughly to the sacrum and coccyx in mammals reptiles and birds while tails are primarily a feature of vertebrates some invertebrates including scorpions and springtails as well as snails and slugs have tail-like appendages that are sometimes referred to as tails tailed objects are sometimes referred to as caudate and the part of the body associated with or proximal to the tail are given the adjective caudal

animal tails are used in a variety of ways they provide a source of locomotion for fish and some other forms of marine life many land animals use their tails to brush away flies and other biting insects some species including cats and kangaroos use their tails for balance and some such as new world monkeys and opossums have what are known as prehensile tails which are adapted to allow them to grasp tree branches
tails are also used for social signaling some deer species flash the white underside of their tails to warn other nearby deer of possible danger and canids (including domestic dogs) indicate emotions through the positioning and movement of their tails some species tails are armored and some such as those of scorpions contain venom
some species of lizard can detach ("cast") their tails from their bodies this can help them to escape predators which are either distracted by the wriggling detached tail or left with only the tail while the lizard flees tails cast in this manner generally grow back over time though the replacement is typically darker in colour than the original
most birds tails end in long feathers called rectrices these feathers are used as a rudder helping the bird steer and maneuver in flight they also help the bird to balance while it is perched in some speciessuch as birds of paradise lyrebirds and most notably peafowlmodified tail feathers play an important role in courtship displays the extra-stiff tail feathers of other species including woodpeckers and woodcreepers allow them to brace themselves firmly against tree trunks
the tails of grazing animals such as horses are used both to sweep away insects and positioned or moved in ways that indicate the animal's physical or emotional state

a scut is a short erect tail hares rabbits and deer have scuts
a prehensile tail is a tail that can grasp or hold objects examples are monkeys rats and snakes (prehensile body)
== human tailsedit ==
human embryos have a tail that measures about one-sixth of the size of the embryo itself as the embryo develops into a fetus the tail is absorbed by the growing body infrequently a child is born with a soft tail which contains no vertebrae but only blood vessels muscles and nerves but this is regarded as an abnormality rather than a vestigial true tail even when such an appendage is located where the tail would be expected
humans have a tail bone (the coccyx) attached to the pelvis formed of fused vertebrae usually four at the bottom of the vertebral column it does not protrude externally
