chemic chang occur substanc combin anoth form new substanc call synthesi altern decompos two differ substanc process call chemic reaction general revers except chemic reaction reaction produc heat call exotherm reaction other may requir heat enabl reaction occur call endotherm reaction understand chemic chang major part scienc chemistri
chemic reaction occur atom rearrang reaction accompani energi chang new product generat exampl chemic chang reaction sodium water produc sodium hydroxid hydrogen much energi releas hydrogen gas releas spontan burn air exampl chemic chang end product chemic differ substanc reaction
typesedit
chemist categor chemic chang three main class inorgan chemic chang organ chemic chang biochem chang
inorgan changesedit
inorgan chemistri describ reaction element compound general involv carbon chang typic take place laboratori larger scale heavi industri
typic type chang includ neutral mix acid base result water salt oxid includ combust redox reaction etc
organ changesedit
organ chemistri concern chemistri carbon element compound react compound includ miner oil product much output industri manufactur pharmaceut paint deterg cosmet fuel etc typic exampl organ chemic chang includ crack heavi hydrocarbon oil refineri creat gasolin crude oil gasolin higher demand heavier hydrocarbon residu fuel oil reaction includ methyl condens reaction polymeris halogen etc
biochem changeedit
biochemistri deal chemistri growth activ live organ chemistri reaction control complex protein call enzym moder limit hormon chemistri alway high complex still fulli understood decomposit organ materi also within scope biochemistri although case growth activ fungi bacteria microorgan involv typic type chang includ process involv photosynthesi process carbon dioxid water chang sugar oxygen plant digest energi rich materi use organ grow move kreb cycl liber energi store reserv protein synthesi enabl organ grow use process control rna etc
