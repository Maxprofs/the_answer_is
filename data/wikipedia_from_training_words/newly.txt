the category of newly industrialized country (nic) is a socioeconomic classification applied to several countries around the world by political scientists and economists
nics are countries whose economies have not yet reached developed country status but have in a macroeconomic sense outpaced their developing counterparts another characterization of nics is that of countries undergoing rapid economic growth (usually export-oriented) incipient or ongoing industrialization is an important indicator of an nic in many nics social upheaval can occur as primarily rural or agricultural populations migrate to the cities where the growth of manufacturing concerns and factories can draw many thousands of laborers
nics usually share some other common features including
strong political leaders
a switch from agricultural to industrial economies especially in the manufacturing sector
an increasingly open-market economy allowing free trade with other countries in the world
large national corporations operating in several continents
strong capital investment from foreign countries
political leadership in their area of influence
rapid growth of urban centers and population
== historical context ==
the term came into use around 1970 when the four asian tigers of hong kong singapore south korea and taiwan rose to global prominence as nics in the 1970s and 1980s with exceptionally fast industrial growth since the 1960s all four economies have since graduated into advanced economies and high-income economies there is a clear distinction between these countries and the countries now considered nics in particular the combination of an open political process high gni per capita and a thriving export-oriented economic policy has shown that these countries have now not only reached but surpassed the ranks of many developed countries
all four economies are classified as high-income economies by the world bank and advanced economies by the international monetary fund (imf) and u.s central intelligence agency (cia) all of them like western european countries possess human development index considered very high by the un
== current nics ==
the table below presents the list of countries consistently considered nics by different authors and experts turkey and south africa are classified as developed countries by the cia turkey was a founding member of the oecd in 1961 and mexico joined in 1994 the g8+5 group is composed of the original g8 members in addition to china india mexico south africa and brazil
note green-colored cells indicate higher value or best performance in index while yellow-colored cells indicate the opposite
for china and india the immense population of these two countries (each with over 1.2 billion people as of september 2015) means that per capita income will remain low even if either economy surpasses that of the united states in overall gdp when gdp per capita is calculated according to purchasing power parity (ppp) this takes into account the lower costs of living in each newly industrialized country gdp per capita typically is an indicator for living standards in a given country as well
brazil china india mexico and south africa meet annually with the g8 countries to discuss financial topics and climate change due to their economic importance in today's global market and environmental impact in a group known as g8+5 this group is expected to expand to g14 by adding egypt alongside the five forementioned countries
=== other nics ===
authors set lists of countries accordingly to different methods of economic analysis sometimes a work ascribes nic status to a country that other authors don't consider nic this is the case of countries such as argentina chile egypt sri lanka and russia
== brief economic analysis ==
nics usually benefit from comparatively low labor costs which translates into lower input prices for suppliers as a result it is often easier for producers in nics to outperform and outproduce factories in developed countries where the cost of living is higher and trade unions and other organizations have more political sway
this comparative advantage is often criticized by advocates of the fair trade movement
== issues ==
economic freedom is not always associated with political freedom in countries such as china where internet censorship and human rights violations are common the case is diametrically opposite for india while being a liberal democracy throughout after its independence india has been widely criticized for its inefficient governance and slow process of structural reform thus while political freedom in china remains limited the average chinese citizen enjoys a higher standard of living than his or her counterpart in some regions of india
meanwhile south africa faces an influx of immigrants from countries such as zimbabwe
mexico's economic growth is threatened by an ongoing drug war in the north of the country
meanwhile other nics face common problems such as widespread corruption and/or political instability as well as other circumstances that cause them to face the middle income trap
