o (named o /o/ plural oes) is the 15th letter and the second-to-last vowel in the modern english alphabet and the iso basic latin alphabet
== history ==
its graphic form has remained fairly constant from phoenician times until today the name of the phoenician letter was eyn meaning eye and indeed its shape originates simply as a drawing of a human eye (possibly inspired by the corresponding egyptian hieroglyph c.f proto-sinaitic script) its original sound value was that of a consonant probably [] the sound represented by the cognate arabic letter ayn
the use of this phoenician letter for a vowel sound is due to the early greek alphabets which adopted the letter as o omicron to represent the vowel /o/ the letter was adopted with this value in the old italic alphabets including the early latin alphabet in greek a variation of the form later came to distinguish this long sound (omega meaning large o") from the short o (omicron meaning small o") greek omicron gave rise to the corresponding cyrillic letter o and the early italic letter to runic 
even alphabets constructed from scratch i.e not derived from semitic usually have similar forms to represent this sound e.g. the creators of the afaka and ol chiki scripts each invented in different parts of the world in the last century both attributed their vowels for o to the shape of the mouth when making this sound

=== english ===
the letter o is the fourth most common letter in the english alphabet like the other english vowel letters it has associated long and short pronunciations the long o as in boat is actually most often a diphthong /o/ (realized dialectically anywhere from [o] to []) in english there is also a short o as in fox // which sounds slightly different in different dialects in most dialects of british english it is either an open-mid back rounded vowel [] or an open back rounded vowel [] in american english it is most commonly an unrounded back to a central vowel [] to [a]
common digraphs include oo which represents either /u/ or // oi or oy which typically represents the diphthong // and ao oe and ou which represent a variety of pronunciations depending on context and etymology
in other contexts especially before a letter with a minim o may represent the sound // as in son or love
in english the letter o in isolation before a noun usually capitalized marks the vocative case as in the titles to o canada or o captain my captain or certain verses of the bible
=== other languages ===
o is commonly associated with the open-mid back rounded vowel [] mid back rounded vowel [o] or close-mid back rounded vowel [o] in many languages other languages use o for various values usually back vowels which are at least partly open derived letters such as and have been created for the alphabets of some languages to distinguish values that were not present in latin and greek particularly rounded front vowels
=== other systems ===
in the international phonetic alphabet o represents the close-mid back rounded vowel
