the gram (alternative british english spelling gramme si unit symbol g) (greek/latin root grmma) is a metric system unit of mass gram can be abbreviated as gm or g.[1][2]
originally defined as the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to the cube of the hundredth part of a metre and at the temperature of melting ice (later 4 c) a gram is now defined as one one-thousandth of the si base unit the kilogram or 1103 kg which itself is defined as being equal to the mass of a physical prototype preserved by the international bureau of weights and measures
== official si symboledit ==
the only unit symbol for gram that is recognised by the international system of units (si) is g following the numeric value with a space as in 640 g the si does not support the use of abbreviations such as gr (which is the symbol for grains) gm or gm (the si symbol for gigametre)
== historyedit ==
the word gramme was adopted by the french national convention in its 1795 decree revising the metric system as replacing the gravet introduced in 1793 its definition remained that of the weight (poids) of a cubic centimetre of water french gramme was taken from the late latin term gramma this word ultimately from greek letter had adopted a specialised meaning in late antiquity of one twenty-fourth part of an ounce (two oboli) corresponding to about 1.14 (modern) grams this use of the term is found in the carmen de ponderibus et mensuris ("poem about weights and measures") composed around 400 ad there is also evidence that the greek was used in the same sense at around the same time in the 4th century and survived in this sense into medieval greek while the latin term did not remain current in medieval latin and was recovered in renaissance scholarship
the gram was the fundamental unit of mass in the 19th-century centimetregramsecond system of units (cgs) the cgs system co-existed with the mks system of units first proposed in 1901 during much of the 20th century but the gram has been displaced by the kilogram as the fundamental unit for mass when the mks system was chosen for the si base units in 1960
== usesedit ==
the gram is today the most widely used unit of measurement for non-liquid ingredients in cooking and grocery shopping worldwide
most standards and legal requirements for nutrition labels on food products require relative contents to be stated per 100 g (3.5274 ounces) of the product such that the resulting figure can also be read as a percentage by weight

1 gram (g) = 15.4323583529 grains (gr)
1 grain (gr) = 0.06479891 grams (g)
1 avoirdupois ounce (oz) = 28.349523125 grams (g)
1 troy ounce (ozt) = 31.1034768 grams (g)
100 grams (g) = 3.527396195 ounces
1 gram (g) = 5 carats (ct)
1 gram (g) = 8.987551791013 joules (j) (by massenergy equivalence)
1 eleventh-gram = 1011 grams in the historic quadrant-eleventh-gram-second system (qes system)
== comparisonsedit ==
1 gram is roughly equal to 1 small paper clip or pen cap
the japanese 1 yen coin has a mass of one gram (lighter than the british penny (3.56 g) the united states cent (2.5 g) or the euro-cent (2.30 g))
