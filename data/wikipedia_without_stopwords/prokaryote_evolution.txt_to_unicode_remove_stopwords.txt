terrabacteria taxon containing approximately twothirds sp prokaryote species including gram positive phyla actinobacteria firmicutes well phyla cyanobacteria chloroflexi deinococcusthermus
derives name terra land evolutionary pressures life land terrabacteria possess important adaptations resistance environmental hazards eg desiccation ultraviolet radiation high salinity oxygenic photosynthesis also unique properties cell wall grampositive taxa likely evolved response terrestrial conditions contributed toward pathogenicity many species results leave open possibility terrestrial adaptations may played larger role prokaryote evolution currently understood
