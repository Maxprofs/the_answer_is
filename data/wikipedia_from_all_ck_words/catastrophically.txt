the ultraviolet catastrophe also called the rayleighjeans catastrophe was the prediction of late 19th century/early 20th century classical physics that an ideal black body at thermal equilibrium will emit radiation with infinite power
the term ultraviolet catastrophe was first used in 1911 by paul ehrenfest but the concept originated with the 1900 derivation of the rayleighjeans law the phrase refers to the fact that the rayleigh-jeans law accurately predicts experimental results at radiative frequencies below 105 ghz but begins to diverge with empirical observations as these frequencies reach the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum since the first appearance of the term it has also been used for other predictions of a similar nature as in quantum electrodynamics and such cases as ultraviolet divergence

the ultraviolet catastrophe results from the equipartition theorem of classical statistical mechanics which states that all harmonic oscillator modes (degrees of freedom) of a system at equilibrium have an average energy of 
an example from mason's a history of the sciences illustrates multi-mode vibration via a piece of string as a natural vibrator the string will oscillate with specific modes (the standing waves of a string in harmonic resonance) dependent on the length of the string in classical physics a radiator of energy will act as a natural vibrator and since each mode will have the same energy most of the energy in a natural vibrator will be in the smaller wavelengths and higher frequencies where most of the modes are
according to classical electromagnetism the number of electromagnetic modes in a 3-dimensional cavity per unit frequency is proportional to the square of the frequency this therefore implies that the radiated power per unit frequency should follow the rayleighjeans law and be proportional to frequency squared thus both the power at a given frequency and the total radiated power is unlimited as higher and higher frequencies are considered this is clearly unphysical as the total radiated power of a cavity is not observed to be infinite a point that was made independently by einstein and by lord rayleigh and sir james jeans in 1905

planck derived the correct form for the intensity spectral distribution function by making some strange (for the time) assumptions in particular planck assumed that electromagnetic radiation can only be emitted or absorbed in discrete packets called quanta of energy  where h is planck's constant planck's assumptions led to the correct form of the spectral distribution functions  albert einstein solved the problem by postulating that planck's quanta were real physical particleswhat we now call photons not just a mathematical fiction he modified statistical mechanics in the style of boltzmann to an ensemble of photons einstein's photon had an energy proportional to its frequency and also explained an unpublished law of stokes and the photoelectric effect
== historical inaccuraciesedit ==
many popular histories of physics as well as a number of physics textbooks present an incorrect version of the history of the ultraviolet catastrophe in this version the catastrophe was first noticed by planck who developed his formula in response in fact planck never concerned himself with this aspect of the problem because he did not believe that the equipartition theorem was fundamental his motivation for introducing quanta was entirely different that planck's proposal happened to provide a solution for it was realized only later as stated above though the true sequence of events has been known to historians for many decades the historically incorrect version persists in part because planck's actual motivations for the proposal of the quantum are complicated and difficult to summarize for a lay audience
