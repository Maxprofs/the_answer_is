eclipse astronomical event occurs astronomical object temporarily obscured either passing shadow another body another body pass viewer eclipse type syzygy
term eclipse often used describe either solar eclipse moons shadow crosses earths surface lunar eclipse moon moves earths shadow however also refer events beyond earthmoon system example planet moving shadow cast one moons moon passing shadow cast host planet moon passing shadow another moon binary star system also produce eclipses plane orbit constituent stars intersects observers position
etymology
term derived ancient greek noun kleipsis means abandonment downfall darkening heavenly body derived verb eklep means abandon darken cease exist combination prefix ek preposition ek verb lep absent
umbra penumbra antumbra
region moons shadow solar eclipse divided three parts
umbra within moon completely covers sun precisely photosphere
antumbra extending beyond tip umbra within moon completely front sun small completely cover
penumbra within moon partially front sun
lunar eclipse umbra penumbra applicable earths apparent diameter viewpoint moon nearly four times sun
first contact occurs moons disc first starts impinge suns second contact moons disc moves completely within suns third contact starts move suns fourth last contact finally leaves suns disc entirely
terms may used analogously describing eclipses eg antumbra deimos crossing mars phobos entering marss penumbra
total eclipse occurs observer within umbra annular eclipse observer within antumbra partial eclipse observer within penumbra

eclipse cycles
eclipse cycle takes place series eclipses separated certain interval time happens orbital motions bodies form repeating harmonic patterns particular instance saros results repetition solar lunar eclipse every days little years whole number days successive eclipses visible different parts world
earthmoon system
eclipse involving sun earth moon occur nearly straight line allowing one hidden behind another viewed third orbital plane moon tilted respect orbital plane earth ecliptic eclipses occur moon close intersection two planes nodes sun earth nodes aligned twice year eclipse season eclipses occur period two months around times four seven eclipses calendar year repeat according various eclipse cycles saros
maximum seven eclipses
four penumbral lunar three solar eclipses
four solar three lunar eclipses
five solar two lunar eclipses
excluding penumbral lunar eclipses maximum seven eclipses
solar eclipse
observed earth solar eclipse occurs moon passes front sun type solar eclipse event depends distance moon earth event total solar eclipse occurs earth intersects umbra portion moons shadow umbra reach surface earth sun partially occulted resulting annular eclipse partial solar eclipses occur viewer inside penumbra
eclipse magnitude fraction suns diameter covered moon total eclipse value always greater equal one annular total eclipses eclipse magnitude ratio angular sizes moon sun
solar eclipses relatively brief events viewed totality along relatively narrow track favorable circumstances total solar eclipse last minutes seconds viewed along track km wide however region partial eclipse observed much larger moons umbra advance eastward rate kmh longer intersects earths surface
solar eclipse moon sometimes perfectly cover sun size nearly suns viewed earth total solar eclipse fact occultation annular solar eclipse transit
observed points space earths surface sun eclipsed bodies moon two examples include crew apollo observed earth eclipse sun cassini probe observed saturn eclipse sun
lunar eclipse
lunar eclipses occur moon passes earths shadowthis occurs moon far side earth sun lunar eclipses occur full moon unlike solar eclipse eclipse moon observed nearly entire hemisphere reason much common observe lunar eclipse given location lunar eclipse also lasts longer taking several hours complete totality usually averaging anywhere minutes hour
three types lunar eclipses penumbral moon crosses earths penumbra partial moon crosses partially earths umbra total moon crosses entirely earths umbra total lunar eclipses pass three phases even total lunar eclipse however moon completely dark sunlight refracted earths atmosphere enters umbra provides faint illumination much sunset atmosphere tends strongly scatter light shorter wavelengths illumination moon refracted light red hue thus phrase blood moon often found descriptions lunar events far back eclipses recorded
historical record
records solar eclipses kept since ancient times eclipse dates used chronological dating historical records syrian clay tablet ugaritic language records solar eclipse occurred march bc paul griffin argues stone ireland records eclipse november bc positing classicalera astronomers use babylonian eclipse records mostly th century bc provides feasible mathematically consistent explanation greek finding three lunar mean motions synodic anomalistic draconitic precision one part million better chinese historical records solar eclipses date back years used measure changes earths rate spin
european astronomers publishing books diagrams explaining lunar solar eclipses occurred order disseminate information broader audience decrease fear consequences eclipses booksellers printed broadsides explaining event either using science via astrology
planets pluto
gas giants
gas giant planets jupiter saturn uranus neptune many moons thus frequently display eclipses striking involve jupiter four large moons low axial tilt making eclipses frequent bodies pass shadow larger planet transits occur equal frequency common see larger moons casting circular shadows upon jupiters cloudtops
eclipses galilean moons jupiter became accurately predictable orbital elements known discovered events occurring minutes later expected jupiter far side sun ole rmer deduced delay caused time needed light travel jupiter earth used produce first estimate speed light
three gas giants eclipses occur certain periods planets orbit due higher inclination orbits moon orbital plane planet moon titan example orbital plane tilted saturns equatorial plane saturn axial tilt nearly orbital plane titan crosses line sight sun two points along saturns orbit orbital period saturn years eclipse possible every years
timing jovian satellite eclipses also used calculate observers longitude upon earth knowing expected time eclipse would observed standard longitude greenwich time difference could computed accurately observing local time eclipse time difference gives longitude observer every hour difference corresponded around earths equator technique used example giovanni d cassini remap france
mars
mars partial solar eclipses transits possible neither moons large enough respective orbital radii cover suns disc seen surface planet eclipses moons mars possible commonplace hundreds occurring earth year also rare occasions deimos eclipsed phobos martian eclipses photographed surface mars orbit
pluto
pluto proportionately largest moon charon also site many eclipses series mutual eclipses occurred daily events led first accurate measurements physical parameters objects
mercury venus
eclipses impossible mercury venus moons however observed transit across face sun average transits mercury century transits venus occur pairs separated interval eight years pair events happen less century
eclipsing binaries
binary star system consists two stars orbit around common centre mass movements stars lie common orbital plane space plane closely aligned location observer stars seen pass front result type extrinsic variable star system called eclipsing binary
maximum luminosity eclipsing binary system equal sum luminosity contributions individual stars one star passes front luminosity system seen decrease luminosity returns normal two stars longer alignment
first eclipsing binary star system discovered algol star system constellation perseus normally star system visual magnitude however every days magnitude decreases nine hours caused passage dimmer member pair front brighter star concept eclipsing body caused luminosity variations introduced john goodricke
