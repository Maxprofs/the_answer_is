a no-frills or no frills service or product is one for which the non-essential features have been removed to keep the price low the use of the term frills refers to a style of fabric decoration something offered to customers for no additional charge may be designated as a frill - for example free drinks on airline journeys or a radio installed in a rental car no-frills businesses operate on the principle that by removing luxurious additions customers may be offered lower prices
common products and services for which no-frills brands exist include airlines supermarkets vacations and vehicles
== no-frills airlinesedit ==
no-frills airlines are airlines that offer low fares but eliminate all non-essential services such as complimentary food in-flight entertainment systems business-class seating etc a no-frills airline will typically cut overhead by flying from more remote airports (with lower access charges) and by using a single type of aircraft aircraft cabin interiors may be fitted out with minimum comforts dispensing with luxuries such as seat-back video screens reclining seats and blinds some airlines choose to carry advertising inside the cabin to increase revenue should meals be served they must be paid for in full
some airlines also extend the definition of frills to include standard services and conveniences for example a no-frills airline may charge passengers an additional fee for check-in luggage using airport check-in desks or even providing wheelchairs
== no-frills holidayedit ==
no-frills holidays are holidays which like no-frills airlines do not include unnecessary services such as
in-flight meals
travel representatives
transfers between the airport and the hotel
entertainment
luxury accommodation
such holidays usually have a simple fare scheme in which fares typically increase during peak seasons and also as more people sign up for the holiday this rewards early reservations and is known as yield management
examples of no-frills holiday companies are

== no-frills supermarketsedit ==
no-frills supermarkets are recognisable by their store design and business model
they do not decorate aisles and sometimes they don't even fill shelves in this case pallets of the products on offer are simply parked alongside the aisles and customers picking up products will gradually empty them when all items on a pallet have been sold they are replaced prices are given on plain labels
queueing at the checkout is relatively common as staffing levels reflect average demand rather than peak demand at actual peak times customers often have to wait
shopping bags are charged for as they are seen as a frill thus many shoppers bring reusable shopping bags buy shopping bags at a low fee put their shopping in the cardboard boxes that the products originally came in or put it directly in their shopping cart customers must bag their own purchases
they work on the principle that in most supermarkets 20% of products on sale account for 80% of what people buy therefore they only stock the most commonly sold products
they only take cash and debit cards (although this has changed in many stores over the years due to the high usage of credit cards)
they only open at peak times i.e 9 am to 6 pm monday to saturday although a few stores are 24hrs
they often do not serve branded items except in the case of special purchases which are almost always at a discounted price instead they sell generic or private label products
the shopping carts have a coin-operated slot to ensure that the trolleys are kept on site
they usually lack butcher bakery and deli counters
staff (or even the managers sometimes) do the cleaning
no in-store background music although some use satellite radio

== no-frills automobilesedit ==
in the united states a no-frills automobile model typically has a minimum of convenience equipment a less powerful engine and spartan trim
frequently these models represent the lowest-priced version of a larger selection of more lavishly equipped and trimmed models of that same car often the less-expensive models are sold with a manual transmission and have a shorter options list early 1950s american examples include the chevrolet 150 and kaiser-frazer henry j these were larger cars than those produced in the us in the 1940s gasoline rationing period by crosley who shut down in 1952
one of the more famous no-frills cars was the studebaker scotsman which was on sale from 1957 to 1958 these cars came with a low-grade cloth-trimmed front seat and contained only a driver's side sunvisor no door armrests and painted trim (in lieu of chrome trim) even routine convenience items such as a cigarette lighter and dome light were deleted buyers were allowed to buy only a low-cost heater and a few other trim and convenience items from a short options list a radio was not offered as an option on this model (unlike studebaker's more expensive models)
during the 1960s and early 1970s american automakers offered several trim levels of full-sized models (each having a different name) with a price-leading no-frills versions examples included the chevrolet biscayne ford custom 500 and plymouth fury i while ostensibly targeted toward fleet buyers and business customers where luxury is not a concern these cars were also available to private customers while many of these cars were typically sold with the standard six-cylinder or basic v-8 engine with the standard three-speed manual transmission many of these price-leading models were also available with the full range of engines and transmissions including those that were performance-oriented unlike the later no-frills models that had restricted performance options
during the gasoline crisis of the 1970s many american automakers began offering no-frills models on their compact lines of cars (such as the ford pinto mpg and plymouth duster feather duster") as before these models usually had spartan trim (vinyl seats with rubber floor covering) fewer convenience items than the more expensive models (i.e no cigarette lighter) lighter-weight components (such as aluminum on various engine body and suspension components) and a manual transmission
most no-frills cars are sold to fleet buyers such as taxi companies or police departments however these models are generally available to cost-conscious private customers whose primary concerns were price fuel economy and basic low-cost transportation
the concept of a no-frills car in the european market was common in the 1950s with cars such as the ford abeille or the citron id normale the dacia logan is a remarkable example of a recent no-frills car in europe another example is fiat albea
in argentina and brazil the no-frills category takes a considerable share of the new car market costs cuts in base versions are listed but not limited to

in some specific markets very aggressive forms of no-frills cars may be available for example the supermini and city cars sold at the mercosur markets such as the chevrolet celta chevrolet corsa fiat uno fiat palio ford ka and volkswagen gol tend to be noisy and feature cost cuttings like
no lock on the fuel cap
elimination of nearly all process to polish or finish the molded plastic parts
substitution of black plastics by cheaper gray ones even on unpainted bumpers
1-liter engine (due to brazil's taxation according to the engine displacement)
ultra-short gearbox with the 5th gear scaled as the 4th gear of a regular 1.3 vehicle
