nutrients components foods organism uses survive grow macronutrients provide bulk energy organisms metabolic system needs function micronutrients provide necessary cofactors metabolism carried types nutrients acquired environment micronutrients used build repair tissues regulate body processes macronutrients converted used energy methods nutrient intake different plants animals plants take nutrients directly soil roots atmosphere leaves animals protists specialized digestive systems work break macronutrients energy utilize micronutrients metabolism anabolism constructive synthesis body
organic nutrients consist carbohydrates fats proteins building blocks amino acids vitamins inorganic chemical compounds dietary minerals water oxygen may also considered nutrients nutrient considered essential must obtained external source either organism cannot synthesize insufficient quantities produced nutrients needed small amounts called micronutrients needed large quantities called macronutrients effects nutrients dosedependent shortages called deficiencies
types nutrientedit
macronutrients defined several different ways
chemical elements humans consume largest quantities carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen phosphorus sulphur chnops
classes chemical compounds humans consume largest quantities provide bulk energy carbohydrates proteins fats water atmospheric oxygen also must consumed large quantities always considered food nutrients
calcium salt sodium chloride magnesium potassium along phosphorus sulfur sometimes added list macronutrients required large quantities compared vitamins minerals sometimes referred macrominerals
substances provide energyedit
carbohydrates compounds made types sugars carbohydrates classified number sugar units monosaccharides glucose fructose disaccharides sucrose lactose oligosaccharides polysaccharides starch glycogen cellulose
proteins organic compounds consist amino acids joined peptide bonds body cannot manufacture amino acids termed essential amino acids diet must supply proteins nutrition broken digestion proteases back free amino acids
fats consist glycerin molecule three fatty acids attached fatty acids unbranched hydrocarbon chains connected single bonds alone saturated fatty acids double single bonds unsaturated fatty acids fats needed keep cell membranes functioning properly insulate body organs shock keep body temperature stable maintain healthy skin hair body manufacture certain fatty acids termed essential fatty acids diet must supply
although alcohol provides energy thus compared macronutrients substance essential normal function acetic acid vinegar also provides similar amount energy per gram nutrient essential normal function
fat energy content kcalg kjg proteins carbohydrates kcalg kjg ethanol grain alcohol energy content kcalg kjg
substances support metabolismedit
dietary minerals generally trace elements salts ions copper iron minerals essential human metabolism
vitamins organic compounds essential body usually act coenzymes cofactors various proteins body
water essential nutrient solvent chemical reactions life take place
plants absorb nutrients soil atmosphere water mainly aquatic plants exception carnivorous plants externally digest nutrients animals ingesting
chemical elements consumed greatest quantities plants carbon hydrogen oxygen present environment form water carbon dioxide energy provided sunlight nitrogen phosphorus sulfur also needed relatively large quantities together big six elemental macronutrients organisms often represented acronym chnops usually sourced inorganic eg carbon dioxide water nitrate phosphate sulfate organic eg carbohydrates lipids proteins compounds although elemental diatomic molecules nitrogen especially oxygen often used
chemical elements also necessary carry various life processes build structures see fertilizer micronutrient information
considered macronutrients certain organisms mnemonic c hopkns cafe mg used c hopkins coffee mug used students remember list carbon hydrogen oxygen phosphorus potassium nitrogen sulfur calcium iron magnesium silicon chloride sodium copper zinc molybdenum sometimes also included cases considered micronutrients
essential nonessential nutrientsedit
nutrients frequently categorized essential nonessential
essential nutrientsedit
essential nutrients unable synthesized internally either sufficient quantities must consumed organism environment nonessential nutrients nutrients made body may often also absorbed consumed food majority animals ultimately derive essential nutrients plants though animals may consume mineralbased soils supplement diet
humans include essential fatty acids essential amino acids vitamins certain dietary minerals oxygen water also essential human survival generally considered food consumed isolation essential carbohydrates animals synthesize types carbohydrates needed growth
humans derive energy wide variety fats carbohydrates proteins simple chemicals ethanol acetic acid
nonessential nutrientsedit
nonessential nutrients substances within foods still significant impact health whether beneficial toxic example dietary fiber absorbed human digestive tract important maintaining bulk bowel movement avoid constipation
interest recently increased phytochemicals include many nonessential substances may may health benefits
deficiencies toxicityedit
inadequate amount nutrient deficiency deficiencies due number causes including inadequacy nutrient intake called dietary deficiency conditions interfere utilization nutrient within organism conditions interfere nutrient utilization include problems nutrient absorption substances cause greater normal need nutrient conditions cause nutrient destruction conditions cause greater nutrient excretion
nutrient toxicity occurs excess nutrient harm organism
