smallpox was an infectious disease caused by either of two virus variants variola major and variola minor the disease is also known by the latin names variola or variola vera derived from varius ("spotted") or varus ("pimple") the disease was originally known in english as the pox or red plague the term smallpox was first used in britain in the 15th century to distinguish variola from the great pox (syphilis) the last naturally occurring case of smallpox (variola minor) was diagnosed on 26 october 1977
infection with smallpox is focused in small blood vessels of the skin and in the mouth and throat before disseminating in the skin it results in a characteristic maculopapular rash and later raised fluid-filled blisters v major produced a more serious disease and had an overall mortality rate of 3035 percent v minor caused a milder form of disease (also known as alastrim cottonpox milkpox whitepox and cuban itch) which killed about 1 percent of its victims long-term complications of v major infection included characteristic scars commonly on the face which occur in 6585 percent of survivors blindness resulting from corneal ulceration and scarring and limb deformities due to arthritis and osteomyelitis were less common complications seen in about 25 percent of cases
smallpox is believed to have emerged in human populations about 10,000 bc the earliest physical evidence of it is probably the pustular rash on the mummified body of pharaoh ramses v of egypt the disease killed an estimated 400,000 europeans annually during the closing years of the 18th century (including five reigning monarchs) and was responsible for a third of all blindness of all those infected 2060 percentand over 80 percent of infected childrendied from the disease smallpox was responsible for an estimated 300500 million deaths during the 20th century as recently as 1967 the world health organization (who) estimated that 15 million people contracted the disease and that two million died in that year
after vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries the who certified the global eradication of smallpox in 1979 smallpox is one of two infectious diseases to have been eradicated the other being rinderpest which was declared eradicated in 2011
== classificationedit ==
there were two clinical forms of smallpox variola major was the severe and most common form with a more extensive rash and higher fever variola minor was a less common presentation and a much less severe disease with historical death rates of 1 percent or less subclinical (asymptomatic) infections with variola virus were noted but were not common in addition a form called variola sine eruptione (smallpox without rash) was seen generally in vaccinated persons this form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or rarely by virus isolation
== signs and symptomsedit ==
the incubation period between contraction and the first obvious symptoms of the disease is around 12 days once inhaled variola major virus invades the oropharyngeal (mouth and throat) or the respiratory mucosa migrates to regional lymph nodes and begins to multiply in the initial growth phase the virus seems to move from cell to cell but around the 12th day lysis of many infected cells occurs and the virus is found in the bloodstream in large numbers (this is called viremia) and a second wave of multiplication occurs in the spleen bone marrow and lymph nodes the initial or prodromal symptoms are similar to other viral diseases such as influenza and the common cold fever of at least 38.3 c (101 f) muscle pain malaise headache and prostration as the digestive tract is commonly involved nausea and vomiting and backache often occur the prodrome or preeruptive stage usually lasts 24 days by days 1215 the first visible lesionssmall reddish spots called enanthemappear on mucous membranes of the mouth tongue palate and throat and temperature falls to near normal these lesions rapidly enlarge and rupture releasing large amounts of virus into the saliva
smallpox virus preferentially attacks skin cells causing the characteristic pimples (called macules) associated with the disease a rash develops on the skin 24 to 48 hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appear typically the macules first appear on the forehead then rapidly spread to the whole face proximal portions of extremities the trunk and lastly to distal portions of extremities the process takes no more than 24 to 36 hours after which no new lesions appear at this point variola major infection can take several very different courses resulting in four types of smallpox disease based on the rao classification ordinary modified malignant (or flat) and hemorrhagic historically smallpox has an overall fatality rate of about 30 percent however the malignant and hemorrhagic forms are usually fatal
=== ordinaryedit ===
ninety percent or more of smallpox cases among unvaccinated persons are of the ordinary type in this form of the disease by the second day of the rash the macules become raised papules by the third or fourth day the papules fill with an opalescent fluid to become vesicles this fluid becomes opaque and turbid within 2448 hours giving them the appearance of pustules however the so-called pustules are filled with tissue debris not pus
by the sixth or seventh day all the skin lesions have become pustules between seven and ten days the pustules mature and reach their maximum size the pustules are sharply raised typically round tense and firm to the touch the pustules are deeply embedded in the dermis giving them the feel of a small bead in the skin fluid slowly leaks from the pustules and by the end of the second week the pustules deflate and start to dry up forming crusts (or scabs) by day 1620 scabs have formed over all the lesions which have started to flake off leaving depigmented scars
ordinary smallpox generally produces a discrete rash in which the pustules stand out on the skin separately the distribution of the rash is densest on the face denser on the extremities than on the trunk and on the extremities denser on the distal parts than on the proximal the palms of the hands and soles of the feet are involved in the majority of cases sometimes the blisters merge into sheets forming a confluent rash which begin to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh patients with confluent smallpox often remain ill even after scabs have formed over all the lesions in one case series the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62 percent
=== modifiededit ===
referring to the character of the eruption and the rapidity of its development modified smallpox occurs mostly in previously vaccinated people in this form the prodromal illness still occurs but may be less severe than in the ordinary type there is usually no fever during evolution of the rash the skin lesions tend to be fewer and evolve more quickly are more superficial and may not show the uniform characteristic of more typical smallpox modified smallpox is rarely if ever fatal this form of variola major is more easily confused with chickenpox
=== malignantedit ===
in malignant-type smallpox (also called flat smallpox) the lesions remain almost flush with the skin at the time when raised vesicles form in the ordinary type it is unknown why some people develop this type historically it accounted for 510 percent of cases and the majority (72 percent) were children malignant smallpox is accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasts 34 days prolonged high fever and severe symptoms of toxemia the rash on the tongue and palate is extensive skin lesions mature slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they are flat and appear to be buried in the skin unlike ordinary-type smallpox the vesicles contain little fluid are soft and velvety to the touch and may contain hemorrhages malignant smallpox is nearly always fatal
=== hemorrhagicedit ===
hemorrhagic smallpox is a severe form that is accompanied by extensive bleeding into the skin mucous membranes and gastrointestinal tract this form develops in approximately 2 percent of infections and occurred mostly in adults in hemorrhagic smallpox the skin does not blister but remains smooth instead bleeding occurs under the skin making it look charred and black hence this form of the disease is also known as black pox
in the early or fulminating form hemorrhaging appears on the second or third day as sub-conjunctival bleeding turns the whites of the eyes deep red hemorrhagic smallpox also produces a dusky erythema petechiae and hemorrhages in the spleen kidney serosa muscle and rarely the epicardium liver testes ovaries and bladder death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present a later form of the disease occurs in patients who survive for 810 days the hemorrhages appear in the early eruptive period and the rash is flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage patients in the early stage of disease show a decrease in coagulation factors (e.g platelets prothrombin and globulin) and an increase in circulating antithrombin patients in the late stage have significant thrombocytopenia however deficiency of coagulation factors is less severe some in the late stage also show increased antithrombin this form of smallpox occurs in anywhere from 3 to 25 percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain hemorrhagic smallpox is usually fatal
== causeedit ==
=== pathogensedit ===
smallpox is caused by infection with variola virus which belongs to the genus orthopoxvirus the family poxviridae and subfamily chordopoxvirinae
the date of the appearance of smallpox is not settled it most likely evolved from a rodent virus between 68,000 and 16,000 years ago the wide range of dates is due to the different records used to calibrate the molecular clock one clade was the variola major strains (the more clinically severe form of smallpox) which spread from asia between 400 and 1,600 years ago a second clade included both alastrim minor (a phenotypically mild smallpox) described from the american continents and isolates from west africa which diverged from an ancestral strain between 1,400 and 6,300 years before present this clade further diverged into two subclades at least 800 years ago a second estimate has placed the separation of variola from taterapox at 30004000 years ago this is consistent with archaeological and historical evidence regarding the appearance of smallpox as a human disease which suggests a relatively recent origin however if the mutation rate is assumed to be similar to that of the herpesviruses the divergence date between variola from taterapox has been estimated to be 50,000 years ago while this is consistent with the other published estimates it suggests that the archaeological and historical evidence is very incomplete better estimates of mutation rates in these viruses are needed variola is a large brick-shaped virus measuring approximately 302 to 350 nanometers by 244 to 270 nm with a single linear double stranded dna genome 186 kilobase pairs (kbp) in size and containing a hairpin loop at each end the two classic varieties of smallpox are variola major and variola minor
four orthopoxviruses cause infection in humans variola vaccinia cowpox and monkeypox variola virus infects only humans in nature although primates and other animals have been infected in a laboratory setting vaccinia cowpox and monkeypox viruses can infect both humans and other animals in nature
the life cycle of poxviruses is complicated by having multiple infectious forms with differing mechanisms of cell entry poxviruses are unique among dna viruses in that they replicate in the cytoplasm of the cell rather than in the nucleus in order to replicate poxviruses produce a variety of specialized proteins not produced by other dna viruses the most important of which is a viral-associated dna-dependent rna polymerase
both enveloped and unenveloped virions are infectious the viral envelope is made of modified golgi membranes containing viral-specific polypeptides including hemagglutinin infection with either variola major or variola minor confers immunity against the other
=== transmissionedit ===
transmission occurs through inhalation of airborne variola virus usually droplets expressed from the oral nasal or pharyngeal mucosa of an infected person it is transmitted from one person to another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person usually within a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) but can also be spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects (fomites) such as bedding or clothing rarely smallpox has been spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed settings such as buildings buses and trains the virus can cross the placenta but the incidence of congenital smallpox is relatively low smallpox is not notably infectious in the prodromal period and viral shedding is usually delayed until the appearance of the rash which is often accompanied by lesions in the mouth and pharynx the virus can be transmitted throughout the course of the illness but is most frequent during the first week of the rash when most of the skin lesions are intact infectivity wanes in 7 to 10 days when scabs form over the lesions but the infected person is contagious until the last smallpox scab falls off
smallpox is highly contagious but generally spreads more slowly and less widely than some other viral diseases perhaps because transmission requires close contact and occurs after the onset of the rash the overall rate of infection is also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage in temperate areas the number of smallpox infections were highest during the winter and spring in tropical areas seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year age distribution of smallpox infections depends on acquired immunity vaccination immunity declines over time and is probably lost within thirty years smallpox is not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there is no asymptomatic carrier state
== diagnosisedit ==
the clinical definition of smallpox is an illness with acute onset of fever equal to or greater than 38.3 c (101 f) followed by a rash characterized by firm deep seated vesicles or pustules in the same stage of development without other apparent cause if a clinical case is observed smallpox is confirmed using laboratory tests
microscopically poxviruses produce characteristic cytoplasmic inclusions the most important of which are known as guarnieri bodies and are the sites of viral replication guarnieri bodies are readily identified in skin biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin and appear as pink blobs they are found in virtually all poxvirus infections but the absence of guarnieri bodies cannot be used to rule out smallpox the diagnosis of an orthopoxvirus infection can also be made rapidly by electron microscopic examination of pustular fluid or scabs however all orthopoxviruses exhibit identical brick-shaped virions by electron microscopy however if particles with the characteristic morphology of herpesviruses are seen this will eliminate smallpox and other orthopoxvirus infections
definitive laboratory identification of variola virus involves growing the virus on chorioallantoic membrane (part of a chicken embryo) and examining the resulting pock lesions under defined temperature conditions strains may be characterized by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis serologic tests and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (elisa) which measure variola virus-specific immunoglobulin and antigen have also been developed to assist in the diagnosis of infection
chickenpox was commonly confused with smallpox in the immediate post-eradication era chickenpox and smallpox can be distinguished by several methods unlike smallpox chickenpox does not usually affect the palms and soles additionally chickenpox pustules are of varying size due to variations in the timing of pustule eruption smallpox pustules are all very nearly the same size since the viral effect progresses more uniformly a variety of laboratory methods are available for detecting chickenpox in evaluation of suspected smallpox cases
== preventionedit ==
the earliest procedure used to prevent smallpox was inoculation (known as variolation after the introduction of smallpox vaccine to avoid possible confusion) which likely occurred in india africa and china well before the practice arrived in europe however the idea that inoculation originated in india has been challenged as few of the ancient sanskrit medical texts described the process of inoculation accounts of inoculation against smallpox in china can be found as early as the late 10th century and the procedure was widely practiced by the 16th century during the ming dynasty if successful inoculation produced lasting immunity to smallpox however because the person was infected with variola virus a severe infection could result and the person could transmit smallpox to others variolation had a 0.52 percent mortality rate considerably less than the 2030 percent mortality rate of the disease
lady mary wortley montagu observed smallpox inoculation during her stay in the ottoman empire writing detailed accounts of the practice in her letters and enthusiastically promoted the procedure in england upon her return in 1718 in 1721 cotton mather and colleagues provoked controversy in boston by inoculating hundreds in 1796 edward jenner a doctor in berkeley gloucestershire rural england discovered that immunity to smallpox could be produced by inoculating a person with material from a cowpox lesion cowpox is a poxvirus in the same family as variola jenner called the material used for inoculation vaccine from the root word vacca which is latin for cow the procedure was much safer than variolation and did not involve a risk of smallpox transmission vaccination to prevent smallpox was soon practiced all over the world during the 19th century the cowpox virus used for smallpox vaccination was replaced by vaccinia virus vaccinia is in the same family as cowpox and variola but is genetically distinct from both the origin of vaccinia virus and how it came to be in the vaccine are not known
the current formulation of smallpox vaccine is a live virus preparation of infectious vaccinia virus the vaccine is given using a bifurcated (two-pronged) needle that is dipped into the vaccine solution the needle is used to prick the skin (usually the upper arm) a number of times in a few seconds if successful a red and itchy bump develops at the vaccine site in three or four days in the first week the bump becomes a large blister (called a jennerian vesicle") which fills with pus and begins to drain during the second week the blister begins to dry up and a scab forms the scab falls off in the third week leaving a small scar
the antibodies induced by vaccinia vaccine are cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses such as monkeypox cowpox and variola (smallpox) viruses neutralizing antibodies are detectable 10 days after first-time vaccination and seven days after revaccination historically the vaccine has been effective in preventing smallpox infection in 95 percent of those vaccinated smallpox vaccination provides a high level of immunity for three to five years and decreasing immunity thereafter if a person is vaccinated again later immunity lasts even longer studies of smallpox cases in europe in the 1950s and 1960s demonstrated that the fatality rate among persons vaccinated less than 10 years before exposure was 1.3 percent it was 7 percent among those vaccinated 11 to 20 years prior and 11 percent among those vaccinated 20 or more years prior to infection by contrast 52 percent of unvaccinated persons died
there are side effects and risks associated with the smallpox vaccine in the past about 1 out of 1,000 people vaccinated for the first time experienced serious but non-life-threatening reactions including toxic or allergic reaction at the site of the vaccination (erythema multiforme) spread of the vaccinia virus to other parts of the body and to other individuals potentially life-threatening reactions occurred in 14 to 500 people out of every 1 million people vaccinated for the first time based on past experience it is estimated that 1 or 2 people in 1 million (0.000198 percent) who receive the vaccine may die as a result most often the result of postvaccinial encephalitis or severe necrosis in the area of vaccination (called progressive vaccinia)
given these risks as smallpox became effectively eradicated and the number of naturally occurring cases fell below the number of vaccine-induced illnesses and deaths routine childhood vaccination was discontinued in the united states in 1972 and was abandoned in most european countries in the early 1970s routine vaccination of health care workers was discontinued in the u.s in 1976 and among military recruits in 1990 (although military personnel deploying to the middle east and korea still receive the vaccination) by 1986 routine vaccination had ceased in all countries it is now primarily recommended for laboratory workers at risk for occupational exposure
== treatmentedit ==
smallpox vaccination within three days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms in the vast majority of people vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease other than vaccination treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive such as wound care and infection control fluid therapy and possible ventilator assistance flat and hemorrhagic types of smallpox are treated with the same therapies used to treat shock such as fluid resuscitation people with semi-confluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin burns
no drug is currently approved for the treatment of smallpox however antiviral treatments have improved since the last large smallpox epidemics and studies suggest that the antiviral drug cidofovir might be useful as a therapeutic agent the drug must be administered intravenously however and may cause serious kidney toxicity
== prognosisedit ==
the overall case-fatality rate for ordinary-type smallpox is about 30 percent but varies by pock distribution ordinary type-confluent is fatal about 5075 percent of the time ordinary-type semi-confluent about 2550 percent of the time in cases where the rash is discrete the case-fatality rate is less than 10 percent the overall fatality rate for children younger than 1 year of age is 4050 percent hemorrhagic and flat types have the highest fatality rates the fatality rate for flat-type is 90 percent or greater and nearly 100 percent is observed in cases of hemorrhagic smallpox the case-fatality rate for variola minor is 1 percent or less there is no evidence of chronic or recurrent infection with variola virus
in fatal cases of ordinary smallpox death usually occurs between the tenth and sixteenth days of the illness the cause of death from smallpox is not clear but the infection is now known to involve multiple organs circulating immune complexes overwhelming viremia or an uncontrolled immune response may be contributing factors in early hemorrhagic smallpox death occurs suddenly about six days after the fever develops cause of death in hemorrhagic cases involved heart failure sometimes accompanied by pulmonary edema in late hemorrhagic cases high and sustained viremia severe platelet loss and poor immune response were often cited as causes of death in flat smallpox modes of death are similar to those in burns with loss of fluid protein and electrolytes beyond the capacity of the body to replace or acquire and fulminating sepsis
=== complicationsedit ===
complications of smallpox arise most commonly in the respiratory system and range from simple bronchitis to fatal pneumonia respiratory complications tend to develop on about the eighth day of the illness and can be either viral or bacterial in origin secondary bacterial infection of the skin is a relatively uncommon complication of smallpox when this occurs the fever usually remains elevated
other complications include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients) which is more common in adults and may cause temporary disability permanent pitted scars most notably on the face and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases) pustules can form on the eyelid conjunctiva and cornea leading to complications such as conjunctivitis keratitis corneal ulcer iritis iridocyclitis and optic atrophy blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages in 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox virions reach the joints and bone causing osteomyelitis variolosa lesions are symmetrical most common in the elbows tibia and fibula and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions swollen joints limit movement and arthritis may lead to limb deformities ankylosis malformed bones flail joints and stubby fingers
== historyedit ==
=== disease emergenceedit ===
the earliest credible clinical evidence of smallpox is found in the smallpox-like disease in medical writings from ancient india (as early as 1500 bc) egyptian mummy of ramses v who died more than 3000 years ago (1145 bc) and china (1122 bc) it has been speculated that egyptian traders brought smallpox to india during the 1st millennium bc where it remained as an endemic human disease for at least 2000 years smallpox was probably introduced into china during the 1st century ad from the southwest and in the 6th century was carried from china to japan in japan the epidemic of 735737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of the population at least seven religious deities have been specifically dedicated to smallpox such as the god sopona in the yoruba religion in india the hindu goddess of smallpox sitala mata was worshiped in temples throughout the country
the timing of the arrival of smallpox in europe and south-western asia is less clear smallpox is not clearly described in either the old or new testaments of the bible or in the literature of the greeks or romans while some have identified the plague of athenswhich was said to have originated in ethiopia and egyptor the plague that lifted carthage's 396 bc siege of syracuse with smallpox many scholars agree it is very unlikely such a serious disease as variola major would have escaped being described by hippocrates if it had existed in the mediterranean region during his lifetime while the antonine plague that swept through the roman empire in ad 165180 may have been caused by smallpox saint nicasius of rheims became the patron saint of smallpox victims for having supposedly survived a bout in 450 and saint gregory of tours recorded a similar outbreak in france and italy in 580 the first use of the term variola other historians speculate that arab armies first carried smallpox from africa into southwestern europe during the 7th and 8th centuries in the 9th century the persian physician rhazes provided one of the most definitive descriptions of smallpox and was the first to differentiate smallpox from measles and chickenpox in his kitab fi al-jadari wa-al-hasbah (the book of smallpox and measles) during the middle ages smallpox made periodic incursions into europe but did not become established there until the population increased and population movement became more active during the era of the crusades by the 16th century smallpox had become well established across most of europe with its introduction into populated areas in india china and europe smallpox affected mainly children with periodic epidemics that killed as many as 30 percent of those infected the settled existence of smallpox in europe was of particular historical importance since successive waves of exploration and colonization by europeans tended to spread the disease to other parts of the world by the 16th century it had become an important cause of morbidity and mortality throughout much of the world
there are no credible descriptions of smallpox-like disease in the americas before the westward exploration by europeans in the 15th century ad smallpox was introduced into the caribbean island of hispaniola in 1509 and into the mainland in 1520 when spanish settlers from hispaniola arrived in mexico bringing smallpox with them smallpox devastated the native amerindian population and was an important factor in the conquest of the aztecs and the incas by the spaniards settlement of the east coast of north america in 1633 in plymouth massachusetts was also accompanied by devastating outbreaks of smallpox among native american populations and subsequently among the native-born colonists case fatality rates during outbreaks in native american populations were as high as 8090% smallpox was introduced into australia in 1789 and again in 1829 although the disease was never endemic on the continent it was the principal cause of death in aboriginal populations between 1780 and 1870
by the mid-18th century smallpox was a major endemic disease everywhere in the world except in australia and in several small islands in europe smallpox was a leading cause of death in the 18th century killing an estimated 400,000 europeans each year up to 10 percent of swedish infants died of smallpox each year and the death rate of infants in russia may have been even higher the widespread use of variolation in a few countries notably great britain its north american colonies and china somewhat reduced the impact of smallpox among the wealthy classes during the latter part of the 18th century but a real reduction in its incidence did not occur until vaccination became a common practice toward the end of the 19th century improved vaccines and the practice of re-vaccination led to a substantial reduction in cases in europe and north america but smallpox remained almost unchecked everywhere else in the world in the united states and south africa a much milder form of smallpox variola minor was recognized just before the close of the 19th century by the mid-20th century variola minor occurred along with variola major in varying proportions in many parts of africa patients with variola minor experience only a mild systemic illness are often ambulant throughout the course of the disease and are therefore able to more easily spread disease infection with v minor induces immunity against the more deadly variola major form thus as v minor spread all over the usa into canada the south american countries and great britain it became the dominant form of smallpox further reducing mortality rates
=== eradicationedit ===
the english physician edward jenner demonstrated the effectiveness of cowpox to protect humans from smallpox in 1796 after which various attempts were made to eliminate smallpox on a regional scale the introduction of the vaccine to the new world took place in trinity newfoundland in 1800 by dr john clinch boyhood friend and medical colleague of jenner as early as 1803 the spanish crown organized a mission (the balmis expedition) to transport the vaccine to the spanish colonies in the americas and the philippines and establish mass vaccination programs there the u.s congress passed the vaccine act of 1813 to ensure that safe smallpox vaccine would be available to the american public by about 1817 a very solid state vaccination program existed in the dutch east indies in british india a program was launched to propagate smallpox vaccination through indian vaccinators under the supervision of european officials nevertheless british vaccination efforts in india and in burma in particular were hampered by stubborn indigenous preference for inoculation and distrust of vaccination despite tough legislation improvements in the local efficacy of the vaccine and vaccine preservative and education efforts by 1832 the federal government of the united states established a smallpox vaccination program for native americans in 1842 the united kingdom banned inoculation later progressing to mandatory vaccination the british government introduced compulsory smallpox vaccination by an act of parliament in 1853 in the united states from 1843 to 1855 first massachusetts and then other states required smallpox vaccination although some disliked these measures coordinated efforts against smallpox went on and the disease continued to diminish in the wealthy countries by 1897 smallpox had largely been eliminated from the united states in northern europe a number of countries had eliminated smallpox by 1900 and by 1914 the incidence in most industrialized countries had decreased to comparatively low levels vaccination continued in industrialized countries until the mid to late 1970s as protection against reintroduction australia and new zealand are two notable exceptions neither experienced endemic smallpox and never vaccinated widely relying instead on protection by distance and strict quarantines
the first hemisphere-wide effort to eradicate smallpox was made in 1950 by the pan american health organization the campaign was successful in eliminating smallpox from all american countries except argentina brazil colombia and ecuador in 1958 professor viktor zhdanov deputy minister of health for the ussr called on the world health assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox the proposal (resolution wha11.54) was accepted in 1959 at this point 2 million people were dying from smallpox every year overall however the progress towards eradication was disappointing especially in africa and in the indian subcontinent in 1966 an international team the smallpox eradication unit was formed under the leadership of an american donald henderson in 1967 the world health organization intensified the global smallpox eradication by contributing $2.4 million annually to the effort and adopted the new disease surveillance method promoted by czech epidemiologist karel raka
in the early 1950s an estimated 50 million cases of smallpox occurred in the world each year to eradicate smallpox each outbreak had to be stopped from spreading by isolation of cases and vaccination of everyone who lived close by this process is known as ring vaccination the key to this strategy was monitoring of cases in a community (known as surveillance) and containment the initial problem the who team faced was inadequate reporting of smallpox cases as many cases did not come to the attention of the authorities the fact that humans are the only reservoir for smallpox infection and that carriers did not exist played a significant role in the eradication of smallpox the who established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities early on donations of vaccine were provided primarily by the soviet union and the united states but by 1973 more than 80 percent of all vaccine was produced in developing countries
the last major european outbreak of smallpox was in 1972 in yugoslavia after a pilgrim from kosovo returned from the middle east where he had contracted the virus the epidemic infected 175 people causing 35 deaths authorities declared martial law enforced quarantine and undertook widespread re-vaccination of the population enlisting the help of the who in two months the outbreak was over prior to this there had been a smallpox outbreak in mayjuly 1963 in stockholm sweden brought from the far east by a swedish sailor this had been dealt with by quarantine measures and vaccination of the local population
by the end of 1975 smallpox persisted only in the horn of africa conditions were very difficult in ethiopia and somalia where there were few roads civil war famine and refugees made the task even more difficult an intensive surveillance and containment and vaccination program was undertaken in these countries in early and mid-1977 under the direction of australian microbiologist frank fenner as the campaign neared its goal fenner and his team played an important role in verifying eradication the last naturally occurring case of indigenous smallpox (variola minor) was diagnosed in ali maow maalin a hospital cook in merca somalia on 26 october 1977 the last naturally occurring case of the more deadly variola major had been detected in october 1975 in a two-year-old bangladeshi girl rahima banu
the global eradication of smallpox was certified based on intense verification activities in countries by a commission of eminent scientists on 9 december 1979 and subsequently endorsed by the world health assembly on 8 may 1980 the first two sentences of the resolution read
having considered the development and results of the global program on smallpox eradication initiated by who in 1958 and intensified since 1967 declares solemnly that the world and its peoples have won freedom from smallpox which was a most devastating disease sweeping in epidemic form through many countries since earliest time leaving death blindness and disfigurement in its wake and which only a decade ago was rampant in africa asia and south america
=== post-eradicationedit ===
the last cases of smallpox in the world occurred in an outbreak of two cases (one of which was fatal) in birmingham uk in 1978 a medical photographer janet parker contracted the disease at the university of birmingham medical school and died on september 11 1978 after which professor henry bedson the scientist responsible for smallpox research at the university committed suicide in light of this incident all known stocks of smallpox were destroyed or transferred to one of two who reference laboratories which had bsl-4 facilities the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) in the united states and the state research center of virology and biotechnology vector in koltsovo russia
in 1986 the world health organization first recommended destruction of the virus and later set the date of destruction to be 30 december 1993 this was postponed to 30 june 1999 due to resistance from the u.s and russia in 2002 the world health assembly agreed to permit the temporary retention of the virus stocks for specific research purposes destroying existing stocks would reduce the risk involved with ongoing smallpox research the stocks are not needed to respond to a smallpox outbreak some scientists have argued that the stocks may be useful in developing new vaccines antiviral drugs and diagnostic tests however a 2010 review by a team of public health experts appointed by the world health organization concluded that no essential public health purpose is served by the u.s and russia continuing to retain virus stocks the latter view is frequently supported in the scientific community particularly among veterans of the who smallpox eradication program
in march 2004 smallpox scabs were found tucked inside an envelope in a book on civil war medicine in santa fe new mexico the envelope was labeled as containing scabs from a vaccination and gave scientists at the centers for disease control and prevention an opportunity to study the history of smallpox vaccination in the u.s
in july 2014 several vials of smallpox were discovered in an fda laboratory at the national institutes of health location in bethesda maryland

=== biological warfareedit ===
the british used smallpox as a biological warfare agent at the siege of fort pitt during the french and indian wars (17541763) against france and its native american allies the actual use of smallpox had official sanction british officers including the top british commanding generals ordered sanctioned paid for and conducted the use of smallpox against the native americans as described by historians there is no doubt that british military authorities approved of attempts to spread smallpox among the enemy and it was deliberate british policy to infect the indians with smallpox on june 24 1763 william trent a local trader and commander of the fort pitt militia wrote out of our regard for them we gave them two blankets and an handkerchief out of the small pox hospital i hope it will have the desired effect. the effectiveness of this effort to broadcast the disease is unknown there are also accounts that smallpox was used as a weapon during the american revolutionary war (17751783)
according to a theory put forward in journal of australian studies (jas) by an independent researcher in 1789 british marines used smallpox against indigenous tribes in new south wales this occasion was also discussed earlier in bulletin of the history of medicine and by david day in his book claiming a continent a new history of australia prior to the jas article this theory was disputed by some academics jack carmody claimed the cause of the outbreak in question was more likely due to chickenpox which at the time was sometimes identified as a mild form of smallpox while it was noted that in the 8-month voyage of the first fleet and the following 14 months there were no reports of smallpox amongst the colonists and that as smallpox has an incubation period of 1012 days it is unlikely it was present in the first fleet it is now known that the likely source was bottles of smallpox virus possessed by first fleet surgeons and there actually was a report of smallpox amongst the colonists - a seaman jefferies more information is at first fleet smallpox
during world war ii scientists from the united kingdom united states and japan (unit 731 of the imperial japanese army) were involved in research into producing a biological weapon from smallpox plans of large scale production were never carried through as they considered that the weapon would not be very effective due to the wide-scale availability of a vaccine
in 1947 the soviet union established a smallpox weapons factory in the city of zagorsk 75 km to the northeast of moscow an outbreak of weaponized smallpox occurred during testing at a facility on an island in the aral sea in 1971 general prof peter burgasov former chief sanitary physician of the soviet army and a senior researcher within the soviet program of biological weapons described the incident
on vozrozhdeniya island in the aral sea the strongest recipes of smallpox were tested suddenly i was informed that there were mysterious cases of mortalities in aralsk a research ship of the aral fleet came to within 15 km of the island (it was forbidden to come any closer than 40 km) the lab technician of this ship took samples of plankton twice a day from the top deck the smallpox formulation400 gr of which was exploded on the island"got her and she became infected after returning home to aralsk she infected several people including children all of them died i suspected the reason for this and called the chief of general staff of ministry of defense and requested to forbid the stop of the alma-atamoscow train in aralsk as a result the epidemic around the country was prevented i called andropov who at that time was chief of kgb and informed him of the exclusive recipe of smallpox obtained on vozrazhdenie island
others contend that the first patient may have contracted the disease while visiting uyaly or komsomolsk-on-ustyurt two cities where the boat docked
responding to international pressures in 1991 the soviet government allowed a joint u.s.-british inspection team to tour four of its main weapons facilities at biopreparat the inspectors were met with evasion and denials from the soviet scientists and were eventually ordered out of the facility in 1992 soviet defector ken alibek alleged that the soviet bioweapons program at zagorsk had produced a large stockpileas much as twenty tonsof weaponized smallpox (possibly engineered to resist vaccines alibek further alleged) along with refrigerated warheads to deliver it alibek's stories about the former soviet program's smallpox activities have never been independently verified
in 1997 the russian government announced that all of its remaining smallpox samples would be moved to the vector institute in koltsovo with the breakup of the soviet union and unemployment of many of the weapons program's scientists u.s government officials have expressed concern that smallpox and the expertise to weaponize it may have become available to other governments or terrorist groups who might wish to use virus as means of biological warfare specific allegations made against iraq in this respect however proved to be false
concern has been expressed by some that artificial gene synthesis could be used to recreate the virus from existing digital genomes for use in biological warfare insertion of the synthesized smallpox dna into existing related pox viruses could theoretically be used to recreate the virus the first step to mitigating this risk it has been suggested should be to destroy the remaining virus stocks so as to enable unequivocal criminalization of any possession of the virus
=== notable casesedit ===
famous historical figures who contracted smallpox include lakota chief sitting bull ramses v of egypt the kangxi emperor (survived) shunzhi emperor and tongzhi emperor (refer to the official history) of china date masamune of japan (who lost an eye to the disease) cuitlhuac the 10th tlatoani (ruler) of the aztec city of tenochtitlan died of smallpox in 1520 shortly after its introduction to the americas and the incan emperor huayna capac died of it in 1527 more recent public figures include guru har krishan 8th guru of the sikhs in 1664 peter ii of russia in 1730 (died) george washington (survived) king louis xv in 1774 (died) and maximilian iii joseph elector of bavaria in 1777
prominent families throughout the world often had several people infected by and/or perish from the disease for example several relatives of henry viii survived the disease but were scarred by it these include his sister margaret queen of scotland his fourth wife anne of cleves and his two daughters mary i of england in 1527 and elizabeth i of england in 1562 (as an adult she would often try to disguise the pockmarks with heavy makeup) his great-niece mary queen of scots contracted the disease as a child but had no visible scarring
in europe deaths from smallpox often changed dynastic succession the only surviving son of henry viii edward vi died from complications shortly after apparently recovering from the disease thereby nullifying henry's efforts to ensure a male successor to the throne (his two immediate successors were both women who had both had it and survived) louis xv of france succeeded his great-grandfather louis xiv through a series of deaths of smallpox or measles among those earlier in the succession line he himself died of the disease in 1774 william iii lost his mother to the disease when he was only ten years old in 1660 and named his uncle charles as legal guardian her death from smallpox would indirectly spark a chain of events that would eventually lead to the permanent ousting of the stuart line from the british throne william iii's wife mary ii of england died from smallpox as well
in russia peter ii of russia died of the disease at 15 years of age also prior to becoming russian emperor peter iii caught the virus and suffered greatly from it he was left scarred and disfigured his wife catherine the great was spared but fear of the virus clearly had its effects on her she feared for her son and heir pavel's safety so much that she made sure that large crowds were kept at bay and sought to isolate him eventually she decided to have herself inoculated by a scottish doctor thomas dimsdale while this was considered a controversial method at the time she succeeded her son pavel was later inoculated as well catherine then sought to have inoculations throughout her empire stating my objective was through my example to save from death the multitude of my subjects who not knowing the value of this technique and frightened of it were left in danger. by 1800 approximately 2 million inoculations were administered in the russian empire
in china the qing dynasty had extensive protocols to protect manchus from peking's endemic smallpox
u.s presidents george washington andrew jackson and abraham lincoln all contracted and recovered from the disease washington became infected with smallpox on a visit to barbados in 1751 jackson developed the illness after being taken prisoner by the british during the american revolution and though he recovered his brother robert did not lincoln contracted the disease during his presidency possibly from his son tad and was quarantined shortly after giving the gettysburg address in 1863
famous theologian jonathan edwards died of smallpox in 1758 following an inoculation
soviet leader joseph stalin fell ill with smallpox at the age of seven his face was badly scarred by the disease he later had photographs retouched to make his pockmarks less apparent
hungarian poet ferenc klcsey who wrote the hungarian national anthem lost his right eye to smallpox
=== tradition and religionedit ===
in the face of the devastation of smallpox various smallpox gods and goddesses have been worshipped throughout parts of the old world for example in china and in india in china the smallpox goddess was referred to as tou-shen niang-niang chinese believers actively worked to appease the goddess and pray for her mercy by such measures as referring to smallpox pustules as beautiful flowers as a euphemism intended to avert offending the goddess for example in a related new year's eve custom it was prescribed that the children of the house wear ugly masks while sleeping so as to conceal any beauty and thereby avoid attracting the goddess who would be passing through sometime that night if a case of smallpox did occur shrines would be set up in the homes of the victims to be worshipped and offered to as the disease ran its course if the victim recovered the shrines were removed and carried away in a special paper chair or boat for burning if the patient did not recover the shrine was destroyed and cursed so as to expel the goddess from the house
indias first records of smallpox can be found in a medical book that dates back to a.d 400 this book describes a disease that sounds exceptionally like smallpox india like china created a goddess in response to its exposure to smallpox the hindu goddess shitala was both worshipped and feared during her reign it was believed that this goddess was both evil and kind and had the ability to inflict victims when angered as well as calm the fevers of the already afflicted portraits of the goddess show her holding a broom in her right hand to continue to move the disease and a pot of cool water in the other hand in an attempt to soothe victims shrines were created where many india natives both healthy and not went to worship and attempt to protect themselves from this disease some indian women in an attempt to ward off shitala placed plates of cooling foods and pots of water on the roofs of their homes
in cultures that did not recognize a smallpox deity there was often nonetheless a belief in smallpox demons who were accordingly blamed for the disease such beliefs were prominent in japan europe africa and other parts of the world nearly all cultures who believed in the demon also believed that it was afraid of the color red this led to the invention of so-called red treatment where victims and their rooms would be decorated in red the practice spread to europe in the 12th century and was practiced by (among others) charles v of france and elizabeth i of england afforded scientific credibility through the studies by finsen showing that red light reduced scarring this belief persisted even until the 1930s
