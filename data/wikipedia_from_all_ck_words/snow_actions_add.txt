luminescence is emission of light by a substance not resulting from heat it is thus a form of cold body radiation it can be caused by chemical reactions electrical energy subatomic motions or stress on a crystal this distinguishes luminescence from incandescence which is light emitted by a substance as a result of heating historically radioactivity was thought of as a form of radio-luminescence although it is today considered to be separate since it involves more than electromagnetic radiation the term luminescence was introduced in 1888 by eilhard wiedemann
the dials hands scales and signs of aviation and navigational instruments and markings are often coated with luminescent materials in a process known as luminising
== types ==
the following are types of luminescence
chemiluminescence a result of a chemical reaction
bioluminescence emission as a result of biochemical reaction by a living organism
electrochemiluminescence a result of an electrochemical reaction
crystalloluminescence produced during crystallization
electroluminescence a result of an electric current passed through a substance
cathodoluminescence a result of a luminescent material being struck by the electrons
mechanoluminescence a result of a mechanical action on a solid
triboluminescence generated when bonds in a material are broken when that material is scratched crushed or rubbed
fractoluminescence generated when bonds in certain crystals are broken by fractures
piezoluminescence produced by the action of pressure on certain solids
sonoluminescence a result of imploding bubbles in a liquid when excited by sound
photoluminescence a result of absorption of photons
fluorescence photoluminescence as a result of singletsinglet electronic relaxation (typical lifetime nanoseconds)
phosphorescence photoluminescence as a result of tripletsinglet electronic relaxation (typical lifetime milliseconds to hours)
radioluminescence a result of bombardment by ionizing radiation
thermoluminescence the re-emission of absorbed energy when a substance is heatedcryoluminescence the emission of light when an object is cooled (an example of this is wulfenite)
== applications ==
light-emitting diodes (leds) emit light via electro-luminescence
phosphors emitting light when irradiated by higher-energy electromagnetic radiation or particle radiation
phosphor thermometry measuring temperature using phosphorescence
