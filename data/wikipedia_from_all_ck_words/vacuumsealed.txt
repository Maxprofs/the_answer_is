== etymology and historyedit ==
the latin name for june is junius ovid offers multiple etymologies for the name in the fasti a poem about the roman calendar the first is that the month is named after the roman goddess juno the goddess of marriage and the wife of the supreme deity jupiter the second is that the name comes from the latin word iuniores meaning younger ones as opposed to maiores ("elders") for which the preceding month may (maius) may be named
in ancient rome the period from mid-may through mid-june was considered inauspicious for marriage ovid says that he consulted the flaminica dialis the high priestess of jupiter about setting a date for his daughter's wedding and was advised to wait till after june 15 plutarch however implies that the entire month of june was more favorable for weddings than may
