types
name telescope covers wide range instruments detect electromagnetic radiation major differences astronomers must go collecting light electromagnetic radiation different frequency bands
telescopes may classified wavelengths light detect
xray telescopes using shorter wavelengths ultraviolet light
ultraviolet telescopes using shorter wavelengths visible light
optical telescopes using visible light
infrared telescopes using longer wavelengths visible light
submillimetre telescopes using longer wavelengths infrared light
fresnel imager optical lens technology
xray optics optics certain xray wavelengths
wavelengths become longer becomes easier use antenna technology interact electromagnetic radiation although possible make tiny antenna nearinfrared handled much like visible light however farinfrared submillimetre range telescopes operate like radio telescope example james clerk maxwell telescope observes wavelengths m mm m mm uses parabolic aluminum antenna hand spitzer space telescope observing m mm m mm uses mirror reflecting optics also using reflecting optics hubble space telescope wide field camera observe m mm m mm ultraviolet infrared light
photon energy shorter wavelengths higher frequency fully reflecting optics rather glancingincident optics used telescopes trace soho use special mirrors reflect extreme ultraviolet producing higher resolution brighter images otherwise possible larger aperture mean light collected also enables finer angular resolution
telescopes may also classified location ground telescope space telescope flying telescope may also classified whether operated professional astronomers amateur astronomers vehicle permanent campus containing one telescopes instruments called observatory
optical telescopes
optical telescope gathers focuses light mainly visible part electromagnetic spectrum although work infrared ultraviolet optical telescopes increase apparent angular size distant objects well apparent brightness order image observed photographed studied sent computer telescopes work employing one curved optical elements usually made glass lenses andor mirrors gather light electromagnetic radiation bring light radiation focal point optical telescopes used astronomy many nonastronomical instruments including theodolites including transits spotting scopes monoculars binoculars camera lenses spyglasses three main optical types
refracting telescope uses lenses form image
reflecting telescope uses arrangement mirrors form image
catadioptric telescope uses mirrors combined lenses form image
beyond basic optical types many subtypes varying optical design classified task perform astrographs comet seekers solar telescope etc
radio telescopes
radio telescopes directional radio antennas used radio astronomy dishes sometimes constructed conductive wire mesh whose openings smaller wavelength observed multielement radio telescopes constructed pairs larger groups dishes synthesize large virtual apertures similar size separation telescopes process known aperture synthesis current record array size many times width earthutilizing spacebased long baseline interferometry vlbi telescopes japanese halca highly advanced laboratory communications astronomy vsop vlbi space observatory program satellite aperture synthesis also applied optical telescopes using optical interferometers arrays optical telescopes aperture masking interferometry single reflecting telescopes radio telescopes also used collect microwave radiation used collect radiation visible light obstructed faint quasars radio telescopes used programs seti arecibo observatory search extraterrestrial life

xray gammaray telescopes usually earthorbiting satellites highflying balloons since earths atmosphere opaque part electromagnetic spectrum however high energy xrays gammarays form image way telescopes visible wavelengths example type telescope fermi gammaray space telescope
detection high energy gamma rays shorter wavelength higher frequency regular gamma rays requires specialization example type observatory veritas high energy gammarays still photons like visible light whereas cosmic rays includes particles like electrons protons heavier nuclei
discovery may allow focusing gammaray telescopes photon energies greater kev index refraction starts increase
highenergy particle telescopes
highenergy astronomy requires specialized telescopes make observations since particles go metals glasses
types high energy particle telescopes imageforming optical system cosmicray telescopes usually consist array different detector types spread large area neutrino telescope consists large mass water ice surrounded array sensitive light detectors known photomultiplier tubes energetic neutral atom observatories like interstellar boundary explorer detect particles traveling certain energies
types telescopes
astronomy limited using electromagnetic radiation additional information obtained using media detectors used observe universe analogous telescopes
gravitationalwave detector equivalent gravitational wave telescope used gravitationalwave astronomy
neutrino detector equivalent neutrino telescope used neutrino astronomy
types mount
telescope mount mechanical structure supports telescope telescope mounts designed support mass telescope allow accurate pointing instrument many sorts mounts developed years majority effort put systems track motion stars earth rotates two main types tracking mount
altazimuth mount
equatorial mount
atmospheric electromagnetic opacity
since atmosphere opaque electromagnetic spectrum bands observed earths surface bands visible nearinfrared portion radiowave part spectrum reason xray farinfrared groundbased telescopes observed orbit even wavelength observable ground might still advantageous place telescope satellite due astronomical seeing
