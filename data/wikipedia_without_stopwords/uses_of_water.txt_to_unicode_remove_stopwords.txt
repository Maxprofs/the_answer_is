watermeadow also water meadow watermeadow area grassland subject controlled irrigation increase agricultural productivity watermeadows mainly used europe th early th centuries working watermeadows largely disappeared field patterns water channels derelict watermeadows remain common areas used parts northern italy switzerland england derelict watermeadows often importance wetland wildlife habitats
watermeadows confused floodmeadows naturally covered shallow water seasonal flooding river watermeadow sometimes used loosely mean level grassland beside river
types watermeadow
two main types watermeadow used
catchwork watermeadow
used fields slopes relatively little engineering skill required construct water stream spring fed top sloping field gentle sloping terraces formed along water could trickle zigzag fashion field water could used fields lower slope
bedwork watermeadow
bedwork floated watermeadows built almostlevel fields along broad river valleys required careful construction ensure correct operation
leat called main carrier top carrier used divert water river carry valley gentler slope river producing hydrostatic head two mains often along edge valley main supplying km mi valley water main used supply many smaller carriers crests ridges built across fields channel crest ridge would overflow slowly sides panes ridge channel eventually tapering end tip ridge seeping water would collected ridges drains drawns joining form bottom carrier tail drain returned water river ridges drains made interlocking grid like interlaced fingers ridgetop channels drains connect directly bycarrier took water needed irrigation straight main back river ridges varied height depending available head usually around cm pattern carriers drains generally regular adapted fit natural topography ground locations suitable places offtake return water
water flow controlled system hatches sluice gates stops small earth woodenboard dams irrigation could provided separately section watermeadow sometimes aqueducts took carriers drains causeways culverts provided access wagons working floating irrigation maintenance watermeadow done highly skilled craftsman called drowner waterman often employed several adjacent farmers
terminology used watermeadows varied considerably locality dialect
uses watermeadows
watermeadow irrigation aim flood ground keep continuously damp working watermeadow standing water irrigation early spring kept frosts ground allowed grass grow several weeks earlier otherwise dry summer weather irrigation kept grass growing also allowed ground absorb plant nutrients silt carried river water fertilised grassland incidentally also reduced eutrophication river water nutrient pollution grass used making hay grazing livestock usually cattle sheep
derelict watermeadows
former watermeadows found along many river valleys sluice gates channels field ridges may still visible however ridges confused ridge furrow topography found drier ground different origin arable farming drains derelict watermeadow generally clogged wet carrier channels dry smaller ones ridgetops often invisible main carrier channels still flow usually connect permanently bycarriers larger sluices may concealed roots trees crack willows grown seedlings established brickwork complex mixture wet drier ground often gives derelict watermeadows particularly high wetland biodiversity
