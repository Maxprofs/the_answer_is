allium sativum commonly known as garlic is a species in the onion genus allium
its close relatives include the onion shallot leek chive and rakkyo with a history of human use of over 7,000 years garlic is native to central asia and has long been a staple in the mediterranean region as well as a frequent seasoning in asia africa and europe it was known to ancient egyptians and has been used for both culinary and medicinal purposes
== descriptionedit ==
allium sativum is a bulbous plant it grows up to 1.2 m (4 ft) in height its hardiness is usda zone 8 it produces hermaphrodite flowers pollination occurs by bees and other insects
== origin and major typesedit ==
allium sativum grows in the wild in areas where it has become naturalized the wild garlic crow garlic and field garlic of britain are members of the species allium ursinum allium vineale and allium oleraceum respectively identification of the wild progenitor for common garlic is made difficult by the sterility of its many cultivars which may all be descended from the species allium longicuspis growing wild in central and southwestern asia
in north america allium vineale (known as wild garlic or crow garlic") and allium canadense known as meadow garlic or wild garlic and wild onion are common weeds in fields one of the best-known garlics the so-called elephant garlic is actually a wild leek (allium ampeloprasum) and not a true garlic single clove garlic (also called pearl or solo garlic) originated in the yunnan province of china
=== european garlicedit ===

== subspecies and varietiesedit ==
there are two subspecies of a sativum ten major groups of varieties and hundreds of varieties or cultivars
a sativum var ophioscorodon (link) dll called ophioscorodon or hard necked garlic includes porcelain garlics rocambole garlic and purple stripe garlics it is sometimes considered to be a separate species allium ophioscorodon g.don
a sativum var sativum or soft-necked garlic includes artichoke garlic silverskin garlic and creole garlic
== cultivationedit ==
garlic is easy to grow and can be grown year-round in mild climates while sexual propagation of garlic is indeed possible nearly all of the garlic in cultivation is propagated asexually by planting individual cloves in the ground in cold climates cloves are planted in the autumn about six weeks before the soil freezes and harvested in late spring the cloves must be planted at sufficient depth to prevent freeze/thaw which causes mold or white rot garlic plants are usually very hardy and are not attacked by many pests or diseases garlic plants are said to repel rabbits and moles two of the major pathogens that attack garlic are nematodes and white rot disease which remain in the soil indefinitely after the ground has become infected garlic also can suffer from pink root a typically nonfatal disease that stunts the roots and turns them pink or red
garlic plants can be grown closely together leaving enough space for the bulbs to mature and are easily grown in containers of sufficient depth garlic does well in loose dry well drained soils in sunny locations and is hardy throughout usda climate zones 49 when selecting garlic for planting it is important to pick large bulbs from which to separate cloves large cloves along with proper spacing in the planting bed will also improve bulb size garlic plants prefer to grow in a soil with a high organic material content but are capable of growing in a wide range of soil conditions and ph levels
there are different varieties or subspecies of garlic most notably hardneck garlic and softneck garlic the latitude where the garlic is grown affects the choice of type as garlic can be day-length sensitive hardneck garlic is generally grown in cooler climates softneck garlic is generally grown closer to the equator
garlic scapes are removed to focus all the garlic's energy into bulb growth the scapes can be eaten raw or cooked
=== production trendsedit ===
garlic is grown globally but china is by far the largest producer of garlic with around 20 million tonnes (44 billion pounds) grown annually accounting for over 81% of world output india (4.6%) and south korea (1.4%) follow with egypt (1.2%) on fourth place and the united states (where garlic is grown in every state except for alaska) in ninth place (0.8%) this leaves 11% of global garlic production in countries that each produce less than 2% of global output much of the garlic production in the united states is centered in gilroy california which calls itself the garlic capital of the world
== usesedit ==
=== culinary usesedit ===
garlic is widely used around the world for its pungent flavor as a seasoning or condiment
the garlic plant's bulb is the most commonly used part of the plant with the exception of the single clove types garlic bulbs are normally divided into numerous fleshy sections called cloves garlic cloves are used for consumption (raw or cooked) or for medicinal purposes they have a characteristic pungent spicy flavor that mellows and sweetens considerably with cooking
other parts of the garlic plant are also edible the leaves and flowers (bulbils) on the head (spathe) are sometimes eaten they are milder in flavor than the bulbs and are most often consumed while immature and still tender immature garlic is sometimes pulled rather like a scallion and sold as green garlic when green garlic is allowed to grow past the scallion stage but not permitted to fully mature it may produce a garlic round a bulb like a boiling onion but not separated into cloves like a mature bulb it imparts a garlic flavor and aroma in food minus the spiciness green garlic is often chopped and stir-fried or cooked in soup or hotpot in southeast asian (i.e vietnamese thai lao cambodian singaporean) and chinese cookery and is very abundant and low-priced additionally the immature flower stalks (scapes) of the hardneck and elephant types are sometimes marketed for uses similar to asparagus in stir-fries
inedible or rarely eaten parts of the garlic plant include the skin covering each clove and root cluster the papery protective layers of skin over various parts of the plant are generally discarded during preparation for most culinary uses though in korea immature whole heads are sometimes prepared with the tender skins intact the root cluster attached to the basal plate of the bulb is the only part not typically considered palatable in any form
garlic is a fundamental component in many or most dishes of various regions including eastern asia south asia southeast asia the middle east northern africa southern europe and parts of south and central america the flavor varies in intensity and aroma with the different cooking methods it is often paired with onion tomato or ginger the parchment-like skin is much like the skin of an onion and is typically removed before using in raw or cooked form an alternative is to cut the top off the bulb coat the cloves by dribbling olive oil (or other oil-based seasoning) over them and roast them in an oven garlic softens and can be extracted from the cloves by squeezing the (root) end of the bulb or individually by squeezing one end of the clove in korea heads of garlic are fermented at high temperature the resulting product called black garlic is sweet and syrupy and is now being sold in the united states united kingdom and australia
garlic may be applied to different kinds of bread usually in a medium of butter or oil to create a variety of classic dishes such as garlic bread garlic toast bruschetta crostini and canap
oils can be flavored with garlic cloves these infused oils are used to season all categories of vegetables meats breads and pasta garlic along with fish sauce chopped fresh chilis lime juice sugar and water is a basic essential item in dipping fish sauce a highly used dipping sauce condiment used in indochina in east and southeast asia chili oil with garlic is a popular dipping sauce especially for meat and seafood tuong ot toi viet nam (vietnam chili garlic sauce) is a highly popular condiment and dip across north america and asia
in some cuisines the young bulbs are pickled for three to six weeks in a mixture of sugar salt and spices in eastern europe the shoots are pickled and eaten as an appetizer laba garlic prepared by soaking garlic in vinegar is a type of pickled garlic served with dumplings in northern china to celebrate the chinese new year
lightly smoked garlic is becoming increasingly popular in british and european cuisine it is particularly prized for stuffing poultry and game and in soups and stews in both these cases it is important to utilize the undiscarded skin as much of the smoke flavor is situated there rather than in the cloves themselves
immature scapes are tender and edible they are also known as garlic spears stems or tops scapes generally have a milder taste than the cloves they are often used in stir frying or braised like asparagus garlic leaves are a popular vegetable in many parts of asia the leaves are cut cleaned and then stir-fried with eggs meat or vegetables
mixing garlic with egg yolks and olive oil produces aioli garlic oil and a chunky base produce skordalia blending garlic almond oil and soaked bread produces ajoblanco tzatziki yogurt mixed with garlic and salt is a common sauce in eastern mediterranean cuisines
garlic powder has a different taste from fresh garlic if used as a substitute for fresh garlic 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder is equivalent to one clove of garlic
=== storageedit ===
domestically garlic is stored warm [above 18 c (64 f)] and dry to keep it dormant (lest it sprout) it is traditionally hung softneck varieties are often braided in strands called plaits or grappes peeled cloves may be stored in wine or vinegar in the refrigerator commercially garlic is stored at 0 c (32 f) in a dry low-humidity environment garlic will keep longer if the tops remain attached
garlic is often kept in oil to produce flavored oil however the practice requires measures to be taken to prevent the garlic from spoiling untreated garlic kept in oil can support the growth of clostridium botulinum which causes the deadly botulism illness refrigeration will not assure the safety of garlic kept in oil to reduce this risk the oil should be refrigerated and used within one week according to wikihow the garlic immersed in oil should be stored in the freezer and not the fridge commercially prepared oils are widely available manufacturers add acids or other chemicals to eliminate the risk of botulism in their products two outbreaks of botulism related to garlic stored in oil have been reported
garlic bulbs should be clean and white with a dried neck and outer skin and quite firm under pressure they should be discarded if they are soft or spongy or show signs of mold
=== historical useedit ===
the use of garlic in china dates back to 2000 bc it was consumed by ancient greek and roman soldiers sailors and rural classes (virgil ecologues ii 11) and according to pliny the elder (natural history xix 32) by the african peasantry galen eulogized it as the rustic's theriac (cure-all) (see f adams paulus aegineta p 99) and alexander neckam a writer of the 12th century (see wright's edition of his works p 473 1863) discussed it as a palliative for the heat of the sun in field labor garlic was placed by the ancient greeks on the piles of stones at crossroads as a supper for hecate (theophrastus characters the superstitious man) according to pliny garlic and onions were invoked as deities by the egyptians at the taking of oaths
in his natural history pliny gives a list of scenarios in which garlic was considered beneficial (n.h xx 23) dr t sydenham valued it as an application in confluent smallpox and says cullen (mat med ii p 174 1789) found some dropsies cured by it alone
garlic was rare in traditional english cuisine (though it is said to have been grown in england before 1548) and has been a much more common ingredient in mediterranean europe translations of the c.1300 assize of weights and measures indicate a passage as dealing with standardized units of garlic production sale and taxationthe hundred of 15 ropes of 15 heads eachbut the latin version of the text refers to herring rather than garlic
garlic was used as an antiseptic to prevent gangrene during world wars i and ii
=== nutrientsedit ===
in the typical serving size of 1-3 cloves (3-9 g) garlic provides no significant nutritional value with the content of all essential nutrients below 10% of the daily value (dv) (right table) when expressed per 100 grams garlic contains several nutrients in rich amounts (> 20% dv) including vitamins b6 and c and the dietary minerals manganese and phosphorus per 100 gram serving garlic is also a good source (10-19% dv) of certain b vitamins including thiamine (vitamin b1) and pantothenic acid (vitamin b5) as well as certain dietary minerals including calcium iron and zinc (right table)

==== cardiovascularedit ====
a 2013 meta-analysis concluded that garlic preparations may effectively lower total cholesterol by 1123 mg/dl and ldl cholesterol by 315 mg/dl in adults with high cholesterol if taken for longer than two months the same analysis found that garlic had a marginally positive effect on hdl cholesterol no significant effect on blood triglyceride levels and that garlic preparations were generally well tolerated with very few side effects
a 2012 cochrane review of two randomized controlled trials found that the effect of garlic supplementation on blood pressure is unclear and that there is insufficient evidence to determine if garlic lowers cardiovascular death and disease rates in people with hypertension
as garlic may reduce platelet aggregation patients taking anticoagulant medication are cautioned about consuming garlic
==== canceredit ====
a 2014 meta-analysis of observational epidemiological studies found that garlic consumption is associated with a lower risk of stomach cancer in the korean population similarly a 2013 meta-analysis of case-control studies and cohort studies found limited evidence suggesting an association between higher garlic consumption and a lower risk of prostate cancer however the association was only significant in the case-control studies and the authors noted there was evidence of publication bias
==== common coldedit ====
one news source reported garlic supplements may prevent the common cold but there is insufficient clinical research to confirm this effect a 2014 report in the cochrane database of systematic reviews concluded that there is insufficient clinical trial evidence regarding the effects of garlic in preventing or treating the common cold a single trial suggested that garlic may prevent occurrences of the common cold but more studies are needed to validate this finding claims of effectiveness appear to rely largely on poor-quality evidence. another review reached similar conclusions about the lack of high-quality evidence for the idea that garlic prevents or treats the common cold
=== other usesedit ===
the sticky juice within the bulb cloves is used as an adhesive in mending glass and porcelain an environmentally benign garlic-derived polysulfide product is approved for use in the european union (under annex 1 of 91/414) and the uk as a nematicide and insecticide including for use for control of cabbage root fly and red mite in poultry
garlic along with cinnamon is used as a fish and meat preservative and displays antimicrobial property at temperatures as high as 120 degree celsius the combination can also be used to preserve fried and deep fried foods and in the future might be used in an inner layer of plastic
=== adverse effects and toxicologyedit ===
garlic is known to cause bad breath (halitosis) and body odor described as a pungent garlicky smell to sweat this is caused by allyl methyl sulfide (ams) ams is a volatile liquid which is absorbed into the blood during the metabolism of garlic-derived sulfur compounds from the blood it travels to the lungs (and from there to the mouth causing bad breath see garlic breath) and skin where it is exuded through skin pores washing the skin with soap is only a partial and imperfect solution to the smell studies have shown sipping milk at the same time as consuming garlic can significantly neutralize bad breath mixing garlic with milk in the mouth before swallowing reduced the odor better than drinking milk afterward plain water mushrooms and basil may also reduce the odor the mix of fat and water found in milk however was the most effective
the green dry folds in the center of the garlic clove are especially pungent the sulfur compound allicin produced by crushing or chewing fresh garlic produces other sulfur compounds ajoene allyl polysulfides and vinyldithiins aged garlic lacks allicin but may have some activity due to the presence of s-allylcysteine
some people suffer from allergies to garlic and other species of allium symptoms can include irritable bowel diarrhea mouth and throat ulcerations nausea breathing difficulties and in rare cases anaphylaxis garlic-sensitive patients show positive tests to diallyl disulfide allylpropyldisulfide allylmercaptan and allicin all of which are present in garlic people who suffer from garlic allergies are often sensitive to many plants including onions chives leeks shallots garden lilies ginger and bananas
several reports of serious burns resulting from garlic being applied topically for various purposes including naturopathic uses and acne treatment indicate care must be taken for these uses usually testing a small area of skin using a very low concentration of garlic on the basis of numerous reports of such burns including burns to children topical use of raw garlic as well as insertion of raw garlic into body cavities is discouraged in particular topical application of raw garlic to young children is not advisable the side effects of long-term garlic supplementation are largely unknown and no fda-approved study has been performed possible side effects include gastrointestinal discomfort sweating dizziness allergic reactions bleeding and menstrual irregularities
some breastfeeding mothers have found after consuming garlic that their babies can be slow to feed and have noted a garlic odor coming from them
if higher than recommended doses of garlic are taken with anticoagulant medications this can lead to a higher risk of bleeding garlic may interact with warfarin antiplatelets saquinavir antihypertensives calcium channel blockers quinolone family of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin and hypoglycemic drugs as well as other medications alliums might be toxic to cats or dogs
=== spiritual and religious usesedit ===
garlic has been regarded as a force for both good and evil in europe many cultures have used garlic for protection or white magic perhaps owing to its reputation as a potent preventative medicine central european folk beliefs considered garlic a powerful ward against demons werewolves and vampires to ward off vampires garlic could be worn hung in windows or rubbed on chimneys and keyholes
in iranian countries which celebrate nowruz (persian calendar new year) such as iran the caucasus countries afghanistan and central asian countries such as tajikistan and uzbekistan garlic is one of the items in a seven-seen table a traditional new year's display
in islam it is generally recommended not to eat raw garlic prior to going to the mosque since the odor could distract other muslims during their prayer muhammad himself disliked eating garlic
in both hinduism and jainism garlic is thought to stimulate and warm the body and to increase one's desires some devout hindus generally avoid using garlic and the related onion in the preparation of foods while less devout followers may only observe this for religious festivities and events followers of the jain religion avoid eating garlic and onion on a daily basis
in some buddhist traditions garlic along with the other five pungent spices is understood to stimulate sexual and aggressive drives to the detriment of meditation practice in mahayana buddhism monks and nuns are not allowed to consume garlic or other pungent spices such as chili which are deemed as being earthly pleasures and are viewed as promoting aggression due to their spiciness and pungency
== propertiesedit ==
fresh or crushed garlic yields the sulfur-containing compounds alliin ajoene diallyl polysulfides vinyldithiins s-allylcysteine and enzymes saponins flavonoids and maillard reaction products which are not sulfur-containing compounds
the composition of the bulbs is approximately 84.09% water 13.38% organic matter and 1.53% inorganic matter while the leaves are 87.14% water 11.27% organic matter and 1.59% inorganic matter
the phytochemicals responsible for the sharp flavor of garlic are produced when the plant's cells are damaged when a cell is broken by chopping chewing or crushing enzymes stored in cell vacuoles trigger the breakdown of several sulfur-containing compounds stored in the cell fluids (cytosol) the resultant compounds are responsible for the sharp or hot taste and strong smell of garlic some of the compounds are unstable and continue to react over time among the members of the onion family garlic has by far the highest concentrations of initial reaction products making garlic much more potent than onion shallot or leeks although many humans enjoy the taste of garlic these compounds are believed to have evolved as a defensive mechanism deterring animals such as birds insects and worms from eating the plant because of this people throughout history have used garlic to keep away insects such as mosquitoes and slugs
a large number of sulfur compounds contribute to the smell and taste of garlic allicin has been found to be the compound most responsible for the hot sensation of raw garlic this chemical opens thermo-transient receptor potential channels that are responsible for the burning sense of heat in foods the process of cooking garlic removes allicin thus mellowing its spiciness allicin along with its decomposition products diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide are major contributors to the characteristic odor of garlic with other allicin-derived compounds such as vinyldithiins and ajoene because of its strong odor garlic is sometimes called the stinking rose when eaten in quantity garlic may be strongly evident in the diner's sweat and garlic breath the following day this is because garlic's strong-smelling sulfur compounds are metabolized forming allyl methyl sulfide allyl methyl sulfide (ams) cannot be digested and is passed into the blood it is carried to the lungs and the skin where it is excreted since digestion takes several hours and release of ams several hours more the effect of eating garlic may be present for a long time
the well-known phenomenon of garlic breath is allegedly alleviated by eating fresh parsley the herb is therefore included in many garlic recipes such as pistou persillade and the garlic butter spread used in garlic bread
because of the ams in the bloodstream it is believed by some to act as a mosquito repellent but no clinically reported evidence suggests it is actually effective
abundant sulfur compounds in garlic are also responsible for turning garlic green or blue during pickling and cooking under these conditions (i.e acidity heat) the sulfur-containing compound alliinase react with common amino acids to make pyrroles clusters of carbon-nitrogen rings these rings can be linked together into polypyrrole molecules ring structures absorb particular wavelengths of light and thus appear colored the two-pyrrole molecule looks red the three-pyrrole molecule looks blue and the four-pyrrole molecule looks green (like chlorophyll a tetrapyrrole) like chlorophyll the pyrrole pigments are safe to eat
