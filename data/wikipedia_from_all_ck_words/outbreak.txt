in epidemiology an outbreak is a sudden increase in occurrences of a disease in a particular time and place it may affect a small and localized group or impact upon thousands of people across an entire continent two linked cases of a rare infectious disease may be sufficient to constitute an outbreak outbreaks may also refer to epidemics which affect a region in a country or a group of countries or pandemics which describe global disease outbreaks
== outbreak investigation ==
when investigating disease outbreaks the epidemiology profession has developed a number of widely accepted steps as described by the centers for disease control and prevention these include the following
verify the diagnosis related to the outbreak
identify the existence of the outbreak (is the group of ill persons normal for the time of year geographic area etc.?)
create a case definition to define who/what is included as a case
map the spread of the outbreak using information technology as diagnosis is reported to insurance
develop a hypothesis (what appears to be causing the outbreak?)
study hypothesis (collect data and perform analysis)
refine hypothesis and carry out further study
develop and implement control and prevention systems
release findings to greater communities
outbreak debriefing and review has also been recognized as an additional final step and iterative process by the public health agency of canada
== types ==
there are several outbreak patterns which can be useful in identifying the transmission method or source and predicting the future rate of infection each has a distinctive epidemic curve or histogram of case infections and deaths
common source all victims acquire the infection from the same source (e.g a contaminated water supply).continuous source common source outbreak where the exposure occurs over multiple incubation periods
point source common source outbreak where the exposure occurs in less than one incubation period
propagated transmission occurs from person to person
outbreaks can also be
behavioral risk related (e.g. sexually transmitted diseases increased risk due to malnutrition)
zoonotic the infectious agent is endemic to an animal population
patterns of occurrence are
endemic a communicable disease such as influenza measles mumps pneumonia colds smallpox which is characteristic of a particular place or among a particular group or area of interest or activity
epidemic when this disease is found to infect a significantly larger number of people at the same time than is common at that time and among that population and may spread through one or several communities
pandemic occurs when an epidemic spreads worldwide
== outbreak legislation ==
outbreak legislation is still in its infancy and not many countries have had a direct and complete set of the provisions however some countries do manage the outbreaks using relevant acts such as public health law
