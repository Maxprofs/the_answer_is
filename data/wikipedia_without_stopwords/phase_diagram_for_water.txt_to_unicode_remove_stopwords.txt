overviewedit
common components phase diagram lines equilibrium phase boundaries refer lines mark conditions multiple phases coexist equilibrium phase transitions occur along lines equilibrium
triple points points phase diagrams lines equilibrium intersect triple points mark conditions three different phases coexist example water phase diagram triple point corresponding single temperature pressure solid liquid gaseous water coexist stable equilibrium
