applications distillation
application distillation roughly divided four groups laboratory scale industrial distillation distillation herbs perfumery medicinals herbal distillate food processing latter two distinctively different former two processing beverages herbs distillation used true purification method transfer volatiles source materials distillate
main difference laboratory scale distillation industrial distillation laboratory scale distillation often performed batchwise whereas industrial distillation often occurs continuously batch distillation composition source material vapors distilling compounds distillate change distillation batch distillation still charged supplied batch feed mixture separated component fractions collected sequentially volatile less volatile bottoms remaining least nonvolatile fraction removed end still recharged process repeated
continuous distillation source materials vapors distillate kept constant composition carefully replenishing source material removing fractions vapor liquid system results better control separation process
idealized distillation model
boiling point liquid temperature vapor pressure liquid equals pressure around liquid enabling bubbles form without crushed special case normal boiling point vapor pressure liquid equals ambient atmospheric pressure
common misconception liquid mixture given pressure component boils boiling point corresponding given pressure vapors component collect separately purely however occur even idealized system idealized models distillation essentially governed raoults law daltons law assume vaporliquid equilibria attained
raoults law states vapor pressure solution dependent vapor pressure chemical component solution fraction solution component makes aka mole fraction law applies ideal solutions solutions different components whose molecular interactions similar pure solutions
daltons law states total pressure sum partial pressures individual component mixture multicomponent liquid heated vapor pressure component rise thus causing total vapor pressure rise total vapor pressure reaches pressure surrounding liquid boiling occurs liquid turns gas throughout bulk liquid note mixture given composition one boiling point given pressure components mutually soluble mixture constant composition multiple boiling points
implication one boiling point lighter components never cleanly boil first boiling point volatile components boil component percentage vapor percentage total vapor pressure lighter components higher partial pressure thus concentrated vapor heavier volatile components also smaller partial pressure necessarily evaporate also albeit less concentrated vapor indeed batch distillation fractionation succeed varying composition mixture batch distillation batch evaporates changes composition fractionation liquid higher fractionation column contains lights boils lower temperatures therefore starting given mixture appears boiling range instead boiling point although composition changes intermediate mixture singular boiling point
idealized model accurate case chemically similar liquids benzene toluene cases severe deviations raoults law daltons law observed famously mixture ethanol water compounds heated together form azeotrope composition boiling point higher lower boiling point separate liquid virtually liquids mixed heated display azeotropic behaviour although computational methods used estimate behavior mixture arbitrary components way obtain accurate vaporliquid equilibrium data measurement
possible completely purify mixture components distillation would require component mixture zero partial pressure ultrapure products goal chemical separation must applied binary mixture evaporated component eg salt zero partial pressure practical purposes process simpler called evaporation engineering
batch distillation

result ratio liquid mixture changing becoming richer component b causes boiling point mixture rise turn results rise temperature vapor results changing ratio b gas phase distillation continues increasing proportion b gas phase results slowly changing ratio b distillate
difference vapor pressure two components b large generally expressed difference boiling points mixture beginning distillation highly enriched component component distilled boiling liquid enriched component b
continuous distillation
continuous distillation ongoing distillation liquid mixture continuously without interruption fed process separated fractions removed continuously output streams occur time operation continuous distillation produces minimum two output fractions including least one volatile distillate fraction boiled separately captured vapor condensed liquid always bottoms residue fraction least volatile residue separately captured condensed vapor
continuous distillation differs batch distillation respect concentrations change time continuous distillation run steady state arbitrary amount time source material specific composition main variables affect purity products continuous distillation reflux ratio number theoretical equilibrium stages practice determined number trays height packing reflux flow condenser back column generates recycle allows better separation given number trays equilibrium stages ideal steps compositions achieve vaporliquid equilibrium repeating separation process allowing better separation given reflux ratio column high reflux ratio may fewer stages refluxes large amount liquid giving wide column large holdup conversely column low reflux ratio must large number stages thus requiring taller column
