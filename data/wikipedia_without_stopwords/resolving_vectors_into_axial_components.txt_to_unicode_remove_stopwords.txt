thermodynamics term exothermic process exo outside describes process reaction releases energy system usually form heat also form light eg spark flame flash electricity eg battery sound eg explosion heard burning hydrogen etymology stems greek prefix ex means outwards greek word thermiks means thermal term exothermic first coined marcellin berthelot opposite exothermic process endothermic process one absorbs energy form heat
concept frequently applied physical sciences chemical reactions chemical bond energy converted thermal energy heat
exothermic endothermic describe two types chemical reactions systems found nature follows
simply stated exothermic reaction energy released surroundings absorbed initiate maintain reaction example would burning candle wherein sum calories produced combustion found looking radiant heating surroundings visible light produced including increase temperature fuel wax oxygen become hot co water vapor exceeds number calories absorbed initially lighting flame flame maintaining ie energy produced combustion reabsorbed used melting vaporizing wax etc far outstripped energy produced breaking carbonhydrogen bonds combination oxygen resulting carbon hydrogen
hand endothermic reaction system energy taken surroundings course reaction example endothermic reaction first aid cold pack reaction two chemicals dissolving one another requires calories surroundings reaction cools pouch surroundings absorbing heat endothermic system seen production wood trees absorb radiant energy sun use endothermic reactions taking apart co ho combining carbon hydrogen generated produce cellulose organic chemicals products form wood say may later burned fireplace exothermically producing co water releasing energy form heat light surroundings eg homes interior chimney gasses
overview
exothermic refers transformation system releases energy heat surroundings expressed
q
transformation occurs constant pressure one enthalpy
h
constant volume one internal energy
u
adiabatic system ie system exchange heat surroundings exothermic process results increase temperature system
exothermic chemical reactions heat released reaction takes form electromagnetic energy transition electrons one quantum energy level another causes light released light equivalent energy stabilization energy energy chemical reaction ie bond energy light released absorbed molecules solution give rise molecular vibrations rotations gives rise classical understanding heat contrast endothermic reactions occur energy absorbed place electron higher energy state electron associate another atom form chemical complex net energy absorbed endothermic reaction exothermic reaction energy needed start reaction less energy subsequently released net release energy physical understanding exothermic endothermic reactions

contrast thermodynamic biological terminology
historical accident students encounter source possible confusion terminology physics biology whereas thermodynamic terms exothermic endothermic respectively refer processes give heat energy processes absorb heat energy biology sense effectively inverted metabolic terms ectothermic endothermic respectively refer organisms rely largely external heat achieve full working temperature organisms produce heat within major factor controlling bodily temperature
