groundwater (or ground water) is the water present beneath earth's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations a unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water the depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table groundwater is recharged from and eventually flows to the surface naturally natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps and can form oases or wetlands groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural municipal and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells the study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology also called groundwater hydrology
typically groundwater is thought of as water flowing through shallow aquifers but in the technical sense it can also contain soil moisture permafrost (frozen soil) immobile water in very low permeability bedrock and deep geothermal or oil formation water groundwater is hypothesized to provide lubrication that can possibly influence the movement of faults it is likely that much of earth's subsurface contains some water which may be mixed with other fluids in some instances groundwater may not be confined only to earth the formation of some of the landforms observed on mars may have been influenced by groundwater there is also evidence that liquid water may also exist in the subsurface of jupiter's moon europa
groundwater is often cheaper more convenient and less vulnerable to pollution than surface water therefore it is commonly used for public water supplies for example groundwater provides the largest source of usable water storage in the united states and california annually withdraws the largest amount of groundwater of all the states underground reservoirs contain far more water than the capacity of all surface reservoirs and lakes in the us including the great lakes many municipal water supplies are derived solely from groundwater
polluted groundwater is less visible but more difficult to clean up than pollution in rivers and lakes groundwater pollution most often results from improper disposal of wastes on land major sources include industrial and household chemicals and garbage landfills excessive fertilizers and pesticides used in agriculture industrial waste lagoons tailings and process wastewater from mines oil field brine pits leaking underground oil storage tanks and pipelines sewage sludge and septic systems
== aquifers ==
an aquifer is a layer of porous substrate that contains and transmits groundwater when water can flow directly between the surface and the saturated zone of an aquifer the aquifer is unconfined the deeper parts of unconfined aquifers are usually more saturated since gravity causes water to flow downward
the upper level of this saturated layer of an unconfined aquifer is called the water table or phreatic surface below the water table where in general all pore spaces are saturated with water is the phreatic zone
substrate with low porosity that permits limited transmission of groundwater is known as an aquitard an aquiclude is a substrate with porosity that is so low it is virtually impermeable to groundwater
a confined aquifer is an aquifer that is overlain by a relatively impermeable layer of rock or substrate such as an aquiclude or aquitard if a confined aquifer follows a downward grade from its recharge zone groundwater can become pressurized as it flows this can create artesian wells that flow freely without the need of a pump and rise to a higher elevation than the static water table at the above unconfined aquifer
the characteristics of aquifers vary with the geology and structure of the substrate and topography in which they occur in general the more productive aquifers occur in sedimentary geologic formations by comparison weathered and fractured crystalline rocks yield smaller quantities of groundwater in many environments unconsolidated to poorly cemented alluvial materials that have accumulated as valley-filling sediments in major river valleys and geologically subsiding structural basins are included among the most productive sources of groundwater
the high specific heat capacity of water and the insulating effect of soil and rock can mitigate the effects of climate and maintain groundwater at a relatively steady temperature in some places where groundwater temperatures are maintained by this effect at about 10 c (50 f) groundwater can be used for controlling the temperature inside structures at the surface for example during hot weather relatively cool groundwater can be pumped through radiators in a home and then returned to the ground in another well during cold seasons because it is relatively warm the water can be used in the same way as a source of heat for heat pumps that is much more efficient than using air
the volume of groundwater in an aquifer can be estimated by measuring water levels in local wells and by examining geologic records from well-drilling to determine the extent depth and thickness of water-bearing sediments and rocks before an investment is made in production wells test wells may be drilled to measure the depths at which water is encountered and collect samples of soils rock and water for laboratory analyses pumping tests can be performed in test wells to determine flow characteristics of the aquifer
== water cycle ==
groundwater makes up about twenty percent of the world's fresh water supply which is about 0.61% of the entire world's water including oceans and permanent ice global groundwater storage is roughly equal to the total amount of freshwater stored in the snow and ice pack including the north and south poles this makes it an important resource that can act as a natural storage that can buffer against shortages of surface water as in during times of drought
groundwater is naturally replenished by surface water from precipitation streams and rivers when this recharge reaches the water table
groundwater can be a long-term reservoir of the natural water cycle (with residence times from days to millennia) as opposed to short-term water reservoirs like the atmosphere and fresh surface water (which have residence times from minutes to years) the figure shows how deep groundwater (which is quite distant from the surface recharge) can take a very long time to complete its natural cycle
the great artesian basin in central and eastern australia is one of the largest confined aquifer systems in the world extending for almost 2 million km2 by analysing the trace elements in water sourced from deep underground hydrogeologists have been able to determine that water extracted from these aquifers can be more than 1 million years old
by comparing the age of groundwater obtained from different parts of the great artesian basin hydrogeologists have found it increases in age across the basin where water recharges the aquifers along the eastern divide ages are young as groundwater flows westward across the continent it increases in age with the oldest groundwater occurring in the western parts this means that in order to have travelled almost 1000 km from the source of recharge in 1 million years the groundwater flowing through the great artesian basin travels at an average rate of about 1 metre per year
recent research has demonstrated that evaporation of groundwater can play a significant role in the local water cycle especially in arid regions scientists in saudi arabia have proposed plans to recapture and recycle this evaporative moisture for crop irrigation in the opposite photo a 50-centimeter-square reflective carpet made of small adjacent plastic cones was placed in a plant-free dry desert area for five months without rain or irrigation it managed to capture and condense enough ground vapor to bring to life naturally buried seeds underneath it with a green area of about 10% of the carpet area it is expected that if seeds were put down before placing this carpet a much wider area would become green
== issues ==
=== overview ===
certain problems have beset the use of groundwater around the world just as river waters have been over-used and polluted in many parts of the world so too have aquifers the big difference is that aquifers are out of sight the other major problem is that water management agencies when calculating the sustainable yield of aquifer and river water have often counted the same water twice once in the aquifer and once in its connected river this problem although understood for centuries has persisted partly through inertia within government agencies in australia for example prior to the statutory reforms initiated by the council of australian governments water reform framework in the 1990s many australian states managed groundwater and surface water through separate government agencies an approach beset by rivalry and poor communication
in general the time lags inherent in the dynamic response of groundwater to development have been ignored by water management agencies decades after scientific understanding of the issue was consolidated in brief the effects of groundwater overdraft (although undeniably real) may take decades or centuries to manifest themselves in a classic study in 1982 bredehoeft and colleagues modeled a situation where groundwater extraction in an intermontane basin withdrew the entire annual recharge leaving nothing for the natural groundwater-dependent vegetation community even when the borefield was situated close to the vegetation 30% of the original vegetation demand could still be met by the lag inherent in the system after 100 years by year 500 this had reduced to 0% signalling complete death of the groundwater-dependent vegetation the science has been available to make these calculations for decades however in general water management agencies have ignored effects that will appear outside the rough timeframe of political elections (3 to 5 years) marios sophocleous argued strongly that management agencies must define and use appropriate timeframes in groundwater planning this will mean calculating groundwater withdrawal permits based on predicted effects decades sometimes centuries in the future
as water moves through the landscape it collects soluble salts mainly sodium chloride where such water enters the atmosphere through evapotranspiration these salts are left behind in irrigation districts poor drainage of soils and surface aquifers can result in water tables coming to the surface in low-lying areas major land degradation problems of soil salinity and waterlogging result combined with increasing levels of salt in surface waters as a consequence major damage has occurred to local economies and environments
four important effects are worthy of brief mention first flood mitigation schemes intended to protect infrastructure built on floodplains have had the unintended consequence of reducing aquifer recharge associated with natural flooding second prolonged depletion of groundwater in extensive aquifers can result in land subsidence with associated infrastructure damage as well as third saline intrusion fourth draining acid sulphate soils often found in low-lying coastal plains can result in acidification and pollution of formerly freshwater and estuarine streams
another cause for concern is that groundwater drawdown from over-allocated aquifers has the potential to cause severe damage to both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in some cases very conspicuously but in others quite imperceptibly because of the extended period over which the damage occurs
=== overdraft ===
groundwater is a highly useful and often abundant resource however over-use or overdraft can cause major problems to human users and to the environment the most evident problem (as far as human groundwater use is concerned) is a lowering of the water table beyond the reach of existing wells as a consequence wells must be drilled deeper to reach the groundwater in some places (e.g. california texas and india) the water table has dropped hundreds of feet because of extensive well pumping in the punjab region of india for example groundwater levels have dropped 10 meters since 1979 and the rate of depletion is accelerating a lowered water table may in turn cause other problems such as groundwater-related subsidence and saltwater intrusion
groundwater is also ecologically important the importance of groundwater to ecosystems is often overlooked even by freshwater biologists and ecologists groundwaters sustain rivers wetlands and lakes as well as subterranean ecosystems within karst or alluvial aquifers
not all ecosystems need groundwater of course some terrestrial ecosystems for example those of the open deserts and similar arid environments exist on irregular rainfall and the moisture it delivers to the soil supplemented by moisture in the air while there are other terrestrial ecosystems in more hospitable environments where groundwater plays no central role groundwater is in fact fundamental to many of the worlds major ecosystems water flows between groundwaters and surface waters most rivers lakes and wetlands are fed by and (at other places or times) feed groundwater to varying degrees groundwater feeds soil moisture through percolation and many terrestrial vegetation communities depend directly on either groundwater or the percolated soil moisture above the aquifer for at least part of each year hyporheic zones (the mixing zone of streamwater and groundwater) and riparian zones are examples of ecotones largely or totally dependent on groundwater
=== subsidence ===
subsidence occurs when too much water is pumped out from underground deflating the space below the above-surface and thus causing the ground to collapse the result can look like craters on plots of land this occurs because in its natural equilibrium state the hydraulic pressure of groundwater in the pore spaces of the aquifer and the aquitard supports some of the weight of the overlying sediments when groundwater is removed from aquifers by excessive pumping pore pressures in the aquifer drop and compression of the aquifer may occur this compression may be partially recoverable if pressures rebound but much of it is not when the aquifer gets compressed it may cause land subsidence a drop in the ground surface the city of new orleans louisiana is actually below sea level today and its subsidence is partly caused by removal of groundwater from the various aquifer/aquitard systems beneath it in the first half of the 20th century the san joaquin valley experienced significant subsidence in some places up to 8.5 metres (28 feet) due to groundwater removal cities on river deltas including venice in italy and bangkok in thailand have experienced surface subsidence mexico city built on a former lake bed has experienced rates of subsidence of up to 40 cm (1'3") per year
=== seawater intrusion ===
in general in very humid or undeveloped regions the shape of the water table mimics the slope of the surface the recharge zone of an aquifer near the seacoast is likely to be inland often at considerable distance in these coastal areas a lowered water table may induce sea water to reverse the flow toward the land sea water moving inland is called a saltwater intrusion in alternative fashion salt from mineral beds may leach into the groundwater of its own accord
=== pollution ===
polluted groundwater is less visible but more difficult to clean up than pollution in rivers and lakes groundwater pollution most often results from improper disposal of wastes on land major sources include industrial and household chemicals and garbage landfills industrial waste lagoons tailings and process wastewater from mines oil field brine pits leaking underground oil storage tanks and pipelines sewage sludge and septic systems polluted groundwater is mapped by sampling soils and groundwater near suspected or known sources of pollution to determine the extent of the pollution and to aid in the design of groundwater remediation systems preventing groundwater pollution near potential sources such as landfills requires lining the bottom of a landfill with watertight materials collecting any leachate with drains and keeping rainwater off any potential contaminants along with regular monitoring of nearby groundwater to verify that contaminants have not leaked into the groundwater
groundwater pollution from pollutants released to the ground that can work their way down into groundwater can create a contaminant plume within an aquifer pollution can occur from landfills naturally occurring arsenic on-site sanitation systems or other point sources such as petrol stations or leaking sewers
movement of water and dispersion within the aquifer spreads the pollutant over a wider area its advancing boundary often called a plume edge which can then intersect with groundwater wells or daylight into surface water such as seeps and springs making the water supplies unsafe for humans and wildlife different mechanism have influence on the transport of pollutants e.g diffusion adsorption precipitation decay in the groundwater the interaction of groundwater contamination with surface waters is analyzed by use of hydrology transport models
the danger of pollution of municipal supplies is minimized by locating wells in areas of deep groundwater and impermeable soils and careful testing and monitoring of the aquifer and nearby potential pollution sources
== government regulations ==
in the united states laws regarding ownership and use of groundwater are generally state laws however regulation of groundwater to minimize pollution of groundwater is by both states and the federal-level environmental protection agency ownership and use rights to groundwater typically follow one of three main systems
=== rule of capture ===
the rule of capture provides each landowner the ability to capture as much groundwater as they can put to a beneficial use but they are not guaranteed any set amount of water as a result well-owners are not liable to other landowners for taking water from beneath their land state laws or regulations will often define beneficial use and sometimes place other limits such as disallowing groundwater extraction which causes subsidence on neighboring property
=== riparian rights ===
limited private ownership rights similar to riparian rights in a surface stream the amount of groundwater right is based on the size of the surface area where each landowner gets a corresponding amount of the available water once adjudicated the maximum amount of the water right is set but the right can be decreased if the total amount of available water decreases as is likely during a drought landowners may sue others for encroaching upon their groundwater rights and water pumped for use on the overlying land takes preference over water pumped for use off the land
=== environmental protection of groundwater ===
in november 2006 the environmental protection agency published the groundwater rule in the united states federal register the epa was worried that the groundwater system would be vulnerable to contamination from fecal matter the point of the rule was to keep microbial pathogens out of public water sources the 2006 groundwater rule was an amendment of the 1996 safe drinking water act
=== others ===
==== reasonable use rule (american rule) ====
this rule does not guarantee the landowner a set amount of water but allows unlimited extraction as long as the result does not unreasonably damage other wells or the aquifer system usually this rule gives great weight to historical uses and prevents new uses that interfere with the prior use
==== groundwater scrutiny upon real estate property transactions in the us ====
in the us upon commercial real estate property transactions both groundwater and soil are the subjects of scrutiny with a phase i environmental site assessment normally being prepared to investigate and disclose potential pollution issues in the san fernando valley of california real estate contracts for property transfer below the santa susana field laboratory (ssfl) and eastward have clauses releasing the seller from liability for groundwater contamination consequences from existing or future pollution of the valley aquifer
