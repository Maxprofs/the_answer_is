simple case dynamic equilibrium occurs constant velocity motion across surface kinetic friction situation force applied direction motion kinetic friction force exactly opposes applied force results zero net force since object started nonzero velocity continues move nonzero velocity aristotle misinterpreted motion caused applied force however kinetic friction taken consideration clear net force causing constant velocity motion
forces quantum mechanics
notion force keeps meaning quantum mechanics though one dealing operators instead classical variables though physics described schrdinger equation instead newtonian equations consequence results measurement sometimes quantized ie appear discrete portions course difficult imagine context forces however potentials vxyz fields forces generally derived treated similar classical position variables ie
becomes different framework quantum field theory fields also quantized
however already quantum mechanics one caveat namely particles acting onto possess spatial variable also discrete intrinsic angular momentumlike variable called spin pauli principle relating space spin variables depending value spin identical particles split two different classes fermions bosons two identical fermions eg electrons symmetric spin function eg parallel spins spatial variables must antisymmetric ie exclude places much repulsive force vice versa ie antiparallel spins position variables must symmetric ie appearant force must attractive thus case two fermions strictly negative correlation spatial spin variables whereas two bosons eg quanta electromagnetic waves photons correlation strictly positive
thus notion force loses already part meaning
