the goldfish (carassius auratus) is a freshwater fish in the family cyprinidae of order cypriniformes it was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated and is one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish
a relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp) the goldfish is a domesticated version of a less-colourful carp (carassius auratus) native to east asia it was first domesticated in china more than a thousand years ago and several distinct breeds have since been developed goldfish breeds vary greatly in size body shape fin configuration and colouration (various combinations of white yellow orange red brown and black are known)
the mutation that gave rise to the domestic goldfish is also known from other cyprinid species such as common carp and tench
== historyedit ==
starting in ancient china various species of carp (collectively known as asian carp) have been domesticated and reared as food fish for thousands of years some of these normally gray or silver species have a tendency to produce red orange or yellow colour mutations this was first recorded during the jin dynasty (265420)
during the tang dynasty (618907) it was popular to raise carp in ornamental ponds and watergardens a natural genetic mutation produced gold (actually yellowish orange) rather than silver colouration people began to breed the gold variety instead of the silver variety keeping them in ponds or other bodies of water on special occasions at which guests were expected they would be moved to a much smaller container for display
by the song dynasty (9601279) the domestication of goldfish was firmly established in 1162 the empress of the song dynasty ordered the construction of a pond to collect the red and gold variety by this time people outside the imperial family were forbidden to keep goldfish of the gold (yellow) variety yellow being the imperial colour this is probably the reason why there are more orange goldfish than yellow goldfish even though the latter are genetically easier to breed the occurrence of other colours (apart from red and gold) was first recorded in 1276
during the ming dynasty (13681644) goldfish also began to be raised indoors which allowed mutations weakening the fishes cold resistance to persist the first occurrence of fancy-tailed goldfish was recorded in the ming dynasty in 1603 goldfish were introduced to japan in 1611 goldfish were introduced to portugal and from there to other parts of europe
during the 1620s goldfish were highly regarded in southern europe because of their metallic scales and symbolised good luck and fortune it became tradition for married men to give their wives a goldfish on their one-year anniversary as a symbol for the prosperous years to come this tradition quickly died as goldfish became more available losing their status goldfish were first introduced to north america around 1850 and quickly became popular in the united states
== classificationedit ==
=== varietiesedit ===
selective breeding over centuries has produced several colour variations some of them far removed from the golden colour of the originally domesticated fish there are also different body shapes fin and eye configurations some extreme versions of the goldfish live only in aquariumsthey are much less hardy than varieties closer to the wild original however some variations are hardier such as the shubunkin currently there are about 300 breeds recognised in china the vast majority of goldfish breeds today originated from china some of the main varieties are
=== chinese goldfish classificationedit ===
chinese tradition classifies goldfish into four main types these classifications are not commonly used in the west
crucian (may also be called grass")goldfish without fancy anatomical features these include the common goldfish comet goldfish and shubunkin
wengoldfish have a fancy tail e.g. fantails and veiltails ("wen is also the name of the characteristic headgrowth on such strains as oranda and lionhead)
dragon eyegoldfish have extended eyes e.g. black moor bubble eye and telescope eye
egggoldfish have no dorsal fin and usually have an egg-shaped body e.g. lionhead (note that a bubble eye without a dorsal fin belongs to this group)
=== related speciesedit ===
goldfish were bred from prussian carp (carassius auratus gibelio) in china and these usually olive green fsh remain the closest wild relative of the goldfish previously some sources claimed the crucian carp (carassius carassius) as the wild version of the goldfish however they are differentiated by several characteristics c auratus have a more pointed snout while the snout of a c carassius is well rounded c a gibelio often has a grey/greenish colour while crucian carp are always golden bronze juvenile crucian carp have a black spot on the base of the tail which disappears with age in c auratus this tail spot is never present c auratus have fewer than 31 scales along the lateral line while crucian carp have 33 scales or more
like their wild ancestors common and comet goldfish as well as shubunkin can survive and even thrive in any climate that can support a pond whereas fancy goldfish are unlikely to survive in the wild as their bright colours and long fins make them easy prey goldfish can hybridise with certain other species of carp as well as c a gibelio within three breeding generations the vast majority of the hybrid spawn revert to the wild type colour koi may also interbreed with the goldfish to produce sterile hybrids
== biologyedit ==
=== sizeedit ===
as of april 2008 the largest goldfish in the world was believed by the bbc to measure 19 inches (48 cm) and be living in the netherlands at the time a goldfish named goldie kept as a pet in a tank in folkestone england was measured as 15 inches (38 cm) and over 2 pounds (0.91 kg) and named as the second largest in the world behind the netherlands fish the secretary of the federation of british aquatic societies (fbas) stated of goldie's size that i would think there are probably a few bigger goldfish that people don't think of as record holders perhaps in ornamental lakes in july 2010 a goldfish measuring 16 inches (41 cm) and 5 pounds (2.3 kg) was caught in a pond in poole england thought to have been abandoned there after outgrowing a tank
=== visionedit ===
goldfish have one of the most studied senses of vision in fishes goldfish have four kinds of cone cells which are respectively sensitive to different colours red green blue and ultraviolet the ability to distinguish between four different primary colours classifies them as tetrachromats
=== cognitive abilitiesedit ===
goldfish have strong associative learning abilities as well as social learning skills in addition their visual acuity allows them to distinguish between individual humans owners may notice that fish react favorably to them (swimming to the front of the glass swimming rapidly around the tank and going to the surface mouthing for food) while hiding when other people approach the tank over time goldfish learn to associate their owners and other humans with food often begging for food whenever their owners approach
goldfish that have constant visual contact with humans also stop considering them to be a threat after being kept in a tank for several weeks sometimes months it becomes possible to feed a goldfish by hand without it shying away
goldfish have a memory-span of at least three months and can distinguish between different shapes colours and sounds by using positive reinforcement goldfish can be trained to recognise and to react to light signals of different colours or to perform tricks fish respond to certain colours most evidently in relation to feeding fish learn to anticipate feedings provided they occur at around the same time every day
=== behaviouredit ===
goldfish are gregarious displaying schooling behaviour as well as displaying the same types of feeding behaviours goldfish may display similar behaviours when responding to their reflections in a mirror
goldfish have learned behaviours both as groups and as individuals that stem from native carp behaviour they are a generalist species with varied feeding breeding and predator avoidance behaviours that contribute to their success as fish they can be described as friendly towards each other very rarely does a goldfish harm another goldfish nor do the males harm the females during breeding the only real threat that goldfish present to each other is competing for food commons comets and other faster varieties can easily eat all the food during a feeding before fancy varieties can reach it this can lead to stunted growth or possible starvation of fancier varieties when they are kept in a pond with their single-tailed brethren as a result care should be taken to combine only breeds with similar body type and swim characteristics
==== feedingedit ====
in the wild the diet of goldfish consists of crustaceans insects and various plant matter like most fish they are opportunistic feeders and do not stop eating on their own accord overfeeding can be deleterious to their health typically by blocking the intestines this happens most often with selectively bred goldfish which have a convoluted intestinal tract when excess food is available they produce more waste and faeces partly due to incomplete protein digestion overfeeding can sometimes be diagnosed by observing faeces trailing from the fish's cloaca
goldfish-specific food has less protein and more carbohydrate than conventional fish food enthusiasts may supplement this diet with shelled peas (with outer skins removed) blanched green leafy vegetables and bloodworms young goldfish benefit from the addition of brine shrimp to their diet as with all animals goldfish preferences vary
==== reproductionedit ====
goldfish may only grow to sexual maturity with enough water and the right nutrition most goldfish breed in captivity particularly in pond settings breeding usually happens after a significant temperature change often in spring males chase gravid female goldfish (females carrying eggs) and prompt them to release their eggs by bumping and nudging them
goldfish like all cyprinids are egg-layers their eggs are adhesive and attach to aquatic vegetation typically dense plants such as cabomba or elodea or a spawning mop the eggs hatch within 48 to 72 hours
within a week or so the fry begins to assume its final shape although a year may pass before they develop a mature goldfish colour until then they are a metallic brown like their wild ancestors in their first weeks of life the fry grow quicklyan adaptation born of the high risk of getting devoured by the adult goldfish (or other fish and insects) in their environment pregnant goldfish are called twit
some highly bred goldfish can no longer breed naturally due to their altered shape the artificial breeding method called hand stripping can assist nature but can harm the fish if not done correctly in captivity adults may also eat young that they encounter
== cultivationedit ==
=== in aquariaedit ===
like most species in the carp family goldfish produce a large amount of waste both in their faeces and through their gills releasing harmful chemicals into the water build-up of this waste to toxic levels can occur in a relatively short period of time and can easily cause a goldfish's death for common and comet varieties each goldfish should have about 20 us gallons (76 l 17 imp gal) of water fancy goldfish (which are smaller) should have about 10 us gallons (38 l 8.3 imp gal) per goldfish the water surface area determines how much oxygen diffuses and dissolves into the water a general rule is have 1 square foot (0.093 m2) active aeration by way of a water pump filter or fountain effectively increases the surface area
the goldfish is classified as a coldwater fish and can live in unheated aquaria at a temperature comfortable for humans however rapid changes in temperature (for example in an office building in winter when the heat is turned off at night) can kill them especially if the tank is small care must also be taken when adding water as the new water may be of a different temperature temperatures under about 10 c (50 f) are dangerous to fancy varieties though commons and comets can survive slightly lower temperatures extremely high temperatures (over 30 c (86 f) can also harm goldfish however higher temperatures may help fight protozoan infestations by accelerating the parasite's life-cyclethus eliminating it more quickly the optimum temperature for goldfish is between 20 c (68 f) and 22 c (72 f)
like all fish goldfish do not like to be petted in fact touching a goldfish can endanger its health because it can cause the protective slime coat to be damaged or removed exposing the fishs skin to infection from bacteria or water-born parasites however goldfish respond to people by surfacing at feeding time and can be trained or acclimated to taking pellets or flakes from human fingers the reputation of goldfish dying quickly is often due to poor care the lifespan of goldfish in captivity can extend beyond 10 years
if left in the dark for a period of time goldfish gradually change colour until they are almost gray goldfish produce pigment in response to light in a similar manner to how human skin becomes tanned in the sun fish have cells called chromatophores that produce pigments which reflect light and give the fish colouration the colour of a goldfish is determined by which pigments are in the cells how many pigment molecules there are and whether the pigment is grouped inside the cell or is spaced throughout the cytoplasm
because goldfish eat live plants their presence in a planted aquarium can be problematic only a few aquarium plant species for example cryptocoryne and anubias can survive around goldfish but they require special attention so that they are not uprooted plastic plants are more durable
=== in pondsedit ===
goldfish are popular pond fish since they are small inexpensive colourful and very hardy in an outdoor pond or water garden they may even survive for brief periods if ice forms on the surface as long as there is enough oxygen remaining in the water and the pond does not freeze solid common goldfish london and bristol shubunkins jikin wakin comet and some hardier fantail goldfish can be kept in a pond all year round in temperate and subtropical climates moor veiltail oranda and lionhead can be kept safely in outdoor ponds year-round only in more tropical climates and only in summer elsewhere
ponds small and large are fine in warmer areas (although it ought to be noted that goldfish can overheat in small volumes of water in summer in tropical climates) in frosty climes the depth should be at least 80 centimeters (31 in) to preclude freezing during winter goldfish become sluggish stop eating and often stay on the bottom of the pond this is normal they become active again in the spring unless the pond is large enough to maintain its own ecosystem without interference from humans a filter is important to clear waste and keep the pond clean plants are essential as they act as part of the filtration system as well as a food source for the fish plants are further beneficial since they raise oxygen levels in the water
compatible fish include rudd tench orfe and koi but the latter require specialised care ramshorn snails are helpful by eating any algae that grows in the pond without some form of animal population control goldfish ponds can easily become overstocked fish such as orfe consume goldfish eggs
=== for mosquito controledit ===
like some other popular aquarium fish such as the guppy goldfish and other carp are frequently added to stagnant bodies of water to reduce mosquito populations they are used to prevent the spread of west nile virus which relies on mosquitoes to migrate however introducing goldfish has often had negative consequences for local ecosystems
== welfare concernsedit ==
some countries ban the sale of traditional fishbowls under animal welfare legislation due to the risk of stunting deoxygenation and ammonia/nitrite poisoning in such a small environment because of their large oxygen needs and high waste output such bowls are no longer considered appropriate housing for goldfish
in many countries carnival and fair operators commonly give goldfish away in plastic bags as prizes in late 2005 rome banned the use of goldfish and other animals as carnival prizes rome has also banned the use of goldfish bowls on animal cruelty grounds as well as monza italy in 2004 in the united kingdom the government proposed banning this practice as part of its animal welfare bill though this has since been amended to only prevent goldfish being given as prizes to unaccompanied minors
in japan during summer festivals and religious holidays (ennichi) a traditional game called goldfish scooping is played in which a player scoops goldfish from a basin with a special scooper sometimes bouncy balls are substituted for goldfish
although edible and closely related to some fairly widely eaten species goldfish are rarely eaten a fad among american college students for many years was swallowing goldfish as a stunt and as a fraternity initiation process the first recorded instance was in 1939 at harvard university the practice gradually fell out of popularity over the course of several decades and is rarely practiced today
in iran and among the international iranian diaspora goldfish are a traditional part of nowruz celebrations some animal advocates have called for boycotts of goldfish purchases citing industrial farming and low survival rates of the fish
