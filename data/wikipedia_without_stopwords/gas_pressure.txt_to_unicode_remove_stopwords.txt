vapor pressure
vapor pressure pressure vapor equilibrium nonvapor phases ie liquid solid often term used describe liquids tendency evaporate measure tendency molecules atoms escape liquid solid liquids atmospheric pressure boiling point corresponds temperature vapor pressure equal surrounding atmospheric pressure often called normal boiling point
higher vapor pressure liquid given temperature lower normal boiling point liquid
vapor pressure chart displayed graphs vapor pressures versus temperatures variety liquids seen chart liquids highest vapor pressures lowest normal boiling points
example given temperature methyl chloride highest vapor pressure liquids chart also lowest normal boiling point c vapor pressure curve methyl chloride blue line intersects horizontal pressure line one atmosphere atm absolute vapor pressure
