== controversy ==
the show when aired in the united kingdom on the channel vh1 uk caused a small controversy when adverts were banned from london underground stations the posters in question depicted jerry hall holding a leash surrounded by several young semi-dressed men and this violated london underground's policy of adverts featuring people as sex objects however the posters were on display in other locations including mainline railway stations
