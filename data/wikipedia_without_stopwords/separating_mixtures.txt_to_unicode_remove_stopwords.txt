chemistry chemical engineering separation process separation technique simply separation method achieve mass transfer phenomenon converts mixture substances two distinct product mixtures may referred fractions least one enriched one mixtures constituents cases separation may fully divide mixture pure constituents separations carried based differences chemical properties physical properties size shape mass density chemical affinity constituents mixture often classified according particular differences use achieve separation usually physical movement substantial chemical modification single difference used accomplish desired separation multiple operations often performed combination achieve desired end
exceptions elements compounds naturally found impure state often impure raw materials must separated purified components put productive use making separation techniques essential modern industrial economy cases separations require total purification electrolysis refining bauxite ore aluminum metal good example incomplete separation technique oil refining crude oil occurs naturally mixture various hydrocarbons impurities refining process splits mixture valuable mixtures natural gas gasoline chemical feedstocks none pure substances must separated raw crude cases series separations necessary obtain desired end products case oil refining crude subjected long series individual distillation steps produces different product intermediate
purpose separation may analytical ie help analyze components original mixture without attempt save fractions may preparative ie prepare fractions samples components saved separation done small scale effectively laboratory scale analytical preparative purposes large scale effectively industrial scale preparative purposes intermediate scale
chromatographyedit
paper chromatography movement substance mixture depends two factors solubility substance solvent adsorption substance filter paper substance moves solvent easily substance soluble solvent solids attract substances hold surface called adsorption solids called adsorbents substance move solvent easily substance mixture strongly absorbed filter paper since neither substance adsorption solubility travels different distance along filter paperand two separate
substances separated chromatography need colored colorless substances made visible spraying paper locating agent reacts colorless substances produce color labs use chromatography identify substances mixture hospital labs example use technique determine patient diabetes identifying sugar urine chromatography also identifies dyes used food
list separation techniquesedit
adsorption adhesion atoms ions molecules gas liquid dissolved solids surface
capillary electrophoresis
centrifugation cyclonic separation separates based density differences
chromatography separates dissolved substances different interaction ie travel material
