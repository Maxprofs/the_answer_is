the hypothalamus (from greek  under and  room chamber") is a portion of the brain that contains a number of small nuclei with a variety of functions one of the most important functions of the hypothalamus is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland (hypophysis)
the hypothalamus is located below the thalamus just above the brainstem and is part of the limbic system in the terminology of neuroanatomy it forms the ventral part of the diencephalon all vertebrate brains contain a hypothalamus in humans it is the size of an almond
the hypothalamus is responsible for certain metabolic processes and other activities of the autonomic nervous system it synthesizes and secretes certain neurohormones often called releasing hormones or hypothalamic hormones and these in turn stimulate or inhibit the secretion of pituitary hormones the hypothalamus controls body temperature hunger important aspects of parenting and attachment behaviors thirst fatigue sleep and circadian rhythms
== structureedit ==
the hypothalamus is a brain structure made up of distinct nuclei as well as less anatomically distinct areas it is found in all vertebrate nervous systems in mammals magnocellular neurosecretory cells in the paraventricular nucleus and the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus produce oxytocin and vasopressin these hormones are released into the blood in the posterior pituitary much smaller parvocellular neurosecretory cells neurons of the paraventricular nucleus release corticotropin-releasing hormone and other hormones into the hypophyseal portal system where these hormones diffuse to the anterior pituitary
=== nucleiedit ===
the hypothalamic nuclei include the following
see also ventrolateral preoptic nucleus periventricular nucleus
=== neural connectionsedit ===
the hypothalamus is highly interconnected with other parts of the central nervous system in particular the brainstem and its reticular formation as part of the limbic system it has connections to other limbic structures including the amygdala and septum and is also connected with areas of the autonomous nervous system
the hypothalamus receives many inputs from the brainstem the most notable from the nucleus of the solitary tract the locus coeruleus and the ventrolateral medulla
most nerve fibres within the hypothalamus run in two ways (bidirectional)
projections to areas caudal to the hypothalamus go through the medial forebrain bundle the mammillotegmental tract and the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus
projections to areas rostral to the hypothalamus are carried by the mammillothalamic tract the fornix and terminal stria
projections to areas of the sympathetic motor system (lateral horn spinal segments t1-l2/l3) are carried by the hypothalamospinal tract and they activate the sympathetic motor pathway
=== sexual dimorphismedit ===
several hypothalamic nuclei are sexually dimorphic i.e. there are clear differences in both structure and function between males and females
some differences are apparent even in gross neuroanatomy most notable is the sexually dimorphic nucleus within the preoptic area however most of the differences are subtle changes in the connectivity and chemical sensitivity of particular sets of neurons
the importance of these changes can be recognised by functional differences between males and females for instance males of most species prefer the odor and appearance of females over males which is instrumental in stimulating male sexual behavior if the sexually dimorphic nucleus is lesioned this preference for females by males diminishes also the pattern of secretion of growth hormone is sexually dimorphic and this is one reason why in many species adult males are much larger than females
responsiveness to ovarian steroids
other striking functional dimorphisms are in the behavioral responses to ovarian steroids of the adult males and females respond to ovarian steroids in different ways partly because the expression of estrogen-sensitive neurons in the hypothalamus is sexually dimorphic i.e. estrogen receptors are expressed in different sets of neurons
estrogen and progesterone can influence gene expression in particular neurons or induce changes in cell membrane potential and kinase activation leading to diverse non-genomic cellular functions estrogen and progesterone bind to their cognate nuclear hormone receptors which translocate to the cell nucleus and interact with regions of dna known as hormone response elements (hres) or get tethered to another transcription factor's binding site estrogen receptor (er) has been shown to transactivate other transcription factors in this manner despite the absence of an estrogen response element (ere) in the proximal promoter region of the gene in general ers and progesterone receptors (prs) are gene activators with increased mrna and subsequent protein synthesis following hormone exposure
male and female brains differ in the distribution of estrogen receptors and this difference is an irreversible consequence of neonatal steroid exposure estrogen receptors (and progesterone receptors) are found mainly in neurons in the anterior and mediobasal hypothalamus notably
the preoptic area (where lhrh neurons are located)
the periventricular nucleus (where somatostatin neurons are located)
the ventromedial hypothalamus (which is important for sexual behavior)
=== developmentedit ===
in neonatal life gonadal steroids influence the development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus for instance they determine the ability of females to exhibit a normal reproductive cycle and of males and females to display appropriate reproductive behaviors in adult life
if a female rat is injected once with testosterone in the first few days of postnatal life (during the critical period of sex-steroid influence) the hypothalamus is irreversibly masculinized the adult rat will be incapable of generating an lh surge in response to estrogen (a characteristic of females) but will be capable of exhibiting male sexual behaviors (mounting a sexually receptive female)
by contrast a male rat castrated just after birth will be feminized and the adult will show female sexual behavior in response to estrogen (sexual receptivity lordosis behavior)
in primates the developmental influence of androgens is less clear and the consequences are less understood within the brain testosterone is aromatized to (estradiol) which is the principal active hormone for developmental influences the human testis secretes high levels of testosterone from about week 8 of fetal life until 56 months after birth (a similar perinatal surge in testosterone is observed in many species) a process that appears to underlie the male phenotype estrogen from the maternal circulation is relatively ineffective partly because of the high circulating levels of steroid-binding proteins in pregnancy
sex steroids are not the only important influences upon hypothalamic development in particular pre-pubertal stress in early life (of rats) determines the capacity of the adult hypothalamus to respond to an acute stressor unlike gonadal steroid receptors glucocorticoid receptors are very widespread throughout the brain in the paraventricular nucleus they mediate negative feedback control of crf synthesis and secretion but elsewhere their role is not well understood
== functionedit ==
=== hormone releaseedit ===
the hypothalamus has a central neuroendocrine function most notably by its control of the anterior pituitary which in turn regulates various endocrine glands and organs releasing hormones (also called releasing factors) are produced in hypothalamic nuclei then transported along axons to either the median eminence or the posterior pituitary where they are stored and released as needed
anterior pituitary
in the hypothalamicadenohypophyseal axis releasing hormones also known as hypophysiotropic or hypothalamic hormones are released from the median eminence a prolongation of the hypothalamus into the hypophyseal portal system which carries them to the anterior pituitary where they exert their regulatory functions on the secretion of adenohypopyseal hormones
other hormones secreted from the median eminence include vasopressin oxytocin and neurotensin
posterior pituitary
in the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal axis neurohypophysial hormones are released from the posterior pituitary which is actually a prolongation of the hypothalamus into the circulation
it is also known that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (hpa) hormones are related to certain skin diseases and skin homeostasis there is evidence linking hyperactivity of hpa hormones to stress-related skin diseases and skin tumors
=== stimulationedit ===
the hypothalamus coordinates many hormonal and behavioural circadian rhythms complex patterns of neuroendocrine outputs complex homeostatic mechanisms and important behaviours the hypothalamus must therefore respond to many different signals some of which generated externally and some internally delta wave signalling arising either in the thalamus or in the cortex influences the secretion of releasing hormones ghrh and prolactin are stimulated whilst trh is inhibited
the hypothalamus is responsive to
light daylength and photoperiod for regulating circadian and seasonal rhythms
olfactory stimuli including pheromones
steroids including gonadal steroids and corticosteroids
neurally transmitted information arising in particular from the heart the stomach and the reproductive tract
autonomic inputs
blood-borne stimuli including leptin ghrelin angiotensin insulin pituitary hormones cytokines plasma concentrations of glucose and osmolarity etc
stress
invading microorganisms by increasing body temperature resetting the body's thermostat upward
==== olfactory stimuliedit ====
olfactory stimuli are important for sexual reproduction and neuroendocrine function in many species for instance if a pregnant mouse is exposed to the urine of a strange male during a critical period after coitus then the pregnancy fails (the bruce effect) thus during coitus a female mouse forms a precise olfactory memory of her partner that persists for several days pheromonal cues aid synchronisation of oestrus in many species in women synchronised menstruation may also arise from pheromonal cues although the role of pheromones in humans is disputed
==== blood-borne stimuliedit ====
peptide hormones have important influences upon the hypothalamus and to do so they must pass through the bloodbrain barrier the hypothalamus is bounded in part by specialized brain regions that lack an effective bloodbrain barrier the capillary endothelium at these sites is fenestrated to allow free passage of even large proteins and other molecules some of these sites are the sites of neurosecretion - the neurohypophysis and the median eminence however others are sites at which the brain samples the composition of the blood two of these sites the sfo (subfornical organ) and the ovlt (organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis) are so-called circumventricular organs where neurons are in intimate contact with both blood and csf these structures are densely vascularized and contain osmoreceptive and sodium-receptive neurons that control drinking vasopressin release sodium excretion and sodium appetite they also contain neurons with receptors for angiotensin atrial natriuretic factor endothelin and relaxin each of which important in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance neurons in the ovlt and sfo project to the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus and also to preoptic hypothalamic areas the circumventricular organs may also be the site of action of interleukins to elicit both fever and acth secretion via effects on paraventricular neurons
it is not clear how all peptides that influence hypothalamic activity gain the necessary access in the case of prolactin and leptin there is evidence of active uptake at the choroid plexus from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) some pituitary hormones have a negative feedback influence upon hypothalamic secretion for example growth hormone feeds back on the hypothalamus but how it enters the brain is not clear there is also evidence for central actions of prolactin
findings have suggested that thyroid hormone (t4) is taken up by the hypothalamic glial cells in the infundibular nucleus/ median eminence and that it is here converted into t3 by the type 2 deiodinase (d2) subsequent to this t3 is transported into the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh)-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus thyroid hormone receptors have been found in these neurons indicating that they are indeed sensitive to t3 stimuli in addition these neurons expressed mct8 a thyroid hormone transporter supporting the theory that t3 is transported into them t3 could then bind to the thyroid hormone receptor in these neurons and affect the production of thyrotropin-releasing hormone thereby regulating thyroid hormone production
the hypothalamus functions as a type of thermostat for the body it sets a desired body temperature and stimulates either heat production and retention to raise the blood temperature to a higher setting or sweating and vasodilation to cool the blood to a lower temperature all fevers result from a raised setting in the hypothalamus elevated body temperatures due to any other cause are classified as hyperthermia rarely direct damage to the hypothalamus such as from a stroke will cause a fever this is sometimes called a hypothalamic fever however it is more common for such damage to cause abnormally low body temperatures
==== steroidsedit ====
the hypothalamus contains neurons that react strongly to steroids and glucocorticoids (the steroid hormones of the adrenal gland released in response to acth) it also contains specialized glucose-sensitive neurons (in the arcuate nucleus and ventromedial hypothalamus) which are important for appetite the preoptic area contains thermosensitive neurons these are important for trh secretion
==== neuraledit ====
oxytocin secretion in response to suckling or vagino-cervical stimulation is mediated by some of these pathways vasopressin secretion in response to cardiovascular stimuli arising from chemoreceptors in the carotid body and aortic arch and from low-pressure atrial volume receptors is mediated by others in the rat stimulation of the vagina also causes prolactin secretion and this results in pseudo-pregnancy following an infertile mating in the rabbit coitus elicits reflex ovulation in the sheep cervical stimulation in the presence of high levels of estrogen can induce maternal behavior in a virgin ewe these effects are all mediated by the hypothalamus and the information is carried mainly by spinal pathways that relay in the brainstem stimulation of the nipples stimulates release of oxytocin and prolactin and suppresses the release of lh and fsh
cardiovascular stimuli are carried by the vagus nerve the vagus also conveys a variety of visceral information including for instance signals arising from gastric distension or emptying to suppress or promote feeding by signalling the release of leptin or gastrin respectively again this information reaches the hypothalamus via relays in the brainstem
in addition hypothalamic function is responsive toand regulated bylevels of all three classical monoamine neurotransmitters noradrenaline dopamine and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in those tracts from which it receives innervation for example noradrenergic inputs arising from the locus coeruleus have important regulatory effects upon corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh) levels
=== control of food intakeedit ===
the extreme lateral part of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus is responsible for the control of food intake stimulation of this area causes increased food intake bilateral lesion of this area causes complete cessation of food intake medial parts of the nucleus have a controlling effect on the lateral part bilateral lesion of the medial part of the ventromedial nucleus causes hyperphagia and obesity of the animal further lesion of the lateral part of the ventromedial nucleus in the same animal produces complete cessation of food intake
there are different hypotheses related to this regulation
lipostatic hypothesis this hypothesis holds that adipose tissue produces a humoral signal that is proportionate to the amount of fat and acts on the hypothalamus to decrease food intake and increase energy output it has been evident that a hormone leptin acts on the hypothalamus to decrease food intake and increase energy output
gutpeptide hypothesis gastrointestinal hormones like grp glucagons cck and others claimed to inhibit food intake the food entering the gastrointestinal tract triggers the release of these hormones which act on the brain to produce satiety the brain contains both cck-a and cck-b receptors
glucostatic hypothesis the activity of the satiety center in the ventromedial nuclei is probably governed by the glucose utilization in the neurons it has been postulated that when their glucose utilization is low and consequently when the arteriovenous blood glucose difference across them is low the activity across the neurons decrease under these conditions the activity of the feeding center is unchecked and the individual feels hungry food intake is rapidly increased by intraventricular administration of 2-deoxyglucose therefore decreasing glucose utilization in cells
thermostatic hypothesis according to this hypothesis a decrease in body temperature below a given set-point stimulates appetite whereas an increase above the set-point inhibits appetite
=== fear processingedit ===
the medial zone of hypothalamus is part of a circuitry that controls motivated behaviors like defensive behaviors analyses of fos-labeling showed that a series of nuclei in the behavioral control column is important in regulating the expression of innate and conditioned defensive behaviors
antipredatory defensive behavior
exposure to a predator (such as a cat) elicits defensive behaviors in laboratory rodents even when the animal has never been exposed to a cat in the hypothalamus this exposure causes an increase in fos-labeled cells in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial nucleus and in the ventrolateral part of the premammillary nucleus (pmdvl) the premammillary nucleus has an important role in expression of defensive behaviors towards a predator since lesions in this nucleus abolish defensive behaviors like freezing and flight the pmd does not modulate defensive behavior in other situations as lesions of this nucleus had minimal effects on post-shock freezing scores the pmd has important connections to the dorsal periaqueductal gray an important structure in fear expression in addition animals display risk assessment behaviors to the environment previously associated with the cat fos-labeled cell analysis showed that the pmdvl is the most activated structure in the hypothalamus and inactivation with muscimol prior to exposure to the context abolishes the defensive behavior therefore the hypothalamus mainly the pmdvl has an important role in expression of innate and conditioned defensive behaviors to a predator
social defeat
likewise the hypothalamus has a role in social defeat nuclei in medial zone are also mobilized during an encounter with an aggressive conspecific the defeated animal has an increase in fos levels in sexually dimorphic structures such as the medial pre-optic nucleus the ventrolateral part of ventromedial nucleus and the ventral premammilary nucleus such structures are important in other social behaviors such as sexual and aggressive behaviors moreover the premammillary nucleus also is mobilized the dorsomedial part but not the ventrolateral part lesions in this nucleus abolish passive defensive behavior like freezing and the on-the-back posture
=== sexual orientationedit ===
according to d f swaab writing in a july 2008 paper neurobiological research related to sexual orientation in humans is only just gathering momentum but the evidence already shows that humans have a vast array of brain differences not only in relation to gender but also in relation to sexual orientation.
swaab first reported on the relationship between sexual orientation in males and the hypothalamus's clock the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn) in 1990 swaab and hofman reported that the suprachiasmatic nucleus in homosexual men was significantly larger than in heterosexual men then in 1995 swaab et al linked brain development to sexual orientation by treating male rats both pre- and postnatally with atd an aromatase blocker in the brain this produced an enlarged scn and bisexual behavior in the adult male rats in 1991 levay showed that part of the sexually dimorphic nucleus (sdn) known as the 3rd interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (inah 3) is nearly twice as large (in terms of volume) in heterosexual men than in homosexual men and heterosexual women however a study in 1992 has shown that the sexually dimorph nucleus of the preoptic area which include the inah3 are of similar size in homosexual males who died of aids to heterosexual males and therefore larger than female this clearly contradicts the hypothesis that homosexual males have a female hypothalamus furthermore the scn of homosexual males is extremely large (both the volume and the number of neurons are twice as many as in heterosexual males) these areas of the hypothalamus have not yet been explored in homosexual females nor bisexual males nor females although the functional implications of such findings still haven't been examined in detail they cast serious doubt over the widely accepted drner hypothesis that homosexual males have a female hypothalamus and that the key mechanism of differentiating the male brain from originally female brain is the epigenetic influence of testosterone during prenatal development
in 2004 and 2006 two studies by berglund lindstrm and savic used positron emission tomography (pet) to observe how the hypothalamus responds to smelling common odors the scent of testosterone found in male sweat and the scent of estrogen found in female urine these studies showed that the hypothalamus of heterosexual men and homosexual women both respond to estrogen also the hypothalamus of homosexual men and heterosexual women both respond to testosterone the hypothalamus of all four groups did not respond to the common odors which produced a normal olfactory response in the brain
== clinical significanceedit ==
=== diseaseedit ===
hypothalamic disease a neuro-immunological disease fibromyalgia appears to be some disorder of hypothalamus all the issues of this disease except muscle stiffness is explainable by abnormal functioning of hypothalamus for example low metabolism loss of appetite changed emotional behavior infertility memory loss low tsh resulting in hypothyroidism lower serotonin and dopamine levels sleep disorder
