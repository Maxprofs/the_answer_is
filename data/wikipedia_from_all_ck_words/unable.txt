uncle (from latin avunculus little grandfather the diminutive of avus grandfather") is a family relationship or kinship within an extended family an uncle is the brother brother-in-law or half-brother of one's parent a biological uncle is a second degree relative and shares 25% genetic overlap
a great-uncle (sometimes written as great uncle grand-uncle or granduncle) is the brother or brother-in-law of one's grandparent
a woman with an equivalent relationship is an aunt and the reciprocal relationship is that of a nephew or niece
in some cultures and families children may refer to the cousins of their parents as aunt or uncle it is also a title of respect for elders (for example older cousins neighbors acquaintances close family friends as well as total strangers) using this term in this way is a form of fictive kinship
in some cultures like slavic or persian cultures no single inclusive term describing both a person's kinship to their parental male sibling or parental male in-law exists instead there are specific terms describing a person's kinship to their mother's brother ("daiyee in persian) or a person's kinship to their father's brother ("amou in persian)
an analogous differentiation exists in modern persian using separate terms to describe a person's kinship to their mother's female sibling ("khaleh") and a person's kinship to their father's female sibling ("ammeh")
furthermore in persian culture the terms used to describe a person's kinship to their maternal or paternal in-laws bear clear and unambiguous descriptions of that relationship differentiating the parental in-laws from blood-relatives for example there is a specific term describing a person's kinship to the spouse of their paternal uncle (i.e zan-amou literally wife-of- amou) this clarifies that kinship is to the spouse of the person's paternal male sibling as opposed to a blood-relationship
uncles and aunts are considered important in modern irish culture and are usually chosen to be godfather or godmother of children during catholic baptism a young irish person might seek the counsel of their favourite aunt or uncle before making an important decision and the opinion of the respective aunt or uncle is treated seriously
