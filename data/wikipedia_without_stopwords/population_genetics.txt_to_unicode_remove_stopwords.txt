historyedit
population genetics began reconciliation mendelian inheritance biostatistics models key step work british biologist statistician ronald fisher series papers starting culminating book genetical theory natural selection fisher showed continuous variation measured biometricians could produced combined action many discrete genes natural selection could change allele frequencies population resulting evolution series papers beginning another british geneticist jbs haldane worked mathematics allele frequency change single gene locus broad range conditions haldane also applied statistical analysis realworld examples natural selection peppered moth evolution industrial melanism showed selection coefficients could larger fisher assumed leading rapid adaptive evolution
american biologist sewall wright background animal breeding experiments focused combinations interacting genes effects inbreeding small relatively isolated populations exhibited genetic drift wright introduced concept adaptive landscape argued genetic drift inbreeding could drive small isolated subpopulation away adaptive peak allowing natural selection drive towards different adaptive peaks

genetic driftedit
genetic drift change allele frequencies caused random sampling alleles offspring random sample parents genetic drift may cause gene variants disappear completely thereby reduce genetic variability contrast natural selection makes gene variants common less common depending reproductive success changes due genetic drift driven environmental adaptive pressures may beneficial neutral detrimental reproductive success
effect genetic drift larger alleles present copies allele present many copies scientists wage vigorous debates relative importance genetic drift compared natural selection ronald fisher held view genetic drift plays minor role evolution remained dominant view several decades motoo kimura rekindled debate neutral theory molecular evolution claims changes genetic material caused neutral mutations genetic drift role genetic drift means sampling error evolution criticized john h gillespie provine argue selection linked sites important stochastic force

mutationedit
mutation ultimate source genetic variation form new alleles mutation result several different types change dna sequences either effect alter product gene prevent gene functioning studies fly drosophila melanogaster suggest mutation changes protein produced gene probably harmful percent mutations damaging effects remainder either neutral weakly beneficial
mutations involve large sections dna becoming duplicated usually genetic recombination duplications major source raw material evolving new genes tens hundreds genes duplicated animal genomes every million years genes belong larger families genes shared ancestry novel genes produced several methods commonly duplication mutation ancestral gene recombining parts different genes form new combinations new functions domains act modules particular independent function mixed together produce genes encoding new proteins novel properties example human eye uses four genes make structures sense light three color vision one night vision four arose single ancestral gene another advantage duplicating gene even entire genome increases redundancy allows one gene pair acquire new function copy performs original function types mutation occasionally create new genes previously noncoding dna
addition major source variation mutation may also function mechanism evolution different probabilities molecular level different mutations occur process known mutation bias two genotypes example one nucleotide g another nucleotide position fitness mutation g happens often mutation g genotypes tend evolve different insertion vs deletion mutation biases different taxa lead evolution different genome sizes developmental mutational biases also observed morphological evolution example according phenotypefirst theory evolution mutations eventually cause genetic assimilation traits previously induced environment
mutation bias effects superimposed processes selection would favor either one two mutations extra advantage mutation occurs frequently one likely become fixed population mutations leading loss function gene much common mutations produce new fully functional gene loss function mutations selected selection weak mutation bias towards loss function affect evolution example pigments longer useful animals live darkness caves tend lost kind loss function occur mutation bias andor function cost benefit function disappeared natural selection leads loss loss sporulation ability bacterium laboratory evolution appears caused mutation bias rather natural selection cost maintaining sporulation ability selection loss function speed loss evolves depends mutation rate effective population size indicating driven mutation bias genetic drift
evolution mutation rateedit
due damaging effects mutations cells organisms evolved mechanisms dna repair remove mutations therefore optimal mutation rate species tradeoff costs high mutation rate deleterious mutations metabolic costs maintaining systems reduce mutation rate dna repair enzymes viruses use rna genetic material rapid mutation rates advantage since viruses evolve constantly rapidly thus evade defensive responses eg human immune system
gene flow transferedit
gene flow exchange genes populations usually species examples gene flow within species include migration breeding organisms exchange pollen gene transfer species includes formation hybrid organisms horizontal gene transfer
migration population change allele frequencies well introducing genetic variation population immigration may add new genetic material established gene pool population conversely emigration may remove genetic material population genetic models used reconstruct history gene flow populations
reproductive isolationedit
barriers reproduction two diverging populations required populations become new species gene flow may slow process spreading genetic differences populations gene flow hindered mountain ranges oceans deserts even manmade structures great wall china hindered flow plant genes
depending far two species diverged since recent common ancestor may still possible produce offspring horses donkeys mating produce mules hybrids generally infertile due two different sets chromosomes unable pair meiosis case closely related species may regularly interbreed hybrids selected species remain distinct however viable hybrids occasionally formed new species either properties intermediate parent species possess totally new phenotype importance hybridization creating new species animals unclear although cases seen many types animals gray tree frog particularly wellstudied example
hybridization however important means speciation plants since polyploidy two copies chromosome tolerated plants readily animals polyploidy important hybrids allows reproduction two different sets chromosomes able pair identical partner meiosis polyploids also genetic diversity allows avoid inbreeding depression small populations
genetic structureedit
physical barriers migration along limited tendency individuals move spread vagility tendency remain come back natal place philopatry natural populations rarely interbreed convenient theoretical random models panmixy buston et al usually geographic range within individuals closely related one another randomly selected general population described extent population genetically structured repaci et al genetic structuring caused migration due historical climate change species range expansion current availability habitat
