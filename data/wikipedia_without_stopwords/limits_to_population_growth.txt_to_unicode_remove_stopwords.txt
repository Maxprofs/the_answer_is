predator satiation less commonly called predator saturation antipredator adaptation prey occur high population densities reducing probability individual organism eaten predators flooded potential prey consume certain amount occurring high densities prey benefit safety numbers effect strategy evolved diverse range prey including notably many species plants insects fish predator satiation considered type refuge predators
available food increases predator chances survival growth reproduction however food supply begins overwhelm predators ability consume process consumption levels pattern evident functional response type ii also limits population growth numerical response dependent generation time predator species
phenomenon particularly conspicuous takes form masting production large numbers seeds population plants
periodical cicada magicicada species erupt large numbers larval stage intervals years prime numbers high density sites research finds number eaten birds increase number cicada individuals risk predation individual decreases
contrast predator satiation different pattern seen response mutualistic consumers benefit organism feeding frugivores disperse seeds example vines berries may ripen different times ensuring frugivores swamped food resulting larger proportion seeds dispersed
