opened was founded in august 2012 with the purpose of providing a catalog of educational resources and aligning them to common core and other standards the opened cataloging process is not consistent with the current industry standard of crowdsourcing and curating individually rather opened has implemented the use of algorithms for automated alignment of resources combined with professional educator curators to validate those alignments the process allows for a bigger scale of aligned content at present moment the site contains over 750,000 resources most of them aligned to the common core
the site also initially launched with the goal of providing materials cataloged to common core and later expanded to include other standards such as next generation science standards opened is continuing to add other standards such as uk and singapore standards
