== historyedit ==
wood is one of mankind's oldest building materials the ability to shape wood improved with technological advances from the stone age to the bronze age to the iron age some of the oldest archaeological evidence of carpentry are water well casings built using split oak timbers with mortise and tenon and notched corners excavated in eastern germany dating from about 7,000 years ago in the early neolithic period
relatively little information about carpentry is available from pre-history (before written language) or even recent centuries because the knowledge and skills were passed down person to person rarely in writing until the printing press was invented in the 15th century and builders began regularly publishing guides and pattern books in the 18th and 19th centuries the oldest surviving complete architectural text is vitruvius ten books collectively titled de architectura which discusses some carpentry
some of the oldest surviving wooden buildings in the world are the temples in china such as the nanchan temple built in the year 782 the greensted church parts of which are from the 11th century the stave churchs in norway from the 12th and 13th centuries
by the 16th century sawmills were coming into use in europe the founding of america was partly based on a desire to extract resources from the new continent including wood for use in ships and buildings in europe in the 18th century part of the industrial revolution was the invention of the steam engine and cut nails these technologies combined with the invention of the circular saw led to the development of balloon framing which was the beginning of the decline of traditional timber framing the 19th century saw the development of electrical engineering and distribution which allowed the development of hand-held power tools wire nails and machines to mass-produce screws in the 20th century portland cement came into common use and concrete foundations allowed carpenters to do away with heavy timber sills also drywall came into common use replacing lime plaster on wooden lath plywood engineered lumber and chemically treated lumber also came into use

== trainingedit ==
carpentry requires training which involves both acquiring knowledge and physical practice in formal training a carpenter begins as an apprentice then becomes a journeyman and with enough experience and competency can eventually attain the status of a master carpenter today pre-apprenticeship training may be gained through non-union vocational programs such as high school shop classes and community colleges
informally a laborer may simply work alongside carpenters for years learning skills by observation and peripheral assistance while such an individual may obtain journeyman status by paying the union entry fee and obtaining a journeyman's card (which provides the right to work on a union carpentry crew) the carpenter foreman will by necessity dismiss any worker who presents the card but does not demonstrate the expected skill level
carpenters may work for an employer or be self-employed no matter what kind of training a carpenter has had some u s states require contractors to be licensed which requires passing a written test and having minimum levels of insurance

upon completion of pre-apprenticeship trainees who have successfully passed the graded curriculum (taught by highly experienced journeyman carpenters) are assigned to a local union and to union carpentry crews at work on construction sites or in cabinet shops as first year apprentices over the next four years as they progress in status to second year third year and fourth year apprentice apprentices periodically return to the training facility every three months for a week of more detailed training in specific aspects of the trade
