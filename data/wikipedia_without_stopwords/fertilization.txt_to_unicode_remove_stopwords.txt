fertilization plantsedit
gametes participate fertilization plants sperm male egg cell flowering plants second fertilization event involves another sperm cell central cell second female gamete flowering plants two sperm pollen grain
seed plants pollination pollen grain germinates pollen tube grows penetrates ovule tiny pore called micropyle sperm transferred pollen pollen tube
bryophytesedit
bryophyte traditional name used refer embryophytes land plants true vascular tissue therefore called nonvascular plants bryophytes specialized tissues transport water however since contain lignin considered true vascular tissue
fernsedit
fern member group roughly species vascular plants reproduce via spores neither seeds flowers differ mosses vascular ie waterconducting vessels stems leaves like vascular plants ferns called fiddleheads expand fronds delicately divided
gymnospermsedit
gymnosperms group seedproducing plants includes conifers cycads ginkgo gnetales term gymnosperm comes greek composite word gymnos naked sperma seed meaning naked seeds unenclosed condition seeds called ovules unfertilized state naked condition stands contrast seeds ovules flowering plants angiosperms enclosed within ovary gymnosperm seeds develop either surface scales leaves often modified form cones end short stalks ginkgo
flowering plantsedit
pollen tube directly reach ovary straight line travels near skin style curls bottom ovary near receptacle breaks ovule micropyle opening ovule wall pollen tube bursts embryo sac
fertilised ovary starts swell develop fruit multiseeded fruits multiple grains pollen necessary syngamy ovule growth pollen tube controlled vegetative tube cytoplasm hydrolytic enzymes secreted pollen tube digest female tissue tube grows stigma style digested tissue used nutrient source pollen tube grows pollen tube growth toward ovary generative nucleus divides produce two separate sperm nuclei haploid number chromosomes growing pollen tube therefore contains three separate nuclei two sperm one tube sperms interconnected dimorphic large one number plants also linked tube nucleus interconnected sperm tube nucleus form male germ unit
double fertilisation process angiosperms flowering plants two sperm pollen tube fertilise two cells female gametophyte sometimes called embryo sac inside ovule pollen tube enters gametophyte pollen tube nucleus disintegrates two sperm cells released one two sperm cells fertilises egg cell bottom gametophyte near micropyle forming diploid n zygote point fertilisation actually occurs pollination fertilisation two separate processes nucleus sperm cell fuses two haploid polar nuclei contained central cell centre gametophyte resulting cell triploid n triploid cell divides mitosis forms endosperm nutrientrich tissue inside seed
two centralcell maternal nuclei polar nuclei contribute endosperm arise mitosis single meiotic product also gave rise egg therefore maternal contribution genetic constitution triploid endosperm double embryo

internal vs externaledit
consideration whether animal specifically vertebrate uses internal external fertilization often dependent method birth oviparous animals laying eggs thick calcium shells chickens thick leathery shells generally reproduce via internal fertilisation sperm fertilises egg without pass thick protective tertiary layer egg ovoviviparous viviparous animals also use internal fertilisation important note although organisms reproduce via amplexus may still use internal fertilisation salamanders advantages internal fertilisation include minimal waste gametes greater chance individual egg fertilisation relatively longer time period egg protection selective fertilisation many females ability store sperm extended periods time fertilise eggs desire
oviparous animals producing eggs thin tertiary membranes membranes hand use external fertilisation methods advantages external fertilisation include minimal contact transmission bodily fluids decreasing risk disease transmission greater genetic variation especially broadcast spawning external fertilisation methods
sea urchinsedit
sperm find eggs via chemotaxis type ligandreceptor interaction resact amino acid peptide purified jelly coat punctulata attracts migration sperm
finding egg sperm penetrates jelly coat process called sperm activation another ligandreceptor interaction oligosaccharide component egg binds activates receptor sperm causes acrosomal reaction acrosomal vesicles sperm fuse plasma membrane released process molecules bound acrosomal vesicle membrane bindin exposed surface sperm contents digest jelly coat eventually vitelline membrane addition release acrosomal vesicles explosive polymerisation actin form thin spike head sperm called acrosomal process
sperm binds egg another ligand reaction receptors vitelline membrane sperm surface protein bindin binds receptor vitelline membrane identified ebr
fusion plasma membranes sperm egg likely mediated bindin site contact fusion causes formation fertilisation cone
mammalsedit
mammals internally fertilise copulation male ejaculates many sperm move upper vagina via contractions vagina cervix across length uterus meet ovum cases fertilisation occurs female usually ovulates period extends hours copulation days therefore mammals common ejaculation precede ovulation vice versa
capacitated spermatozoon oocyte meet interact ampulla fallopian tube thermotactic chemotactic gradients involved guiding sperm towards egg final stage sperm migration spermatozoa respond see sperm thermotaxis temperature gradient c oviduct ampulla chemotactic gradients progesterone confirmed signal emanating cumulus oophorus cells surrounding rabbit human oocytes capacitated hyperactivated sperm respond gradients changing behaviour moving towards cumulusoocyte complex chemotactic signals formyl metleuphe fmlf may also guide spermatozoa

allogamy also known crossfertilization refers fertilization egg cell one individual male gamete another
autogamy also known selffertilization occurs hermaphroditic organisms plants flatworms therein two gametes one individual fuse
variants bisexual reproductionedit
relatively unusual forms reproduction
gynogenesis sperm stimulates egg develop without fertilization syngamy sperm may enter egg
hybridogenesis one genome eliminated produce haploid eggs
canina meiosis sometimes called permanent odd polyploidy one genome transmitted mendelian fashion others transmitted clonally
benefits crossfertilizationedit
major benefit crossfertilisation generally regarded avoidance inbreeding depression charles darwin book effects cross self fertilization vegetable kingdom pages summed findings following way
shown present volume offspring union two distinct individuals especially progenitors subjected different conditions immense advantage height weight constitutional vigour fertility selffertilised offspring one parents fact amply sufficient account development sexual elements genesis two sexes
addition thought longterm advantage outcrossing nature increased genetic variability promotes adaptation andor avoidance extinction see genetic variability
