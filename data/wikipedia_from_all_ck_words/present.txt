the present (or now) is the time that is associated with the events perceived directly and within the past week and a half not as a recollection (perceived more than once) or a speculation (predicted hypothesis uncertain) it is a period of time between the past and the future and can vary in meaning from being an instant to a day or longer in radiocarbon dating the present is defined as ad 1950
it is sometimes represented as a hyperplane in space-time typically called now although modern physics demonstrates that such a hyperplane cannot be defined uniquely for observers in relative motion the present may also be viewed as a duration (see specious present)
== society and religion ==
contemporary history describes the historical timeframe that is immediately relevant to the present time and is a certain perspective of modern history
=== general overview ===
the present is contrasted with the past and the future modern physics has not yet been able to explain the perceived aspect of the present as eliminator of possibilities that transfers future into past physical laws formally are valid at any point of time (classical or quantum mechanics) or even globally (general relativity) there isn't a concept of a present time in this context a complicating factor is that whilst a given observer would describe the present as a spatial structure with a zero-length time lapse other observers would associate both time and space to this structure and therefore disagree on what constitutes the present
the direct experience of the present for each human is that it is what is here now direct experience is of course subjective by definition yet in this case this same direct experience is true for all humans for all of us here means where i am and now means when i am thus the common repeatable experience is that the present is inextricably linked to oneself
in the time aspect the conventional concept of now is that it is some tiny point on a continuous timeline which separates past from future it is not clear however that there is a universal timeline or whether as relativity seems to indicate the timeline is inextricably linked to the observer thus is now for one observer the same time as now for another on a universal timeline assuming a universal timeline exists adding to the confusion in the physics view there is no demonstrable reason why time should move in any one particular direction the laws of physics simply are valid at any point in time they describe events at 16:45 yesterday and events at 20:45 tomorrow the idea that time moves isn't contained in these laws
adding substance to the supposition that the timeline view of now may not hold the full picture the qualities of now or the present in the human direct experience are very different from the qualities of past and future available through memory or anticipation in the human direct experience now has a certain aliveness reality and immediacy not present in our concepts of past and future indeed any experience is always happening now even a re-living of some past event thus there is a deep philosophical case for saying that the present moment is all there ever is and that temporal perception is and only can be this very moment
when comparing time in places separated by great distances the notion of present becomes more subjective for example we visually perceive stars to be where they were when the light now reaching our eyes was emitted because even though light travels at approximately 300,000,000 metres per second (980,000,000 ft/s) it takes many years to reach us from distant sources thus light travel time must be taken into account in such time comparisons
when used in the term before present (bp) as used in expressing ages or dates determined by radiocarbon dating present is defined as ad 1950
=== the present in yoga ===
in patanjali yoga sutras the first sutra defines yoga as now by chitta vrithhi nirodha (restraining the thought-streams) the present can be experienced the moment a person thinks he is recalling his past experience he will never know the present being conscious or being aware is the only way to know the present
=== the present in buddhism ===
buddhism and many of its associated paradigms emphasize the importance of living in the present moment being fully aware of what is happening and not dwelling on the past or worrying about the future this does not mean that they encourage hedonism but merely that constant focus on one's current position in space and time (rather than future considerations or past reminiscence) will aid one in relieving suffering they teach that those who live in the present moment are the happiest a number of meditative techniques aim to help the practiser live in the present moment
=== christianity and eternity ===
christianity views god as being outside of time and from the divine perspective past present and future are actualized in the now of eternity this trans-temporal conception of god has been proposed as a solution to the problem of divine foreknowledge (i.e how can god know what we will do in the future without us being determined to do it) since at least boethius thomas aquinas offers the metaphor of a watchman representing god standing on a height looking down on a valley to a road where past present and future represented by the individuals and their actions strung out along its length are all visible simultaneously to god therefore god's knowledge is not tied to any particular date
== philosophy and science ==
=== philosophical problem ===
the present raises the difficult question how is it that all sentient beings experience now at the same time? there is no logical reason why this should be the case and no easy answer to the question for example say somebody named john is experiencing a great deal of pain john's friend sarah takes pity on john because of john's situation the problem is is it logical for sarah to feel bad for john at present when there is no way to prove that both john and sarah experience the same temporal existence (see also solipsism and philosophy of mind.)
==== special relativity's present ====
the original intent of the diagram on the right was to portray a 3-dimensional object having access to the past present and future in the present moment (4th dimension)
it follows from albert einstein's special theory of relativity that there is no such thing as absolute simultaneity when care is taken to operationalise the present it follows that the events that can be labeled as simultaneous with a given event can not be in direct cause-effect relationship such collections of events are perceived differently by different observers instead when focusing on now as the events perceived directly not as a recollection or a speculation for a given observer now takes the form of the observer's past light cone the light cone of a given event is objectively defined as the collection of events in causal relationship to that event but each event has a different associated light cone one has to conclude that in relativistic models of physics there is no place for the present as an absolute element of reality einstein phrased this as people like us who believe in physics know that the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion
==== today vs now ====
today signifies a day in a 24-hour interval to signify one's stance within the plane of time this is contrary to now because now has no definite measure for its own duration on the graph of space-time the present can appear to be infinitely small or account for a large portion of a sequence in british culture the word now would also indicate  now in a minute  this is well known in popular culture around uk and us
