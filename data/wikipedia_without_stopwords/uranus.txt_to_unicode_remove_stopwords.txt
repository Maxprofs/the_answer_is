history
though uranus visible naked eye like five classical planets never recognized planet ancient observers dimness slow orbit sir william herschel announced discovery march expanding known boundaries solar system first time history uranus first planet discovered telescope
discovery
uranus observed many occasions recognition planet generally mistaken star possibly earliest known observation hipparchos bc may recorded star star catalogue later incorporated ptolemys almagest earliest definite sighting john flamsteed observed least six times cataloguing tauri french astronomer pierre lemonnier observed uranus least twelve times including four consecutive nights
sir william herschel observed uranus march garden house new king street bath somerset england herschel museum astronomy initially reported april comet herschel engaged series observations parallax fixed stars using telescope design
recorded journal quartile near tauri either nebulous star perhaps comet march noted looked comet nebulous star found comet changed place presented discovery royal society continued assert found comet also implicitly compared planet
power first saw comet experience know diameters fixed stars proportionally magnified higher powers planets therefore put powers found diameter comet increased proportion power ought supposition fixed star diameters stars compared increased ratio moreover comet magnified much beyond light would admit appeared hazy illdefined great powers stars preserved lustre distinctness many thousand observations knew would retain sequel shown surmises wellfounded proving comet lately observed
herschel notified astronomer royal nevil maskelyne discovery received flummoxed reply april dont know call likely regular planet moving orbit nearly circular sun comet moving eccentric ellipsis yet seen coma tail
although herschel continued describe new object comet astronomers already begun suspect otherwise finnishswedish astronomer anders johan lexell working russia first compute orbit new object nearly circular orbit led conclusion planet rather comet berlin astronomer johann elert bode described herschels discovery moving star deemed hitherto unknown planetlike object circulating beyond orbit saturn bode concluded nearcircular orbit like planet comet
object soon universally accepted new planet herschel acknowledged royal society president joseph banks observation eminent astronomers europe appears new star honour pointing march primary planet solar system recognition achievement king george iii gave herschel annual stipend condition move windsor royal family could look telescopes
naming
maskelyne asked herschel astronomical world faver sic give name planet entirely much obliged discovery response maskelynes request herschel decided name object georgium sidus georges star georgian planet honour new patron king george iii explained decision letter joseph banks
fabulous ages ancient times appellations mercury venus mars jupiter saturn given planets names principal heroes divinities present philosophical era would hardly allowable recourse method call juno pallas apollo minerva name new heavenly body first consideration particular event remarkable incident seems chronology future age asked lastfound planet discovered would satisfactory answer say reign king george third
herschels proposed name popular outside britain alternatives soon proposed astronomer jrme lalande proposed named herschel honour discoverer swedish astronomer erik prosperin proposed name neptune supported astronomers liked idea commemorate victories british royal naval fleet course american revolutionary war calling new planet even neptune george iii neptune great britain bode opted uranus latinized version greek god sky ouranos bode argued saturn father jupiter new planet named father saturn bodes royal academy colleague martin klaproth named newly discovered element uranium support bodes choice ultimately bodes suggestion became widely used became universal hm nautical almanac office final holdout switched using georgium sidus uranus

uranus named ancient greek deity sky uranus ancient greek father cronus saturn grandfather zeus jupiter latin became ranus planet whose name derived figure greek mythology adjective uranus uranian pronunciation name uranus preferred among astronomers jrns stress first syllable latin ranus contrast colloquial jrens stress second syllable long though considered acceptable
uranus two astronomical symbols first proposed suggested lalande letter herschel lalande described un globe surmont par la premire lettre de votre nom globe surmounted first letter surname later proposal hybrid symbols mars sun uranus sky greek mythology thought dominated combined powers sun mars chinese japanese korean vietnamese name literally translated sky king star
