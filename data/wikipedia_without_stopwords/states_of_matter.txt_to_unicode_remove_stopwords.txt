term phase sometimes used synonym state matter system contain several immiscible phases state matter see phase matter discussion difference two terms
four fundamental states
solid
solid particles ions atoms molecules closely packed together forces particles strong particles cannot move freely vibrate result solid stable definite shape definite volume solids change shape force broken cut
crystalline solids particles atoms molecules ions packed regularly ordered repeating pattern various different crystal structures substance one structure solid phase example iron bodycentred cubic structure temperatures c facecentred cubic structure c ice fifteen known crystal structures fifteen solid phases exist various temperatures pressures
glasses noncrystalline amorphous solids without longrange order thermal equilibrium ground states therefore described nonclassical states matter
solids transformed liquids melting liquids transformed solids freezing solids also change directly gases process sublimation gases likewise change directly solids deposition
liquid
liquid nearly incompressible fluid conforms shape container retains nearly constant volume independent pressure volume definite temperature pressure constant solid heated melting point becomes liquid given pressure higher triple point substance intermolecular interatomic interionic forces still important molecules enough energy move relative structure mobile means shape liquid definite determined container volume usually greater corresponding solid best known exception water ho highest temperature given liquid exist critical temperature
gas
gas compressible fluid gas conform shape container also expand fill container
gas molecules enough kinetic energy effect intermolecular forces small zero ideal gas typical distance neighboring molecules much greater molecular size gas definite shape volume occupies entire container confined liquid may converted gas heating constant pressure boiling point else reducing pressure constant temperature
temperatures critical temperature gas also called vapor liquefied compression alone without cooling vapor exist equilibrium liquid solid case gas pressure equals vapor pressure liquid solid
supercritical fluid scf gas whose temperature pressure critical temperature critical pressure respectively state distinction liquid gas disappears supercritical fluid physical properties gas high density confers solvent properties cases leads useful applications example supercritical carbon dioxide used extract caffeine manufacture decaffeinated coffee
plasma
like gas plasma definite shape volume unlike gases plasmas electrically conductive produce magnetic fields electric currents respond strongly electromagnetic forces positively charged nuclei swim sea freelymoving disassociated electrons similar way charges exist conductive metal fact electron sea allows matter plasma state conduct electricity
plasma state often misunderstood actually quite common earth majority people observe regular basis without even realizing lightning electric sparks fluorescent lights neon lights plasma televisions types flame stars examples illuminated matter plasma state
gas usually converted plasma one two ways either huge voltage difference two points exposing extremely high temperatures
heating matter high temperatures causes electrons leave atoms resulting presence free electrons high temperatures present stars assumed essentially electrons free highenergy plasma essentially bare nuclei swimming sea electrons
phase transitions
state matter also characterized phase transitions phase transition indicates change structure recognized abrupt change properties distinct state matter defined set states distinguished set states phase transition water said several distinct solid states appearance superconductivity associated phase transition superconductive states likewise ferromagnetic states demarcated phase transitions distinctive properties change state occurs stages intermediate steps called mesophases phases exploited introduction liquid crystal technology
state phase given set matter change depending pressure temperature conditions transitioning phases conditions change favor existence example solid transitions liquid increase temperature near absolute zero substance exists solid heat added substance melts liquid melting point boils gas boiling point heated high enough would enter plasma state electrons energized leave parent atoms
forms matter composed molecules organized different forces also considered different states matter superfluids like fermionic condensate quarkgluon plasma examples

magnetically ordered
transition metal atoms often magnetic moments due net spin electrons remain unpaired form chemical bonds solids magnetic moments different atoms ordered form ferromagnet antiferromagnet ferrimagnet
ferromagnetfor instance solid ironthe magnetic moment atom aligned direction within magnetic domain domains also aligned solid permanent magnet magnetic even absence external magnetic field magnetization disappears magnet heated curie point iron c
antiferromagnet two networks equal opposite magnetic moments cancel net magnetization zero example nickelii oxide nio half nickel atoms moments aligned one direction half opposite direction
ferrimagnet two networks magnetic moments opposite unequal cancellation incomplete nonzero net magnetization example magnetite feo contains fe fe ions different magnetic moments
