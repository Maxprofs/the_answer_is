the litre (international spelling) or liter (american spelling) (si symbols l or l commonly abbreviated as ltr) is an si accepted metric system unit of volume equal to 1 cubic decimetre (dm3) 1,000 cubic centimetres (cm3) or 1/1,000 cubic metre a cubic decimetre (or litre) occupies a volume of 101010 centimetres (see figure) and is thus equal to one-thousandth of a cubic metre
the original french metric system used the litre as a base unit the word litre is derived from an older french unit the litron whose name came from greek via latin and which equalled approximately 0.831 litres the litre was also used in several subsequent versions of the metric system and is accepted for use with the si although not an official si unitthe si unit of volume is the cubic metre (m3) the spelling used by the international bureau of weights and measures is litre a spelling which is shared by almost all english-speaking countries the less common spelling of liter is more predominantly used in american english
one litre of liquid water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram due to the gram being defined in 1795 as one cubic centimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice subsequent redefinitions of the metre and kilogram mean that this relationship is no longer exact
== definitionedit ==
a litre is defined as a special name for a cubic decimetre or 10 centimetres 10 centimetres 10 centimetres (1 l 1 dm3 1000 cm3) hence 1 l 0.001 m3 1000 cm3 and 1 m3 (i.e a cubic metre which is the si unit for volume) is exactly 1000 l
from 1901 to 1964 the litre was defined as the volume of one kilogram of pure water at maximum density and standard pressure the kilogram was in turn specified as the mass of a platinum/iridium cylinder held at svres in france and was intended to be of the same mass as the 1 litre of water referred to above it was subsequently discovered that the cylinder was around 28 parts per million too large and thus during this time a litre was about 1.000028 dm3 additionally the mass-volume relationship of water (as with any fluid) depends on temperature pressure purity and isotopic uniformity in 1964 the definition relating the litre to mass was abandoned in favour of the current one although the litre is not an official si unit it is accepted by the cgpm (the standards body that defines the si) for use with the si cgpm defines the litre and its acceptable symbols
a litre is equal in volume to the millistere an obsolete non-si metric unit customarily used for dry measure
== explanationedit ==
litres are most commonly used for items (such as fluids and solids that can be poured) which are measured by the capacity or size of their container whereas cubic metres (and derived units) are most commonly used for items measured either by their dimensions or their displacements the litre is often also used in some calculated measurements such as density (kg/l) allowing an easy comparison with the density of water
one litre of water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram when measured at its maximal density which occurs at about 4 c similarly 1 millilitre of water has a mass of about 1 g 1,000 litres of water has a mass of about 1,000 kg (1 tonne) this relationship holds because the gram was originally defined as the mass of 1 ml of water however this definition was abandoned in 1799 because the density of water changes with temperature and very slightly with pressure
it is now known that density of water also depends on the isotopic ratios of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a particular sample modern measurements of vienna standard mean ocean water which is pure distilled water with an isotopic composition representative of the average of the worlds oceans show it has a density of 69999999750000000000.999975 69941000000000000000.000001 kg/l at its point of maximum density (3.984 c) under one standard atmosphere (760 torr 101.325 kpa) of pressure
== si prefixes applied to the litreedit ==
the litre though not an official si unit may be used with si prefixes the most commonly used derived unit is the millilitre defined as one-thousandth of a litre and also often referred to by the si derived unit name cubic centimetre it is a commonly used measure especially in medicine and cooking other units may be found in the table below where the more often used terms are in bold however some authorities advise against some of them for example in the united states nist advocates using the millilitre or litre instead of the centilitre
== non-metric conversionsedit ==
=== rough conversionsedit ===
one litre is slightly more than one u.s liquid quart and slightly less than one imperial quart or one u.s dry quart a mnemonic for its volume relative to the imperial pint is a litre of water is a pint and three quarters
a litre is the volume of a cube with sides of 10 cm which is slightly less than a cube of sides 4 inches (or one-third of a foot) one cubic foot would contain exactly 27 such cubes (four inches on each side) making one cubic foot approximately equal to 27 litres one cubic foot has an exact volume of 28.316846592 litres which is within 5% of the 27-litre approximation
a litre of water has a mass almost exactly equal to one kilogram an early definition of the kilogram was set as the mass of one litre of water because volume changes with temperature and pressure and pressure uses units of mass the definition of a kilogram was changed at standard pressure one litre of water has a mass of 0.999975 kg at 4 c and 0.997 kg at 25 c
== symboledit ==
originally the only symbol for the litre was l (lowercase letter l) following the si convention that only those unit symbols that abbreviate the name of a person start with a capital letter in many english-speaking countries however the most common shape of a handwritten arabic digit 1 is just a vertical stroke that is it lacks the upstroke added in many other cultures therefore the digit 1 may easily be confused with the letter l further on some typewriters particularly older ones the unshifted l key had to be used to type the numeral 1 even in some computer typefaces the two characters are barely distinguishable this caused some concern especially in the medical community
as a result l (uppercase letter l) was adopted as an alternative symbol for litre in 1979 the united states national institute of standards and technology now recommends the use of the uppercase letter l a practice that is also widely followed in canada and australia in these countries the symbol l is also used with prefixes as in ml and l instead of the traditional ml and l used in europe in the uk and ireland as well as the rest of europe lowercase l is used with prefixes though whole litres are often written in full (so 750 ml on a wine bottle but often 1 litre on a juice carton) in 1990 the cipm stated that it was still too early to choose a single symbol for the litre
prior to 1979 the symbol (script small l u+2113) came into common use in some countries for example it was recommended by south african bureau of standards publication m33 and canada in the 1970s this symbol can still be encountered occasionally in some english-speaking and european countries like germany and its use is ubiquitous in japan and south korea fonts covering the cjk characters usually include not only the script small but also four precomposed characters   and (u+3395 to u+3398) for the microlitre millilitre decilitre and kilolitre such usage in printed works is in conflict with the recommendations published by the bipm on the advice of the major international standards organisations (including iso nist npl iau iupac and iupap) who state in the si brochure that unit symbols should be printed in roman (upright) type regardless of the type used in the surrounding text
== historyedit ==
the first name of the litre was cadil standards are shown at the muse des arts et mtiers in paris
the litre was introduced in france in 1795 as one of the new republican units of measurement and defined as one cubic decimetre one litre of liquid water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram due to the gram being defined in 1795 as one cubic centimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice the original decimetre length was 44.344 lignes which was revised in 1798 to 44.3296 lignes this made the original litre 70001000974000000001.000974 of today's dm3 it was against this litre that the kilogram was constructed
in 1879 the cipm adopted the definition of the litre with the symbol l (lowercase letter l)
in 1901 at the 3rd cgpm conference the litre was redefined as the space occupied by 1 kg of pure water at the temperature of its maximum density (3.98 c) under a pressure of 1 atm this made the litre equal to about 69971000028000000001.000028 dm3 (earlier reference works usually put it at 69971000027000000001.000027 dm3)
in 1964 at the 12th cgpm conference the original definition was reverted to and thus the litre was once again defined in exact relation to the metre as another name for the cubic decimetre that is exactly 1 dm3
in 1979 at the 16th cgpm conference the alternative symbol l (uppercase letter l) was adopted it also expressed a preference that in the future only one of these two symbols should be retained but in 1990 said it was still too early to do so
== colloquial and practical usageedit ==
in spoken english the symbol ml (for millilitre) is often pronounced as mil which is potentially confusing as this could also be interpreted as
millimetre a unit of length equal to one-thousandth of a metre
thousandth of an inch
mil a scandinavian unit of length equal to 10 kilometre
angular mil unit of angular measurement
generally these various meanings do not create confusion because the context is usually sufficientone being a volume the others linear or angular measurement
the abbreviation cc (for cubic centimetre equal to a millilitre or ml) is a unit of the cgs system that preceded the mks system that later evolved into the si system the abbreviation cc is still commonly used in many fields including medical dosage and sizing for small combustion engine displacement such as those used in motorcycles
the microlitre (l) has been known in the past as the lambda () but this usage is now discouraged
in the si system use of prefixes for powers of 1,000 is preferred and all other multiples discouraged however in countries where the metric system was established well before the adoption of the si standard other multiples were already established their use remains common in particular use of the centi (102) deci (101) deca (10+1) and hecto (10+2) prefixes are still common for example in many european countries the hectolitre is the typical unit for production and export volumes of beverages (milk beer soft drinks wine etc.) and for measuring the size of the catch and quotas for fishing boats decilitres are common in switzerland and scandinavia and sometimes found in cookbooks centilitres indicate the capacity of drinking glasses and of small bottles in colloquial dutch in belgium a vijfentwintiger and a driendertiger (literally twenty-fiver and thirty-threer') are the common beer glasses the corresponding bottles mention 25cl or 33cl bottles may also be 75cl or half size at 37.5cl for artisanal brews or 70cl for wines or spirits cans come in 25cl 33cl and 50cl a.k.a 0.5l
in countries where the metric system was adopted as the official measuring system after the si standard was established common usage more closely follow contemporary si conventions for example in canada australia and new zealand consumer beverages are labelled almost exclusively using litres and millilitres hectolitres sometimes appear in industry but centilitres and decilitres are rarely if ever used larger volumes are usually given in cubic metres (equivalent to 1 kl) or thousands or millions of cubic metres
although kilolitres megalitres and gigalitres are commonly used for measuring water consumption reservoir capacities and river flows for larger volumes of fluids such as annual consumption of tap water lorry (truck) tanks or swimming pools the cubic metre is the general unit it is also generally for all volumes of a non-liquid nature
== usages to indicate capacityedit ==
fields where the litre and millilitre are used as a measurement for non-liquid volumes where the capacity of the container is indicated include
solid items that can be poured and are measured by their containers (such as in many places berries)
car boot/trunk size
rucksacks & climbing packs
computer cases
microwave ovens
refrigerators
bins
engine displacement
