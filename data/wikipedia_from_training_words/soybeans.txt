the soybean in the us also called the soya bean in europe (glycine max) is a species of legume native to east asia widely grown for its edible bean which has numerous uses the plant is classed as an oilseed rather than a pulse by the un food and agriculture organization (fao)
fat-free (defatted) soybean meal is a significant and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many packaged meals soy vegetable oil is another product of processing the soybean crop for example soybean products such as textured vegetable protein (tvp) are ingredients in many meat and dairy analogues soybeans produce significantly more protein per acre than most other uses of land
traditional nonfermented food uses of soybeans include soy milk from which tofu and tofu skin are made fermented foods include soy sauce fermented bean paste natto and tempeh among others the oil is used in many industrial applications the main producers of soy are the united states (36%) brazil (36%) argentina (18%) china (5%) and india (4%) the beans contain significant amounts of phytic acid alpha-linolenic acid and isoflavones
== name ==
the plant is known as the large bean in chinese and japanese (chinese  pinyin ddu japanese romaji daizu) or yellow bean (chinese  pinyin hungdu) both the immature soybean and its dish are called edamame in japan but in english edamame refers only to a specific dish the genus name glycine is the same as a simple amino acid
since the early twentieth century soybeans have been called the golden bean or miracle bean in america the english words soy and soya are ultimately derived from the japanese pronunciation of shyu () the sino-japanese word for soy sauce through the german adaptation of the same word soja
== classification ==
the genus glycine willd is divided into two subgenera glycine and soja the subgenus soja (moench) f.j herm includes the cultivated soybean glycine max (l.) merr. and the wild soybean glycine soja sieb & zucc both species are annuals glycine soja is the wild ancestor of glycine max and grows wild in china japan korea taiwan and russia the subgenus glycine consists of at least 25 wild perennial species for example glycine canescens f.j herm and g tomentella hayata both found in australia and papua new guinea perennial soybean (neonotonia wightii) originated in africa and is now a widespread pasture crop in the tropics
like some other crops of long domestication the relationship of the modern soybean to wild-growing species can no longer be traced with any degree of certainty it is a cultural variety with a very large number of cultivars
== description ==
soy varies in growth and habit the height of the plant varies from less than 0.2 to 2.0 m (0.66 to 6.56 ft)
the pods stems and leaves are covered with fine brown or gray hairs the leaves are trifoliolate having three to four leaflets per leaf and the leaflets are 615 cm (2.45.9 in) long and 27 cm (0.792.76 in) broad the leaves fall before the seeds are mature the inconspicuous self-fertile flowers are borne in the axil of the leaf and are white pink or purple
the fruit is a hairy pod that grows in clusters of three to five each pod is 38 cm long (13 in) and usually contains two to four (rarely more) seeds 511 mm in diameter
soybeans occur in various sizes and in many hull or seed coat colors including black brown blue yellow green and mottled the hull of the mature bean is hard water-resistant and protects the cotyledon and hypocotyl (or germ") from damage if the seed coat is cracked the seed will not germinate the scar visible on the seed coat is called the hilum (colors include black brown buff gray and yellow) and at one end of the hilum is the micropyle or small opening in the seed coat which can allow the absorption of water for sprouting
remarkably seeds such as soybeans containing very high levels of protein can undergo desiccation yet survive and revive after water absorption a carl leopold son of aldo leopold began studying this capability at the boyce thompson institute for plant research at cornell university in the mid-1980s he found soybeans and corn to have a range of soluble carbohydrates protecting the seed's cell viability patents were awarded to him in the early 1990s on techniques for protecting biological membranes and proteins in the dry state
== nitrogen-fixing ability ==
many legumes (alfalfa clover lupins peas beans lentils soybeans peanuts and others) contain symbiotic bacteria called rhizobia within nodules of their root systems these bacteria have the special ability of fixing nitrogen from atmospheric molecular nitrogen (n2) into ammonia (nh3) the chemical reaction is
n2 + 8 h+ + 8 e 2 nh3 + h2
ammonia is then converted to another form ammonium (nh4+) usable by (some) plants by the following reaction
nh3 + h+ nh4+
this arrangement means that the root nodules are sources of nitrogen for legumes making them relatively rich in plant proteins
== chemical composition ==
together protein and soybean oil content account for 56% of dry soybeans by weight (36% protein and 20% fat table) the remainder consists of 30% carbohydrates 9% water and 5% ash (table) soybeans comprise approximately 8% seed coat or hull 90% cotyledons and 2% hypocotyl axis or germ
=== nutrition ===
soybeans are an exceptional source of essential nutrients providing in a 100 gram serving (raw for reference) high contents of the daily value (dv) especially for protein (36% dv) dietary fiber (37%) iron (121%) manganese (120%) phosphorus (101%) and several b vitamins including folate (94%) (table) high contents also exist for vitamin k magnesium zinc and potassium (table)
a 100 gram serving of soybeans supplies 446 calories and 11 grams of polyunsaturated fat (table)
for human consumption soybeans must be cooked with wet heat to destroy the trypsin inhibitors (serine protease inhibitors) raw soybeans including the immature green form are toxic to all monogastric animals
==== protein ====
most soy protein is a relatively heat-stable storage protein this heat stability enables soy food products requiring high temperature cooking such as tofu soy milk and textured vegetable protein (soy flour) to be made
soybeans are considered by many agencies to be a source of complete protein a complete protein is one that contains significant amounts of all the essential amino acids that must be provided to the human body because of the body's inability to synthesize them for this reason soy is a good source of protein amongst many others for vegetarians and vegans or for people who want to reduce the amount of meat they eat according to the us food and drug administration
soy protein products can be good substitutes for animal products because unlike some other beans soy offers a complete protein profile  soy protein products can replace animal-based foodswhich also have complete proteins but tend to contain more fat especially saturated fatwithout requiring major adjustments elsewhere in the diet
the gold standard for measuring protein quality since 1990 is the protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (pdcaas) and by this criterion soy protein is the nutritional equivalent of meat eggs and casein for human growth and health soybean protein isolate has a biological value of 74 whole soybeans 96 soybean milk 91 and eggs 97
soy protein is essentially identical to the protein of other legume seeds and pulses moreover soybeans can produce at least twice as much protein per acre than any other major vegetable or grain crop besides hemp five to 10 times more protein per acre than land set aside for grazing animals to make milk and up to 15 times more protein per acre than land set aside for meat production
==== carbohydrates ====
the principal soluble carbohydrates of mature soybeans are the disaccharide sucrose (range 2.58.2%) the trisaccharide raffinose (0.11.0%) composed of one sucrose molecule connected to one molecule of galactose and the tetrasaccharide stachyose (1.4 to 4.1%) composed of one sucrose connected to two molecules of galactose while the oligosaccharides raffinose and stachyose protect the viability of the soybean seed from desiccation (see above section on physical characteristics) they are not digestible sugars so contribute to flatulence and abdominal discomfort in humans and other monogastric animals comparable to the disaccharide trehalose undigested oligosaccharides are broken down in the intestine by native microbes producing gases such as carbon dioxide hydrogen and methane
since soluble soy carbohydrates are found in the whey and are broken down during fermentation soy concentrate soy protein isolates tofu soy sauce and sprouted soybeans are without flatus activity on the other hand there may be some beneficial effects to ingesting oligosaccharides such as raffinose and stachyose namely encouraging indigenous bifidobacteria in the colon against putrefactive bacteria
the insoluble carbohydrates in soybeans consist of the complex polysaccharides cellulose hemicellulose and pectin the majority of soybean carbohydrates can be classed as belonging to dietary fiber
==== fats ====
raw soybeans are 20% fat including saturated fat (3%) monounsaturated fat (4%) and polyunsaturated fat mainly as linoleic acid (table)
within soybean oil or the lipid portion of the seed is contained four phytosterols stigmasterol sitosterol campesterol and brassicasterol accounting for about 2.5% of the lipid fraction and which can be converted into steroid hormones
=== comparison to other major staple foods ===
the following table shows the nutrient content of green soybean and other major staple foods each in respective raw form raw soybeans however aren't edible and cannot be digested these must be sprouted or prepared and cooked for human consumption in sprouted and cooked form the relative nutritional and anti-nutritional contents of each of these grains is remarkably different from that of raw form of these grains reported in this table the nutritional value of soybean and each cooked staple depends on the processing and the method of cooking boiling frying roasting baking etc
== soy protein ==
all spermatophytes except for the grass/cereal family contain soybean-like 7s (vicilin) and/or 11s (legumin) {s denotes svedberg sedimentation coefficients} desiccation-tolerant seed storage globulin proteins oats and rice are anomalous in that they also contain a majority of soybean-like protein cocoa for example contains the 7s globulin which contributes to cocoa/chocolate taste and aroma whereas coffee beans (coffee grounds) contain the 11s globulin responsible for coffee's aroma and flavor
vicilin and legumin proteins belong to the cupin superfamily a large and functionally diverse superfamily of proteins that have a common origin and whose evolution can be followed from bacteria to eukaryotes including animals and higher plants
2s albumins form a major group of homologous storage proteins in many dicot species and in some monocots but not in grasses (cereals) soybeans contain a small but significant 2s storage protein 2s albumin are grouped in the prolamin superfamily other allergenic proteins included in this superfamily are the non-specific plant lipid transfer proteins alpha amylase inhibitor trypsin inhibitors and prolamin storage proteins of cereals and grasses
peanuts for instance contain 20% 2s albumin but only 6% 7s globulin and 74% 11s it is the high 2s albumin and low 7s globulin that is responsible for the relatively low quality (low lysine) of peanut protein compared to soy protein cereal storage prolamins are likewise low in lysine the most important and first limiting amino acid peanut butter and wheat bread therefore do not complement each other as they each suffer from low lysine
== cultivation ==
soybeans are a globally important crop providing oil and protein in the united states the bulk of the harvest is solvent-extracted with hexane and the toasted defatted soymeal (50% protein) then makes possible the raising of farm animals (e.g chicken hog turkey) on an industrial scale never before seen in human history a very small proportion of the crop is consumed directly by humans soybean products do however appear in a large variety of processed foods
during world war ii soybeans became important in both north america and europe chiefly as substitutes for other protein foods and as a source of edible oil during the war the soybean was discovered as fertilizer by the united states department of agriculture in the 19601 dillon round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt) the united states secured tariff-free access for its soybeans to the european market in the 1960s the united states exported over 90% of the world's soybeans by 2005 the top soybeans exporters were argentina (39% of world soybean exports) united states (37%) and brazil (16%) while top importers were china (41% of world soybean imports) european union (22%) japan (6%) and mexico (6%)
cultivation is successful in climates with hot summers with optimum growing conditions in mean temperatures of 20 to 30 c (68 to 86 f) temperatures of below 20 c and over 40 c (68 f 104 f) stunt growth significantly they can grow in a wide range of soils with optimum growth in moist alluvial soils with a good organic content soybeans like most legumes perform nitrogen fixation by establishing a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium bradyrhizobium japonicum (syn rhizobium japonicum jordan 1982) for best results though an inoculum of the correct strain of bacteria should be mixed with the soybean (or any legume) seed before planting modern crop cultivars generally reach a height of around 1 m (3.3 ft) and take 80120 days from sowing to harvesting
the u.s. argentina brazil china and india are the world's largest soybean producers and represent more than 90% of global soybean production the u.s produced 75 million tons of soybeans in 2000 of which more than one-third was exported in the 20102011 production year this figure is expected to be over 90 million tons
the average worldwide yield for soybean crops in 2010 was 2.5 tonnes per hectare the three largest producers had an average nationwide soybean crop yields of about 3 tonnes per hectare the most productive soybean farms in the world in 2010 were in turkey with a nationwide average farm yield of 3.7 tonnes per hectare the world record for soybean yield is 10.8 tonnes per hectare demonstrated in 2010 by kip cullers a farmer in purdy missouri kip cullers claims the secret to his record breaking soybean crop yields year after year is attention to detail proactive management style irrigation herbicides keeping plants healthy and stress free for the entire growing season
environmental groups such as greenpeace and the wwf have reported soybean cultivation and the probability of increased soybean cultivation in brazil has destroyed huge areas of amazon rainforest and is encouraging further deforestation
american soil scientist andrew mcclung who first showed that the ecologically biodiverse savannah of the cerrado region of brazil could grow profitable soybeans was awarded the 2006 world food prize on october 19 2006 however even correcting for poor soils soybeans were an unlikely cash crop for the cerrado soy did not fare well in the low latitudes more than the heat and humidity it was a lack of seasons that hampered production in the higher more northerly latitudes flowering coincides with the summer solstice when the plants reach their maximum height the first soybeans planted in the cerrado however flowered early and deprived of long summer days remained stunted for soy agriculture to take root in mato grosso it was first necessary to develop a tropical soybean"one that would flower later giving the plants more time to fully mature the feat was accomplished after years of laborious crossbreeding by scientists within embrapa the respected research arm of the brazilian ministry of agriculture
human sewage sludge can be used as fertilizer to grow soybeans soybeans grown in sewage sludge likely contain elevated concentrations of metals soybean plants are vulnerable to a wide range of bacterial diseases fungal diseases viral diseases and parasites one important pest is the corn earworm moth which is the most common and destructive pest of soybean growth in virginia
== history ==
soybeans were a crucial crop in east asia long before written records began there is evidence for soybean domestication between 9000 and 8600 bp(before present) in china between 7000 bp and 5000 bp in japan and 3000 bp in korea they are now a major crop in the united states brazil argentina india and china prior to fermented products such as fermented black soybeans (douchi) jiang (chinese miso) soy sauce tempeh natto and miso soy was considered sacred for its beneficial effects in crop rotation soy was introduced to africa from china in the late 19th century and is now widespread across the continent
=== asia ===
the closest living relative of the soybean is glycine soja (previously called g ussuriensis) a legume native to central china according to the ancient chinese myth in 2853 bce the legendary emperor shennong of china proclaimed that five plants were sacred soybeans rice wheat barley and millet cultivation of soybeans took place over long periods of time in the prehistory of modern-day japan korea and northern china based on archaeological evidence
the origin of soy bean cultivation remains scientifically debated recent research indicates that seeding of wild forms started early (before 5000 bce) in multiple locations through china korea and japan great soviet encyclopedia records soybean cultivation originated in china about 5000 years ago some scholars suggest that soybean originated in china and was domesticated about 3500 bce the oldest preserved soybeans resembling modern varieties in size and shape were found in archaeological sites in korea dated about 1000 bce radiocarbon dating of soybean samples recovered through flotation during excavations at the early mumun period okbang site in korea indicated soybean was cultivated as a food crop in around 1000900 bce soy bean from the jomon period in japan from 3000 bce are also significantly larger than wild varieties the cultivation of soybeans began in the eastern half of northern china by 2000 bce but is almost certainly much older it became an important crop by the zhou dynasty (c.1046 bce256 bce) in china however the details of where when and under what circumstances soybean developed a close relationship with people are poorly understood but archaeologically unsubstantiated source claims that soybean was domesticated in ancient china perhaps 3000 to 5000 years ago soy bean was unknown in south china before the han period from about the first century ce to the age of discovery (1516th century) soybeans were introduced into several countries such as india japan indonesia the philippines vietnam thailand cambodia malaysia burma and nepal this spread was due to the establishment of sea and land trade routes the earliest japanese textual reference to the soybean is in the classic kojiki (records of ancient matters) which was completed in 712 ce
many people have claimed soybeans in asia were historically only used after a fermentation process which lowers the high phytoestrogens content found in the raw plant however terms similar to soy milk have been in use since 82 ce and there is evidence of tofu consumption that dates to 220
=== north america ===
soybeans were first introduced to north america from china in 1765 by samuel bowen a former east india company sailor who had visited china in conjunction with james flint,the first englishman legally permitted by the chinese authorities to learn chinese the first new world soybean crop was grown on skidaway island georgia in 1765 by henry yonge from seeds given him by samuel bowen bowen grew soy near savannah georgia possibly using funds from flint and made soy sauce for sale to england although soybean was introduced into north america in 1765,for the next 155 years the crop was grown primarily for forage
it wasn't until lafayette mendel and thomas burr osborne (chemist) showed that the nutritional value of soybean seeds could be greatly increased by cooking wet heat that soy went from merely a forage to a farm animal feed and became much more appreciated as a human food
william morse is considered the father of modern soybean agriculture in america he and charles piper dr c.v piper took what was an unknown oriental peasant crop in 1910 and transformed it into a golden bean for america becoming one of america's largest farm crops and its most nutritious
prior to the 1920 in the usa the soybean was mainly a forage crop a source of oil meal (for feed) and industrial products with very little used as food however it took on an important role after world war i during the great depression the drought-stricken (dust bowl) regions of the united states were able to use soy to regenerate their soil because of its nitrogen-fixing properties farms were increasing production to meet with government demands and henry ford became a great leader in the soybean industry
in 1931 ford hired chemists robert boyer and frank calvert to produce artificial silk they succeeded in making a textile fiber of spun soy protein fibers hardened or tanned in a formaldehyde bath which was given the name azlon it was usable in the making of suits felt hats and overcoats though pilot production of azlon reached 5000 pounds per day in 1940 it never reached the commercial market dupont's nylon was the winner in the quest to produce artificial silk in 193233 the ford motor company spent approximately $1,250,000 on soybean research by 1935 every ford car had soy involved in its manufacture for example soybean oil was used to paint the automobiles as well as fluid for shock absorbers ford's involvement with the soybean opened many doors for agriculture and industry to be linked more strongly than ever before
henry ford promoted the soybean helping to develop uses for it both in food and in industrial products even demonstrating auto body panels made of soy-based plastics ford's interest led to two bushels (120 pounds) of soybeans being used in each ford car as well as products like the first commercial soy milk ice cream and all-vegetable nondairy whipped topping the ford development of so-called soy-based plastics was based on the addition of soybean flour and wood flour to phenol formaldehyde plastics a prototype vehicle colloquially titled the soybean car was built in 1941 out of such plastics
=== south america ===
the soybean first arrived in south america in argentina in 1882
andrew mcclung showed in the early 1950s that with soil amendments the cerrado region of brazil would grow soybeans the march of soybeans into deforested areas of the amazon rain forest would come later
=== africa ===
the soybean first arrived in africa via egypt in 1857
=== australia ===
wild soybeans were discovered in northeastern australia in 1770 by explorers banks and solander in 1804 the first soyfood product ("fine india soy [sauce]) was sold in sydney in 1879 the first domesticated soybeans arrived in australia a gift of the minister of the interior department japan
=== canada ===
in 1831 the first soy product a few dozen india soy [sauce] arrived in canada soybeans were probably first cultivated in canada by 1855 and definitely in 1895 at ontario agricultural college
=== caribbean and west indies ===
the soybean arrived in the caribbean in the form of soy sauce made by samuel bowen in savannah georgia in 1767 it remains only a minor crop there but its uses for human food are growing steadily
=== central asia ===
the soybean is first in cultivated transcaucasia in central asia in 1876 by the dungans this region has never been important for soybean production
=== mexico and central america ===
the first reliable reference to the soybean in this region dates from mexico in 1877
=== southeast asia ===
by the 13th century the soybean had arrived in indonesia it probably arrived much earlier carried by traders or merchants from southern china
=== south asia and indian subcontinent ===
by the 1600s soy sauce spread from southern japan across the region through the dutch east india company (voc) the soybean probably arrived from southern china moving southward into northern india
=== europe ===
in 1873 professor friedrich j haberlandt first became interested in soybeans when he obtained the seeds of 19 soybean varieties at the vienna world exposition (wiener weltausstellung) he cultivated these seeds in vienna and soon began to distribute them throughout central and western europe most of the farmers who received seeds from him cultivated them then reported their results back to him starting in feb 1876 he published these results first in various journal articles and finally in his magnus opum die sojabohne ( the soybean) in 1878 in northern europe lupin/lupine is known as the soybean of the north
a hitler youth manual from the 1930s promoted soy beans which it called nazi beans as an alternative to meat
=== austria and switzerland ===
in 1861 soybeans were first cultivated in switzerland
in austria at the vienna world exposition of 1873 prof friedrich haberlandt of the royal college of agriculture in vienna (wiener hochschule fr bodencultur) gathered a number of soybean varieties from the chinese japanese mongolian transcaucasian and east indian expositions in 1875 he first grew the soybeans in vienna then in early 1876 he sent samples of seeds to seven cooperators in central europe who planted and tested the seeds in the spring of 1876 with good or fairly good results in each case
=== france ===
the soybean was first cultivated in france by 1779 (and perhaps as early as 1740) the two key early people and organizations introducing the soybean to france were the society of acclimatization (starting in 1855) and li yu-ying (from 1910) li started a large tofu factory where the first commercial soyfoods in france were made
=== greece ===
1935 - soybeans are first introduced to greece by anton brillmayer an austrian soybean breeder (brillmayer 1947 die kultur der soja in oesterreich, p 14-18)
1939 - by now soybeans have been cultivated in greece (matagrin 1939 le soja et les industries du soja, p 47-48)
an entire book has been published on the history of soybeans and soyfoods in greece
=== italy ===
the soybean was first cultivated in italy by 1760 in the botanical garden of turin during the 1780s it was grown at at least three other botanical gardens in italy
=== spain and portugal ===
in 1603 vocabvlario da lingoa de iapam a famous japanese-portuguese dictionary was compiled and published by jesuit priests in nagasaki it contains short but clear definitions for about 20 words related to soyfoods - the first in any european language
in 1880 the soybean was first cultivated in portugal in the botanical gardens at coimbra (crespi 1935)
in about 1910 in spain the first attempts at soybean cultivation were made by the count of san bernardo who cultivated soybeans on his estates at almillo (in southwest spain) about 48 miles east-northeast of seville
== genetic modification ==
soybeans are one of the biotech food crops that have been genetically modified and genetically modified soybeans are being used in an increasing number of products in 1995 monsanto company introduced glyphosate-tolerant soybeans that have been genetically modified to be resistant to monsanto's glyphosate herbicides through substitution of the agrobacterium sp (strain cp4) gene epsp (5-enolpyruvyl shikimic acid-3-phosphate) synthase the substituted version is not sensitive to glyphosate
in 1997 about 8% of all soybeans cultivated for the commercial market in the united states were genetically modified in 2010 the figure was 93% as with other glyphosate-tolerant crops concern is expressed over damage to biodiversity a 2003 study concluded the rr gene had been bred into so many different soybean cultivars there had been little decline in genetic diversity but diversity was limited among elite lines from some companies
the widespread use of such types of gm soybeans in the americas has caused problems with exports to some regions gm crops require extensive certification before they can be legally imported into the european union where there is considerable supplier and consumer reluctance to use gm products for consumer or animal use difficulties with coexistence and subsequent traces of cross-contamination of non-gm stocks have caused shipments to be rejected and have put a premium on non-gm soy
a 2006 united states department of agriculture report found the adoption of genetically engineered (ge) soy corn and cotton reduced the amount of pesticides used overall but did result in a slightly greater amount of herbicides used for soy specifically the use of ge soy was also associated with greater conservation tillage indirectly leading to better soil conservation as well as increased income from off-farming sources due to the greater ease with which the crops can be managed though the overall estimated benefits of the adoption of ge soybeans in the united states was $310 million the majority of this benefit was experienced by the companies selling the seeds (40%) followed by biotechnology firms (28%) and farmers (20%) the patent on glyphosate-tolerant soybeans expired in 2014 so benefits can be expected to shift
in 2010 a team of american scientists announced they had sequenced the soybean genome the first legume to be sequenced
== uses ==
approximately 85% of the world's soybean crop is processed into soybean meal and vegetable oil soybeans can be broadly classified as vegetable (garden) or field (oil) types vegetable types cook more easily have a mild nutty flavor better texture are larger in size higher in protein and lower in oil than field types tofu and soy milk producers prefer the higher protein cultivars bred from vegetable soybeans originally brought to the united states in the late 1930s the garden cultivars are generally not suitable for mechanical combine harvesting because there is a tendency for the pods to shatter upon reaching maturity
among the legumes the soybean also classed as an oilseed is preeminent for its high (3845%) protein content as well as its high (approximately 20%) oil content soybeans are the second-most valuable agricultural export in the united states behind corn the bulk of the soybean crop is grown for oil production with the high-protein defatted and toasted soy meal used as livestock feed a smaller percentage of soybeans are used directly for human consumption
immature soybeans may be boiled whole in their green pods and served with salt under the japanese name edamame ( edamame) in english these soybeans are generally known as edamame or green vegetable soybeans
in china japan and korea the bean and products made from it are a popular part of the diet the chinese invented tofu ( dufu) and also made use of several varieties of soybean paste as seasonings japanese foods made from soya include miso () natt () kinako () and edamame () also many kinds of food are produced using tofu such as atsuage aburaage and so on in korean cuisine soybean sprouts called kongnamul () are also used in a variety of dishes and are also the base ingredient in doenjang cheonggukjang and ganjang in vietnam soybeans are used to make soybean paste- tng in the north with the most popular products are tng bn tng nam n tng c as a garnish for ph and gi cun dishes tofu (u h or u ph or tu h) soya sauce (nc tng literally soya water) soya milk (nc u in the north or sa u nnh in the south) and u h nc ng (tofu sweet soup)
the beans can be processed in a variety of ways common forms of soy (or soya) include soy meal soy flour soy milk tofu textured vegetable protein (tvp which is made into a wide variety of vegetarian foods some of them intended to imitate meat) tempeh soy lecithin and soybean oil soybeans are also the primary ingredient involved in the production of soy sauce (shoyu)
=== oil ===
soybean seed contains about 19% oil to extract soybean oil from seed the soybeans are cracked adjusted for moisture content rolled into flakes and solvent-extracted with commercial hexane the oil is then refined blended for different applications and sometimes hydrogenated soybean oils both liquid and partially hydrogenated are exported abroad sold as vegetable oil or end up in a wide variety of processed foods the remaining soybean meal is used mainly as animal feed
=== meal ===
soybean meal is the material remaining after solvent extraction of oil from soybean flakes with a 50% soy protein content the meal is toasted (a misnomer because the heat treatment is with moist steam) and ground in a hammer mill soybean meal is an essential element of the american production method of growing farm animals such as poultry and swine on an industrial scale that began in the 1930s and more recently the aquaculture of catfish ninety-eight percent of the u.s soybean crop is used for livestock feed soybean meal is also used in lower-end dog foods
=== flour ===
soy flour refers to soybeans ground finely enough to pass through a 100-mesh or smaller screen where special care was taken during desolventizing (not toasted) to minimize denaturation of the protein to retain a high protein dispersibility index for uses such as food extrusion of textured vegetable protein it is the starting material for production of soy concentrate and soy protein isolate
soy flour is made by roasting the soybean removing the coat and grinding into a flour soy flour is manufactured with different fat levels alternatively raw soy flour omits the roasting step
defatted soy flour is obtained from solvent extracted flakes and contains less than 1% oil
natural or full-fat soy flour is made from unextracted dehulled beans and contains about 18% to 20% oil. its high oil content requires the use of a specialized alpine fine impact mill to grind rather than the usual hammer mill full-fat soy flour has a lower protein concentration then defatted flour extruded full-fat soy flour ground in an alpine mill can replace/extend eggs in baking and cooking full-fat soy flour is a component of the famous cornell bread recipe (think pizza)
low-fat soy flour is made by adding some oil back into defatted soy flour fat levels range from 4.5% to 9%
high-fat soy flour can also be produced by adding back soybean oil to defatted flour at the level of 15%
soy lecithin can be added (up to 15%) to soy flour to make lecithinated soy flour it increases dispersibility and gives it emulsifying properties
soy flour has 50% protein and 5% fiber it has higher levels of protein thiamine riboflavin phosphorus calcium and iron than wheat flour it does not contain gluten as a result yeast-raised breads made with soy flour are dense in texture among many uses soy flour thickens sauces prevents staling in baked food and reduces oil absorption during frying baking food with soy flour gives it tenderness moistness a rich color and a fine texture
soy grits are similar to soy flour except the soybeans have been toasted and cracked into coarse pieces
kinako is a soy flour used in japanese cuisine
section reference smith & circle (1972 p 442)
=== soy-based infant formula ===
soy-based infant formula (sbif) is sometimes given to infants who are not being strictly breastfed it can be useful for infants who are either allergic to pasteurized cow milk proteins or who are being fed a vegan diet it is sold in powdered ready-to-feed and concentrated liquid forms
some reviews have expressed the opinion that more research is needed to determine what effect the phytoestrogens in soybeans may have on infants diverse studies have concluded there are no adverse effects in human growth development or reproduction as a result of the consumption of soy-based infant formula one of these studies published in the journal of nutrition concludes that there are
 no clinical concerns with respect to nutritional adequacy sexual development neurobehavioral development immune development or thyroid disease sbifs provide complete nutrition that adequately supports normal infant growth and development fda has accepted sbifs as safe for use as the sole source of nutrition
=== meat and dairy alternatives and extenders ===
soybeans can be processed to produce a texture and appearance similar to many other foods for example soybeans are the primary ingredient in many dairy product substitutes (e.g. soy milk margarine soy ice cream soy yogurt soy cheese and soy cream cheese) and meat alternatives (e.g veggie burgers) these substitutes are readily available in most supermarkets soy milk does not naturally contain significant amounts of digestible calcium many manufacturers of soy milk sell calcium-enriched products as well soy is also used in tempeh the beans (sometimes mixed with grain) are fermented into a solid cake
soy products also are used as a low-cost substitute in meat and poultry products food service retail and institutional (primarily school lunch and correctional) facilities regularly use such extended products extension may result in diminished flavor but fat and cholesterol are reduced vitamin and mineral fortification can be used to make soy products nutritionally equivalent to animal protein the protein quality is already roughly equivalent the soy-based meat substitute textured vegetable protein has been used for more than 50 years as a way of inexpensively extending ground beef without reducing its nutritional value
=== soynut butter ===
the soybean is used to make a product similar to peanut butter called soynut butter and with the slogan i.m healthy printed on the label
=== other products ===
soybeans with black hulls are used in chinese fermented black beans douchi not to be confused with black turtle beans
soybeans are also used in industrial products including oils soap cosmetics resins plastics inks crayons solvents and clothing soybean oil is the primary source of biodiesel in the united states accounting for 80% of domestic biodiesel production soybeans have also been used since 2001 as fermenting stock in the manufacture of a brand of vodka in 1936 ford motor company developed a method where soybeans and fibers were rolled together producing a soup which was then pressed into various parts for their cars from the distributor cap to knobs on the dash board ford also informed in public relation releases that in 1935 over five million acres (20,000 km2) was dedicated to growing soybeans in the united states
=== cattle feed ===
cattle are often fed soy spring grasses are rich in omega-3 fatty acids whereas soy is predominantly omega-6
== health ==
=== cancer ===
according to the american cancer society studies in humans have not shown harm from eating soy foods moderate consumption of soy foods appears safe for both breast cancer survivors and the general population and may even lower breast cancer risk. they caution however that soy supplements should be avoided
=== alpha-linolenic acid ===
soybean oil is one of the vegetable oils that contain a significant amount of the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n3 ala) other plant oils containing ala include canola walnut hemp and flax soybean oil has an omega-3:omega-6 ratio of 1:7 this is a significantly higher omega-3 content than in other vegetable cooking oils except flaxseed while flaxseed is higher with a ratio of 3:1 it is not practical for cooking for more information on the health benefits of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids see essential fatty acids
=== phytochemicals ===
saponins a class of natural surfactants (soaps) are sterols that are present naturally in a wide variety of food-plants including vegetables legumes and cerealsranging from beans and spinach to tomatoes potatoes and oats whole soybeans contain from 0.17 to 6.16% saponins 0.35 to 2.3% in defatted soy flour and 0.06 to 1.9% in tofu legumes such as soybean and chickpeas are the major source of saponins in the human diet sources of non-dietary saponins include alfalfa sunflower herbs and barbasco
soy contains isoflavones like genistein and daidzein it also contains glycitein an o-methylated isoflavone which accounts for 510% of the total isoflavones in soy food products glycitein is a phytoestrogen with weak estrogenic activity comparable to that of the other soy isoflavones
==== isoflavones ====
soybeans also contain the isoflavones genistein and daidzein types of phytoestrogen and endocrine disruptive soy's content of isoflavones are as much as 3 mg/g dry weight isoflavones are polyphenol compounds produced primarily by beans and other legumes including peanuts and chickpeas isoflavones are closely related to the antioxidant flavonoids found in other plants vegetables and flowers isoflavones such as genistein and daidzein are found in only some plant families because most plants do not have an enzyme chalcone isomerase which converts a flavone precursor into an isoflavone
glyceollins are molecules belonging to the pterocarpans family they are also found in the soybean and have been found to have an antifungal activity against aspergillus sojae the fungal ferment used to produce soy sauce they are phytoalexins with an antiestrogenic activity
=== cholesterol and heart diseases ===
the dramatic increase in soyfood sales is largely credited to the food and drug administration's (fda) approval of soy as a cholesterol-lowering food along with other heart and health benefits
one review concluded that soy protein is correlated with significant decreases in serum cholesterol ldl (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides however hdl (good cholesterol) did not increase by a significant amount soy phytoestrogens (isoflavones genistein and daidzein) adsorbed onto the soy protein were suggested as the agent reducing serum cholesterol levels
the fda granted the following health claim for soy 25 grams of soy protein a day as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease. one serving (1 cup or 240 ml) of soy milk for instance contains 6 or 7 grams of soy protein solae resubmitted their original petition asking for a more vague health claim after their original was challenged and highly criticized solae also submitted a petition for a health claim that soy can help prevent cancer they quickly withdrew the petition for lack of evidence and after more than 1,000 letters of protest were received on february 18 2008 weston a price foundation submitted a petition for removal of this health claim 25 g/day soy protein was established as the threshold intake because most trials used at least this much protein and not because less than this amount is inefficacious in fact there is evidence suggesting that lower amounts are indeed efficacious
an american heart association review of a decade long study of soy protein benefits casts doubt on the fda allowed heart healthy claim for soy protein and does not recommend isoflavone supplementation the review panel also found that soy isoflavones have not been shown to reduce post menopause hot flashes in women and the efficacy and safety of isoflavones to help prevent cancers of the breast uterus or prostate is in question however aha concludes that many soy products should be beneficial to cardiovascular and overall health because of their high content of polyunsaturated fats fiber vitamins and minerals and low content of saturated fat
the aha did not conduct a formal statistical analysis of the 22 studies upon which they based their estimate of the potency of soy protein when such an analysis was conducted jenkins et al found that the aha had considerably underestimated the hypocholesterolemic effects of soy protein further when the analysis was limited to the 11 studies that provided evidence that the control and soy diets were matched soy protein was found to lower ldl by 5.2 percent this estimate is in line with the results of other recently published meta-analyses furthermore recent research suggests that soy protein decreases postprandial triglyceride levels which is increasingly viewed as important for reducing chd risk
=== phytic acid ===
soybeans contain a high level of phytic acid which has many effects including acting as an antioxidant and a chelating agent the beneficial claims for phytic acid include reducing cancer minimizing diabetes and reducing inflammation however phytic acid is also criticized for reducing vital minerals due to its chelating effect especially for diets already low in minerals
== health risks ==
=== allergy ===
allergy to soy is common and the food is listed with other foods that commonly cause allergy such as milk eggs peanuts tree nuts shellfish the problem has been reported among younger children and the diagnosis of soy allergy is often based on symptoms reported by parents and results of skin tests or blood tests for allergy only a few reported studies have attempted to confirm allergy to soy by direct challenge with the food under controlled conditions it is very difficult to give a reliable estimate of the true prevalence of soy allergy in the general population to the extent that it does exist soy allergy may cause cases of urticaria and angioedema usually within minutes to hours of ingestion in rare cases true anaphylaxis may also occur the reason for the discrepancy is likely that soy proteins the causative factor in allergy are far less potent at triggering allergy symptoms than the proteins of peanut and shellfish an allergy test that is positive demonstrates that the immune system has formed ige antibodies to soy proteins however this is only a factor when soy proteins reach the blood without being digested in sufficient quantities to reach a threshold to provoke actual symptoms
soy can also trigger symptoms via food intolerance a situation where no allergic mechanism can be proven one scenario is seen in very young infants who have vomiting and diarrhoea when fed soy-based formula which resolves when the formula is withdrawn older infants can suffer a more severe disorder with vomiting diarrhoea that may be bloody anemia weight loss and failure to thrive the most common cause of this unusual disorder is a sensitivity to cow's milk but soy formulas can also be the trigger the precise mechanism is unclear and it could be immunologic although not through the ige-type antibodies that have the leading role in urticaria and anaphylaxis however it is also self-limiting and will often disappear in the toddler years
=== phytoestrogen ===
soybeans contain isoflavones called genistein and daidzein which are one source of phytoestrogens in the human diet because most naturally occurring estrogenic substances show weak activity normal consumption of foods that contain these phytoestrogens should not provide sufficient amounts to elicit a physiological response in humans
plant lignans associated with high fiber foods such as cereal brans and beans are the principal precursor to mammalian lignans which have an ability to bind to human estrogen sites soybeans are a significant source of mammalian lignan precursor secoisolariciresinol containing 13273 g/100 g dry weight another phytoestrogen in the human diet with estrogen activity is coumestans which are found in beans split-peas with the best sources being alfalfa clover and soybean sprouts coumestrol an isoflavone coumarin derivative is the only coumestan in foods
soybeans and processed soy foods are among the richest foods in total phytoestrogens (wet basis per 100 g) which are present primarily in the form of the isoflavones daidzein and genistein when compared to human breast fed or cow milk formula fed diets which contain isoflavone levels of 0.005-0.01 mg/day soy-based infant formulas contain isoflavone levels of 647 mg/day that constitute several orders of magnitude greater than they receive from other sources of nutrition
==== women ====
a 2001 literature review suggested that women with current or past breast cancer should be aware of the risks of potential tumor growth when taking soy products based on the effect of phytoestrogens to promote breast cancer cell growth in animals a 2006 commentary reviewed the relationship with soy and breast cancer they stated that soy may decrease the risk of breast cancer but cautioned that the impact of isoflavones on breast tissue needs to be evaluated at the cellular level in women at high risk for breast cancer a high consumption of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are found in most types of vegetable oil including soybean oil may increase the likelihood that postmenopausal women will develop breast cancer another analysis suggests an inverse association between total polyunsaturated fatty acids and breast cancer risk a 2011 analysis of the literature said our study suggests soy isoflavones intake is associated with a significant reduced risk of breast cancer incidence in asian populations but not in western populations.
in a recent (august 2011) trial the daily administration of tablets containing 200 mg of soy isoflavones for 2 years did not prevent bone loss or menopausal symptoms
==== men ====
because of the phytoestrogen content some studies have suggested that soybean ingestion may influence testosterone levels in men however a 2010 meta-analysis of 15 placebo controlled studies showed that neither soy foods nor isoflavone supplements alter measures of bioavailable testosterone or estrogen concentrations in men it has been hypothesized that soy foods and enterolactone may increase the development of prostate cancer although no significant associations were observed for the soy isoflavones furthermore soy consumption has been shown to have no effect on the levels and quality of sperm a 2009 meta-analysis of the research on the association between soy consumption and prostate cancer risk in men concluded that consumption of soy foods is associated with a reduction in prostate cancer risk in men.
=== brain ===
because of mixed results from animal studies and epidemiological studies a (relatively definitive but expensive) controlled study of the impacts of soy on cognitive skills was performed it found no impact
though there is some evidence that estrogen can help protect and repair the brain after injury in rats there is also evidence that phytoestrogens may be harmful for the recovery of rats in other situations that have sustained brain injury
similarly epidemiological evidence of humans eating soya products is currently divided a study of japanese men between 1965 and 1999 demonstrated a positive correlation between brain atrophy and consumption of tofu meals
a 2001 literature review noted that disturbing data on soy's effect on the cognitive function of the elderly existed in 2008 an epidemiological study of 719 indonesian elderly men and women found that tofu intake was associated with worse memory but tempeh (a fermented soy product) intake was associated with better memory
the cover article in the center for science in the public interest's september 2014 newsletter reported that a controlled study at usc prompted by suggestive epidemiological evidence found no impact on cognitive skills of years of soy vs milk protein diet enrichment
=== carcinogenicity ===
though raw soy flour is known to be correlated with pancreatic cancer in rats the cooked flour has not been found carcinogenic whether soy might promote pancreatic cancer in humans is unknown because studies have not yet attempted to single out soy intake and the incidence of pancreatic cancer in humans and the amount of soy fed to the rats is proportionately far larger than what humans would normally consume however the soy isoflavone genistein has been suggested as a chemopreventive agent against pancreatic cancer by interfering with the chemical pathways that promote the creation and growth of tumors
the cancer council of new south wales australia has released a statement saying scientific research suggests that overall the moderate consumption of soy products does not appear to present a risk to women with breast cancer and there is equivocal evidence that consuming large amounts of soy products may have a protective effect against developing breast and prostate cancer however the council does not recommend taking soy dietary supplements as there is no evidence they are either effective or safe at preventing or treating cancers
=== gout ===
soybeans and soy products contain significant amounts of purines a class of organic compounds for people who suffer from gout eating foods containing moderate or high levels of purines may make the condition worse the u.s national institutes of health (nih) recommends that gout sufferers limit consumption of soy products (although also suggesting that soy may have health benefits by reducing the risk for heart disease) however other researchers have found little or no association between consumption of purine-rich vegetables (including beans) and gout
