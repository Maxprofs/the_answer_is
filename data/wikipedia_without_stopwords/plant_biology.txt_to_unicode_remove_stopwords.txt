evolutionary relationships heredity group organisms called phylogeny phylogenetic studies attempt discover phylogenies basic approach use similarities based shared inheritance determine relationships example species pereskia trees bushes prominent leaves obviously resemble typical leafless cactus echinocactus however pereskia echinocactus spines produced areoles highly specialised padlike structures suggesting two genera indeed related
judging relationships based shared characters requires care since plants may resemble one another convergent evolution characters arisen independently euphorbias leafless rounded bodies adapted water conservation similar globular cacti characters structure flowers make clear two groups closely related cladistic method takes systematic approach characters distinguishing carry information shared evolutionary history evolved separately different groups homoplasies left ancestors plesiomorphies derived characters passed innovations shared ancestor apomorphies derived characters spineproducing areoles cacti provide evidence descent common ancestor results cladistic analyses expressed cladograms treelike diagrams showing pattern evolutionary branching descent
onwards predominant approach constructing phylogenies living plants molecular phylogenetics uses molecular characters particularly dna sequences rather morphological characters like presence absence spines areoles difference genetic code used decide evolutionary relationships instead used indirectly via characters gives rise clive stace describes direct access genetic basis evolution simple example prior use genetic evidence fungi thought either plants closely related plants animals genetic evidence suggests true evolutionary relationship multicelled organisms shown cladogram fungi closely related animals plants
