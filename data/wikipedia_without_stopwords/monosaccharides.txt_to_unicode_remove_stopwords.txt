monosaccharides greek monos single sacchar sugar british english monosaccharides basic units carbohydrates fundamental units carbohydrates cannot hydrolised simpler compounds general formula cnh
non n simplest form sugar usually colorless watersoluble crystalline solids monosaccharides sweet taste examples monosaccharides include glucose dextrose fructose levulose galactose monosaccharides building blocks disaccharides sucrose lactose polysaccharides cellulose starch carbon atom supports hydroxyl group carbons except primary terminal carbon chiral giving rise number isomeric forms chemical formula instance galactose glucose aldohexoses different physical structures chemical properties
structure nomenclature
exceptions eg deoxyribose monosaccharides chemical formula cxhoy conventionally x monosaccharides classified number x carbon atoms contain diose triose tetrose pentose hexose heptose
important monosaccharide glucose hexose examples heptoses include ketoses mannoheptulose sedoheptulose monosaccharides eight carbons rarely observed quite unstable
linearchain monosaccharides
simple monosaccharides linear unbranched carbon skeleton one carbonyl co functional group one hydroxyl oh group remaining carbon atoms therefore molecular structure simple monosaccharide written hchohncochohmh n m x elemental formula cxhxox
convention carbon atoms numbered x along backbone starting end closest co group
carbonyl position n m zero molecule begins formyl group hco technically aldehyde case compound termed aldose otherwise molecule keto group carbonyl co two carbons formally ketone termed ketose ketoses biological interest usually carbonyl position
various classifications combined resulting names aldohexose ketotriose
general nomenclature openchain monosaccharides combines greek prefix indicate number carbons tri tetr pent hex etc suffixes ose aldoses ulose ketoses latter case carbonyl position position indicated numeric infix example hcochohh pentose hchohcochohh pentulose hchohcochohh pentulose
openchain stereoisomers
two monosaccharides equivalent molecular graphs chain length carbonyl position may still distinct stereoisomers whose molecules differ threedimensional arrangement bonds certain atoms happens molecule contains stereogenic center specifically carbon atom chiral connected four distinct molecular substructures four bonds two configurations space distinguished handedness simple openchain monosaccharide every carbon chiral except first last atoms chain ketoses carbon keto group
example triketose hchohcochohh glycerone dihydroxyacetone stereogenic center therefore exists single stereoisomer triose aldose hcochohh glyceraldehyde one chiral carbon central one number bonded groups h oh cohh coh therefore exists two stereoisomers whose molecules mirror images like left right glove monosaccharides four carbons may contain multiple chiral carbons typically two stereoisomers number distinct stereoisomers diagram bounded c c total number chiral carbons

stereoisomers chiral distinct mirror images fischer projection two mirrorimage isomers differ positions chiral hydroxyls reversed righttoleft mirrorimage isomers chemically identical nonchiral environments usually different biochemical properties occurrences nature
stereoisomers arranged pairs mirrorimage forms nonchiral stereoisomers identical mirror images spite chiral centers happens whenever molecular graph symmetrical ketopentoses hchohcochohh two halves mirror images case mirroring equivalent halfturn rotation reason three distinct ketopentose stereoisomers even though molecule two chiral carbons
distinct stereoisomers mirrorimages usually different chemical properties even nonchiral environments therefore mirror pair nonchiral stereoisomer may given specific monosaccharide name example distinct aldohexose stereoisomers name glucose means specific pair mirrorimage aldohexoses fischer projection one two glucose isomers hydroxyl left c right c c isomer reversed pattern specific monosaccharide names conventional threeletter abbreviations like glu glucose thr threose
generally monosaccharide n asymmetrical carbons n stereoisomers number open chain stereoisomers aldose monosaccharide larger one ketose monosaccharide length every ketose n stereoisomers n number carbons every aldose n stereoisomers n number carbons also referred epimers different arrangement oh h groups asymmetric chiral carbon atoms apply carbons carbonyl functional group
dl nomenclature
like many chiral molecules two stereoisomers glyceraldehyde gradually rotate polarization direction linearly polarized light passes even solution two stereoisomers identified prefixes d l according sense rotation dglyceraldehyde dextrorotatory rotates polarization axis clockwise lglyceraldehyde levorotatory rotates counterclockwise
d l prefixes also used monosaccharides distinguish two particular stereoisomers mirrorimages purpose one considers chiral carbon furthest removed co group four bonds must connect h oh cohh rest molecule molecule rotated space directions four groups match analog groups dglyceraldehydes c isomer receives d prefix otherwise receives l prefix
fischer projection d l prefixes specifies configuration carbon atom second bottom d hydroxyl right side l left side
note d l prefixes indicate direction rotation polarized light combined effect arrangement chiral centers however two enantiomers always rotate light opposite directions amount
cyclic isomers
monosaccharide often switches acyclic openchain form cyclic form nucleophilic addition reaction carbonyl group one hydroxyls molecule reaction creates ring carbon atoms closed one bridging oxygen atom resulting molecule hemiacetal hemiketal group depending whether linear form aldose ketose reaction easily reversed yielding original openchain form
cyclic forms ring usually atoms forms called furanoses pyranoses respectively analogy furan pyran simplest compounds carbonoxygen ring although lack double bonds two molecules example aldohexose glucose may form hemiacetal linkage hydroxyl carbon oxygen carbon yielding molecule membered ring called glucofuranose reaction take place carbons form molecule membered ring called glucopyranose cyclic forms atom ring oxepane rarely encountered called heptoses
many monosaccharides including glucose cyclic forms predominate solid state solutions therefore name commonly used open closedchain isomers thus example term glucose may signify glucofuranose glucopyranose openchain form mixture three
cyclization creates new stereogenic center carbonylbearing carbon oh group replaces carbonyls oxygen may end two distinct positions relative rings midplane thus openchain monosaccharide yields two cyclic isomers anomers denoted prefixes molecule change two forms process called mutarotation consists reversal ringforming reaction followed another ring formation
