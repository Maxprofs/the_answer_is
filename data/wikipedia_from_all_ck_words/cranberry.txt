cranberries are a group of evergreen dwarf shrubs or trailing vines in the subgenus oxycoccus of the genus vaccinium in britain cranberry may refer to the native species vaccinium oxycoccos while in north america cranberry may refer to vaccinium macrocarpon vaccinium oxycoccos is cultivated in central and northern europe while vaccinium macrocarpon is cultivated throughout the northern united states canada and chile in some methods of classification oxycoccus is regarded as a genus in its own right they can be found in acidic bogs throughout the cooler regions of the northern hemisphere
cranberries are low creeping shrubs or vines up to 2 metres (7 ft) long and 5 to 20 centimetres (2 to 8 in) in height they have slender wiry stems that are not thickly woody and have small evergreen leaves the flowers are dark pink with very distinct reflexed petals leaving the style and stamens fully exposed and pointing forward they are pollinated by bees the fruit is a berry that is larger than the leaves of the plant it is initially white but turns a deep red when fully ripe it is edible with an acidic taste that can overwhelm its sweetness
cranberries are a major commercial crop in certain american states and canadian provinces (see cultivation and uses below) most cranberries are processed into products such as juice sauce jam and sweetened dried cranberries with the remainder sold fresh to consumers cranberry sauce is a traditional accompaniment to turkey at christmas dinner in the united kingdom and thanksgiving dinners in the united states and canada
since the early 21st century within the global functional food industry raw cranberries have been marketed as a superfruit due to their nutrient content and antioxidant qualities
== species and descriptionedit ==
there are three to four species of cranberry classified in two sections
subgenus oxycoccus sect oxycoccus
vaccinium oxycoccos or oxycoccus palustris (common cranberry northern cranberry or cranberry) is widespread throughout the cool temperate northern hemisphere including northern europe northern asia and northern north america it has small 510 mm leaves the flowers are dark pink with a purple central spike produced on finely hairy stems the fruit is a small pale pink berry with a refreshing sharp acidic flavour
vaccinium microcarpum or oxycoccus microcarpus (small cranberry) occurs in northern north america northern europe and northern asia and differs from v oxycoccos in the leaves being more triangular and the flower stems hairless some botanists include it within v oxycoccos
vaccinium macrocarpon or oxycoccus macrocarpus (large cranberry american cranberry bearberry) native to northern north america across canada and eastern united states south to north carolina at high altitudes) it differs from v oxycoccos in the leaves being larger 1020 mm long and in its slightly apple-like taste
subgenus oxycoccus sect oxycoccoides
vaccinium erythrocarpum or oxycoccus erythrocarpus (southern mountain cranberry) native to southeastern north america at high altitudes in the southern appalachian mountains and also in eastern asia
cranberries are related to bilberries blueberries and huckleberries all in vaccinium subgenus vaccinium these differ in having stouter woodier stems forming taller shrubs and in the bell-shaped flowers the petals not being reflexed
some plants of the completely unrelated genus viburnum are sometimes called highbush cranberries (e.g viburnum trilobum)
cranberries are susceptible to false blossom a harmful but controllable phytoplasma disease common in the eastern production areas of massachusetts and new jersey
== etymology and historyedit ==
the name cranberry derives from craneberry first named by early european settlers in america who felt the expanding flower stem calyx and petals resembled the neck head and bill of a crane another name used in northeastern canada is mossberry the traditional english name for vaccinium oxycoccos fenberry originated from plants found growing in fen (marsh) lands in 17th-century new england cranberries were sometimes called bearberries as bears were often seen feeding on them
in north america native americans were the first to use cranberries as food native americans used cranberries in a variety of foods especially for pemmican wound medicine and dye calling the red berries sassamanash algonquian peoples may have introduced cranberries to starving english settlers in massachusetts who incorporated the berries into traditional thanksgiving feasts american revolutionary war veteran henry hall is credited as first to farm cranberries in the cape cod town of dennis around 1816 in the 1820s cranberries were shipped to europe cranberries became popular for wild harvesting in the nordic countries and russia in scotland the berries were originally wild-harvested but with the loss of suitable habitat the plants have become so scarce that this is no longer done
== cultivationedit ==
=== geography and bog methodedit ===
cranberries are a major commercial crop in the u.s states of massachusetts new jersey oregon washington and wisconsin as well as in the canadian provinces of british columbia new brunswick ontario nova scotia prince edward island newfoundland and quebec british columbia's fraser river valley region produces an annual volume of 17 million kg of cranberries from 1,150 hectares about 95% of total canadian production in the united states wisconsin is the leading producer of cranberries with over half of u.s production massachusetts is the second largest u.s producer small volume production occurs in southern argentina chile and the netherlands
historically cranberry beds were constructed in wetlands today's cranberry beds are constructed in upland areas with a shallow water table the topsoil is scraped off to form dykes around the bed perimeter clean sand is hauled into a depth of four to eight inches the surface is laser leveled flat to provide even drainage beds are frequently drained with socked tile in addition to the perimeter ditch in addition to making it possible to hold water the dykes allow equipment to service the beds without driving on the vines irrigation equipment is installed in the bed to provide irrigation for vine growth and for spring and autumn frost protection
a common misconception about cranberry production is that the beds remain flooded throughout the year during the growing season cranberry beds are not flooded but are irrigated regularly to maintain soil moisture beds are flooded in the autumn to facilitate harvest and again during the winter to protect against low temperatures in cold climates like wisconsin new england and eastern canada the winter flood typically freezes into ice while in warmer climates the water remains liquid when ice forms on the beds trucks can be driven onto the ice to spread a thin layer of sand that helps to control pests and rejuvenate the vines sanding is done every three to five years
=== propagationedit ===
cranberry vines are propagated by moving vines from an established bed the vines are spread on the surface of the sand of the new bed and pushed into the sand with a blunt disk the vines are watered frequently during the first few weeks until roots form and new shoots grow beds are given frequent light application of nitrogen fertilizer during the first year the cost of establishment for new cranberry beds is estimated to be about us$70,000 per hectare (approx $28,300 per acre)
=== harvestingedit ===
cranberries are harvested in the fall when the fruit takes on its distinctive deep red color this is usually in september through the first part of november to harvest cranberries the beds are flooded with six to eight inches of water above the vines a harvester is driven through the beds to remove the fruit from the vines for the past 50 years water reel type harvesters have been used harvested cranberries float in the water and can be corralled into a corner of the bed and conveyed or pumped from the bed from the farm cranberries are taken to receiving stations where they are cleaned sorted and stored prior to packaging or processing
although most cranberries are wet-picked as described above 510% of the us crop is still dry-picked this entails higher labor costs and lower yield but dry-picked berries are less bruised and can be sold as fresh fruit instead of having to be immediately frozen or processed originally performed with two-handed comb scoops dry picking is today accomplished by motorized walk-behind harvesters which must be small enough to traverse beds without damaging the vines
white cranberry juice is made from regular cranberries that have been harvested after the fruits are mature but before they have attained their characteristic dark red color yields are lower on beds harvested early and the early flooding tends to damage vines but not severely
cranberries for fresh market are stored in shallow bins or boxes with perforated or slatted bottoms which deter decay by allowing air to circulate because harvest occurs in late autumn cranberries for fresh market are frequently stored in thick walled barns without mechanical refrigeration temperatures are regulated by opening and closing vents in the barn as needed cranberries destined for processing are usually frozen in bulk containers shortly after arriving at a receiving station
== food usesedit ==
=== nutritional valueedit ===
raw cranberries have moderate levels of vitamin c dietary fiber and the essential dietary mineral manganese (each nutrient having more than 10% of the daily value per 100 g serving see right table) as well as other essential micronutrients in minor amounts
=== productsedit ===
as fresh cranberries are hard and bitter about 95% of cranberries are processed and used to make cranberry juice and sauce they are also sold dried and sweetened
cranberry juice is usually sweetened or blended with other fruit juices to reduce its natural tartness many cocktails including the cosmopolitan are made with cranberry juice at one teaspoon of sugar per ounce cranberry juice cocktail is more highly sweetened than even soda drinks that have been linked to obesity
usually cranberries as fruit are cooked into a compote or jelly known as cranberry sauce such preparations are traditionally served with roast turkey as a staple of english christmas dinners and the canadian and us holiday thanksgiving the berry is also used in baking (muffins scones cakes and breads) in baking it is often combined with orange or orange zest less commonly cranberries are used to add tartness to savory dishes such as soups and stews
fresh cranberries can be frozen at home and will keep up to nine months they can be used directly in recipes without thawing
== researchedit ==
=== urinary tract infectionsedit ===
two comprehensive reviews of available research concluded that there is no evidence that cranberry compounds are effective in treating urinary tract infections
=== phytochemicalsedit ===
raw cranberries are a source of phytochemicals particularly polyphenols which are under active research for possible effects on the cardiovascular system immune system and cancer such as in isolated prostate cancer cells however there is no confirmation from human studies that consuming cranberry polyphenols provides health benefits
cranberry juice contains a high molecular weight non-dializable material that is under research for its potential to affect formation of plaque by streptococcus mutans pathogens that cause tooth decay cranberry juice components are also being studied for possible effects on kidney stone formation
cranberry juice is an abundant food source of proanthocyanidins and flavonols and quercetin which are being studied in vitro however their effectiveness in humans remains unknown and is limited by poor absorption into cells and rapid excretion
cranberry tannins may interact with proteins and possibly digestive enzymes -amylase and glucoamylase which in turn may affect starch hydrolysis as shown in one in vitro study
=== extract qualityedit ===
problems may arise with the lack of validation for quantifying of a-type proanthocyanidins (pac) extracted from cranberries for instance pac extract quality and content can be performed using different methods including the european pharmacopoeia method liquid chromatographymass spectrometry or a modified 4-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde colorimetric method variations in extract analysis can lead to difficulties in assessing the quality of pac extracts from different cranberry starting material such as by regional origin ripeness at time of harvest and post-harvest processing assessments show that quality varies greatly from one commercial pac extract product to another
=== possible safety concernsedit ===
caution from the committee on safety of medicines the uk agency dealing with drug safety advised patients taking warfarin not to drink cranberry juice after adverse effects (such as increased incidence of bruising) were reported possibly resulting from the presence of salicylic acid native to polyphenol-rich plants such as the cranberry however case reports and pilot studies failed to confirm this effect collectively indicating no statistically significant interaction between daily consumption of 250 ml cranberry juice and warfarin in the general population other safety concerns from consuming large quantities of cranberry juice or using cranberry supplements include potential for increasing stomach inflammation sugar intake or kidney stone formation

=== historyedit ===
in 1550 james white norwood made reference to native americans using cranberries in james rosier's book the land of virginia there is an account of europeans coming ashore and being met with native americans bearing bark cups full of cranberries in plymouth massachusetts there is a 1633 account of the husband of mary ring auctioning her cranberry-dyed petticoat for 16 shillings in 1640's key into the language roger williams described cranberries referring to them as bearberries because bears ate them in 1648 preacher john elliott was quoted in thomas shepard's book clear sunshine of the gospel with an account of the difficulties the pilgrims were having in using the indians to harvest cranberries as they preferred to hunt and fish in 1663 the pilgrim cookbook appears with a recipe for cranberry sauce in 1667 new englanders sent to king charles ten barrels of cranberries three barrels of codfish and some indian corn as a means of appeasement for his anger over their local coining of the pine tree shilling in 1669 captain richard cobb had a banquet in his house (to celebrate both his marriage to mary gorham and his election to the convention of assistance) serving wild turkey with sauce made from wild cranberries in the 1672 book new england rarities discovered author john josselyn described cranberries writing
sauce for the pilgrims cranberry or bearberry is a small trayling [sic] plant that grows in salt marshes that are overgrown with moss the berries are of a pale yellow color afterwards red as big as a cherry some perfectly round others oval all of them hollow with sower [sic] astringent taste they are ripe in august and september they are excellent against the scurvy they are also good to allay the fervor of hoof diseases the indians and english use them mush boyling [sic] them with sugar for sauce to eat with their meat and it is a delicate sauce especially with roasted mutton some make tarts with them as with gooseberries.
the compleat cook's guide published in 1683 made reference to cranberry juice in 1703 cranberries were served at the harvard university commencement dinner in 1787 james madison wrote thomas jefferson in france for background information on constitutional government to use at the constitutional convention jefferson sent back a number of books on the subject and in return asked for a gift of apples pecans and cranberries william aiton a scottish botanist included an entry for the cranberry in volume ii of his 1789 work hortus kewensis he notes that vaccinium macrocarpon (american cranberry) was cultivated by james gordon in 1760 in 1796 cranberries were served at the first celebration of the landing of the pilgrims and amelia simmons (an american orphan) wrote a book entitled american cookery which contained a recipe for cranberry tarts in 1816 henry hall first commercially grew cranberries in east dennis massachusetts on cape cod in 1843 eli howes planted his own crop of cranberries on cape cod using the howes variety in 1847 cyrus cahoon planted a crop of early black variety near pleasant lake harwich massachusetts in 1860 edward watson a friend of henry david thoreau wrote a poem called the cranberry tart.
cranberry sales in the united states have traditionally been associated with holidays of thanksgiving and christmas until the 1930s most of the crop was sold fresh
in the u.s. large scale cranberry cultivation has been developed as opposed to other countries american cranberry growers have a long history of cooperative marketing as early as 1904 john gaynor a wisconsin grower and a.u chaney a fruit broker from des moines iowa organized wisconsin growers into a cooperative called the wisconsin cranberry sales company to receive a uniform price from buyers growers in new jersey and massachusetts were also organized into cooperatives creating the national fruit exchange that marketed fruit under the eatmor brand the success of cooperative marketing almost led to its failure with consistent and high prices area and production doubled between 1903 and 1917 and prices fell in 1918 us$54,000 was spent on advertising leading to us$1 million in increased sales
with surplus cranberries and changing american households some enterprising growers began canning cranberries that were below-grade for fresh market competition between canners was fierce because profits were thin the ocean spray cooperative was established in 1930 through a merger of three primary processing companies ocean spray preserving company makepeace preserving co and cranberry products co the new company was called cranberry canners inc and used the ocean spray label on their products since the new company represented over 90% of the market it would have been illegal (cf antitrust) had attorney john quarles not found an exemption for agricultural cooperatives morris april brothers were the producers of eatmor brand cranberry sauce in tuckahoe new jersey morris april brothers brought an action against ocean spray for violation of the sherman antitrust act and won $200,000 in real damages plus triple damages in 1958 just in time for the great cranberry scare of 1959 as of 2006 about 65% of the north american industry belongs to the ocean spray cooperative (the percentage may be slightly higher in canada than in the u.s.)
a turning point for the industry occurred on 9 november 1959 when the secretary of the united states department of health education and welfare arthur s flemming announced that some of the 1959 crop was tainted with traces of the herbicide aminotriazole the market for cranberries collapsed and growers lost millions of dollars however the scare taught the industry that they could not be completely dependent on the holiday market for their products they had to find year-round markets for their fruit they also had to be exceedingly careful about their use of pesticides
after the aminotriazole scare ocean spray reorganized and spent substantial sums on product development new products such as cranberry/apple juice blends were introduced followed by other juice blends
a federal marketing order that is authorized to synchronize supply and demand was approved in 1962 the order has been renewed and modified slightly in subsequent years but it has allowed for more stable marketing the market order has been invoked during six crop years 1962 (12%) 1963 (5%) 1970 (10%) 1971 (12%) 2000 (15%) and 2001 (35%) even though supply still exceeds demand there is little will to invoke the federal marketing order out of the realization that any pullback in supply by u.s growers would easily be filled by canadian production
prices and production increased steadily during the 1980s and 1990s prices peaked at about $65.00 per barrel (29 /kga cranberry barrel equals 100 pounds or 45.4 kg.) in 1996 then fell to $18.00 per barrel (8.2 /kg) in 2001 the cause for the precipitous drop was classic oversupply production had outpaced consumption leading to substantial inventory in freezers or as concentrate
cranberry handlers (processors) include ocean spray cliffstar corporation northland cranberries inc.[sun northland llc] clement pappas & co. decas cranberry products as well as a number of small handlers and processors
=== cranberry marketing committeeedit ===
the cranberry marketing committee of the united states of america is an organization that represents 100% of the united states cranberry handlers in four marketing order districts the committee was established in 1963 as a federal marketing order to safeguard the orderly supply of a quality product the cranberry marketing committee based in wareham massachusetts represents 18 cranberry handlers which represents about 1,200 united states cranberry growers located in oregon connecticut massachusetts michigan minnesota new jersey new york rhode island washington and wisconsin the authority for the actions taken by the cranberry marketing committee is provided in chapter ix title 7 code of federal regulations which is called the federal cranberry marketing order the order is part of the agricultural marketing agreement act of 1937 identifying cranberries as a commodity good that can be regulated by congress the federal cranberry marketing order has been altered over the years to expand the cranberry marketing committee's ability to develop projects in the united states and around the world the cranberry marketing committee currently runs promotional programs in the united states china india mexico pan-europe russia and south korea
