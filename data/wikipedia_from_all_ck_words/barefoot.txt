barefoot is the most common term for the state of not wearing any footwear barefootedness is not regarded as unusual in many domestic environments but is subject to criticism in public spaces in many urban environments
== summary ==
wearing footwear is an exclusively human characteristic it has been normal in cold climates since early antiquity and has since become a convention in most cultures this is particularly the case in most urban situations where going barefoot is unusual while footwear is generally worn for functional fashion and societal reasons many people do not wear shoes at home
there are health benefits and risks associated with going barefoot footwear provides protection from cuts abrasions bruises and impacts from objects on the ground or the ground texture itself as well as from frostbite and parasites like hookworm in extreme situations however shoes can limit the flexibility and mobility of the foot and can lead to higher incidences of flexible flat foot bunions hammer toe and morton's neuroma walking barefoot results in a more natural gait allowing for a more rocking motion of the foot eliminating the hard heel strike hereby generating less collision force in the foot and lower leg
there are many sports that are performed barefoot most notably gymnastics and martial arts but also beach volleyball barefoot running and water skiing in modern language someone who tends not to wear shoes in public or is participating in the afore mentioned sports may be described as a barefooter
== historical and religious aspects ==

the romans who eventually conquered the greeks and adopted many aspects of their culture did not adopt the greek perception of footwear and clothing roman clothing explicitly including footwear was seen as a sign of power and as a necessity of living in a civilized world accordingly slaves usually were to remain barefoot there are many references to shoes being worn in the bible during weddings of this period a father would give his son-in-law a pair of shoes to symbolize the transfer of authority

bare feet have come to symbolize innocence or childhood in a glorifying perception of freedom from real-life requirements the connection to childhood and innocence as well as the simple joys of country life are embodied in the poem the barefoot boy by john greenleaf whittier published in 1855 additionally the book dancing barefoot by star trek the next generation actor wil wheaton features five short stories that chronicle his journey from childhood and youth through to maturity and self-acceptance

== imprisonment and slavery ==
confiscating an arrestee's footwear hereby forcing the unfree person to go barefoot has served as the first conventional method to tag and identify an individual as a prisoner in most civilizations hereby this marked an early appearance of distinguishable prison uniforming the distinctive look of bare feet is hereby used to establish a striking visual contrast to the conventional appearance comprising footwear as a standard feature
besides the indicatory aspect this also restricts the freedom of action in many situations therefore a barefooted person is generally disadvantaged opposite a shod person in practical aspects which is used as a means of exercising control over prisoners and captives
one of the most significant implications lies in disadvantages in a physical confrontation opposing shod individuals notably kicking acts exercised in bare feet provoke notably lesser grave impacts compared to the use of footwear therefore shoes are considered as deadly weapons in today's penal law of most countries moreover the barefooted person assumes the risk of hurting him- or herself in the act unshod feet further afford an effective target for forceful impacts these effects are usually desired by penal institutions with the intent to reduce the risk of personal injury for the correctional officers and facilitate subduing prisoners
another main objective is frustrating and impeding a prisoner's potential attempts to escape from custody by withholding the usual protection against external impacts on the relatively sensitive and susceptible feet notably the soles and toes the unshod individual is considerably impeded in locomotion when exposed to the common adversities of natural and also urban environments the imponderabilities of most urban or rural terrain surfaces therefore generally slow down the moving pace of a barefoot fugitive so the person is easier to retrieve if an escape should be attempted however an integral implication lies in the prisoner being aware of these adverse circumstances as they are constantly palpable and hereby being discouraged from contriving an escape attempt altogether
additionally a barefoot person typically experiences a certain amount of discomfort in common daily life situations mainly due to inconvenient ground temperature or textures and accidental impacts the desire to avoid these palpable inconveniences prompted the main motivation for man to continually revert to footwear ever since remote antiquity and incidentally established the traditional visual appearance implicating shoes an imposed exclusion from the habitual relief and visual identity of footwear afore and usually taken for granted is hereby likely to induce sentiments of humiliation and intimidation as well as a persistent cognition of heightened vulnerability on an involuntarily barefoot prisoner the direct presence of regularly vested individuals such as prison staff or spectators usually accentuates this effect a further aspect of humiliation lies in the stark display of power executed by the authorities against the powerless individual in this measure the prisoner typically cannot react against the coercion to go barefoot hereby constantly visualizes his or her weakness
as the mentioned effects are achieved practically effortless forcing captives or prisoners to go barefoot has been common practice in most civilisations since antiquity and is still practiced in several countries of today
it was also customary for visually marking slaves in former times while imposing the noted physical disadvantages on the individuals
=== slave codes ===
since ancient times it is a common practice in civil societies to wear footwear as a standard feature in contrast to this convention slave codes often decreed that slaves go barefoot for example the cape town slave code stated that slaves must go barefoot and must carry passes. this was the case in the majority of states that abolished slavery later in history as most images from the respective historical period suggest that slaves were barefoot to quote brother riemer (1779) [the slaves] are even in their most beautiful suit obliged to go barefoot slaves were forbidden to wear shoes this was a prime mark of distinction between the free and the bonded and no exceptions were permitted.
as shoes have been considered badges of freedom since biblical times but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put [it] on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on [his] feet (luke 15:22) this aspect has been an informal law wherever slavery existed a barefoot person could therefore be clearly identified as a slave upon first sight being seen barefoot was hereby socially proscribed for free citizens and avoided in many us-states this perception continues to have an effect to this day as everyday shoes are customarily also worn in private surroundings and going barefoot is effectively placed under taboo (see above)
in certain societies this rule is valid to this day as with the tuareg slavery is still unofficially practiced and their slaves have to go barefoot
=== imprisonment ===
within penal institutions in several countries of today prisoners generally have to remain barefoot by constraint
this is current practice in china zimbabwe thailand uganda iran pakistan india congo malawi rwanda cte divoire (ivory coast) and north korea among others
in thailand a defendant in penal proceedings traditionally must remain barefoot for courtroom appearances
in germany it was common practice during the nazi-era to uniformly detain female prisoners in their bare feet inside women's penitentiaries in socialist east germany (german democratic republic) especially political prisoners were often kept barefoot
the earmarking of captives by forcing them to go in bare feet was also practiced specifically on imprisoned women in parts of the united states until the early 20th century it was then common practice by penal institutions particularly in texas to exclude female prisoners from being issued with any kind of footwear by this means keeping them barefoot throughout contrary to this measure adequate shoes were standardly provided for male convicts as a matter of course there were no apparent security motives for this unequal treatment it was however practiced to point out the evident hierarchy between male and female detainees the according structure of subordination of the female prisoners also towards the male convicts was hereby showcased in an evident and palpable way it also conformed to the notion of the criminal courts who widely saw prisoners as official slaves of the state in this an analogy to actual former slaves was drawn who were often forced to remain barefoot as well (see above) as going shoeless is placed under a more of less strict social taboo in most regions of the us (see above) being forced to go entirely barefoot determined the degradation to the lowest social rank for the incarcerated women this arbitrary and victimizing measure was an apparent token for the general discrimination against incarcerated women who unlike male prisoners did not have the right to claim legal remedies at that time
in the present isis usually deprives their captives of footwear presumably in order to identify them more readily and prevent escape
in the bible there are multiple passages stating that a potent way to inflict humiliation on another human being lies in taking away his or her shoes and forcing the individual to go barefoot ritualistic customs therefore consisted of publicly taking away a disgraced person's shoes this resulted in the individual being defamed as a barefooter culminating in the loss of social standing on the other hand taking off the shoes of one's own will and voluntarily exposing one's bare feet is regarded as a token of submission and humility by the bible this included the subjection under higher powers as well as a mundane authority therefore it was concluded to be imperative that prisoners or captives were to be kept barefoot and in light clothing as a token of their subjugation
== corporal punishment ==
the soles of a person's bare feet also serve as a target for corporal punishment commonly referred to as bastinado (foot whipping) this method is mainly used in the context of penal functions and situations of detention or incarceration
the practice of foot whipping is still officially employed in several middle eastern nations where the term falaka is customary in history bastinado was frequently practiced in western countries as well among others it was commonly used in german territories where it was employed until the end of the nazi-era mainly within the reformatory and detention system in certain facilities it was even continued to be used during the 1950s
== arts and entertainment ==

the 1954 film the barefoot contessa tells the fictional story of maria vargas (portrayed by ava gardner) a spanish cabaret dancer of simple origins who frequently went barefoot she was cast in a movie by writer and director harry dawes (portrayed by humphrey bogart) and became a major star in 1978 ina garten purchased a specialty food store in the hamptons named barefoot contessa after the movie she liked the name because it went well with her simple and elegant cooking style she sold the store in 1999 and wrote her first book the barefoot contessa cookbook which became one of the best-selling cookbooks of the year she would go on to write more cookbooks and in 2002 started production of a television show on the food network also named the barefoot contessa which continues to run

== health implications ==
there are risks and benefits associated with going barefoot footwear provides some protection from puncture wounds from glass nails rocks or thorns as well as abrasions bruises and frostbitebut studies of people who habitually walk barefoot have consistently found that these problems are minimal with only about 0.89% of barefoot people having any kind of foot complaint linked to walking barefoot (including temporary conditions such as abrasions) or having the tops of the feet uncovered feet that have never worn shoes rarely exhibit problems such as bunions corns and fallen arches aren't prone to more than ordinary foot eversion on standing and walking due to the associated weakness or stiffness of the joints of the foot and weakness of the muscles controlling them as well as having a much reduced incidence of problems such as callouses
walking barefoot results in a more natural gait people who are used to walking barefoot tend to land with the forefoot or mid-foot eliminating the hard heel strike and generating much less collision force in the foot and lower leg a 2006 study found that shoes may increase stress on the knee and ankle and suggested that adults who walked barefoot may have a lower rate of osteoarthritis although more study is required to elucidate the factors that distribute loads in shod and barefoot walking a 2007 study examined 180 modern humans and compared their feet with 2,000-year-old skeletons they concluded that before the invention of shoes humans overall had healthier feet a 1991 study found that children who wore shoes were three times more likely to have flat feet than those who did not and suggested that wearing shoes in early childhood can be detrimental to the longitudinal arch of the foot children who habitually go barefoot were found to have stronger feet with better flexibility and mobility fewer deformities like flat feet or toes that curve inwards and fewer complaints walking barefoot enables a more natural gait eliminating the hard heel strike and instead allowing for a rocking motion of the foot from heel to toe similarly barefoot running usually involves an initial forefoot strike instead of on the rear of the foot generating smaller collision forces
since there is no artificial protection of the bare foot some of the possible issues include cuts abrasions bruises or puncture wounds from glass nails rocks or thorns as well as poisonous plants animals or parasites that can enter the body through the cuts on an injured bare foot in people who are not habitually barefoot athlete's foot is spread by fungal spores coming into contact with skin that has been weakened and made moist the fungus is known to only affect around 0.75% of habitually barefoot people in one study and can be prevented by reducing shoe use and keeping the feet dry particularly after walking through a damp environment where people communally walk barefoot as the fungus only develops under the right conditions such as when people fail to properly dry their feet after swimming or showering and then put on shoes wearing shoes such as flip flops or sandals in these areas can reduce the risk as such the fungus is very unlikely to develop on a person who goes barefoot all the time
the hookworm parasite found only in warm moist climates where human feces contaminated with hookworm larvae has been left in places where it might come into contact with human skin can burrow through a bare human foot (or any part of the body that comes into contact with it) however as the parasite tends to occur mainly in mud and cesspools its spread cannot be stopped by most standard shoessince the larvae can penetrate fabric and small holes the parasite may spread through contaminated material coming into contact with any part of the body such as through flecks of mud splashing on an ankle or leg the hookworm parasite is relatively mild has few symptoms and can pass completely unnoticed when the infestation level is low enough since the hookworm infection is very cheap and easy to treat and since it requires infected feces to come into contact with human skin within a particular time period eradicating hookworm is mainly a matter of hygiene (including the building of proper toilet and waste-disposal facilities) and mass-treatment in very cold weather shoes can provide thermal insulation protecting against frostbite
issues that can develop as a result of someone who has always worn shoes going barefoot include calf pain or achilles tendinitis or plantar fasciitis due to shortening of the achilles tendon and the foot being underdeveloped due to regular use of shoes a careful transition ease or remove symptoms which quickly vanish as the foot adapts blisters on the feet may occur in the first few weeks of going barefoot until the skin has become more robust individuals with diabetes or other conditions that affect sensation in the feet are at greater risk of injury while barefoot the american diabetes association recommends that diabetics wear shoes and socks at all times
== laws ==
in the united states there have been myths that regulations require the wearing of footwear in the united states during the period of the counterculture movement of the 1960s business establishments would deny admittance to barefoot hippies arguing that health regulations required that shoes be worn this led to a belief by many in nonexistent osha or local health department regulations preventing people from going to stores restaurants and other establishments without shoes however those regulations that exist apply only to employees and not customers specifically the united states occupational safety and health administration requires employers to ensure that each affected employee uses protective footwear when there is a danger of foot injuries due to falling or rolling objects objects piercing the sole of an employee's foot and where an employee's feet may be exposed to electrical hazards additionally employee footwear where required by osha must comply with one of the standards described in osha's regulations state and local laws may dictate when and where an employee must wear shoes

barefoot running can be dangerous especially to runners who do not adequately prepare or give their feet time to adapt to the new style many injuries are possible such as injuries to the achilles tendon or plantar fascia or stress fractures in the metatarsal bones or lower leg barefoot runners who do not prepare their bodies could provide a stimulus plan for podiatrists orthopedists and physical therapists.
the official position on barefoot running by the american podiatric medical association states that there is not enough research on the immediate- and long-term benefits of the practice and that individuals should consult a podiatrist with a strong background in sports medicine to make an informed decision on all aspects of their running and training programs
one alternative to barefoot running is to wear thin-soled shoes with minimal padding such as moccasins plimsolls or huaraches which result in similar gait to going barefoot but protect the skin and keep dirt and water off some modern shoe manufacturers have recently designed footwear to maintain optimum flexibility while providing a minimum amount of protection such shoes include the shoes made by vibram fivefingers vivobarefoot and nike's nike free shoes sales of minimalist running shoes have grown into a $1.7 billion industry sales of vibram fivefingers alone grew from $450,000 in 2006 to $50 million in 2011
