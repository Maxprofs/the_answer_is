transformers movie set earth year brawn assigned moonbase one along several first season autobots later assigned make special supply run autobot city earth shuttle mission decepticon forces invaded shuttle using megatron pistol mode starscream killed brawn single shot shoulder
brawns death disputed among fans although one strongest toughest autobots movie rapidly dispensed single piercing shot shoulder absence list deceased autobots dark awakening replaced list killed shuttle attack huffer plus appearance postmovie episode carnage cminor inspired ongoing debate whether character truly dead episode shows brawn miscolored huffer bonecrusher fighting together weapon built galvatron appearance generally considered error due episode riddled animation mistakes although select fans continue argue brawns survival addition animation confirmation demise confirmed movie script comic book adaptations depict brawn killed
dispute made brawns injuries damaging first glance whenever brawn takes shot shoulder falls noticed larger amount brawns back damaged thus giving possibility laser fired could acted hollow point like bullet damaging brawn previously thought
animators series would occasionally swell ranks transformers duplicates certain characters reflector transport oblivion shockwave five faces darkness duplicates intended represent generic transformers seems alternative brawn seen carnage cminor might possibly one duplicate along huffer
