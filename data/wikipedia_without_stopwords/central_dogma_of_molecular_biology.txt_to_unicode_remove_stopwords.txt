central dogma molecular biology explanation flow genetic information within biological system first stated francis crick restated nature paper published
central dogma also described dna makes rna rna makes protein positive statement originally termed sequence hypothesis crick however simplification make clear central dogma stated crick preclude reverse flow information rna dna ruling flow protein rna dna cricks use word dogma unconventional controversial
dogma framework understanding transfer sequence information sequential informationcarrying biopolymers common general case living organisms major classes biopolymers dna rna nucleic acids protein conceivable direct transfers information occur dogma classes groups general transfers believed occur normally cells special transfers known occur specific conditions case viruses laboratory unknown transfers believed never occur general transfers describe normal flow biological information dna copied dna dna replication dna information copied mrna transcription proteins synthesized using information mrna template translation
biological sequence information
biopolymers comprise dna rna polypeptides linear polymers ie monomer connected two monomers sequence monomers effectively encodes information transfers information described central dogma ideally faithful deterministic transfers wherein one biopolymers sequence used template construction another biopolymer sequence entirely dependent original biopolymers sequence
general transfers biological sequential information
dna replications
sense dna replication must occur genetic material provided progeny cell whether somatic reproductive copying dna dna arguably fundamental step central dogma complex group proteins called replisome performs replication information parent strand complementary daughter strand
replisome comprises
helicase unwinds superhelix well doublestranded dna helix create replication fork
ssb protein binds open doublestranded dna prevent reassociating
rna primase adds complementary rna primer template strand starting point replication
dna polymerase iii reads existing template chain end end adds new complementary nucleotides end end daughter chain
dna polymerase removes rna primers replaces dna
dna ligase joins two okazaki fragments phosphodiester bonds produce continuous chain
process typically takes place phase cell cycle
transcription
transcription process information contained section dna replicated form newly assembled piece messenger rna mrna enzymes facilitating process include rna polymerase transcription factors eukaryotic cells primary transcript premrna premrna must processed translation proceed processing includes addition cap polya tail premrna chain followed splicing alternative splicing occurs appropriate increasing diversity proteins single mrna produce product entire transcription process began production premrna chain mature mrna chain
translation
mature mrna finds way ribosome gets translated prokaryotic cells nuclear compartment processes transcription translation may linked together without clear separation eukaryotic cells site transcription cell nucleus usually separated site translation cytoplasm mrna must transported nucleus cytoplasm bound ribosomes ribosome reads mrna triplet codons usually beginning aug adenineuracilguanine initiator methionine codon downstream ribosome binding site complexes initiation factors elongation factors bring aminoacylated transfer rnas trnas ribosomemrna complex matching codon mrna anticodon trna trna bears appropriate amino acid residue add polypeptide chain synthesised amino acids get linked growing peptide chain chain begins folding correct conformation translation ends stop codon may uaa uga uag triplet
mrna contain information specifying nature mature protein nascent polypeptide chain released ribosome commonly requires additional processing final product emerges one thing correct folding process complex vitally important proteins requires chaperone proteins control form product proteins excise internal segments peptide chains splicing free ends border gap processes inside discarded sections called inteins proteins must split multiple sections without splicing polypeptide chains need crosslinked others must attached cofactors haem heme become functional
special transfers biological sequential information
reverse transcription
reverse transcription transfer information rna dna reverse normal transcription known occur case retroviruses hiv well eukaryotes case retrotransposons telomere synthesis process genetic information rna gets transcribed new dna
rna replication
rna replication copying one rna another many viruses replicate way enzymes copy rna new rna called rnadependent rna polymerases also found many eukaryotes involved rna silencing
rna editing rna sequence altered complex proteins guide rna could also seen rnatorna transfer
direct translation dna protein
direct translation dna protein demonstrated cellfree system ie test tube using extracts e coli contained ribosomes intact cells cell fragments could synthesize proteins singlestranded dna templates isolated organisms eg mouse toad neomycin found enhance effect however unclear whether mechanism translation corresponded specifically genetic code
transfers information explicitly covered theory
posttranslational modification
protein amino acid sequences translated nucleic acid chains edited appropriate enzymes although form protein affecting protein sequence explicitly covered central dogma many clear examples associated concepts two fields much
inteins
intein parasitic segment protein able excise chain amino acids emerge ribosome rejoin remaining portions peptide bond manner main protein backbone fall apart case protein changing primary sequence sequence originally encoded dna gene additionally inteins contain homing endonuclease heg domain capable finding copy parent gene include intein nucleotide sequence contact inteinfree copy heg domain initiates dna doublestranded break repair mechanism process causes intein sequence copied original source gene inteinfree gene example protein directly editing dna sequence well increasing sequences heritable propagation
methylation
variation methylation states dna alter gene expression levels significantly methylation variation usually occurs action dna methylases change heritable considered epigenetic change information status heritable would somatic epitype effective information content changed means actions protein proteins dna primary dna sequence altered
prions
prions proteins particular amino acid sequences particular conformations propagate host cells making conformational changes molecules protein amino acid sequence different conformation functionally important cell protein transconformed prion folding changes function turn convey information new cells reconfigure functional molecules sequence alternate prion form types prion fungi change continuous direct information flow protein protein
natural genetic engineering
james shapiro argues superset examples classified natural genetic engineering sufficient falsify central dogma shapiro received respectful hearing view critics convinced reading central dogma line crick intended
use term dogma
autobiography mad pursuit crick wrote choice word dogma problems caused
called idea central dogma two reasons suspect already used obvious word hypothesis sequence hypothesis addition wanted suggest new assumption central powerful turned use word dogma caused almost trouble worth many years later jacques monod pointed appear understand correct use word dogma belief cannot doubted apprehend vague sort way since thought religious beliefs without foundation used word way thought world simply applied grand hypothesis however plausible little direct experimental support
similarly horace freeland judson records eighth day creation
mind dogma idea reasonable evidence see crick gave roar delight didnt know dogma meant could well called central hypothesis know meant say dogma catch phrase
