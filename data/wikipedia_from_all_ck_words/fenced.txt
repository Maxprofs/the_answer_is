=== history ===
servitudes are legal arrangements of land use arising out of private agreements under the feudal system most land in england was cultivated in common fields where peasants were allocated strips of arable land that were used to support the needs of the local village or manor by the sixteenth century the growth of population and prosperity provided incentives for landowners to use their land in more profitable ways dispossessing the peasantry common fields were aggregated and enclosed by large and enterprising farmerseither through negotiation among one another or by lease from the landlordto maximize the productivity of the available land and contain livestock fences redefined the means by which land is used resulting in the modern law of servitudes
in the united states the earliest settlers claimed land by simply fencing it in later as the american government formed unsettled land became technically owned by the government and programs to register land ownership developed usually making raw land available for low prices or for free if the owner improved the property including the construction of fences however the remaining vast tracts of unsettled land were often used as a commons or in the american west open range as degradation of habitat developed due to overgrazing and a tragedy of the commons situation arose common areas began to either be allocated to individual landowners via mechanisms such as the homestead act and desert land act and fenced in or if kept in public hands leased to individual users for limited purposes with fences built to separate tracts of public and private land
=== united kingdom ===
ownership of a fence on an ownership boundary varies generally title deeds will show which side owns the fence using a t symbol (the leg of the t points towards the owner) commonly the cladding is on non-owners side enabling access to the posts for the owner when repairs are needed
where a fence or hedge has an adjacent ditch the ditch is normally in the same ownership as the hedge or fence with the ownership boundary being the edge of the ditch furthest from the fence or hedge the principle of this rule is that an owner digging a boundary ditch will normally dig it up to the very edge of their land and must then pile the spoil on their own side of the ditch to avoid trespassing on their neighbour they may then erect a fence or hedge on the spoil leaving the ditch on its far side exceptions often occur for example where a plot of land derives from subdivision of a larger one along the centre line of a previously-existing ditch or other feature
on private land in the united kingdom it is the landowner's responsibility to fence their livestock in conversely for common land it is the surrounding landowners responsibility to fence the common's livestock out
=== united states ===
distinctly different land ownership and fencing patterns arose in the eastern and western united states original fence laws on the east coast were based on the british common law system and rapidly increasing population quickly resulted in laws requiring livestock to be fenced in in the west land ownership patterns and policies reflected a strong influence of spanish law and tradition plus the vast land area involved made extensive fencing impractical until mandated by a growing population and conflicts between landowners the open range tradition of requiring landowners to fence out unwanted livestock was dominant in most of the rural west until very late in the 20th century and even today a few isolated regions of the west still have open range statutes on the books more recently fences are generally constructed on the surveyed property line as precisely as possible today across the nation each state is free to develop its own laws regarding fences in many cases for both rural and urban property owners the laws were designed to require adjacent landowners to share the responsibility for maintaining a common boundary fenceline today however only 22 states have retained that provision
