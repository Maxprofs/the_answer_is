overview
scientific model seeks represent empirical objects phenomena physical processes logical objective way models simulacra simplified reflections reality despite approximations extremely useful building disputing models fundamental scientific enterprise complete true representation may impossible scientific debate often concerns better model given task eg accurate climate model seasonal forecasting
attempts formalize principles empirical sciences use interpretation model reality way logicians axiomatize principles logic aim attempts construct formal system produce theoretical consequences contrary found reality predictions statements drawn formal system mirror map real world insofar scientific models true
scientist model also way human thought processes amplified instance models rendered software allow scientists leverage computational power simulate visualize manipulate gain intuition entity phenomenon process represented computer models silico types scientific model vivo living models laboratory rats vitro glassware tissue culture
basics scientific modelling
modelling substitute direct measurement experimentation
models typically used either impossible impractical create experimental conditions scientists directly measure outcomes direct measurement outcomes controlled conditions see scientific method always reliable modelled estimates outcomes
simulation
simulation implementation model steady state simulation provides information system specific instant time usually equilibrium state exists dynamic simulation provides information time simulation brings model life shows particular object phenomenon behave simulation useful testing analysis training cases realworld systems concepts represented models
structure
structure fundamental sometimes intangible notion covering recognition observation nature stability patterns relationships entities childs verbal description snowflake detailed scientific analysis properties magnetic fields concept structure essential foundation nearly every mode inquiry discovery science philosophy art
systems
system set interacting interdependent entities real abstract forming integrated whole general system construct collection different elements together produce results obtainable elements alone concept integrated whole also stated terms system embodying set relationships differentiated relationships set elements relationships element set elements part relational regime two types system models discrete variables change instantaneously separate points time continuous state variables change continuously respect time
generating model
modelling refers process generating model conceptual representation phenomenon typically model refer aspects phenomenon question two models phenomenon may essentially different say differences comprise simple renaming components
differences may due differing requirements models end users conceptual aesthetic differences among modellers contingent decisions made modelling process considerations may influence structure model might modellers preference reduced ontology preferences regarding statistical models versus deterministic models discrete versus continuous time etc case users model need understand assumptions made pertinent validity given use
building model requires abstraction assumptions used modelling order specify domain application model example special theory relativity assumes inertial frame reference assumption contextualized explained general theory relativity model makes accurate predictions assumptions valid might well make accurate predictions assumptions hold assumptions often point older theories succeeded new ones general theory relativity works noninertial reference frames well
term assumption actually broader standard use etymologically speaking oxford english dictionary oed online wiktionary indicate latin source assumere accept take oneself adopt usurp conjunction ad towards sumere take root survives shifted meanings italian sumere spanish sumir oed assume senses investing oneself attribute ii undertake especially law iii take oneself appearance pretend possess iv suppose thing thus assumption connotes associations contemporary standard sense assumed taken granted supposition postulate deserves broader analysis philosophy science
evaluating model
model evaluated first foremost consistency empirical data model inconsistent reproducible observations must modified rejected one way modify model restricting domain credited high validity case point newtonian physics highly useful except small fast massive phenomena universe however fit empirical data alone sufficient model accepted valid factors important evaluating model include
ability explain past observations
ability predict future observations
cost use especially combination models
refutability enabling estimation degree confidence model
simplicity even aesthetic appeal
people may attempt quantify evaluation model using utility function
visualization
visualization technique creating images diagrams animations communicate message visualization visual imagery effective way communicate abstract concrete ideas since dawn man examples history include cave paintings egyptian hieroglyphs greek geometry leonardo da vincis revolutionary methods technical drawing engineering scientific purposes

model based learning education
model based learning education particularly relation learning science involves students creating models scientific concepts order
gain insight scientific ideas
acquire deeper understanding subject visualization model
improve student engagement course
different types model based learning techniques include
physical macrocosms
representational systems
syntactic models
emergent models
model making education iterative exercise students refining developing evaluating models time shifts learning rigidity monotony traditional curriculum exercise students creativity curiosity approach utilizes constructive strategy social collaboration learning scaffold theory model based learning includes cognitive reasoning skills existing models improved upon construction newer models using old models basis
model based learning entails determining target models learning pathway provide realistic chances understanding model making also incorporate blended learning strategies using web based tools simulators thereby allowing students
familiarize online digital resources
create different models various virtual materials little cost
practice model making activity time place
refine existing models
welldesigned simulation simplifies real world system heightening awareness complexity system students participate simplified system learn real system operates without spending days weeks years would take undergo experience real world
teachers role overall teaching learning process primarily facilitator arranger learning experience would assign students model making activity particular concept provide relevant information support activity virtual model making activities teacher also provide information usage digital tool render troubleshooting support case glitches using teacher also arrange group discussion activity students provide platform necessary students share observations knowledge extracted model making activity
model based learning evaluation could include use rubrics assess ingenuity creativity student model construction also overall classroom participation student visavis knowledge constructed activity
important however give due consideration following successful model based learning occur
use right tool right time particular concept
provision within educational setup model making activity eg computer room internet facility software installed access simulator digital tool
