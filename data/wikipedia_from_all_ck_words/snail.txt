snail is a common name that is applied most often to land snails terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs
however the common name snail is also applied to most of the members of the molluscan class gastropoda that have a coiled shell that is large enough for the animal to retract completely into when the word snail is used in this most general sense it includes not just land snails but also thousands of species of sea snails and freshwater snails occasionally a few other molluscs that are not actually gastropods such as the monoplacophora which superficially resemble small limpets may also informally be referred to as snails
snail-like animals that naturally lack a shell or have only an internal shell are mostly called slugs and land snails that have only a very small shell (that they cannot retract into) are often called semi-slugs
== overview ==
snails that respire using a lung belong to the group pulmonata while those with gills form a polyphyletic group in other words snails with gills form a number of taxonomic groups that are not necessarily more closely related to each other than they are related to some other groups both snails that have lungs and snails that have gills have diversified so widely over geological time that a few species with gills can be found on land and numerous species with lungs can be found in freshwater even a few marine species have lungs
snails can be found in a very wide range of environments including ditches deserts and the abyssal depths of the sea although land snails may be more familiar to people marine snails constitute the majority of snail species and have much greater diversity and a greater biomass numerous kinds of snail can also be found in fresh water
most snails have thousands of microscopic tooth-like structures located on a ribbon-like tongue called a radula the radula works like a file ripping food into small pieces many snails are herbivorous eating plants or rasping algae from surfaces with their radulae though a few land species and many marine species are omnivores or predatory carnivores
several species of the genus achatina and related genera are known as giant african land snails some grow to 15 in (38 cm) from snout to tail and weigh 1 kg (2 lb) the largest living species of sea snail is syrinx aruanus its shell can measure up to 90 cm (35 in) in length and the whole animal with the shell can weigh up to 18 kg (40 lb)
== types of snails by habitat ==
== slugs ==
gastropod species that lack a conspicuous shell are commonly called slugs rather than snails some species of slugs have a reduced shell some have only an internal vestige that serves mainly as a calcium repository and others have no shell at all other than that there is little morphological difference between slugs and snails there are however important differences in habitats and behaviour
a shell-less animal is much more maneuverable and compressible so even quite large land slugs can take advantage of habitats or retreats with very little space retreats that would be inaccessible to a similar-sized snail slugs squeeze themselves into confined spaces such as under loose bark on trees or under stone slabs logs or wooden boards lying on the ground in such retreats they are in less danger from either predators or desiccation and often those also are suitable places for laying their eggs
slugs as a group are far from monophyletic biologically speaking slug is a term of convenience with little taxonomic significance the reduction or loss of the shell has evolved many times independently within several very different lineages of gastropods the various taxa of land and sea gastropods with slug morphology occur within numerous higher taxonomic groups of shelled species such independent slug taxa are not in general closely related to one another
== human relevance ==
land snails are known as an agricultural and garden pest but some species are an edible delicacy and occasionally household pets
=== in agriculture ===
there are a variety of snail-control measures that gardeners and farmers use in an attempt to reduce damage to valuable plants traditional pesticides are still used as are many less toxic control options such as concentrated garlic or wormwood solutions copper metal is also a snail repellent and thus a copper band around the trunk of a tree will prevent snails from climbing up and reaching the foliage and fruit
the decollate snail (rumina decollata) will capture and eat garden snails and because of this it has sometimes been introduced as a biological pest control agent however this is not without problems as the decollate snail is just as likely to attack and devour other gastropods that may represent a valuable part of the native fauna of the region
=== as food ===
in french cuisine edible snails are served for instance in escargot la bourguignonne the practice of rearing snails for food is known as heliciculture for purposes of cultivation the snails are kept in a dark place in a wired cage with dry straw or dry wood coppiced wine-grape vines are often used for this purpose during the rainy period the snails come out of hibernation and release most of their mucus onto the dry wood/straw the snails are then prepared for cooking their texture when cooked is slightly chewy
as well as being relished as gourmet food several species of land snails provide an easily harvested source of protein to many people in poor communities around the world many land snails are valuable because they can feed on a wide range of agricultural wastes such as shed leaves in banana plantations in some countries giant african land snails are produced commercially for food
land snails freshwater snails and sea snails are all eaten in a number of countries (principally spain philippines morocco nigeria algeria cameroon france italy portugal greece bulgaria belgium vietnam laos cambodia cyprus ghana malta terai of nepal southwestern china northeast india states such as manipur tripura and parts of the usa) in certain parts of the world snails are fried for example in indonesia they are fried as satay a dish known as sate kakul the eggs of certain snail species are eaten in a fashion similar to the way caviar is eaten
in bulgaria snails are traditionally cooked in an oven with rice or fried in a pan with vegetable oil and red paprika powder before they are used for those dishes however they are thoroughly boiled in hot water (for up to 90 minutes) and manually extracted from their shells the two species most commonly used for food in the country are helix lucorum and helix pomatia
==== famine food ====
snails and slug species that are not normally eaten in certain areas have occasionally been used as famine food in historical times variants of the following event have occurred in europe from time to time
in a popular publication quoted below occurs the following notice of a well-known land mollusk in connection with a traditionary story of the plague which has long had general currency in scotland in the woodlands the more formidable black nude slug the arion or limax will also be often encountered it is a huge voracious creature herbivorous feeding to barbaras astonishment on tender plants fruits as strawberries apples and even turnips and mushrooms appearing morning and evening or after rain suffering severely in its concealment in long droughts and remaining torpid in winter the gray field slug (limax agrestis) is actually recommended to be swallowed by consumptive patients in the town of dundee there exists a strange traditionary story of the plague connected with the conversion from dire necessity of the arion ater or black slug to a use similar to that which the luxurious romans are said to have made of the great apple-snail two young and blooming maidens lived together at that dread time like bessie bell and mary gray in a remote cottage on the steep (indeed almost perpendicular) ascent of the bonnetmakers hill deprived of friends or support by the pestilence that walked at noonday they still retained their good looks and healthful aspect even when the famine had succeeded to the plague the jaundiced eyes of the famine-wasted wretches around them were instantly turned towards the poor girls who appeared to thrive so well whilst others were famishing they were unhesitatingly accused of witchcraft and had nearly fallen a prey to that terrible charge for betwixt themselves they had sworn never to tell in words by what means they were supported ashamed as they felt of the resource to which they had been driven and resolved if possible to escape the anticipated derision of their neighbours on its disclosure it was only when about to be dragged before their stern inquisitors that one of the girls drawing aside the covering of a great barrel which stood in a corner of their domicile discovered without violating her oath that the youthful pair had been driven to the desperate necessity of collecting and preserving for food large quantities of these limacinae which they ultimately acknowledged to have proved to them generous and even agreeable sustenance to the credit of the times of george wisharta glimpse of pre-reforming enlightenmentthe explanation sufficed the young women escaped with their lives and were even applauded for their prudence
=== cosmetic ===
skin creams derived from helix aspersa snails are sold for use on wrinkles scars dry skin and acne a research study suggested that secretions produced under stress by helix aspersa might facilitate regeneration of wounded tissue
=== cultural depictions ===
==== symbolism ====
because of its slowness the snail has traditionally been seen as a symbol of laziness in christian culture it has been used as a symbol of the deadly sin of sloth psalms 58:8 uses snail slime as a metaphorical punishment
==== divination and other religious uses ====
snails were widely noted and used in divination the greek poet hesiod wrote that snails signified the time to harvest by climbing the stalks while the aztec moon god tecciztecatl bore a snail shell on his back this symbolised rebirth the snail's penchant for appearing and disappearing was analogised with the moon
==== love darts and cupid ====
professor ronald chase of mcgill university in montreal has suggested the ancient myth of cupid's arrows might be based on early observations of the love dart behavior of the land snail species helix aspersa
==== metaphor ====
in contemporary speech the expression a snail's pace is often used to describe a slow inefficient process the phrase snail mail is used to mean regular postal service delivery of paper messages as opposed to the delivery of email which can be virtually instantaneous
