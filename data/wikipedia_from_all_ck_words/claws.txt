a claw is a curved pointed appendage found at the end of a toe or finger in most amniotes (mammals reptiles birds) however the word claw is also often used in reference to an invertebrate somewhat similar fine hooked structures are found in arthropods such as beetles and spiders at the end of the leg or tarsus for gripping a surface as the creature walks crabs lobsters and scorpions pincers or more formally their chelae are sometimes called claws
a true claw (as opposed to a chela) is made of hard protein called keratin claws are used to catch and hold prey in carnivorous mammals such as cats and dogs but may also be used for such purposes as digging climbing trees self-defense and grooming in those and other species
similar appendages that are flat and do not come to a sharp point are called nails instead claw-like projections that do not form at the end of digits but spring from other parts of the foot are properly named spurs
claws of animals like tigers lions and bears were used in making items such as ornaments pendants and brooches
== tetrapods ==
in tetrapods claws are made of keratin and consist of two layers the unguis is the harder external layer which consists of keratin fibers arranged perpendicular to the direction of growth and in layers at an oblique angle the subunguis is the softer flaky underside layer whose grain is parallel to the direction of growth the claw grows outward from the nail matrix at the base of the unguis and the subunguis grows thicker while travelling across the nail bed the unguis grows outward faster than the subunguis to produce a curve and the thinner sides of the claw wear away faster than their thicker middle producing a more or less sharp point tetrapods use their claws in many ways commonly to grasp or kill prey to dig and to climb and hang
=== mammals ===
all carnivora have claws which vary considerably in length and shape claws grow out of the third phalanges of the paws and are made of keratin many predatory mammals have protractile claws that can partially hide inside the animal's paw especially the cat family felidae almost all of which members have fully protractible claws outside of the cat family retractable claws are found only in certain species of the viverridae (and the extinct nimravidae) a claw that is retractable is protected from wear and tear
most cats and dogs also have a dewclaw on the inside of the front paws it is much less functional than the other claws but does help the cats to grasp prey agile strong acrobatic dogs use their dew claws to improve their purchase or grip for quick turns during high speed chases if you inspect the paws of a dog after such activity you will find the dew claw worn and traces of soil felines and wild canines probably use their dew claws similarly because the dew claw does not touch the ground often it receives less wear and tends to be sharper and longer
a nail is homologous to a claw but is flatter and has a curved edge instead of a point a nail that is big enough to bear weight is called a hoof (nevertheless one side of the cloven-hoof of artiodactyl ungulates may also be called a claw)
every so often the growth of claws stops and restarts as does hair in hair this results in the hair falling out and being replaced by a new one in claws this results in an abscission layer and the old segment breaks off this process takes several months for human thumbnails cats are often seen working old unguis layers off on wood or on boards made for the purpose ungulates hooves wear or self-trim by ground contact domesticated equids (horses donkeys and mules) usually need regular trimming by a farrier as a consequence of reduced activity on hard ground
==== primates ====
primate nails consist of the unguis alone as the subunguis has disappeared with the evolution of grasping hands and feet claws are no longer necessary for locomotion and instead most digits exhibit nails however claw-like nails are found in small-bodied callitrichids on all digits except the hallux or big toe a laterally flattened grooming claw used for grooming can be found on the second toe in living strepsirrhines and the second and third in tarsiers aye-ayes have functional claws on all other digits except the hallux including a grooming claw on the second toe less commonly known a grooming claw is also found on the second pedal digit of night monkeys (aotus) titis (callicebus) and possibly other new world monkeys
=== reptiles ===
most lizards have toes ending in stout claws the claws form from the last scale on the toe most reptiles have well-developed claws in snakes feet and claws are absent but in many boids such as boa constrictor remnants of highly reduced hind-limbs emerge with a single claw as spurs on each side of the anal opening
lizard claws are used as aids in climbing and in holding down prey in carnivorous species
=== birds ===
a talon is the claw of a bird of prey its primary hunting tool the talons are very important without them most birds of prey would not be able to catch their food some birds also use claws for defensive purposes cassowaries use claws on their inner toe (digit ii) for defence and have been known to disembowel people all birds however have claws which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits
the hoatzin is unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the thumb and index finger (digit i and ii) on the forelimbs as chicks allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop however several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers at the end of the hand digits notably ducks geese and kiwis
=== amphibians ===
the only amphibians to bear claws are the african clawed frogs claws appear to have evolved separately in the amphibian and amniote line
== arthropods ==
the correct term for the claw of an arthropod such as a lobster or crab is a chela (plural chelae) legs bearing a chela are called chelipeds chelae are also called pincers
