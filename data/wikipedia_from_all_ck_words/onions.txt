the onion (allium cepa l.) (latin cepa = onion) also known as the bulb onion or common onion is a vegetable and is the most widely cultivated species of the genus allium
this genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the japanese bunching onion (a fistulosum) the egyptian onion (a proliferum) and the canada onion (a canadense) the name wild onion is applied to a number of allium species but a cepa is exclusively known from cultivation its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions the onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season
the onion plant has a fan of hollow bluish-green leaves and the bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached in the autumn the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle the crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage the crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases particularly the onion fly the onion eelworm and various fungi cause rotting some varieties of a cepa such as shallots and potato onions produce multiple bulbs
onions are cultivated and used around the world as a food item they are usually served cooked as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish but can also be eaten raw or used to make pickles or chutneys they are pungent when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which irritate the eyes
== taxonomy and etymology ==
the onion plant (allium cepa) also known as the bulb onion or common onion is the most widely cultivated species of the genus allium it was first officially described by carl linnaeus in his 1753 work species plantarum a number of synonyms have appeared in its taxonomic history
allium cepa var aggregatum g don
allium cepa var bulbiferum regel
allium cepa var cepa linnaeus
allium cepa var multiplicans l.h bailey
allium cepa var proliferum (moench) regel
allium cepa var solaninum alef
allium cepa var viviparum (metz) mansf
a cepa is known exclusively from cultivation but related wild species occur in central asia the most closely related species include a vavilovii (popov & vved.) and a asarense (r.m fritsch & matin) from iran however zohary and hopf state that there are doubts whether the a vavilovii collections tested represent genuine wild material or only feral derivatives of the crop.
the vast majority of cultivars of a cepa belong to the common onion group (a cepa var cepa) and are usually referred to simply as onions the aggregatum group of cultivars (a cepa var aggregatum) includes both shallots and potato onions
the genus allium also contains a number of other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the japanese bunching onion (a fistulosum) egyptian onion (a proliferum) and canada onion (a canadense)
cepa is commonly accepted as latin for onion and has an affinity with ancient greek (kpia) albanian qep aromanian tseap catalan ceba english chive occitan ceba old french cive and romanian ceap
== description ==
the onion plant is unknown in the wild but has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7,000 years it is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm (6 to 18 in) the leaves are yellowish-green and grow alternately in a flattened fan-shaped swathe they are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side they are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper towards a blunt tip the base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of a basal disc from the underside of the disc a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil as the onion matures food reserves begin to accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells
in the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle and this is when the crop is normally harvested if left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring new leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence the inflorescence takes the form of a globular umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes the seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross section
== uses ==
=== historical use ===
bulbs from the onion family are thought to have been used as a food source for millennia in bronze age settlements traces of onion remains were found alongside date stones and fig remains that date back to 5000 bc however it is not clear if these were cultivated onions archaeological and literary evidence such as the book of numbers 11:5 suggests that onions were probably being cultivated around 2000 years later in ancient egypt at the same time that leeks and garlic were cultivated workers who built the egyptian pyramids may have been fed radishes and onions
the onion is easily propagated transported and stored the ancient egyptians worshipped it believing its spherical shape and concentric rings symbolized eternal life onions were even used in egyptian burials as evidenced by onion traces being found in the eye sockets of ramesses iv
in ancient greece athletes ate large quantities of onion because it was believed to lighten the balance of the blood roman gladiators were rubbed down with onions to firm up their muscles in the middle ages onions were such an important food that people would pay their rent with onions and even give them as gifts doctors were known to prescribe onions to facilitate bowel movements and erections and to relieve headaches coughs snakebite and hair loss
onions were taken by the first settlers to north america where the native americans were already using wild onions in a number of ways eating them raw or cooked in a variety of foods they also used them to make into syrups to form poultices and in the preparation of dyes according to diaries kept by the colonists bulb onions were one of the first things planted by the pilgrim fathers when they cleared the land for cropping
onions were also prescribed by doctors in the early 16th century to help with infertility in women they were similarly used to raise fertility levels in dogs cats and cattle but this was an error as recent research has shown that onions are toxic to dogs cats guinea pigs and many other animals
=== culinary uses ===
onions are commonly chopped and used as an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes and may also be used as a main ingredient in their own right for example in french onion soup or onion chutney they are very versatile and can be baked boiled braised grilled fried roasted sauted or eaten raw in salads their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked facilitating stuffing them onions are a staple in indian cuisine used as a thickening agent for curries and gravies onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack these are often a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the united kingdom and the commonwealth usually served with cheese and/or ale in the united kingdom in north america sliced onions are battered and deep-fried and served as onion rings
==== onion types and products ====
common onions are normally available in three colour varieties yellow or brown onions (called red in some european countries) are full-flavoured and are the onions of choice for everyday use yellow onions turn a rich dark brown when caramelized and give french onion soup its sweet flavour the red onion (called purple in some european countries) is a good choice for fresh use when its colour livens up the dish it is also used in grilling white onions are the traditional onions used in classic mexican cuisine they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sauted
while the large mature onion bulb is most often eaten onions can be eaten at immature stages young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions when an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun but the onion is not yet mature the plants are sometimes referred to as summer onions
additionally onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes depending on the mature size and the purpose for which the onion is used these may be referred to as pearl boiler or pickler onions but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a long-lasting relish
onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelized pickled and chopped forms the dehydrated product is available as kibbled sliced rings minced chopped granulated and powder forms
onion powder is a seasoning widely used when the fresh ingredient is not available it is made from finely ground dehydrated onions mainly the pungent varieties of bulb onions and has a strong odour being dehydrated it has a long shelf life and is available in several varieties yellow red and white
=== non-culinary uses ===
onions have particularly large cells that are readily observed under low magnification forming a single layer of cells the bulb epidermis is easy to separate for educational experimental and breeding purposes onions are therefore commonly employed in science education to teach the use of a microscope for observing cell structure
the pungent juice of onions has been used as a moth repellent and can be rubbed on the skin to prevent insect bites when applied to the scalp it is said to promote growth of hair and on the face to reduce freckling it has been used to polish glass and copperware and to prevent rust on iron if boiling water is poured onto chopped onions and left to cool the resulting liquid can be sprayed onto plants to increase their resistance to pests and the onion plants when growing are reputed to keep away moles and insects onion skins have been used to produce a yellow-brown dye
historically onions were often used for cromniomancy across europe africa and northern asia and they continue to be used for this practice in some rural areas
== nutrients and phytochemicals ==
most onion cultivars are about 89% water 4% sugar 1% protein 2% fibre and 0.1% fat onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients (right table) are low in fats and have an energy value of 166 kj (40 kcal) per 100 g (3.5 oz) they contribute their flavor to savory dishes without raising caloric content appreciably
onions contain phytochemical compounds such as phenolics that are under basic research to determine their possible properties in humans
considerable differences exist between onion varieties in polyphenol content with shallots having the highest level six times the amount found in vidalia onions the variety with the smallest amount yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content an amount 11 times higher than in white onions red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10% of total flavonoid content
some people suffer from allergic reactions after handling onions symptoms can include contact dermatitis intense itching rhinoconjunctivitis blurred vision bronchial asthma sweating and anaphylaxis allergic reactions may not occur in these individuals to the consumption of onions perhaps because of the denaturing of the proteins involved during the cooking process
while onions and other members of the genus allium are commonly consumed by humans they can be deadly for dogs cats guinea pigs monkeys and other animals the toxicity is caused by the sulfoxides present in raw and cooked onions which many animals are unable to digest ingestion results in anaemia caused by the distortion and rupture of red blood cells sick pets are sometimes fed with tinned baby foods and any that contain onion should be avoided the typical toxic doses are 5 g (0.2 oz) per kg (2.2 lb) bodyweight for cats and 15 to 30 g (0.5 to 1.1 oz) per kg for dogs
== eye irritation ==
chopping an onion causes damage to cells which allows enzymes called alliinases to break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids a specific sulfenic acid 1-propenesulfenic acid is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme the lacrimatory factor synthase (lfs) giving syn-propanethial-s-oxide a volatile gas known as the onion lacrimatory factor or lf this gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes where it activates sensory neurons creating a stinging sensation tear glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant
eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb refrigerating the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away from the eyes the more often one chops onions the less one experiences eye irritation
the amount of sulfenic acids and lf released and the irritation effect differs among allium species in 2008 the new zealand crop and food institute created a strain of no tears onions by using gene-silencing biotechnology to prevent synthesis by the onions of the lfs enzyme
== cultivation ==
onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are well-drained sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting bulbing onions are day-length sensitive their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity most traditional european onions are referred to as long-day onions producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs southern european and north african varieties are often known as intermediate-day types requiring only 1213 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation finally short-day onions which have been developed in more recent times are planted in mild-winter areas in the fall and form bulbs in the early spring and require only 1112 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation onions are a cool-weather crop and can be grown in usda zones 3 to 9 hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to bolt meaning that a flower stem begins to grow
onions may be grown from seed or from sets onion seeds are short-lived and fresh seeds germinate better the seeds are sown thinly in shallow drills thinning the plants in stages in suitable climates certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year onion sets are produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in poor soil and the small bulbs produced are harvested in the autumn these bulbs are planted the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year certain cultivars are used for this purpose and these may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed
routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds especially when the plants are young the plants are shallow-rooted and do not need a great deal of water when established bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks the bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh but if they will be kept in storage they should be harvested after the leaves have died back naturally in dry weather they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days to dry out properly then they can be placed in nets roped into strings or laid in layers in shallow boxes they should be stored in a well-ventilated cool place such as a shed
=== pests and diseases ===
onions suffer from a number of plant disorders the most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly stem and bulb eelworm white rot and neck rot diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut downy mildew and white tip disease the bulbs may be affected by splitting white rot and neck rot shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants the larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth (acrolepiopsis assectella) sometimes attacks the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb
the onion fly (delia antiqua) lays eggs on the leaves and stems and on the ground close to onion shallot leek and garlic plants the fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning plants grown from sets are less prone to attack the larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow the bulbs are disfigured and rot especially in wet weather control measures may include crop rotation the use of seed dressings early sowing or planting and the removal of infested plants
the onion eelworm (ditylenchus dipsaci) a tiny parasitic soil-living nematode causes swollen distorted foliage young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs no cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burnt the site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots parsnips and beans which are also susceptible to the eelworm
white rot of onions leeks and garlic is caused by the soil-borne fungus sclerotium cepivorum as the roots rot the foliage turns yellow and wilts the bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia which later produces small globular black structures called sclerotia these resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop no cure for this fungal disease exists so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years
neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage it is caused by botrytis allii which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb causing a grey mould to develop the symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales large quantities of spores are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop in time a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry mummified structure this disease may be present throughout the growing period but only manifests itself when the bulb is in store antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting careful drying and curing of the mature onions and correct storage in a cool dry place with plenty of circulating air
=== storage in the home ===
cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in mesh bags in a dry cool dark well-ventilated location in this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay
sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions this makes them sweeter- and milder-tasting but reduces their shelf life sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life around 1 month irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days
== varieties ==
=== common onion group (var cepa) ===
most of the diversity within a cepa occurs within this group the most economically important allium crop plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets the majority of cultivars grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group the range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod (length of day that triggers bulbing) storage life flavour and skin colour common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the vidalia from georgia usa or walla walla from washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich
=== aggregatum group (var aggregatum) ===
this group contains shallots and potato onions also referred to as multiplier onions the bulbs are smaller than those of common onions and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs they are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs although reproduction from seed is possible shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially they form aggregate clusters of small narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster and having a flattened (onion-like) shape however intermediate forms exist
i'itoi onion is a prolific multiplier onion cultivated in the baboquivari peak wilderness arizona area this small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavor and is easy to grow and ideal for hot dry climates bulbs are separated and planted in the fall 1 in below the surface and 12 in apart bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months tops die back in the heat of summer and may return with heavy rains bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall the plants rarely flower propagation is by division
==== hybrids with a cepa parentage ====
a number of hybrids are cultivated that have a cepa parentage such as the diploid tree onion or egyptian onion (a proliferum) wakegi onion (a wakegi) and the triploid onion (a cornutum)
the tree onion or egyptian onion produces bulblets in the umbel instead of flowers and is now known to be a hybrid of a cepa a fistulosum it has previously been treated as a variety of a cepa for example a cepa var proliferum a cepa var bulbiferum and a cepa var viviparum
the wakegi onion is also known to be a hybrid between a cepa and a fistulosum with the a cepa parent believed to be from the aggregatum group of cultivars it has been grown for centuries in japan and china for use as a salad onion
under the rules of botanical nomenclature both the egyptian onion and wakegi onion should be combined into one hybrid species having the same parent species where this is followed the egyptian onion is named a proliferum eurasian group and the wakegi onion is named a proliferum east asian group
the triploid onion is a hybrid species with three sets of chromosomes two sets from a cepa and the third set from an unknown parent various clones of the triploid onion are grown locally in different regions such as ljutika in croatia and pran poonch and srinagar in the india-kashmir region pran is grown extensively in the northern indian provinces of jammu and kashmir there are very small genetic differences between pran and the croatian clone ljutika implying a monophyletic origin for this species
some authors have used the name a cepa var viviparum (metzg.) alef for the triploid onion but this name has also been applied to the egyptian onion the only name unambiguously connected with the triploid onion is a cornutum
spring onions or salad onions may be grown from the welsh onion (a fistulosum) as well as from a cepa young plants of a fistulosum and a cepa look very similar but may be distinguished by their leaves which are circular in cross-section in a fistulosum rather than flattened on one side
== production and trade ==
an estimated 9,000,000 acres (3,642,000 ha) of onions are grown around the world annually about 170 countries cultivate onions for domestic use and about 8% of the global production is traded internationally
the onion futures act passed in 1958 bans the trading of futures contracts on onions in the united states this prohibition came into force after farmers complained about alleged market manipulation by sam seigel and vincent kosuga at the chicago mercantile exchange two years earlier the subsequent investigation provided economists with a unique case study into the effects of futures trading on agricultural prices the act remains in effect as of 2013
