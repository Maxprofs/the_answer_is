=== july 7 disruption ===
on 7 july 2015 trains along the east-west line and north-south line experienced intermittent power surges this eventually led to the entire suspension of both lines affecting 413,000 passengers it was the worst mrt disruption in the history of the mrt
an investigation by lta found that smrt had failed to detect leakages to the underground tunnel between tanjong pagar and raffles place this led to mineral deposits on the third rail insulation causing the power system to trip which led to the disruption of both lines
== impacts ==
=== dissatisfaction with public transportation ===
while singaporeans began to noticing some issues with the mrt system in terms of overcrowding the december 2011 disruptions brought the state of public transportation as a whole to national and international prominence lta also noted a noticeable drop in dissatisfaction with public transport with the release of the 2012 public transport customer satisfaction survey and promised government action to deal with issues relating to mrt and lrt disruptions
=== changes to government policy ===
the government increased the penalty of train disruptions and made free travel available for any bus services passing mrt stations affected during any train disruptions to increase satisfaction with the public transport the government introduced the bus service enhancement programme and free morning off-peak travel to the city as interim measures to cope with the demands of the public transport system
=== financial penalties ===
for the december 2011 disruptions the land transport authority (lta) imposed a maximum financial penalty of s$2 million on smrt (approximately us$1.526 million) for the two train disruptions along the north south line (nsl) on december 15 and 17 2011 for the july 2015 disruption lta imposed a higher penalty of s$5.4 million on smrt
