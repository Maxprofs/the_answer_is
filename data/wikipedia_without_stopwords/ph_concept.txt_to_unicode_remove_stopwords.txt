background
izaak kolthoff son moses rosetta kolthoff born almelo netherlands youngest three children early education high school first chemistry course allowed develop keen interest subject inspired create laboratory kitchen experiments involved hydrogen sulfide dismay family graduating high school entered school pharmacy university utrecht reason began studies pharmacy rather chemistry lacked latin greek time prerequisites admission pure physical sciences nevertheless pharmacy curriculum utrecht thorough involved great deal analytical chemistry kolthoffs pharmacy professor nicholas schoorl great influence life schoorl emphasized proper balance descriptive chemistry fundamental principles field important part kolthoffs life education schoorl drew kolthoffs attention early papers electroanalytical chemistry well coprecipitation also responsible advising kolthoff study analytical chemistry scientific perspective opposed empirical art upon graduation kolthoff obtained apotheker dimploma continued education taking courses utrecht physical colloid chemistry university dropped requirement latin greek received phd chemistry
college izaak kolthoff known originality insight timeliness published work kolthoff published first paper ph new concept time already published papers authored coauthored eight textbooks monographs time retirement published research papers nine textbooks published next thirty years published another papers coedited thirty four volumes reference books kolthoff continued stay utrecht conservator lecturer electrochemistry invited lecture tour canada united states also served chairman committee analytical research methods supervisor three research projects us government synthetic rubber work specifically emulsion polymerization process crucial step military making synthetic rubber natural rubber supplies stopped also considered political social justice activist early unamerican activities committee accused kolthoff belonging thirty two subversive organizations directly criticized senator joseph mccarthys persecution perceived communists actions taken also helped german scientist persecuted hitler find jobs university minnesota
kolthoff never married lived life short distance chemistry building retirement continued working lab assistant miron chantooni died thursday bethesda lutheran hospital rehabilitation center st paul according trustee sidney barrows death due kidney failure
occupation
kolthoff went lecture tour united states canada soon offered position professor chief analytical division school chemistry university minnesota initially contract one year position became permanent letter acceptance stated may assure side try duty well possible hope expectations disappointed remained university minnesota nominally retired retired remained active research late

research
main areas research diverse full insight main areas research ph electron transfer precipitation reactions voltammetry emulsion polymerization induced reactions compounds containing sulfhydryl disulfide groups nonaqueous solutions
proton transfer reactions analytical chemistry ph concept titrations indicators buffers
proton transfer reactions analytical chemistry ph concept titrations indicators buffers dr kolthoffs first paper dealt titration phosphoric acid mono diprotic acid
electron transfer precipitation reactions
topic arose thesis work fundamentals iodimetry work discussed variety reactions occurring iodimetry mechanisms reactions side reactions titration errors
formation properties precipitates
dr kolthoff spent much time precipitates discovered many new things crystalline precipitates used radiotracers thorium b lead bromine activated neutrons radonberyllium source study highly imperfect crystalline precipitates structures underwent aging ambient temperatures meaning purification recrystallization takes place
voltammetry
j heyrovsky inventor polarography introduced topic kolthoff polarography measurement voltammetry dropping mercury electrode two kolthoffs students began working voltammetry
emulsion polymerization
dr kolthoff asked work major rubber companies create synthetic rubber war effort asked develop analytical methods rates reactants consumed could determined ndodecyl mercaptan constituent turned key reactant referred oei one essential ingredient dr kolthoff developed method determination oei based amperometric titration rotated platinum microelectrode silver nitrate method found worldwide use war immediately research dr kolthoff looked factors influencing rates reaction mercaptans also studied kinetics mechanism emulsion polymerization general later led initiating systems worked lower temperatures produced cold rubber cold rubber superior properties natural rubber
induced reactions
dr kolthoff studied number induced reactions including ironiihydrogen peroxide reaction showed hydroxyl radicals first step induce oxidation many organic compounds
compounds containing sulfhydryl disulfide groups
also underwent extensive studies included compounds containing sulfhydryl disulfide groups starting papers may first bioelectrochemistry
chemistry nonaqueous solutions
early dr kolthoff began long series studies solvents influence properties solutes contributions proton transfer followed electrolytic dissociation resolved studies also became interested reactions macrocyclic ligands various solvents
publications
der gebrauch von farbenindikatoren
first published monogram book went many german editions translated english princeton university later titled acidbase indicators expanded c rosenblum coauthor
konduktometrische titrationen potentiometric titrations
period working iodimetry began use conductometry poteniometry led two monograms potentiometric titrations especially influential analytical chemistry fields well
massanalyse
continuation fundamental studies classical methods translated coauthored nh furman later appeared volumetric analysis also appeared much later expanded threevolume edition coauthored va stenger g matsuyama r belcher dr kolthoff served adviser maurits dekker eric proskauer creating interscience publishers
polarography
introduction voltammetry expanded two volumes
emulsion polymerization
book immediately followed dr kolthoffs studies cold rubber coauthored fa bovey ai medalia ej meehan
colorimetric potentiometric determination ph
colorimetric potentiometric determination ph dr kolthoffs first book published mostly meant used text
textbook quantitative inorganic analysis
second text published considered admirable balance fundamentals experimental features field book served model future texts
treatise analytical chemistry
said monumental production part deals general fundamentals analytical chemistry part ii deals analytical chemistry organic inorganic compounds specific terms part iii concerns analytical chemistry industry treatise huge impact world principal reference source analytical chemistry
