differences male female pubertyedit
two significant differences puberty girls puberty boys age begins major sex steroids involved testosterones estrogens
although wide range normal ages girls typically begin process puberty age boys ages girls usually complete puberty ages boys usually complete puberty ages girls attain reproductive maturity four years first physical changes puberty appear contrast boys accelerate slowly continue grow six years first visible pubertal changes increase height beyond postpubertal age uncommon
boys androgen called testosterone principal sex hormone testosterone produced boys changes characterized virilization substantial product testosterone metabolism males estradiol conversion testosterone estradiol depends amount body fat estradiol levels boys typically much lower girls male growth spurt also begins later accelerates slowly lasts longer epiphyses fuse although boys average centimetres shorter girls puberty begins adult men average centimetres taller women sex difference adult heights attributable later onset growth spurt slower progression completion direct result later rise lower adult male levels estradiol
hormone dominates female development estrogen called estradiol estradiol promotes growth breasts uterus also principal hormone driving pubertal growth spurt epiphyseal maturation closure estradiol levels rise earlier reach higher levels women men
hormonal maturation females considerably complicated boys main steroid hormones testosterone estradiol progesterone well prolactin play important physiological functions puberty gonadal steroidgenesis girls starts production testosterone typically quickly converted estradiol inside ovaries however rate conversion testosterone estradiol driven fshlh balance early puberty highly individual resulting diverse development patterns secondary sexual characteristics production progesterone ovaries begins development ovulatory cycles girls lutheal phase cycle puberty low levels progesterone produced adrenal glands boys girls

effects early late puberty onsetedit
several studies puberty examined effects early late onset puberty males females general girls enter puberty late experience positive outcomes adolescence adulthood girls enter puberty early experience negative outcomes boys earlier pubertal timing generally positive outcomes adulthood negative outcomes adolescence reverse true later pubertal timing
girlsedit
outcomes generally indicated early onset puberty girls psychologically damaging main reason detrimental effect issue body image physically develop gaining weight several areas body earlymaturing girls usually look larger girls yet entered puberty result social pressure thin earlymaturing girls develop negative view body image addition boys may tease girls visible breasts forcing earlymaturing girl hide breasts dressing differently embarrassment developed body may also result refusal undress gym experiences lead lower selfesteem depression poorer body image earlymaturing girls
furthermore physical emotional differences set apart people age group earlymaturing girls develop relationships older people instance earlymaturing girls older boyfriends attracted girls womanly figure girlish innocence older boyfriends might improve popularity among peers also increases risk alcohol drug use increased sexual relations often unprotected eating disorders bullying
generally later onset puberty girls produces positive outcomes exhibit positive behaviors adolescence continue adulthood
boysedit
past early onset puberty boys associated positive outcomes leadership high school success adulthood however recent studies revealed risks problems early maturation males might outweigh benefits
earlymaturing boys develop aggressive lawbreaking alcohol abusing behaviors result anger towards parents trouble school police early puberty also correlates increased sexual activity higher instance teenage pregnancy lead depression psychosocial issues however early puberty might also result positive outcomes popularity among peers higher selfesteem confidence result physical developments taller height developed muscles better athletic ability
hand latematuring boys develop lower selfesteems confidence generally lower popularity among peers due lessdeveloped physiques also experience problems anxiety depression likely afraid sex boys

erections sleep waking medically known nocturnal penile tumescence colloquially referred morning wood penis regularly get erect sleep men boys often wakeup erection boy reaches teenage years erections occur much frequently due puberty erections occur spontaneously time day clothed may cause bulge hump disguised hidden wearing closefitting underwear long shirt baggier clothes erections common male children infants even occur birth spontaneous erections also known involuntary unwanted erections normal erections embarrassing happen public classroom living room
foreskin retractionedit
puberty tip opening boys foreskin becomes wider progressively allowing retraction shaft penis behind glans ultimately possible without pain difficulty membrane bonds inner surface foreskin glans disintegrates releases foreskin separate glans foreskin gradually becomes retractable
research ster found onset continuation puberty proportion boys able pull back foreskins increased ages ster found boys able retract foreskins increased ages also found unable fully retract experienced phimosis ages remainder partially able findings supported research kayaba et al sample boys ishikawa kawakita found age sample boys could retract foreskins beaug reports boys may assist development retractile foreskin manual stretching
boy able retract foreskin penile hygiene become important feature routine body care although american academy pediatrics states little evidence affirm association circumcision status optimal penile hygiene various studies suggest boys educated role hygiene including retracting foreskin urinating rinsing around glans bathing opportunity regular washing foreskin found krueger osborn reduce risk numerous penile disorders

end puberty adult men heavier bones nearly twice much skeletal muscle bone growth eg shoulder width jaw disproportionately greater resulting noticeably different male female skeletal shapes average adult male lean body mass average female body fat
muscle develops mainly later stages puberty muscle growth continue even boys biologically adult peak socalled strength spurt rate muscle growth attained one year male experiences peak growth rate
often fat pads male breast tissue male nipples develop puberty sometimes especially one breast becomes apparent termed gynecomastia usually permanent phenomenon
body odor acneedit
rising levels androgens change fatty acid composition perspiration resulting adult body odor girls another androgen effect increased secretion oil sebum skin resultant variable amounts acne acne prevented diminished easily typically fully diminishes end puberty however unusual fully grown adult suffer occasional bout acne though normally less severe adolescents may desire using prescription topical creams ointments keep acne getting worse even oral medication due fact acne emotionally difficult cause scarring

nutritional influenceedit
nutritional factors strongest obvious environmental factors affecting timing puberty girls especially sensitive nutritional regulation must contribute nutritional support growing fetus surplus calories beyond growth activity requirements reflected amount body fat signals brain availability resources initiation puberty fertility
much evidence suggests last centuries nutritional differences accounted majority variation pubertal timing different populations even among social classes population recent worldwide increased consumption animal protein changes nutrition increases childhood obesity resulted falling ages puberty mainly populations higher previous ages many populations amount variation attributable nutrition shrinking
although available dietary energy simple calories important dietary influence timing puberty quality diet plays role well lower protein intakes higher dietary fiber intakes occur typical vegetarian diets associated later onset slower progression female puberty
obesity influence exerciseedit
scientific researchers linked early obesity earlier onset puberty girls cited obesity cause breast development nine years menarche twelve years early puberty girls harbinger later health problems
