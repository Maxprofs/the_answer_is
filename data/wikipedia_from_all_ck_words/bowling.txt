== variations ==
there are two main things that a professional bowler looks at in order to determine the kind of ball or rotation that he or she will use
lane pattern- the lane pattern can be short medium long the lane is 60 feet (18 m) long from the foul line to the headpin but the pins take up 4 feet (1.2 m) more the approach (part of the lane that a bowler walks on) has no set limit (usually 15 feet (4.6 m)) short- a short pattern will be anywhere from 0 feet until about 15 feet (4.6 m) medium- a medium pattern will be from about 1540 feet (4.612.2 m) long- a long pattern is anything above the 40 feet (12 m) the length of the pattern affects the bowler because if there is less or more oil the ball will react differently to the lanes all together reacting in this sense is referring to the break point of the ball the break point is when the ball goes from rolling straight to hooking inward towards the pocket (which is the one and three pin) or a brooklyn pocket (which is one and two pin)
lane material- the lane can be either wood or synthetic the difference between the two is very similar to importance of lane pattern the different materials can cause more or less friction which would cause the ball to again hook earlier or later
synthetic- the synthetic lanes are generally softer than the wood surfaces the bowling ball being the weight that it is and the way that it is used is able to manipulate the lanes all together and without the strength of wood the lane would wear down much faster the ball hooks a lot later because it has so much more friction acting on it wood- the wood lanes are a lot harder and last much longer than the synthetic wood lanes have been used since the origination of bowling competition the ball does not have as much material around it so it does not have as much of a fight for the roll
