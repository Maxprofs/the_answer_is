before the 20th century the term matter included ordinary matter composed of atoms and excluded other energy phenomena such as light or sound this concept of matter may be generalized from atoms to include any objects having mass even when at rest but this is ill-defined because an object's mass can arise from its (possibly massless) constituents motion and interaction energies thus matter does not have a universal definition nor is it a fundamental concept in physics today matter is also used loosely as a general term for the substance that makes up all observable physical objects
all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into touch or squeeze are composed of atoms this atomic matter is in turn made up of interacting subatomic particlesusually a nucleus of protons and neutrons and a cloud of orbiting electrons typically science considers these composite particles matter because they have both rest mass and volume by contrast massless particles such as photons are not considered matter because they have neither rest mass nor volume however not all particles with rest mass have a classical volume since fundamental particles such as quarks and leptons (sometimes equated with matter) are considered point particles with no effective size or volume nevertheless quarks and leptons together make up ordinary matter and their interactions contribute to the effective volume of the composite particles that make up ordinary matter
matter commonly exists in four states (or phases) solid liquid and gas and plasma however advances in experimental techniques have revealed other previously theoretical phases such as boseeinstein condensates and fermionic condensates a focus on an elementary-particle view of matter also leads to new phases of matter such as the quarkgluon plasma for much of the history of the natural sciences people have contemplated the exact nature of matter the idea that matter was built of discrete building blocks the so-called particulate theory of matter was first put forward by the greek philosophers leucippus (~490 bc) and democritus (~470380 bc)
matter should not be confused with mass as the two are not quite the same in modern physics for example mass is a conserved quantity which means that its value is unchanging through time within closed systems however matter is not conserved in such systems although this is not obvious in ordinary conditions on earth where matter is approximately conserved still special relativity shows that matter may disappear by conversion into energy even inside closed systems and it can also be created from energy within such systems however because mass (like energy) can neither be created nor destroyed the quantity of mass and the quantity of energy remain the same during a transformation of matter (which represents a certain amount of energy) into non-material (i.e. non-matter) energy this is also true in the reverse transformation of energy into matter
different fields of science use the term matter in different and sometimes incompatible ways some of these ways are based on loose historical meanings from a time when there was no reason to distinguish mass and matter as such there is no single universally agreed scientific meaning of the word matter scientifically the term mass is well-defined but matter is not sometimes in the field of physics matter is simply equated with particles that exhibit rest mass (i.e. that cannot travel at the speed of light) such as quarks and leptons however in both physics and chemistry matter exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties the so-called waveparticle duality
== definitionedit ==
=== common definitionedit ===
the common definition of matter is anything that has mass and volume (occupies space) for example a car would be said to be made of matter as it occupies space and has mass
the observation that matter occupies space goes back to antiquity however an explanation for why matter occupies space is recent and is argued to be a result of the phenomenon described in the pauli exclusion principle two particular examples where the exclusion principle clearly relates matter to the occupation of space are white dwarf stars and neutron stars discussed further below
=== relativityedit ===
in the context of relativity mass is not an additive quantity in the sense that one can add the rest masses of particles in a system to get the total rest mass of the system thus in relativity usually a more general view is that it is not the sum of rest masses but the energymomentum tensor that quantifies the amount of matter this tensor gives the rest mass for the entire system matter therefore is sometimes considered as anything that contributes to the energymomentum of a system that is anything that is not purely gravity this view is commonly held in fields that deal with general relativity such as cosmology in this view light and other massless particles and fields are part of matter
the reason for this is that in this definition electromagnetic radiation (such as light) as well as the energy of electromagnetic fields contributes to the mass of systems and therefore appears to add matter to them for example light radiation (or thermal radiation) trapped inside a box would contribute to the mass of the box as would any kind of energy inside the box including the kinetic energy of particles held by the box nevertheless isolated individual particles of light (photons) and the isolated kinetic energy of massive particles are normally not considered to be matter
a difference between matter and mass therefore may seem to arise when single particles are examined in such cases the mass of single photons is zero for particles with rest mass such as leptons and quarks isolation of the particle in a frame where it is not moving removes its kinetic energy
a source of definition difficulty in relativity arises from two definitions of mass in common use one of which is formally equivalent to total energy (and is thus observer dependent) and the other of which is referred to as rest mass or invariant mass and is independent of the observer only rest mass is loosely equated with matter (since it can be weighed) invariant mass is usually applied in physics to unbound systems of particles however energies which contribute to the invariant mass may be weighed also in special circumstances such as when a system that has invariant mass is confined and has no net momentum (as in the box example above) thus a photon with no mass may (confusingly) still add mass to a system in which it is trapped the same is true of the kinetic energy of particles which by definition is not part of their rest mass but which does add rest mass to systems in which these particles reside (an example is the mass added by the motion of gas molecules of a bottle of gas or by the thermal energy of any hot object)
since such mass (kinetic energies of particles the energy of trapped electromagnetic radiation and stored potential energy of repulsive fields) is measured as part of the mass of ordinary matter in complex systems the matter status of massless particles and fields of force becomes unclear in such systems these problems contribute to the lack of a rigorous definition of matter in science although mass is easier to define as the total stressenergy above (this is also what is weighed on a scale and what is the source of gravity)
=== atoms definitionedit ===
a definition of matter based on its physical and chemical structure is matter is made up of atoms as an example deoxyribonucleic acid molecules (dna) are matter under this definition because they are made of atoms this definition can extend to include charged atoms and molecules so as to include plasmas (gases of ions) and electrolytes (ionic solutions) which are not obviously included in the atoms definition alternatively one can adopt the protons neutrons and electrons definition
=== protons neutrons and electrons definitionedit ===
a definition of matter more fine-scale than the atoms and molecules definition is matter is made up of what atoms and molecules are made of meaning anything made of positively charged protons neutral neutrons and negatively charged electrons this definition goes beyond atoms and molecules however to include substances made from these building blocks that are not simply atoms or molecules for example white dwarf mattertypically carbon and oxygen nuclei in a sea of degenerate electrons at a microscopic level the constituent particles of matter such as protons neutrons and electrons obey the laws of quantum mechanics and exhibit waveparticle duality at an even deeper level protons and neutrons are made up of quarks and the force fields (gluons) that bind them together (see quarks and leptons definition below)
=== quarks and leptons definitionedit ===
as seen in the above discussion many early definitions of what can be called ordinary matter were based upon its structure or building blocks on the scale of elementary particles a definition that follows this tradition can be stated as ordinary matter is everything that is composed of elementary fermions namely quarks and leptons the connection between these formulations follows
leptons (the most famous being the electron) and quarks (of which baryons such as protons and neutrons are made) combine to form atoms which in turn form molecules because atoms and molecules are said to be matter it is natural to phrase the definition as ordinary matter is anything that is made of the same things that atoms and molecules are made of (however notice that one also can make from these building blocks matter that is not atoms or molecules.) then because electrons are leptons and protons and neutrons are made of quarks this definition in turn leads to the definition of matter as being quarks and leptons which are the two types of elementary fermions carithers and grannis state ordinary matter is composed entirely of first-generation particles namely the [up] and [down] quarks plus the electron and its neutrino (higher generations particles quickly decay into first-generation particles and thus are not commonly encountered.)
this definition of ordinary matter is more subtle than it first appears all the particles that make up ordinary matter (leptons and quarks) are elementary fermions while all the force carriers are elementary bosons the w and z bosons that mediate the weak force are not made of quarks or leptons and so are not ordinary matter even if they have mass in other words mass is not something that is exclusive to ordinary matter
the quarklepton definition of ordinary matter however identifies not only the elementary building blocks of matter but also includes composites made from the constituents (atoms and molecules for example) such composites contain an interaction energy that holds the constituents together and may constitute the bulk of the mass of the composite as an example to a great extent the mass of an atom is simply the sum of the masses of its constituent protons neutrons and electrons however digging deeper the protons and neutrons are made up of quarks bound together by gluon fields (see dynamics of quantum chromodynamics) and these gluons fields contribute significantly to the mass of hadrons in other words most of what composes the mass of ordinary matter is due to the binding energy of quarks within protons and neutrons for example the sum of the mass of the three quarks in a nucleon is approximately 700112500000000000012.5 mev/c2 which is low compared to the mass of a nucleon (approximately 7002938000000000000938 mev/c2) the bottom line is that most of the mass of everyday objects comes from the interaction energy of its elementary components
=== smaller building blocks issueedit ===
the standard model groups matter particles into three generations where each generation consists of two quarks and two leptons the first generation is the up and down quarks the electron and the electron neutrino the second includes the charm and strange quarks the muon and the muon neutrino the third generation consists of the top and bottom quarks and the tau and tau neutrino the most natural explanation for this would be that quarks and leptons of higher generations are excited states of the first generations if this turns out to be the case it would imply that quarks and leptons are composite particles rather than elementary particles
== structureedit ==
in particle physics fermions are particles that obey fermidirac statistics fermions can be elementary like the electronor composite like the proton and neutron in the standard model there are two types of elementary fermions quarks and leptons which are discussed next
=== quarksedit ===
quarks are particles of spin-12 implying that they are fermions they carry an electric charge of 13 e (down-type quarks) or +23 e (up-type quarks) for comparison an electron has a charge of 1 e they also carry colour charge which is the equivalent of the electric charge for the strong interaction quarks also undergo radioactive decay meaning that they are subject to the weak interaction quarks are massive particles and therefore are also subject to gravity
==== baryonic matteredit ====
baryons are strongly interacting fermions and so are subject to fermidirac statistics amongst the baryons are the protons and neutrons which occur in atomic nuclei but many other unstable baryons exist as well the term baryon usually refers to triquarksparticles made of three quarks exotic baryons made of four quarks and one antiquark are known as the pentaquarks but their existence is not generally accepted
baryonic matter is the part of the universe that is made of baryons (including all atoms) this part of the universe does not include dark energy dark matter black holes or various forms of degenerate matter such as compose white dwarf stars and neutron stars microwave light seen by wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) suggests that only about 4.6% of that part of the universe within range of the best telescopes (that is matter that may be visible because light could reach us from it) is made of baryonic matter about 23% is dark matter and about 72% is dark energy
==== degenerate matteredit ====
in physics degenerate matter refers to the ground state of a gas of fermions at a temperature near absolute zero the pauli exclusion principle requires that only two fermions can occupy a quantum state one spin-up and the other spin-down hence at zero temperature the fermions fill up sufficient levels to accommodate all the available fermionsand in the case of many fermions the maximum kinetic energy (called the fermi energy) and the pressure of the gas becomes very large and depends on the number of fermions rather than the temperature unlike normal states of matter
degenerate matter is thought to occur during the evolution of heavy stars the demonstration by subrahmanyan chandrasekhar that white dwarf stars have a maximum allowed mass because of the exclusion principle caused a revolution in the theory of star evolution
degenerate matter includes the part of the universe that is made up of neutron stars and white dwarfs
==== strange matteredit ====
strange matter is a particular form of quark matter usually thought of as a liquid of up down and strange quarks it is contrasted with nuclear matter which is a liquid of neutrons and protons (which themselves are built out of up and down quarks) and with non-strange quark matter which is a quark liquid that contains only up and down quarks at high enough density strange matter is expected to be color superconducting strange matter is hypothesized to occur in the core of neutron stars or more speculatively as isolated droplets that may vary in size from femtometers (strangelets) to kilometers (quark stars)
===== two meanings of the term strange matter"edit =====
in particle physics and astrophysics the term is used in two ways one broader and the other more specific
the broader meaning is just quark matter that contains three flavors of quarks up down and strange in this definition there is a critical pressure and an associated critical density and when nuclear matter (made of protons and neutrons) is compressed beyond this density the protons and neutrons dissociate into quarks yielding quark matter (probably strange matter)
the narrower meaning is quark matter that is more stable than nuclear matter the idea that this could happen is the strange matter hypothesis of bodmer and witten in this definition the critical pressure is zero the true ground state of matter is always quark matter the nuclei that we see in the matter around us which are droplets of nuclear matter are actually metastable and given enough time (or the right external stimulus) would decay into droplets of strange matter i.e strangelets
=== leptonsedit ===
leptons are particles of spin-12 meaning that they are fermions they carry an electric charge of 1 e (charged leptons) or 0 e (neutrinos) unlike quarks leptons do not carry colour charge meaning that they do not experience the strong interaction leptons also undergo radioactive decay meaning that they are subject to the weak interaction leptons are massive particles therefore are subject to gravity
== phasesedit ==
in bulk matter can exist in several different forms or states of aggregation known as phases depending on ambient pressure temperature and volume a phase is a form of matter that has a relatively uniform chemical composition and physical properties (such as density specific heat refractive index and so forth) these phases include the three familiar ones (solids liquids and gases) as well as more exotic states of matter (such as plasmas superfluids supersolids boseeinstein condensates ) a fluid may be a liquid gas or plasma there are also paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of magnetic materials as conditions change matter may change from one phase into another these phenomena are called phase transitions and are studied in the field of thermodynamics in nanomaterials the vastly increased ratio of surface area to volume results in matter that can exhibit properties entirely different from those of bulk material and not well described by any bulk phase (see nanomaterials for more details)
phases are sometimes called states of matter but this term can lead to confusion with thermodynamic states for example two gases maintained at different pressures are in different thermodynamic states (different pressures) but in the same phase (both are gases)
== antimatteredit ==
in particle physics and quantum chemistry antimatter is matter that is composed of the antiparticles of those that constitute ordinary matter if a particle and its antiparticle come into contact with each other the two annihilate that is they may both be converted into other particles with equal energy in accordance with einstein's equation e = mc2 these new particles may be high-energy photons (gamma rays) or other particleantiparticle pairs the resulting particles are endowed with an amount of kinetic energy equal to the difference between the rest mass of the products of the annihilation and the rest mass of the original particleantiparticle pair which is often quite large
antimatter is not found naturally on earth except very briefly and in vanishingly small quantities (as the result of radioactive decay lightning or cosmic rays) this is because antimatter that came to exist on earth outside the confines of a suitable physics laboratory would almost instantly meet the ordinary matter that earth is made of and be annihilated antiparticles and some stable antimatter (such as antihydrogen) can be made in tiny amounts but not in enough quantity to do more than test a few of its theoretical properties
there is considerable speculation both in science and science fiction as to why the observable universe is apparently almost entirely matter and whether other places are almost entirely antimatter instead in the early universe it is thought that matter and antimatter were equally represented and the disappearance of antimatter requires an asymmetry in physical laws called the charge parity (or cp symmetry) violation cp symmetry violation can be obtained from the standard model but at this time the apparent asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe is one of the great unsolved problems in physics possible processes by which it came about are explored in more detail under baryogenesis
== other typesedit ==
ordinary matter in the quarks and leptons definition constitutes about 4% of the energy of the observable universe the remaining energy is theorized to be due to exotic forms of which 23% is dark matter and 73% is dark energy
=== dark matteredit ===
in astrophysics and cosmology dark matter is matter of unknown composition that does not emit or reflect enough electromagnetic radiation to be observed directly but whose presence can be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter observational evidence of the early universe and the big bang theory require that this matter have energy and mass but is not composed of either elementary fermions (as above) or gauge bosons the commonly accepted view is that most of the dark matter is non-baryonic in nature as such it is composed of particles as yet unobserved in the laboratory perhaps they are supersymmetric particles which are not standard model particles but relics formed at very high energies in the early phase of the universe and still floating about
=== dark energyedit ===
in cosmology dark energy is the name given to the antigravitating influence that is accelerating the rate of expansion of the universe it is known not to be composed of known particles like protons neutrons or electrons nor of the particles of dark matter because these all gravitate
=== exotic matteredit ===
exotic matter is a hypothetical concept of particle physics it covers any material that violates one or more classical conditions or is not made of known baryonic particles such materials would possess qualities like negative mass or being repelled rather than attracted by gravity
== historical developmentedit ==
=== originsedit ===
the pre-socratics were among the first recorded speculators about the underlying nature of the visible world thales (c 624 bcc 546 bc) regarded water as the fundamental material of the world anaximander (c 610 bcc 546 bc) posited that the basic material was wholly characterless or limitless the infinite (apeiron) anaximenes (flourished 585 bc d 528 bc) posited that the basic stuff was pneuma or air heraclitus (c 535c 475 bc) seems to say the basic element is fire though perhaps he means that all is change empedocles (c 490430 bc) spoke of four elements of which everything was made earth water air and fire meanwhile parmenides argued that change does not exist and democritus argued that everything is composed of minuscule inert bodies of all shapes called atoms a philosophy called atomism all of these notions had deep philosophical problems
aristotle (384 bc 322 bc) was the first to put the conception on a sound philosophical basis which he did in his natural philosophy especially in physics book i he adopted as reasonable suppositions the four empedoclean elements but added a fifth aether nevertheless these elements are not basic in aristotle's mind rather they like everything else in the visible world are composed of the basic principles matter and form
the word aristotle uses for matter (hyle or hule) can be literally translated as wood or timber that is raw material for building indeed aristotle's conception of matter is intrinsically linked to something being made or composed in other words in contrast to the early modern conception of matter as simply occupying space matter for aristotle is definitionally linked to process or change matter is what underlies a change of substance
for example a horse eats grass the horse changes the grass into itself the grass as such does not persist in the horse but some aspect of itits matterdoes the matter is not specifically described (e.g. as atoms) but consists of whatever persists in the change of substance from grass to horse matter in this understanding does not exist independently (i.e. as a substance) but exists interdependently (i.e. as a principle") with form and only insofar as it underlies change it can be helpful to conceive of the relationship of matter and form as very similar to that between parts and whole for aristotle matter as such can only receive actuality from form it has no activity or actuality in itself similar to the way that parts as such only have their existence in a whole (otherwise they would be independent wholes)
=== early modernityedit ===
ren descartes (15961650) originated the modern conception of matter he was primarily a geometer instead of like aristotle deducing the existence of matter from the physical reality of change descartes arbitrarily postulated matter to be an abstract mathematical substance that occupies space
for descartes matter has only the property of extension so its only activity aside from locomotion is to exclude other bodies this is the mechanical philosophy descartes makes an absolute distinction between mind which he defines as unextended thinking substance and matter which he defines as unthinking extended substance they are independent things in contrast aristotle defines matter and the formal/forming principle as complementary principles that together compose one independent thing (substance) in short aristotle defines matter (roughly speaking) as what things are actually made of (with a potential independent existence) but descartes elevates matter to an actual independent thing in itself
the continuity and difference between descartes and aristotle's conceptions is noteworthy in both conceptions matter is passive or inert in the respective conceptions matter has different relationships to intelligence for aristotle matter and intelligence (form) exist together in an interdependent relationship whereas for descartes matter and intelligence (mind) are definitionally opposed independent substances
descartes justification for restricting the inherent qualities of matter to extension is its permanence but his real criterion is not permanence (which equally applied to color and resistance) but his desire to use geometry to explain all material properties like descartes hobbes boyle and locke argued that the inherent properties of bodies were limited to extension and that so-called secondary qualities like color were only products of human perception
isaac newton (16431727) inherited descartes mechanical conception of matter in the third of his rules of reasoning in philosophy newton lists the universal qualities of matter as extension hardness impenetrability mobility and inertia similarly in optics he conjectures that god created matter as solid massy hard impenetrable movable particles which were ...even so very hard as never to wear or break in pieces the primary properties of matter were amenable to mathematical description unlike secondary qualities such as color or taste like descartes newton rejected the essential nature of secondary qualities
newton developed descartes notion of matter by restoring to matter intrinsic properties in addition to extension (at least on a limited basis) such as mass newton's use of gravitational force which worked at a distance effectively repudiated descartes mechanics in which interactions happened exclusively by contact
though newton's gravity would seem to be a power of bodies newton himself did not admit it to be an essential property of matter carrying the logic forward more consistently joseph priestley argued that corporeal properties transcend contact mechanics chemical properties require the capacity for attraction he argued matter has other inherent powers besides the so-called primary qualities of descartes et al
since priestley's time there has been a massive expansion in knowledge of the constituents of the material world (viz. molecules atoms subatomic particles) but there has been no further development in the definition of matter rather the question has been set aside noam chomsky summarizes the situation that has prevailed since that time
so matter is whatever physics studies and the object of study of physics is matter there is no independent general definition of matter apart from its fitting into the methodology of measurement and controlled experimentation in sum the boundaries between what constitutes matter and everything else remains as vague as the demarcation problem of delimiting science from everything else
=== late nineteenth and early twentieth centuriesedit ===
in the 19th century following the development of the periodic table and of atomic theory atoms were seen as being the fundamental constituents of matter atoms formed molecules and compounds
the common definition in terms of occupying space and having mass is in contrast with most physical and chemical definitions of matter which rely instead upon its structure and upon attributes not necessarily related to volume and mass at the turn of the nineteenth century the knowledge of matter began a rapid evolution
aspects of the newtonian view still held sway james clerk maxwell discussed matter in his work matter and motion he carefully separates matter from space and time and defines it in terms of the object referred to in newton's first law of motion
however the newtonian picture was not the whole story in the 19th century the term matter was actively discussed by a host of scientists and philosophers and a brief outline can be found in levere a textbook discussion from 1870 suggests matter is what is made up of atoms
three divisions of matter are recognized in science masses molecules and atoms
a mass of matter is any portion of matter appreciable by the senses
a molecule is the smallest particle of matter into which a body can be divided without losing its identity
an atom is a still smaller particle produced by division of a molecule
rather than simply having the attributes of mass and occupying space matter was held to have chemical and electrical properties the famous physicist j j thomson wrote about the constitution of matter and was concerned with the possible connection between matter and electrical charge
=== later developmentsedit ===
there is an entire literature concerning the structure of matter ranging from the electrical structure in the early 20th century to the more recent quark structure of matter introduced today with the remark understanding the quark structure of matter has been one of the most important advances in contemporary physics in this connection physicists speak of matter fields and speak of particles as quantum excitations of a mode of the matter field and here is a quote from de sabbata and gasperini with the word matter we denote in this context the sources of the interactions that is spinor fields (like quarks and leptons) which are believed to be the fundamental components of matter or scalar fields like the higgs particles which are used to introduced mass in a gauge theory (and that however could be composed of more fundamental fermion fields).
the modern conception of matter has been refined many times in history in light of the improvement in knowledge of just what the basic building blocks are and in how they interact
in the late 19th century with the discovery of the electron and in the early 20th century with the discovery of the atomic nucleus and the birth of particle physics matter was seen as made up of electrons protons and neutrons interacting to form atoms today we know that even protons and neutrons are not indivisible they can be divided into quarks while electrons are part of a particle family called leptons both quarks and leptons are elementary particles and are currently seen as being the fundamental constituents of matter
these quarks and leptons interact through four fundamental forces gravity electromagnetism weak interactions and strong interactions the standard model of particle physics is currently the best explanation for all of physics but despite decades of efforts gravity cannot yet be accounted for at the quantum level it is only described by classical physics (see quantum gravity and graviton) interactions between quarks and leptons are the result of an exchange of force-carrying particles (such as photons) between quarks and leptons the force-carrying particles are not themselves building blocks as one consequence mass and energy (which cannot be created or destroyed) cannot always be related to matter (which can be created out of non-matter particles such as photons or even out of pure energy such as kinetic energy) force carriers are usually not considered matter the carriers of the electric force (photons) possess energy (see planck relation) and the carriers of the weak force (w and z bosons) are massive but neither are considered matter either however while these particles are not considered matter they do contribute to the total mass of atoms subatomic particles and all systems that contain them
=== summaryedit ===
the term matter is used throughout physics in a bewildering variety of contexts for example one refers to condensed matter physics elementary matter partonic matter dark matter anti"-matter strange matter and nuclear matter in discussions of matter and antimatter normal matter has been referred to by alfvn as koinomatter (gk common matter) it is fair to say that in physics there is no broad consensus as to a general definition of matter and the term matter usually is used in conjunction with a specifying modifier
