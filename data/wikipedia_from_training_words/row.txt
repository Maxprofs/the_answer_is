milk is a pale liquid produced from the mammary glands of mammals it is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals before they are able to digest other types of food early-lactation milk contains colostrum which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases it contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose
as an agricultural product milk is extracted from mammals during or soon after pregnancy dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011 from 260 million dairy cows india is the world's largest producer of milk and is the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder yet has little to no other milk product exports the ever increasing rise in domestic demand for dairy products and a large demand-supply gap could lead to india being a net importer of dairy products in the future new zealand the european union's 28 member states australia and the united states are the world's largest exporters of milk and milk products china and russia are the world's largest importers of milk and milk products
over 750 million people live within dairy farming households
== types of consumption ==
there are two distinct types of milk consumption a natural source of nutrition for all infant mammals and a food product for humans of all ages that is derived from other animals
=== nutrition for infant mammals ===
in almost all mammals milk is fed to infants through breastfeeding either directly or by expressing the milk to be stored and consumed later the early milk from mammals is called colostrum colostrum contains antibodies that provide protection to the newborn baby as well as nutrients and growth factors the makeup of the colostrum and the period of secretion varies from species to species
for humans the world health organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months and breastfeeding in addition to other food for at least two years in some cultures it is common to breastfeed children for three to five years and the period may be longer
fresh goats milk is sometimes substituted for breast milk this introduces the risk of the child developing electrolyte imbalances metabolic acidosis megaloblastic anemia and a host of allergic reactions
=== food product for humans ===
in many cultures of the world especially the west humans continue to consume milk beyond infancy using the milk of other animals (especially cattle goats and sheep) as a food product initially the ability to digest milk was limited to children as adults did not produce lactase an enzyme necessary for digesting the lactose in milk milk was therefore converted to curd cheese and other products to reduce the levels of lactose thousands of years ago a chance mutation spread in human populations in europe that enabled the production of lactase in adulthood this allowed milk to be used as a new source of nutrition which could sustain populations when other food sources failed milk is processed into a variety of dairy products such as cream butter yogurt kefir ice cream and cheese modern industrial processes use milk to produce casein whey protein lactose condensed milk powdered milk and many other food-additives and industrial products
whole milk butter and cream have high levels of saturated fat the sugar lactose is found only in milk forsythia flowers and a few tropical shrubs the enzyme needed to digest lactose lactase reaches its highest levels in the small intestine after birth and then begins a slow decline unless milk is consumed regularly those groups who do continue to tolerate milk however often have exercised great creativity in using the milk of domesticated ungulates not only of cattle but also sheep goats yaks water buffalo horses reindeer and camels the largest producer and consumer of cattle and buffalo milk in the world is india
== terminology ==
the term milk is also used for white colored non-animal beverages resembling milk in color and texture (milk substitutes) such as soy milk rice milk almond milk and coconut milk in addition a substance secreted by pigeons to feed their young is called crop milk and bears some resemblance to mammalian milk although it is not consumed as a milk substitute dairy relates to milk and milk production e.g dairy products milk can be synthesized in a laboratory from water fatty acids and proteins
== evolution of lactation ==
the mammary gland is thought to have derived from apocrine skin glands it has been suggested that the original function of lactation (milk production) was keeping eggs moist much of the argument is based on monotremes (egg-laying mammals) the original adaptive significance of milk secretions may have been nutrition or immunological protection this secretion gradually became more copious and accrued nutritional complexity over evolutionary time
== history ==
humans first learned to regularly consume the milk of other mammals following the domestication of animals during the neolithic revolution or the development of agriculture this development occurred independently in several places around the world from as early as 90007000 bc in southwest asia to 35003000 bc in the americas the most important dairy animalscattle sheep and goatswere first domesticated in southwest asia although domestic cattle had been independently derived from wild aurochs populations several times since initially animals were kept for meat and archaeologist andrew sherratt has suggested that dairying along with the exploitation of domestic animals for hair and labor began much later in a separate secondary products revolution in the fourth millennium bc sherratt's model is not supported by recent findings based on the analysis of lipid residue in prehistoric pottery that shows that dairying was practiced in the early phases of agriculture in southwest asia by at least the seventh millennium bc
from southwest asia domestic dairy animals spread to europe (beginning around 7000 bc but not reaching britain and scandinavia until after 4000 bc) and south asia (70005500 bc) the first farmers in central europe and britain milked their animals pastoral and pastoral nomadic economies which rely predominantly or exclusively on domestic animals and their products rather than crop farming were developed as european farmers moved into the pontic-caspian steppe in the fourth millennium bc and subsequently spread across much of the eurasian steppe sheep and goats were introduced to africa from southwest asia but african cattle may have been independently domesticated around 70006000 bc camels domesticated in central arabia in the fourth millennium bc have also been used as dairy animals in north africa and the arabian peninsula the earliest egyptian records of burn treatments describe burn dressings using milk from mothers of male babies in the rest of the world (i.e. east and southeast asia the americas and australia) milk and dairy products were historically not a large part of the diet either because they remained populated by hunter-gatherers who did not keep animals or the local agricultural economies did not include domesticated dairy species milk consumption became common in these regions comparatively recently as a consequence of european colonialism and political domination over much of the world in the last 500 years
in the middle ages milk was called the virtuous white liquor because alcoholic beverages were more safe to consume than water
=== industrialization ===
the growth in urban population coupled with the expansion of the railway network in the mid-19th century brought about a revolution in milk production and supply individual railway firms began transporting milk from rural areas to london from the 1840s and 1850s possibly the first such instance was in 1846 when st thomas's hospital in southwark contracted with milk suppliers outside london to provide milk by rail the great western railway was an early and enthusiastic adopter and began to transport milk into london from maidenhead in 1860 despite much criticism by 1900 the company was transporting over 25 million gallons annually the milk trade grew slowly through the 1860s but went through a period of extensive structural change in the 1870s and 1880s
urban demand began to grow as consumer purchasing power increased and milk became regarded as a required daily commodity over the last three decades of the 19th century demand for milk in most parts of the country doubled or in some cases tripled legislation in 1875 made the adulteration of milk illegal - this combined with a marketing campaign to change the image of milk the proportion of rural imports by rail as a percentage of total milk consumption in london grew from under 5% in the 1860s to over 96% by the early 20th century by that point the supply system for milk was the most highly organized and integrated of any food product
the first glass bottle packaging for milk was used in the 1870s the first company to do so may have been the new york dairy company in 1877 the express dairy company in england began glass bottle production in 1880 in 1884 hervey thatcher an american inventor from new york invented a glass milk bottle called thatcher's common sense milk jar which was sealed with a waxed paper disk later in 1932 plastic-coated paper milk cartons were introduced commercially
in 1863 french chemist and biologist louis pasteur invented pasteurization a method of killing harmful bacteria in beverages and food products he developed this method while on summer vacation in arbois to remedy the frequent acidity of the local wines he found out experimentally that it is sufficient to heat a young wine to only about 5060 c (122140 f) for a brief time to kill the microbes and that the wine could be nevertheless properly aged without sacrificing the final quality in honor of pasteur the process became known as pasteurization pasteurization was originally used as a way of preventing wine and beer from souring commercial pasteurizing equipment was produced in germany in the 1880s and the process had been adopted in copenhagen and stockholm by 1885
== sources of milk ==
the females of all mammal species can by definition produce milk but cow's milk dominates commercial production in 2011 fao estimates 85% of all milk worldwide was produced from cows
human milk is not produced or distributed industrially or commercially however human milk banks collect donated human breastmilk and redistribute it to infants who may benefit from human milk for various reasons (premature neonates babies with allergies metabolic diseases etc.) but who cannot breastfeed
in the western world cow's milk is produced on an industrial scale and is by far the most commonly consumed form of milk commercial dairy farming using automated milking equipment produces the vast majority of milk in developed countries dairy cattle such as the holstein have been bred selectively for increased milk production about 90% of the dairy cows in the united states and 85% in great britain are holsteins other dairy cows in the united states include ayrshire brown swiss guernsey jersey and milking shorthorn (dairy shorthorn)
=== sources aside from cows ===
aside from cattle many kinds of livestock provide milk used by humans for dairy products these animals include buffalo goat sheep camel donkey horse reindeer and yak the first four respectively produced about 11% 2% 1.4% and 0.2% of all milk worldwide in 2011
in russia and sweden small moose dairies also exist
according to the us national bison association american bison (also called american buffalo) are not milked commercially however various sources report cows resulting from cross-breeding bison and domestic cattle are good milk producers and have been used both during the european settlement of north america and during the development of commercial beefalo in the 1970s and 1980s
== production worldwide ==
in 2012 the largest producer of milk and milk products was india followed by the united states of america china pakistan and brazil all 28 european union members together produced 153.8 million tonnes of milk in 2013 the largest by any politico-economic union
increasing affluence in developing countries as well as increased promotion of milk and milk products has led to a rise in milk consumption in developing countries in recent years in turn the opportunities presented by these growing markets have attracted investments by multinational dairy firms nevertheless in many countries production remains on a small scale and presents significant opportunities for diversification of income sources by small farms local milk collection centers where milk is collected and chilled prior to being transferred to urban dairies are a good example of where farmers have been able to work on a cooperative basis particularly in countries such as india
=== production yields ===
fao reports israel dairy farms are the most productive in the world with a yield of 12,546 kilograms (27,659 lb) milk per cow per year this survey over 2001 and 2007 was conducted by icar (international committee for animal recording) across 17 developed countries the survey found that the average herd size in these developed countries increased from 74 to 99 cows per herd between 2001 to 2007 a dairy farm had an average of 19 cows per herd in norway and 337 in new zealand annual milk production in the same period increased from 7,726 to 8,550 kg (17,033 to 18,850 lb) per cow in these developed countries the lowest average production was in new zealand at 3,974 kg (8,761 lb) per cow the milk yield per cow depended on production systems nutrition of the cows and only to a minor extent different genetic potential of the animals what the cow ate made the most impact on the production obtained new zealand cows with the lowest yield per year grazed all year in contrast to israel with the highest yield where the cows ate in barns with an energy-rich mixed diet
the milk yield per cow in the united states the world's largest cow milk producer was 9,954 kg (21,945 lb) per year in 2010 in contrast the milk yields per cow in india and china the second and third largest producers were respectively 1,154 kg (2,544 lb) and 2,282 kg (5,031 lb) per year
=== price ===
it was reported in 2007 that with increased worldwide prosperity and the competition of bio-fuel production for feed stocks both the demand for and the price of milk had substantially increased worldwide particularly notable was the rapid increase of consumption of milk in china and the rise of the price of milk in the united states above the government subsidized price in 2010 the department of agriculture predicted farmers would receive an average of $1.35 per us gallon of cow's milk (35 cents per liter) which is down 30 cents per gallon from 2007 and below the break-even point for many cattle farmers
== grading ==
in the united states there are two grades of milk with grade a primarily used for direct sales and consumption in stores and grade b used for indirect consumption such as in cheese making or other processing
the differences between the two grades are defined in the wisconsin administrative code for agriculture trade and consumer protection chapter 60 grade b generally refers to milk that is cooled in milk cans which are immersed in a bath of cold flowing water that typically is drawn up from an underground water well rather than using mechanical refrigeration
== physical and chemical properties of milk ==
milk is an emulsion or colloid of butterfat globules within a water-based fluid that contains dissolved carbohydrates and protein aggregates with minerals because it is produced as a food source for the young all of its contents provide benefits for growth the principal requirements are energy (lipids lactose and protein) biosynthesis of non-essential amino acids supplied by proteins (essential amino acids and amino groups) essential fatty acids vitamins and inorganic elements and water
=== lipids ===
initially milk fat is secreted in the form of a fat globule surrounded by a membrane each fat globule is composed almost entirely of triacylglycerols and is surrounded by a membrane consisting of complex lipids such as phospholipids along with proteins these act as emulsifiers which keep the individual globules from coalescing and protect the contents of these globules from various enzymes in the fluid portion of the milk although 9798% of lipids are triacylglycrols small amounts of di- and monoacylglycerols free cholesterol and cholesterol esters free fatty acids and phospholipids are also present unlike protein and carbohydrates fat composition in milk varies widely in the composition due to genetic lactational and nutritional factor difference between different species
like composition fat globules vary in size from less than 0.2 to about 15 micrometers in diameter between different species diameter may also vary between animals within a species and at different times within a milking of a single animal in unhomogenized cow's milk the fat globules have an average diameter of two to four micrometers and with homogenization average around 0.4 micrometers the fat-soluble vitamins a d e and k along with essential fatty acids such as linoleic and linolenic acid are found within the milk fat portion of the milk
=== proteins ===
normal bovine milk contains 3035 grams of protein per liter of which about 80% is arranged in casein micelles
==== caseins ====
the largest structures in the fluid portion of the milk are casein micelles aggregates of several thousand protein molecules with superficial resemblance to a surfactant micelle bonded with the help of nanometer-scale particles of calcium phosphate each casein micelle is roughly spherical and about a tenth of a micrometer across there are four different types of casein proteins s1- s2- - and -caseins collectively they make up around 7686% of the protein in milk by weight most of the casein proteins are bound into the micelles there are several competing theories regarding the precise structure of the micelles but they share one important feature the outermost layer consists of strands of one type of protein k-casein reaching out from the body of the micelle into the surrounding fluid these kappa-casein molecules all have a negative electrical charge and therefore repel each other keeping the micelles separated under normal conditions and in a stable colloidal suspension in the water-based surrounding fluid
milk contains dozens of other types of proteins beside the caseins including enzymes these other proteins are more water-soluble than the caseins and do not form larger structures because the proteins remain suspended in the whey left behind when the caseins coagulate into curds they are collectively known as whey proteins whey proteins make up approximately 20% of the protein in milk by weight lactoglobulin is the most common whey protein by a large margin
=== salts minerals and vitamins ===
minerals or milk salts are traditional names for a variety of cations and anions within bovine milk calcium phosphate magnesium sodium potassium citrate and chlorine are all included as minerals and they typically occur at concentration of 540 mm the milk salts strongly interact with casein most notably calcium phosphate it is present in excess and often much greater excess of solubility of solid calcium phosphate in addition to calcium milk is a good source of many other vitamins vitamins a b6 b12 c d k e thiamine niacin biotin riboflavin folates and pantothenic acid are all present in milk
==== calcium phosphate structure ====
for many years the most accepted theory of the structure of a micelle was that it was composed of spherical casein aggregates called submicelles that were held together by calcium phosphate linkages however there are two recent models of the casein micelle that refute the distinct micellular structures within the micelle
the first theory attributed to de kruif and holt proposes that nanoclusters of calcium phosphate and the phosphopeptide fraction of beta-casein are the centerpiece to micellular structure specifically in this view unstructured proteins organize around the calcium phosphate giving rise to their structure and thus no specific structure is formed
the second theory proposed by horne the growth of calcium phosphate nanoclusters begins the process of micelle formation but is limited by binding phosphopeptide loop regions of the caseins once bound protein-protein interactions are formed and polymerization occurs in which k-casein is used as an end cap to form micelles with trapped calcium phosphate nanoclusters
some sources indicate that the trapped calcium phosphate is in the form of ca9(po4)6 whereas others say it is similar to the structure of the mineral brushite cahpo4 -2h2o
=== carbohydrates and miscellaneous contents ===
milk contains several different carbohydrate including lactose glucose galactose and other oligosaccharides the lactose gives milk its sweet taste and contributes approximately 40% of whole cow's milk's calories lactose is a disaccharide composite of two simple sugars glucose and galactose bovine milk averages 4.8% anhydrous lactose which amounts to about 50% of the total solids of skimmed milk levels of lactose are dependent upon the type of milk as other carbohydrates can be present at higher concentrations that lactose in milks
other components found in raw cow's milk are living white blood cells mammary gland cells various bacteria and a large number of active enzymes
=== appearance ===
both the fat globules and the smaller casein micelles which are just large enough to deflect light contribute to the opaque white color of milk the fat globules contain some yellow-orange carotene enough in some breeds (such as guernsey and jersey cattle) to impart a golden or creamy hue to a glass of milk the riboflavin in the whey portion of milk has a greenish color which sometimes can be discerned in skimmed milk or whey products fat-free skimmed milk has only the casein micelles to scatter light and they tend to scatter shorter-wavelength blue light more than they do red giving skimmed milk a bluish tint
== processing ==
in most western countries centralized dairy facilities process milk and products obtained from milk such as cream butter and cheese in the us these dairies usually are local companies while in the southern hemisphere facilities may be run by very large nationwide or trans-national corporations such as fonterra
=== pasteurization ===
pasteurization is used to kill harmful microorganisms by heating the milk for a short time and then immediately cooling it the standard high temperature short time (htst) process produces a 99.999% reduction in the number of bacteria in milk rendering it safe to drink for up to three weeks if continually refrigerated dairies print expiration dates on each container after which stores remove any unsold milk from their shelves
a side effect of the heating of pasteurization is that some vitamin and mineral content is lost soluble calcium and phosphorus decrease by 5% thiamin and vitamin b12 by 10% and vitamin c by 20% because losses are small in comparison to the large amount of the two b-vitamins present milk continues to provide significant amounts of thiamin and vitamin b12 the loss of vitamin c is not nutritionally significant as milk is not an important dietary source of vitamin c
a newer process ultrapasteurization or ultra-high temperature treatment (uht) heats the milk to a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time this extends its shelf life and allows the milk to be stored unrefrigerated because of the longer lasting sterilization effect
=== microfiltration ===
microfiltration is a process that partially replaces pasteurization and produces milk with fewer microorganisms and longer shelf life without a change in the taste of the milk in this process cream is separated from the whey and is pasteurized in the usual way but the whey is forced through ceramic microfilters that trap 99.9% of microorganisms in the milk (as compared to 99.999% killing of microorganisms in standard htst pasteurization) the whey then is recombined with the pasteurized cream to reconstitute the original milk composition
=== creaming and homogenization ===
upon standing for 12 to 24 hours fresh milk has a tendency to separate into a high-fat cream layer on top of a larger low-fat milk layer the cream often is sold as a separate product with its own uses today the separation of the cream from the milk usually is accomplished rapidly in centrifugal cream separators the fat globules rise to the top of a container of milk because fat is less dense than water the smaller the globules the more other molecular-level forces prevent this from happening in fact the cream rises in cow's milk much more quickly than a simple model would predict rather than isolated globules the fat in the milk tends to form into clusters containing about a million globules held together by a number of minor whey proteins these clusters rise faster than individual globules can the fat globules in milk from goats sheep and water buffalo do not form clusters as readily and are smaller to begin with resulting in a slower separation of cream from these milks
milk often is homogenized a treatment that prevents a cream layer from separating out of the milk the milk is pumped at high pressures through very narrow tubes breaking up the fat globules through turbulence and cavitation a greater number of smaller particles possess more total surface area than a smaller number of larger ones and the original fat globule membranes cannot completely cover them casein micelles are attracted to the newly exposed fat surfaces nearly one-third of the micelles in the milk end up participating in this new membrane structure the casein weighs down the globules and interferes with the clustering that accelerated separation the exposed fat globules are vulnerable to certain enzymes present in milk which could break down the fats and produce rancid flavors to prevent this the enzymes are inactivated by pasteurizing the milk immediately before or during homogenization
homogenized milk tastes blander but feels creamier in the mouth than unhomogenized it is whiter and more resistant to developing off flavors creamline (or cream-top) milk is unhomogenized it may or may not have been pasteurized milk that has undergone high-pressure homogenization sometimes labeled as ultra-homogenized, has a longer shelf life than milk that has undergone ordinary homogenization at lower pressures
== nutrition and health ==
the composition of milk differs widely among species factors such as the type of protein the proportion of protein fat and sugar the levels of various vitamins and minerals and the size of the butterfat globules and the strength of the curd are among those that may vary for example
human milk contains on average 1.1% protein 4.2% fat 7.0% lactose (a sugar) and supplies 72 kcal of energy per 100 grams
cow's milk contains on average 3.4% protein 3.6% fat and 4.6% lactose 0.7% minerals and supplies 66 kcal of energy per 100 grams see also nutritional value further on
donkey and horse milk have the lowest fat content while the milk of seals and whales may contain more than 50% fat
=== cow's milk ===
these compositions vary by breed animal and point in the lactation period
the protein range for these four breeds is 3.3% to 3.9% while the lactose range is 4.7% to 4.9%
milk fat percentages may be manipulated by dairy farmers stock diet formulation strategies mastitis infection can cause fat levels to decline
=== nutritional value ===
ch = choline ca = calcium fe = iron mg = magnesium p = phosphorus k = potassium na = sodium zn = zinc cu = copper mn = manganese se = selenium %dv = % daily value i.e % of dri (dietary reference intake) note all nutrient values including protein are in %dv per 100 grams of the food item significant values are highlighted in light gray color and bold letters cooking reduction = % maximum typical reduction in nutrients due to boiling without draining for ovo-lacto-vegetables group
processed cow's milk was formulated to contain differing amounts of fat during the 1950s one cup (250 ml) of 2%-fat cow's milk contains 285 mg of calcium which represents 22% to 29% of the daily recommended intake (dri) of calcium for an adult depending on its age milk contains 8 grams of protein and a number of other nutrients (either naturally or through fortification) including
biotin
iodine
magnesium
pantothenic acid
potassium
riboflavin
selenium
thiamine
vitamin a
vitamin b12
vitamins d
vitamin k
the amount of calcium from milk that is absorbed by the human body is disputed calcium from dairy products has a greater bioavailability than calcium from certain vegetables such as spinach that contain high levels of calcium-chelating agents but a similar or lesser bioavailability than calcium from low-oxalate vegetables such as kale broccoli or other vegetables in the brassica genus
milk as a calcium source has been questioned in media but scientific research is lacking to support the hypothesis of acidosis induced by milk the hypothesis in question being that acidosis would lead to leeching of calcium storages in bones to neutralize ph levels (also known as acid-ash hypothesis) research has found no link between metabolic acidosis and consumption of milk
=== recommended consumption ===
the u.s federal government document dietary guidelines for americans 2010 recommends consumption of three glasses of fat-free or low-fat milk for adults and children 9 and older (less for younger children) per day this recommendation is disputed by some health researchers who call for more study of the issue given that there are other sources for calcium and vitamin d the researchers also claim that the recommendations have been unduly influenced by the american dairy industry and that whole milk may be better for health due to its increased ability to satiate hunger
=== medical research ===
there is recent evidence suggesting consumption of milk is effective at promoting muscle growth some studies have suggested that conjugated linoleic acid which can be found in dairy products is an effective supplement for reducing body fat
with regards to the claim of milk promoting stronger bones there has been no association between milk consumption and risk of hip fractures in women
=== lactose intolerance ===
lactose the disaccharide sugar component of all milk must be cleaved in the small intestine by the enzyme lactase in order for its constituents galactose and glucose to be absorbed the production of the enzyme lactase declines significantly after weaning in all mammals consequently many humans become unable to digest lactose properly as they mature there is a great deal of variance with some individuals reacting badly to even small amounts of lactose some able to consume moderate quantities and some able to consume large quantities of milk and other dairy products without problems the gene in humans that controls lactase production and hence lactose tolerance and intolerance is labeled c/t-13910 an individual who consumes milk without producing sufficient lactase may suffer diarrhea intestinal gas cramps and bloating as the undigested lactose travels through the gastrointestinal tract and serves as nourishment for intestinal microflora that excrete gas in processes known as fermentation and anaerobic respiration
it is estimated that 30 to 50 million americans are lactose intolerant including 75% of native americans and african americans and 90% of asian americans lactose intolerance is less common among those descended from northern europeans other genetic groups that have a lower prevalence of lactose intolerance are the tuareg of the sahara the fulani of the west african sahel and the beja and kabbabish of sudan as well as possibly the tutsi population of the ugandarwanda area another locus of lactose tolerance is in northern india
lactose intolerance is a natural process and there is no reliable way to prevent or reverse it
having lactose intolerance doesn't mean saying goodbye to dairy forever some dairy foods are easier to digest than others including yogurt and aged cheese lactose-intolerant people vary in how much lactose they can tolerate but dairy and aged cheese are easier to digest because processing has already broken down some of the lactose if you take supplemental lactase which is an enzyme that breaks down lactose you can generally enjoy these foods and other dairy products without experiencing the unpleasant side effects
=== possible harms ===
some studies suggest that milk consumption may increase the risk of suffering from certain health problems cow's milk allergy (cma) is an immunologically mediated adverse reaction rarely fatal to one or more cow's milk proteins milk from any mammal contains amino acids and microrna which influence the drinker's metabolism and growth this programming is beneficial for milk's natural consumers namely infants of the same species as the milk producer but post-infancy and trans-species milk consumption affects the mtorc1 metabolic pathway and may promote diseases of civilization such as obesity and diabetes
milk contains casein a substance that breaks down in the human stomach to produce casomorphin an opioid peptide in the early 1990s it was hypothesized that casomorphin can cause or aggravate autism spectrum disorders and casein-free diets are widely promoted studies supporting these claims have had significant flaws and the data are inadequate to guide autism treatment recommendations
a study demonstrated that men who drink a large amount of milk and consume dairy products were at a slightly increased risk of developing parkinson's disease the effect for women was smaller the reason behind this is not fully understood and it also remains unclear why there is less of a risk for women
the most recent assessment by the world cancer research fund and the american institute for cancer research found that most individual epidemiological studies showed increased risk of prostate cancer with increased intake of milk or dairy products meta-analysis of cohort data produced evidence of a clear dose-response relationship between advanced/aggressive cancer risk with milk intake and between all prostate cancer risk and milk and dairy products. possible mechanisms proposed included inhibition of the conversion of vitamin d to its active metabolite 1,25- dihydroxy vitamin d3 by calcium (which some evidence suggests increases cell proliferation in the prostate) and elevation of levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (igf-1) several sources suggest a correlation between high calcium intake from milk in particular and prostate cancer consistent with a calcium/vitamin d based mechanism overall the wcrf/aicr panel concluded that the evidence is inconsistent from both cohort and case-control studies there is limited evidence suggesting that milk and dairy products are a cause of prostate cancer.
medical studies also have shown a possible link between milk consumption and the exacerbation of diseases such as crohn's disease hirschsprung's diseasemimicking symptoms in babies with existing cow's milk allergies and the aggravation of behet's disease
=== flavored milk in us schools ===
milk must be offered at every meal if a united states school district wishes to get reimbursement from the federal government a quarter of the largest school districts in the us offer rice or soy milk and almost 17% of all us school districts offer lactose-free milk seventy-one percent of the milk served in us school cafeterias is flavored causing some school districts to propose a ban because flavored milk has added sugars (though some flavored milk products use artificial sweeteners instead.) the boulder colorado school district banned flavored milk in 2009 and instead installed a dispenser that keeps the milk colder
== bovine growth hormone supplementation ==
since november 1993 recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbst) also called rbgh has been sold to dairy farmers with fda approval cows produce bovine growth hormone naturally but some producers administer an additional recombinant version of bgh which is produced through a genetically engineered e coli because it increases milk production bovine growth hormone also stimulates liver production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf1) monsanto has stated that both of these compounds are harmless given the levels found in milk and the effects of pasteurization
on june 9 2006 the largest milk processor in the world and the two largest supermarkets in the united states dean foods wal-mart and kroger announced that they are on a nationwide search for rbgh-free milk. milk from cows given rbst may be sold in the united states and the fda stated that no significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rbst-treated and that from non-rbst-treated cows milk that advertises that it comes from cows not treated with rbst is required to state this finding on its label
cows receiving rbgh supplements may more frequently contract an udder infection known as mastitis problems with mastitis have led to canada australia new zealand and japan banning milk from rbst treated cows mastitis among other diseases may be responsible for the fact that levels of white blood cells in milk vary naturally
rbgh is also banned in the european union
== criticism ==
vegans and some other vegetarians do not consume milk for reasons mostly related to animal rights and environmental concerns they may object to features of dairy farming including the necessity of keeping dairy cows pregnant the killing of almost all the male offspring of dairy cows (either by disposal soon after birth for veal production or for beef) the routine separation of mother and calf soon after birth other perceived inhumane treatment of dairy cattle and culling of cows after their productive lives
some have criticized the american government's promotion of milk consumption the main concern is the financial interest that the american government has taken in the dairy industry promoting milk as the best source of calcium all united states schools that are a part of the federally funded national school lunch act are required by the federal government to provide milk for all students the office of dietary supplements recommends that healthy adults between ages 19 and 50 get about 1,000 mg of calcium per day but studies show that the human body can only retain about 550 mg of calcium per day milk also contains more excess calories sugar and fat than many other sources of calcium
there is also some skepticism of the idea that large doses of calcium provide for healthier bones and teeth this is a commonly held belief but there have been some studies that show there is no connection between the intake of calcium (in any form) and the reduced risk of bone fractures in women aged 34-71 years another study suggests that calcium supplements do not contribute to bone gain when a daily intake of 800 mg is surpassed
in 2011 the journal of bone and mineral research published a meta-analysis examining whether milk consumption might protect against hip fracture in middle-aged and older adults studies could find no association between drinking milk and lower rates of fractures in 2014 jama pediatrics published a report after monitoring almost 100,000 men and women for more than two decades subjects were asked to report on how much milk they had consumed as teenagers and were followed to see if there is any association with a reduced chance of hip fractures later in life it found there was not any a study published in the bmj that followed more than 45,000 men and 61,000 women in sweden age 39 and older had similar results milk consumption in adults was associated with no protection for men and an increased risk of fractures in women the risk of any bone fracture increased 16 percent in women who drank three or more glasses daily and the risk of a broken hip increased 60 percent it was also associated with an increased risk of death in both sexes
== varieties and brands ==
milk products are sold in a number of varieties based on types/degrees of
additives (e.g. vitamins)
age (e.g. cheddar)
coagulation (e.g. cottage cheese)
farming method (e.g. organic grass-fed)
fat content (e.g. half and half)

milk preserved by the uht process does not need to be refrigerated before opening and has a longer shelf life than milk in ordinary packaging it is typically sold unrefrigerated in the uk us europe latin america and australia
=== reduction or elimination of lactose ===
lactose-free milk can be produced by passing milk over lactase enzyme bound to an inert carrier once the molecule is cleaved there are no lactose ill effects forms are available with reduced amounts of lactose (typically 30% of normal) and alternatively with nearly 0% the only noticeable difference from regular milk is a slightly sweeter taste due to the generation of glucose by lactose cleavage it does not however contain more glucose and is nutritionally identical to regular milk
finland where approximately 17% of the finnish-speaking population has hypolactasia has had hyla (acronym for hydrolysed lactose) products available for many years lactose of low-lactose level cow's milk products ranging from ice cream to cheese is enzymatically hydrolysed into glucose and galactose the ultra-pasteurization process combined with aseptic packaging ensures a long shelf life in 2001 valio launched a lactose-free milk drink that is not sweet like hyla milk but has the fresh taste of ordinary milk valio patented the chromatographic separation method to remove lactose valio also markets these products in sweden estonia belgium and the united states where the company says ultrafiltration is used
in the uk where an estimated 15% of the population are affected by lactose intolerance lactofree produces milk cheese and yogurt products that contain only 0.03% lactose
to aid digestion in those with lactose intolerance milk with added bacterial cultures such as lactobacillus acidophilus ("acidophilus milk") and bifidobacteria ("a/b milk") is available in some areas another milk with lactococcus lactis bacteria cultures ("cultured buttermilk") often is used in cooking to replace the traditional use of naturally soured milk which has become rare due to the ubiquity of pasteurization which also kills the naturally occurring lactococcus bacteria
=== additives and flavoring ===
in areas where the cattle (and often the people) live indoors commercially sold milk commonly has vitamin d added to it to make up for lack of exposure to uvb radiation
reduced-fat milks often have added vitamin a palmitate to compensate for the loss of the vitamin during fat removal in the united states this results in reduced fat milks having a higher vitamin a content than whole milk
milk often has flavoring added to it for better taste or as a means of improving sales chocolate milk has been sold for many years and has been followed more recently by strawberry milk and others some nutritionists have criticized flavored milk for adding sugar usually in the form of high-fructose corn syrup to the diets of children who are already commonly obese in the us
=== distribution ===
due to the short shelf life of normal milk it used to be delivered to households daily in many countries however improved refrigeration at home changing food shopping patterns because of supermarkets and the higher cost of home delivery mean that daily deliveries by a milkman are no longer available in most countries
==== australia and new zealand ====
in australia and new zealand prior to metrication milk was generally distributed in 1 pint (568ml) glass bottles in australia and ireland there was a government funded free milk for school children program and milk was distributed at morning recess in 1/3 pint bottles with the conversion to metric measures the milk industry were concerned that the replacement of the pint bottles with 500ml bottles would result in a 13.6% drop in milk consumption hence all pint bottles were recalled and replaced by 600 ml bottles with time due to the steadily increasing cost of collecting transporting storing and cleaning glass bottles they were replaced by cardboard cartons a number of designs were used including a tetrahedron which could be close-packed without waste space and could not be knocked over accidentally (slogan no more crying over spilt milk.) however the industry eventually settled on a design similar to that used in the united states
milk is now available in a variety of sizes in cardboard cartons (250 ml 375 ml 600 ml 1 liter and 1.5 liters) and plastic bottles (1 2 and 3 liters) a significant addition to the marketplace has been long-life milk (uht) generally available in 1 and 2 liter rectangular cardboard cartons in urban and suburban areas where there is sufficient demand home delivery is still available though in suburban areas this is often 3 times per week rather than daily another significant and popular addition to the marketplace has been flavored milks for example as mentioned above farmers union iced coffee outsells coca-cola in south australia
==== india ====
in rural india milk is home delivered daily by local milkmen carrying bulk quantities in a metal container usually on a bicycle in other parts of metropolitan india milk is usually bought or delivered in plastic bags or cartons via shops or supermarkets
the current milk chain flow in india is from milk producer to milk collection agent then it is transported to a milk chilling center and bulk transported to the processing plant then to the sales agent and finally to the consumer
a 2011 survey by the food safety and standards authority of india found that nearly 70 per cent of samples had not conformed to the standards set for milk the study found that due to lack of hygiene and sanitation in milk handling and packaging detergents (used during cleaning operations) were not washed properly and found their way into the milk about eight per cent of samples in the survey were found to have detergents which are hazardous to health
==== pakistan ====
in pakistan milk is supplied in jugs milk has been a staple food especially among the pastoral tribes in this country
==== united kingdom ====
since the late 1990s milk-buying patterns have changed drastically in the uk the classic milkman who travels his local milk round (route) using a milk float (often battery powered) during the early hours and delivers milk in 1 pint glass bottles with aluminium foil tops directly to households has almost disappeared two of the main reasons for the decline of uk home deliveries by milkmen are household refrigerators (which lessen the need for daily milk deliveries) and private car usage (which has increased supermarket shopping) another factor is that it is cheaper to purchase milk from a supermarket than from home delivery in 1996 more than 2.5 billion liters of milk were still being delivered by milkmen but by 2006 only 637 million liters (13% of milk consumed) was delivered by some 9,500 milkmen by 2010 the estimated number of milkmen had dropped to 6,000 assuming that delivery per milkman is the same as it was in 2006 this means milkmen deliveries now only account for 67% of all milk consumed by uk households (6.7 billion liters in 2008/2009)
almost 95% of all milk in the uk is thus sold in shops today most of it in plastic bottles of various sizes but some also in milk cartons milk is hardly ever sold in glass bottles in uk shops
==== united states ====
in the united states glass milk bottles have been replaced mostly with milk cartons and plastic jugs gallons of milk are almost always sold in jugs while half gallons and quarts may be found in both paper cartons and plastic jugs and smaller sizes are almost always in cartons

=== packaging ===
glass milk bottles are now rare most people purchase milk in bags plastic bottles or plastic-coated paper cartons ultraviolet (uv) light from fluorescent lighting can alter the flavor of milk so many companies that once distributed milk in transparent or highly translucent containers are now using thicker materials that block the uv light milk comes in a variety of containers with local variants

=== spoilage and fermented milk products ===
when raw milk is left standing for a while it turns sour this is the result of fermentation where lactic acid bacteria ferment the lactose in the milk into lactic acid prolonged fermentation may render the milk unpleasant to consume this fermentation process is exploited by the introduction of bacterial cultures (e.g lactobacilli sp. streptococcus sp. leuconostoc sp. etc.) to produce a variety of fermented milk products the reduced ph from lactic acid accumulation denatures proteins and causes the milk to undergo a variety of different transformations in appearance and texture ranging from an aggregate to smooth consistency some of these products include sour cream yogurt cheese buttermilk viili kefir and kumis see dairy product for more information
pasteurization of cow's milk initially destroys any potential pathogens and increases the shelf life but eventually results in spoilage that makes it unsuitable for consumption this causes it to assume an unpleasant odor and the milk is deemed non-consumable due to unpleasant taste and an increased risk of food poisoning in raw milk the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria under suitable conditions ferments the lactose present to lactic acid the increasing acidity in turn prevents the growth of other organisms or slows their growth significantly during pasteurization however these lactic acid bacteria are mostly destroyed
in order to prevent spoilage milk can be kept refrigerated and stored between 1 and 4 c (34 and 39 f) in bulk tanks most milk is pasteurized by heating briefly and then refrigerated to allow transport from factory farms to local markets the spoilage of milk can be forestalled by using ultra-high temperature (uht) treatment milk so treated can be stored unrefrigerated for several months until opened but has a characteristic cooked taste condensed milk made by removing most of the water can be stored in cans for many years unrefrigerated as can evaporated milk the most durable form of milk is powdered milk which is produced from milk by removing almost all water the moisture content is usually less than 5% in both drum- and spray-dried powdered milk
== language and culture ==
the importance of milk in human culture is attested to by the numerous expressions embedded in our languages for example the milk of human kindness in ancient greek mythology the goddess hera spilled her breast milk after refusing to feed heracles resulting in the milky way
in many african and asian countries butter is traditionally made from fermented milk rather than cream it can take several hours of churning to produce workable butter grains from fermented milk
holy books have also mentioned milk the bible contains references to the land of milk and honey in the qur'an there is a request to wonder on milk as follows and surely in the livestock there is a lesson for you we give you to drink of that which is in their bellies from the midst of digested food and blood pure milk palatable for the drinkers.'(16-the honeybee 66) the ramadan fast is traditionally broken with a glass of milk and dates
abhisheka is conducted by hindu and jain priests by pouring libations on the image of a deity being worshipped amidst the chanting of mantras usually offerings such as milk yogurt ghee honey may be poured among other offerings depending on the type of abhishekam being performed
to milk someone in the vernacular of many english-speaking countries is to take advantage of the person
the word milk has had many slang meanings over time in the 19th century milk was used to describe a cheap alcoholic drink made from methylated spirits mixed with water the word was also used to mean defraud to be idle to intercept telegrams addressed to someone else and a weakling or milksop in the mid-1930s the word was used in australia meaning to siphon gas from a car
== other uses ==
besides serving as a beverage or source of food milk has been described as used by farmers and gardeners as an organic fungicide and fertilizer however its effectiveness is debated diluted milk solutions have been demonstrated to provide an effective method of preventing powdery mildew on grape vines while showing it is unlikely to harm the plant
