mechanical wave wave oscillation matter therefore transfers energy medium waves move long distances movement medium transmissionthe materialis limited therefore oscillating material move far initial equilibrium position mechanical waves transport energy energy propagates direction wave kind wave mechanical electromagnetic certain energy mechanical waves produced media possess elasticity inertia
mechanical wave requires initial energy input initial energy added wave travels medium energy transferred contrast electromagnetic waves require medium still travel one
one important property mechanical waves amplitudes measured unusual way displacement divided reduced wavelength gets comparable unity significant nonlinear effects harmonic generation may occur large enough may result chaotic effects example waves surface body water break dimensionless amplitude exceeds resulting foam surface turbulent mixing common examples mechanical waves water waves sound waves seismic waves
three types mechanical waves transverse waves longitudinal waves surface waves
transverse waveedit
transverse waves cause medium vibrate right angle direction wave energy carried medium transverse waves two partsthe crest trough crest highest point wave trough lowest distance crest trough half wavelength wavelength distance crest crest trough trough
see example move end slinky whose end fixed leftandright slinky opposed toandfro slinky light also properties transverse wave although electromagnetic wave
longitudinal waveedit
longitudinal waves cause medium vibrate parallel direction wave consists multiple compressions rarefactions rarefaction farthest distance apart longitudinal wave compression closest distance together speed longitudinal wave increased higher index refraction due closer proximity atoms medium compressed sound considered longitudinal wave
surface wavesedit
type wave travels along surface two media example surface wave would waves pool ocean lake type water body two types surface waves namely rayleigh waves love waves
rayleigh waves also known ground roll waves travel ripples motion similar waves surface water rayleigh waves much slower body waves roughly velocity body waves typical homogeneous elastic medium
love wave surface waves horizontal waves shear transverse direction propagation usually travel slightly faster rayleigh waves body wave velocity largest amplitude
