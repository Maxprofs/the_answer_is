example consider gasphase reaction

co k reaction rate constant square brackets indicate molar concentration
first step ratedeterminingedit
fact however observed reaction rate second order
zero order co rate equation r kno
suggests rate determined step two
molecules react co molecule entering another faster step possible mechanism two elementary steps explains rate equation
slow step ratedetermining

also react first step occurs reverse direction
rate r minus sign indicates rate reverse reaction
concentration reactive intermediate
remains low almost constant may therefore estimated steady state approximation specifies rate formed equals total rate consumed example
