a tunnel is an underground or underwater passageway dug through the surrounding soil/earth/rock and enclosed except for entrance and exit commonly at each end a pipeline is not a tunnel though some recent tunnels have used immersed tube construction techniques rather than traditional tunnel boring methods
a tunnel may be for foot or vehicular road traffic for rail traffic or for a canal the central portions of a rapid transit network are usually in tunnel some tunnels are aqueducts to supply water for consumption or for hydroelectric stations or are sewers utility tunnels are used for routing steam chilled water electrical power or telecommunication cables as well as connecting buildings for convenient passage of people and equipment
secret tunnels are built for military purposes or by civilians for smuggling of weapons contraband or people special tunnels such as wildlife crossings are built to allow wildlife to cross human-made barriers safely
== terminology ==
a tunnel is relatively long and narrow the length is often much greater than twice the diameter although similar shorter excavations can be constructed such as cross passages between tunnels
the definition of what constitutes a tunnel can vary widely from source to source for example the definition of a road tunnel in the united kingdom is defined as a subsurface highway structure enclosed for a length of 150 metres (490 ft) or more. in the united states the nfpa definition of a tunnel is an underground structure with a design length greater than 23 m (75 ft) and a diameter greater than 1,800 millimetres (5.9 ft).
in the uk a pedestrian cycle or animal tunnel beneath a road or railway is called a subway while an underground railway system is differently named in different cities the underground or the tube in london the subway in glasgow and the metro in newcastle the place where a road railway canal or watercourse passes under a footpath cycleway or another road or railway is most commonly called a bridge or if passing under a canal an aqueduct where it is important to stress that it is passing underneath it may be called an underpass though the official term when passing under a railway is an underbridge a longer underpass containing a road canal or railway is normally called a tunnel whether or not it passes under another item of infrastructure an underpass of any length under a river is also usually called a tunnel whatever mode of transport it is for
in the us the term subway means an underground rapid transit system and the term pedestrian underpass is used for a passage beneath a barrier rail station platforms may be connected by pedestrian tunnels or footbridges
== history ==
much of the early technology of tunneling evolved from mining and military engineering the etymology of the terms mining (for mineral extraction or for siege attacks) military engineering and civil engineering reveals these deep historic connections
== geotechnical investigation and design ==
a tunnel project must start with a comprehensive investigation of ground conditions by collecting samples from boreholes and by other geophysical techniques an informed choice can then be made of machinery and methods for excavation and ground support which will reduce the risk of encountering unforeseen ground conditions in planning the route the horizontal and vertical alignments will make use of the best ground and water conditions
conventional desk and site studies may yield insufficient information to assess such factors as the blocky nature of rocks the exact location of fault zones or the stand-up times of softer ground this may be a particular concern in large-diameter tunnels to give more information a pilot tunnel or drift may be driven ahead of the main drive this tunnel will be easier to support should unexpected conditions be met and will be incorporated in the final tunnel alternatively horizontal boreholes may sometimes be drilled ahead of the advancing tunnel face
other key geotechnical factors include
stand-up time is the amount of time a tunnel will support itself without any added structures knowing this time allows the engineers to determine how much can be excavated before support is needed the longer the stand-up time is the faster the excavating will go generally certain configurations of rock and clay will have the greatest stand-up time and sand and fine soils will have a much lower stand-up time
groundwater control is very important in tunnel construction if there is water leaking into the tunnel stand-up time will be greatly decreased if there is water leaking into the shaft it will become unstable and will not be safe to work in to stop this from happening there are a few common methods one of the most effective is ground freezing to do this pipes are inserted into the ground surrounding the shaft and are cooled until they freeze this freezes the ground around each pipe until the whole shaft is surrounded frozen soil keeping water out the most common method is to install pipes into the ground and to simply pump the water out this works for tunnels and shafts
tunnel shape is very important in determining stand-up time the force from gravity is straight down on a tunnel so if the tunnel is wider than it is high it will have a harder time supporting itself decreasing its stand-up time if a tunnel is higher than it is wide the stand up time will increase making the project easier the hardest shape to support itself is a square or rectangular tunnel the forces have a harder time being redirected around the tunnel making it extremely hard to support itself this of course all depends what the material of the ground is
researchers have also investigated factors linked to the following critical failure events in tunnel works occurring during the construction phase
-face instability in soft soils when using slurry shields
-face instability in soft soils when using an earth pressure balance shield
-collapse and large deformations in shaft excavations
-collapse and large deformations of excavations for cross passages in soft soils
-excessive volume loss leading to surface settlements in tunnels bored in soft soils
-excessive deformation damage and leakage of concrete lining
the investigated factors cover issues related to design boring process and ground conditions
=== choice of tunnels vs bridges ===
for water crossings a tunnel is generally more costly to construct than a bridge navigational considerations may limit the use of high bridges or drawbridge spans intersecting with shipping channels necessitating a tunnel
bridges usually require a larger footprint on each shore than tunnels in areas with expensive real estate such as manhattan and urban hong kong this is a strong factor in favor of a tunnel boston's big dig project replaced elevated roadways with a tunnel system to increase traffic capacity hide traffic reclaim land redecorate and reunite the city with the waterfront in hampton roads virginia tunnels were chosen over bridges for strategic considerations in the event of damage bridges would prevent us navy vessels from leaving naval station norfolk
the 1934 queensway road tunnel under the river mersey at liverpool was chosen over a massively high bridge for defence reasons it was feared aircraft could destroy a bridge in times of war maintenance costs of a massive bridge to allow the world's largest ships to navigate under were considered higher than for a tunnel similar conclusions were reached for the 1971 kingsway tunnel under the mersey
water-crossing tunnels built instead of bridges include the holland tunnel and lincoln tunnel between new jersey and manhattan in new york city the queens-midtown tunnel between manhattan and the borough of queens on long island and the elizabeth river tunnels between norfolk and portsmouth virginia the 1934 river mersey road queensway tunnel the western scheldt tunnel zeeland netherlands and the north shore connector tunnel in pittsburgh pennsylvania
other reasons for choosing a tunnel instead of a bridge include avoiding difficulties with tides weather and shipping during construction (as in the 51.5-kilometre or 32.0-mile channel tunnel) aesthetic reasons (preserving the above-ground view landscape and scenery) and also for weight capacity reasons (it may be more feasible to build a tunnel than a sufficiently strong bridge)
some water crossings are a mixture of bridges and tunnels such as the denmark to sweden link and the chesapeake bay bridge-tunnel in virginia
there are particular hazards with tunnels especially from vehicle fires when combustion gases can asphyxiate users as happened at the gotthard road tunnel in switzerland in 2001 one of the worst railway disasters ever the balvano train disaster was caused by a train stalling in the armi tunnel in italy in 1944 killing 426 passengers
=== cost estimates and overruns ===
government funds are a major factor in the creation of tunnels when a tunnel is in the process of being constructed economics and politics play a large factor in the decision making process this division of the project is part of the construction/project management aspect of civil engineering the project duration must be identified using a work breakdown structure (wbs) and critical path method (cpm) understanding the amount of time the project requires the amount of labors and materials needed is a crucial part of the project also the amount of land that will need to be excavated and the proper machinery that is needed is also very important since infrastructures require millions or even billions of dollars acquiring these funds can be challenging
the need for an infrastructure such as a tunnel must be identified political issues are bound to occur as it was shown in 2005 when the us house of representatives approved a $100 million federal grant to build a tunnel in the new york harbor however the port authority of new york and new jersey was aware of this bill and had never asked for a grant or for such a project the current state of the economy reflects on the amount of money the government can give for public projects since taxpayers money goes to projects such as the creation of tunnels or any other infrastructures increasing taxes may cause issues
== construction ==
tunnels are dug in types of materials varying from soft clay to hard rock the method of tunnel construction depends on such factors as the ground conditions the ground water conditions the length and diameter of the tunnel drive the depth of the tunnel the logistics of supporting the tunnel excavation the final use and shape of the tunnel and appropriate risk management
there are three basic types of tunnel construction in common use
cut-and-cover tunnel constructed in a shallow trench and then covered over
bored tunnel constructed in situ without removing the ground above they are usually of circular or horseshoe cross-section
immersed tube tunnel sunk into a body of water and laid on or buried just under its bed
=== cut-and-cover ===
cut-and-cover is a simple method of construction for shallow tunnels where a trench is excavated and roofed over with an overhead support system strong enough to carry the load of what is to be built above the tunnel two basic forms of cut-and-cover tunnelling are available
bottom-up method a trench is excavated with ground support as necessary and the tunnel is constructed in it the tunnel may be of in situ concrete precast concrete precast arches or corrugated steel arches in early days brickwork was used the trench is then carefully back-filled and the surface is reinstated
top-down method side support walls and capping beams are constructed from ground level by such methods as slurry walling or contiguous bored piling then a shallow excavation allows making the tunnel roof of precast beams or in situ concrete the surface is then reinstated except for access openings this allows early reinstatement of roadways services and other surface features excavation then takes place under the permanent tunnel roof and the base slab is constructed
shallow tunnels are often of the cut-and-cover type (if under water of the immersed-tube type) while deep tunnels are excavated often using a tunnelling shield for intermediate levels both methods are possible
large cut-and-cover boxes are often used for underground metro stations such as canary wharf tube station in london this construction form generally has two levels which allows economical arrangements for ticket hall station platforms passenger access and emergency egress ventilation and smoke control staff rooms and equipment rooms the interior of canary wharf station has been likened to an underground cathedral owing to the sheer size of the excavation this contrasts with many traditional stations on london underground where bored tunnels were used for stations and passenger access nevertheless the original parts of the london underground network the metropolitan and district railways were constructed using cut-and-cover these lines pre-dated electric traction and the proximity to the surface was useful to ventilate the inevitable smoke and steam
a major disadvantage of cut-and-cover is the widespread disruption generated at the surface level during construction this and the availability of electric traction brought about london underground's switch to bored tunnels at a deeper level towards the end of the 19th century
=== boring machines ===
tunnel boring machines (tbms) and associated back-up systems are used to highly automate the entire tunnelling process reducing tunnelling costs in certain predominantly urban applications tunnel boring is viewed as quick and cost effective alternative to laying surface rails and roads expensive compulsory purchase of buildings and land with potentially lengthy planning inquiries is eliminated disadvantages of tbms arise from their usually large size - the difficulty of transporting the large tbm to the site of tunnel construction or (alternatively) the high cost of assembling the tbm on-site often within the confines of the tunnel being constructed
there are a variety of tbm designs that can operate in a variety of conditions from hard rock to soft water-bearing ground some types of tbms the bentonite slurry and earth-pressure balance machines have pressurised compartments at the front end allowing them to be used in difficult conditions below the water table this pressurizes the ground ahead of the tbm cutter head to balance the water pressure the operators work in normal air pressure behind the pressurised compartment but may occasionally have to enter that compartment to renew or repair the cutters this requires special precautions such as local ground treatment or halting the tbm at a position free from water despite these difficulties tbms are now preferred over the older method of tunnelling in compressed air with an air lock/decompression chamber some way back from the tbm which required operators to work in high pressure and go through decompression procedures at the end of their shifts much like deep-sea divers
in february 2010 aker wirth delivered a tbm to switzerland for the expansion of the linthlimmern power stations in switzerland the borehole has a diameter of 8.03 metres (26.3 ft) the four tbms used for excavating the 57-kilometre (35 mi) gotthard base tunnel in switzerland had a diameter of about 9 metres (30 ft) a larger tbm was built to bore the green heart tunnel (dutch tunnel groene hart) as part of the hsl-zuid in the netherlands with a diameter of 14.87 metres (48.8 ft) this in turn was superseded by the madrid m30 ringroad spain and the chong ming tunnels in shanghai china all of these machines were built at least partly by herrenknecht as of august 2013 the world's largest tbm is big bertha a 57.5-foot (17.5 m) diameter machine built by hitachi zosen corporation which is digging the alaskan way viaduct replacement tunnel in seattle washington (us)
=== clay-kicking ===
clay-kicking is a specialised method developed in the united kingdom of manually digging tunnels in strong clay-based soil structures unlike previous manual methods of using mattocks which relied on the soil structure to be hard clay-kicking was relatively silent and hence did not harm soft clay based structures
the clay-kicker lies on a plank at a 45-degree angle away from the working face and inserts a tool with a cup-like rounded end with the feet turning the tool manually he or she extracts a section of soil which is then placed on the waste extract
regularly used in victorian civil engineering the methods found favour in the renewal of the united kingdom's then ancient sewerage systems by not having to remove all property or infrastructure to create an effective small tunnel system during the first world war the system was successfully deployed by the royal engineer tunnelling companies to deploy large military mines beneath enemy german empire lines the method was virtually silent and so not susceptible to listening methods of detection
=== shafts ===
a temporary access shaft is sometimes necessary during the excavation of a tunnel they are usually circular and go straight down until they reach the level at which the tunnel is going to be built a shaft normally has concrete walls and is usually built to be permanent once the access shafts are complete tbms are lowered to the bottom and excavation can start shafts are the main entrance in and out of the tunnel until the project is completed if a tunnel is going to be long multiple shafts at various locations may be bored so that entrance to the tunnel is closer to the unexcavated area
once construction is complete construction access shafts are often used as ventilation shafts and may also be used as emergency exits
=== sprayed concrete techniques ===
the new austrian tunneling method (natm) was developed in the 1960s and is the best known of a number of engineering solutions that use calculated and empirical real-time measurements to provide optimised safe support to the tunnel lining the main idea of this method is to use the geological stress of the surrounding rock mass to stabilize the tunnel itself by allowing a measured relaxation and stress reassignment into the surrounding rock to prevent full loads becoming imposed on the introduced support measures based on geotechnical measurements an optimal cross section is computed the excavation is immediately protected by a layer of sprayed concrete commonly referred to as shotcrete after excavation other support measures could include steel arches rockbolts and mesh technological developments in sprayed concrete technology have resulted in steel and polypropylene fibres being added to the concrete mix to improve lining strength this creates a natural load-bearing ring which minimizes the rock's deformation
by special monitoring the natm method is very flexible even at surprising changes of the geomechanical rock consistency during the tunneling work the measured rock properties lead to appropriate tools for tunnel strengthening in the last decades also soft ground excavations up to 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) became usual
=== pipe jacking ===
in pipe jacking hydraulic jacks are used to push specially made pipes through the ground behind a tbm or shield commonly used to create tunnels under existing structures such as roads or railways tunnels constructed by pipe jacking are normally small diameter tunnels with a maximum size of around 3.2m
=== box jacking ===
box jacking is similar to pipe jacking but instead of jacking tubes a box shaped tunnel is used jacked boxes can be a much larger span than a pipe jack with the span of some box jacks in excess of 20m a cutting head is normally used at the front of the box being jacked and excavation is normally by excavator from within the box
=== underwater tunnels ===
there are also several approaches to underwater tunnels the two most common being bored tunnels or immersed tubes examples are bjrvika tunnel and marmaray submerged floating tunnels are a novel approach under consideration however no such tunnels have been constructed to date
=== temporary way ===
during construction of a tunnel it is often convenient to install a temporary railway particularly to remove excavated spoil often narrow gauge so that it can be double track to allow the operation of empty and loaded trains at the same time the temporary way is replaced by the permanent way at completion thus explaining the term perway
=== enlargement ===
the vehicles or traffic using a tunnel can outgrow it requiring replacement or enlargement
the original single line gib tunnel near mittagong was replaced with a double-track tunnel with the original tunnel used for growing mushrooms
the 1836 double-track mile-long tunnel from edge hill to lime street in liverpool was totally removed apart from a 50-metre section at edge hill as four tracks were required the tunnel was dug out into a very deep four-track cutting with short four-track tunnels in places train services were not interrupted as the work progressed there are other occurrences of tunnels being replaced by open cuts for example the auburn tunnel
the farnworth tunnel was enlarged using a tunnel boring machine (tbm) in 2005 the rhyndaston tunnel was enlarged using a borrowed tbm so as to be able to take iso containers
tunnels can also be enlarged by lowering the floor
=== open building pit ===
an open building pit consists of a horizontal and a vertical boundary that keeps groundwater and soil out of the pit there are several potential alternatives and combinations for (horizontal and vertical) building pit boundaries the most important difference with cut-and-cover is that the open building pit is muted after tunnel construction no roof is placed
=== other construction methods ===
drilling and blasting
hydraulic splitter
slurry-shield machine
wall-cover construction method
== variant tunnel types ==
=== double-deck and multipurpose tunnels ===
some tunnels are double-deck for example the two major segments of the san francisco oakland bay bridge (completed in 1936) are linked by a double-deck tunnel through yerba buena island the largest-diameter bored tunnel in the world at construction this was a combination bidirectional rail and truck pathway on the lower deck with automobiles above now converted to one-way road vehicle traffic on each deck
in the netherlands a two-stack road tunnel is being constructed in the city of maastricht the two lower tubes of the tunnel will carry the a2 motorway which originates in amsterdam through the city and the two upper tubes will take the n2 regional highway for local traffic in the uk the 1934 queensway tunnel under the river mersey between liverpool and birkenhead was originally to have road vehicles running on the upper deck and trams on the lower during construction the tram usage was cancelled the lower section is only used for cables pipes and emergency accident refuge enclosures
in hong kong sar (of china) the lion rock tunnel built in the mid 1960s connecting new kowloon and sha tin carries a motorway and an aqueduct a recent double-deck tunnel with both decks for motor vehicles is the fuxing road tunnel in shanghai china cars travel on the two-lane upper deck and heavier vehicles on the single-lane lower level
multipurpose tunnels exist that have more than one purpose the smart tunnel in malaysia is the first multipurpose flood control tunnel in the world used both to convey traffic and occasional flood waters in kuala lumpur
common utility ducts or utility tunnels are carry two or more utility lines through co-location of different utilities in one tunnel organizations are able to reduce the costs of building and maintaining utilities
=== covered passageways ===
over-bridges can sometimes be built by covering a road or river or railway with brick or steel arches and then leveling the surface with earth in railway parlance a surface-level track which has been built or covered over is normally called a covered way
snow sheds are a kind of artificial tunnel built to protect a railway from avalanches of snow similarly the stanwell park new south wales steel tunnel on the south coast line protects the line from rockfalls
== safety and security ==
owing to the enclosed space of a tunnel fires can have very serious effects on users the main dangers are gas and smoke production with even low concentrations of carbon monoxide being highly toxic fires killed 11 people in the gotthard tunnel fire of 2001 for example all of the victims succumbing to smoke and gas inhalation over 400 passengers died in the balvano train disaster in italy in 1944 when the locomotive halted in a long tunnel carbon monoxide poisoning was the main cause of death in the caldecott tunnel fire of 1982 the majority of fatalities were caused by toxic smoke rather than by the initial crash
motor vehicle tunnels usually require ventilation shafts and powered fans to remove toxic exhaust gases during routine operation
rail tunnels usually require fewer air changes per hour but still may require forced-air ventilation both types of tunnels often have provisions to increase ventilation under emergency conditions such as a fire although there is a risk of increasing the rate of combustion through increased airflow the primary focus is on providing breathable air to persons trapped in the tunnel as well as firefighters
when there is a parallel separate tunnel available airtight but unlocked emergency doors are usually provided which allow trapped personnel to escape from a smoke-filled tunnel to the parallel tube
larger heavily-used tunnels such as the big dig tunnel in boston massachusetts may have a dedicated 24-hour manned operations center which monitors and reports on traffic conditions and responds to emergencies video surveillance equipment is often used and real-time pictures of traffic conditions for some highways may be viewable by the general public via the internet
== examples of tunnels ==
=== in history ===
the history of ancient tunnels and tunneling in the world is reviewed in various sources which include many examples of these structures that were built for different purposes some well known ancient and modern tunnels are briefly introduced below
the qanat or kareez of persia are water management systems used to provide a reliable supply of water to human settlements or for irrigation in hot arid and semi-arid climates the deepest known qanat is in the iranian city of gonabad which after 2700 years still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000 people its main well depth is more than 360 m (1,180 ft) and its length is 45 km (28 mi)
the siloam tunnel was built before 701 bce for a reliable supply of water to withstand siege attacks
the eupalinian aqueduct on the island of samos (north aegean greece) was built in 520 bce by the ancient greek engineer eupalinos of megara under a contract with the local community eupalinos organised the work so that the tunnel was begun from both sides of mount kastro the two teams advanced simultaneously and met in the middle with excellent accuracy something that was extremely difficult in that time the aqueduct was of utmost defensive importance since it ran underground and it was not easily found by an enemy who could otherwise cut off the water supply to pythagoreion the ancient capital of samos the tunnel's existence was recorded by herodotus (as was the mole and harbour and the third wonder of the island the great temple to hera thought by many to be the largest in the greek world) the precise location of the tunnel was only re-established in the 19th century by german archaeologists the tunnel proper is 1.030 km long (3,380 ft) and visitors can still enter it eupalinos tunnel
one of the first known drainage and sewage networks in form of tunnels was constructed at persepolis in iran at the same time as the construction of its foundation in 518 bce in most places the network was dug in the sound rock of the mountain and then covered by large pieces of rock and stone followed by earth and rubbles to level the ground during investigations and surveys long sections of similar rock tunnels extending beneath the palace area were traced by herzfeld and later by schmidt and their archeological teams
the via flaminia an important roman road penetrated the furlo pass in the apennines through a tunnel which emperor vespasian had ordered built in 76-77 ce a modern road the ss 3 flaminia still uses this tunnel which had a precursor dating back to the 3rd century bce remnants of this earlier tunnel (one of the first road tunnels) are also still visible
the world's oldest underwater tunnel is claimed to be the terelek kaya tneli under kzl river a little south of the towns of boyabat and duraan in turkey just downstream from where kizil river joins its tributary gkrmak the tunnel is presently under a narrow part of a lake formed by a dam some kilometers further downstream estimated to have been built more than 2000 years ago possibly by the same civilization that also built the royal tombs in a rock face nearby it is assumed to have had a defensive purpose
sapperton canal tunnel on the thames and severn canal in england dug through hills which opened in 1789 was 3.5 km (2.2 mi) long and allowed boat transport of coal and other goods above it the sapperton long tunnel was constructed which carries the golden valley railway line between swindon and gloucester
the 1791 dudley canal tunnel is on the dudley canal in dudley england the tunnel is 1.83 miles (2.9 km) long closed in 1962 the tunnel was reopened in 1973 the series of tunnels was extended in 1984 and 1989
fritchley tunnel constructed in 1793 in derbyshire by the butterley company to transport limestone to its ironworks factory the butterley company engineered and built its own railway a victim of the depression the company closed after 219 years in 2009 the tunnel is the world's oldest railway tunnel traversed by rail wagons using gravity and horse haulage the railway was converted to steam locomotion in 1813 using a steam horse locomotive engineered and built by the butterley company however reverted to horses steam trains used the tunnel continuously from the 1840s when the railway was converted to a narrow gauge the line closed in 1933 in the second world war the tunnel was used as an air raid shelter sealed up in 1977 it was rediscovered in 2013 and inspected the tunnel was resealed to preserved the construction as it was designated an ancient monument
the 1794 butterley canal tunnel canal tunnel is 3,083 yards (2,819m) in length on the cromford canal in ripley derbyshire england the tunnel was built simultaneously with the 1773 fritchley railway tunnel the tunnel partially collapsed in 1900 splitting the cromford canal and has not been used since the friends of cromford canal a group of volunteers are working at fully restoring the cromford canal and the butterley tunnel
the 1796 stoddart tunnel in chapel-en-le-frith in derbyshire is reputed to be the oldest rail tunnel in the world the rail wagons were originally horse-drawn
derby tunnels in salem massachusetts were built in 1801 to smuggle imports affected by president thomas jefferson new customs duties jefferson had ordered local militias to help the custom house in each port collect these dues but the smugglers led by elias derby hired the salem militia to dig the tunnels and hide the spoil the tunnels ran 3 miles connecting the wharfs in town to an underground train station along the way they connected prominent businessmen and politicians homes to their stores bank and museums members of the salem commons fund hid the tunnels behind a project to fill in the ponds and grade the local common tunnel dirt was hidden in those ponds and was used to fill in rivers to create new wharfs to connect the tunnels to many politicians were involved including a superior court justice a secretary of the navy and many senators in the federalist party
a tunnel was created for the first true steam locomotive from penydarren to abercynon the penydarren locomotive was built by richard trevithick the locomotive made the historic journey from penydarren to abercynon in 1804 part of this tunnel can still be seen at pentrebach merthyr tydfil wales this is arguably the oldest railway tunnel in the world dedicated only to self-propelled steam engines on rails

bourne's tunnel rainhill near liverpool england 0.0321 km (105 ft) long built in the late 1820s the exact date is unknown however probably built in 1828 or 1829 this is the first tunnel in the world constructed under a railway line the construction of the liverpool to manchester railway ran over a horse-drawn tramway from the sutton collieries to the liverpool-warrington turnpike road a tunnel was bored under the railway for the tramway as the railway was being constructed the tunnel was made operational opening prior to the liverpool tunnels on the liverpool to manchester line the tunnel was made redundant in 1844 when the tramway was dismantled
crown street station liverpool england 1829 built by george stephenson a single track tunnel 266 m long (873 ft) was bored from edge hill to crown street to serve the world's first intercity passenger railway terminus station the station was abandoned in 1836 being too far from liverpool city centre with the area converted for freight use closed down in 1972 the tunnel is disused however it is the oldest rail tunnel running under streets in the world
the 2.03 km (1.26 mi) 1829 twin track wapping tunnel in liverpool england was the first rail tunnel bored under a metropolis the tunnel's path is from edge hill in the east of the city to the south end liverpool docks and was used only for freight terminating at the park lane goods terminal opposite king's dock currently disused since 1972 the tunnel was to be a part of the merseyrail metro network with work started and abandoned because of costs the tunnel is in excellent condition and is still being considered for reuse by merseyrail maybe with an underground station cut into the tunnel for liverpool university the river portal is opposite the new king's dock liverpool arena being an ideal location for a serving station if reused the tunnel will be the oldest used underground rail tunnel in the world and oldest section of any underground metro system
1836 lime st station tunnel liverpool a two track rail tunnel 1.811 km (1.125 mi) long was bored under the metropolis from edge hill in the east of the city to lime street in the 1880s the tunnel was converted to a deep open to the atmosphere cutting four tracks wide the only occurrence of a major tunnel being removed a short section of the original tunnel still exists at edge hill station giving the tunnel the distinction of being the oldest rail tunnel in the world still in use and the oldest in use under streets
