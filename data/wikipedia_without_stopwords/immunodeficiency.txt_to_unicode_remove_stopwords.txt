immunodeficiency immune deficiency state immune systems ability fight infectious disease compromised entirely absent immunodeficiency may also decrease cancer immunosurveillance cases immunodeficiency acquired secondary people born defects immune system primary immunodeficiency transplant patients take medications suppress immune system antirejection measure patients suffering overactive immune system person immunodeficiency kind said immunocompromised immunocompromised person may particularly vulnerable opportunistic infections addition normal infections could affect everyone
types
affected component
humoral immune deficiency signs symptoms depending cause generally include signs hypogammaglobulinemia decrease one types antibodies presentations including repeated mild respiratory infections andor agammaglobulinemia lack antibody production results frequent severe infections often fatal
cell deficiency often causes secondary disorders acquired immune deficiency syndrome
granulocyte deficiency including decreased numbers granulocytes called granulocytopenia absent agranulocytosis neutrophil granulocytes termed neutropenia granulocyte deficiencies also include decreased function individual granulocytes chronic granulomatous disease
asplenia function spleen
complement deficiency function complement system deficient
reality immunodeficiency often affects multiple components notable examples including severe combined immunodeficiency primary acquired immune deficiency syndrome secondary
primary secondary
distinction primary versus secondary immunodeficiencies based respectively whether cause originates immune system turn due insufficiency supporting component external decreasing factor
primary immunodeficiency
number rare diseases feature heightened susceptibility infections childhood onward primary immunodeficiency also known congenital immunodeficiencies many disorders hereditary autosomal recessive xlinked recognised primary immunodeficiency syndromes generally grouped part immune system malfunctioning lymphocytes granulocytes
treatment primary immunodeficiencies depends nature defect may involve antibody infusions longterm antibiotics cases stem cell transplantation
secondary immunodeficiencies
secondary immunodeficiencies also known acquired immunodeficiencies result various immunosuppressive agents example malnutrition aging particular medications eg chemotherapy diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs immunosuppressive drugs organ transplants glucocorticoids medications term immunosuppression generally refers beneficial potential adverse effects decreasing function immune system term immunodeficiency generally refers solely adverse effect increased risk infection
many specific diseases directly indirectly cause immunosuppression includes many types cancer particularly bone marrow blood cells leukemia lymphoma multiple myeloma certain chronic infections immunodeficiency also hallmark acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids caused human immunodeficiency virus hiv hiv directly infects small number helper cells also impairs immune system responses indirectly
immunodeficiency autoimmunity
large number immunodeficiency syndromes present clinical laboratory characteristics autoimmunity decreased ability immune system clear infections patients may responsible causing autoimmunity perpetual immune system activation
one example common variable immunodeficiency cvid multiple autoimmune diseases seen eg inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune thrombocytopenia autoimmune thyroid disease familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency another example pancytopenia rashes lymphadenopathy hepatosplenomegaly commonly seen patients presence multiple uncleared viral infections due lack perforin thought responsible addition chronic andor recurrent infections many autoimmune diseases including arthritis autoimmune hemolytic anemia scleroderma type diabetes also seen xlinked agammaglobulinemia xla recurrent bacterial fungal infections chronic inflammation gut lungs seen chronic granulomatous disease cgd well cgd caused decreased production nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadph oxidase neutrophils hypomorphic rag mutations seen patients midline granulomatous disease autoimmune disorder commonly seen patients granulomatosis polyangiitis wegenrs disease nkt cell lymphomas wiskottaldrich syndrome patients also present eczema autoimmune manifestations recurrent bacterial infections lymphoma autoimmune polyendocrinopathycandidiasisectodermal dystrophy apeced also autoimmunity infections coexist organspecific autoimmune manifestations eg hypoparathyroidism adrenocortical failure chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis finally iga deficiency also sometimes associated development autoimmune atopic phenomena
