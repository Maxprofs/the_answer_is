origins
word enthalpy based greek enthalpein means warm comes classical greek prefix en meaning put verb thalpein meaning heat word enthalpy often incorrectly attributed benot paul mile clapeyron rudolf clausius publication clausiusclapeyron relation misconception popularized publication mollier steam tables diagrams however neither concept word symbol enthalpy existed well clapeyrons death
earliest writings contain concept enthalpy appear josiah willard gibbs introduced heat function constant pressure however gibbs use word enthalpy writings
actual word first appears scientific literature publication j p dalton according publication heike kamerlingh onnes actually coined word
years many different symbols used denote enthalpy alfred w porter proposed symbol h accepted standard thus finalizing terminology still use today
