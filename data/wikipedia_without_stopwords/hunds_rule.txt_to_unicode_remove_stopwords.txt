hunds rule maximum multiplicity rule based observation atomic spectra used predict ground state atom molecule one open electronic shells rule states given electron configuration lowest energy term one greatest value spin multiplicity implies two orbitals equal energy available electrons occupy singly filling pairs rule discovered friedrich hund important use atomic chemistry spectroscopy quantum chemistry often abbreviated hunds rule ignoring hunds two rules

multiplicity state defined total electronic spin high multiplicity state therefore highspin state lowestenergy state maximum multiplicity usually unpaired electrons parallel spin since spin electron total spin onehalf number unpaired electrons multiplicity number unpaired electrons example nitrogen atom ground state three unpaired electrons parallel spin total spin multiplicity
lower energy increased stability atom arise highspin state unpaired electrons parallel spin must reside different spatial orbitals according pauli exclusion principle early incorrect explanation lower energy high multiplicity states different occupied spatial orbitals create larger average distance electrons reducing electronelectron repulsion energy however quantummechanical calculations accurate wave functions since shown actual physical reason increased stability decrease screening electronnuclear attractions unpaired electrons approach nucleus closely electronnuclear attraction increased
result hunds rule constraints placed way atomic orbitals filled ground state using aufbau principle two electrons occupy orbital subshell orbitals subshell must first contain one electron also electrons filling subshell parallel spin shell starts filling opposite spin electrons first orbital gains second electron result filling atomic orbitals maximum number unpaired electrons hence maximum total spin state assured
example oxygen atom p subshell arranges electrons rather manganese mn atom d electron configuration five unpaired electrons parallel spin corresponding ground state superscript value multiplicity corresponding five unpaired electrons parallel spin accordance hunds rule
atom ground state two incompletely filled subshells close energy lightest example chromium cr atom ds electron configuration six unpaired electrons parallel spin ground state
moleculesedit
although stable molecules closed electron shells unpaired electrons hunds rule applicable important example dioxygen molecule o two degenerate pi bond pi antibonding molecular orbitals occupied two electrons accordance hunds rule ground state triplet oxygen two unpaired electrons singly occupied orbitals singlet oxygen state one doubly occupied one empty excited state different chemical properties greater reactivity ground state
exceptionedit
researchers reported synthesis dehydromxylylene dmx first organic molecule known violate hunds rule
