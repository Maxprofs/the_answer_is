higher heating valueedit
quantity known higher heating value hhv gross energy upper heating value gross calorific value gcv higher calorific value hcv determined bringing products combustion back original precombustion temperature particular condensing vapor produced measurements often use standard temperature c f thermodynamic heat combustion since enthalpy change reaction assumes common temperature compounds combustion case water produced combustion liquid
higher heating value takes account latent heat vaporization water combustion products useful calculating heating values fuels condensation reaction products practical eg gasfired boiler used space heat words hhv assumes water component liquid state end combustion product combustion heat c f put use
lower heating valueedit
quantity known lower heating value lhv net calorific value ncv lower calorific value lcv determined subtracting heat vaporization water vapor higher heating value treats ho formed vapor energy required vaporize water therefore released heat
lhv calculations assume water component combustion process vapor state end combustion opposed higher heating value hhv aka gross calorific value gross cv assumes water combustion process liquid state combustion process
lhv assumes latent heat vaporization water fuel reaction products recovered useful comparing fuels condensation combustion products impractical heat temperature c f cannot put use
one definition lower heating value adopted american petroleum institute api uses reference temperature f c
another definition used gas processors suppliers association gpsa originally used api data collected api research project enthalpy combustion products minus enthalpy fuel reference temperature api research project used c gpsa currently uses f minus enthalpy stoichiometric oxygen o reference temperature minus heat vaporization vapor content combustion products
distinction two second definition assumes combustion products returned reference temperature heat content condensing vapor considered useful easily calculated higher heating value using preceding definition fact give slightly different answer
gross heating valueedit
gross heating value see ar accounts water exhaust leaving vapor includes liquid water fuel prior combustion value important fuels like wood coal usually contain amount water prior burning
note gpsa th edition states gross heating value gas equivalent higher heating value suggests may different standards play use term gross normally describes larger value net usually describes smaller value gpsa consistent equates gross heating value higher heating value gas probably liquid water present net heating value lower heating value

applications burn fuel produce water vapor unused thus wastes heat content applications lower heating value must used give benchmark process
however true energy calculations specific cases higher heating value correct particularly relevant natural gas whose high hydrogen content produces much water burned condensing boilers power plants fluegas condensation condense water vapor produced combustion recovering heat would otherwise wasted

many engine manufacturers rate engine fuel consumption lower heating values american consumers aware corresponding fuelconsumption figure based higher heating value somewhat higher
difference hhv lhv definitions causes endless confusion quoters bother state convention used since typically difference two methods power plant burning natural gas simply benchmarking part reaction lhv may appropriate hhv used overall energy efficiency calculations avoid confusion case value convention clearly stated
accounting moistureedit
hhv lhv expressed terms ar moisture counted mf maf water combustion hydrogen ar mf maf commonly used indicating heating values coal
