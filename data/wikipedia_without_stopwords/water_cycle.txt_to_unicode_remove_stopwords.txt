water cycle also known hydrologic cycle ho cycle describes continuous movement water surface earth mass water earth remains fairly constant time partitioning water major reservoirs ice fresh water saline water atmospheric water variable depending wide range climatic variables water moves one reservoir another river ocean ocean atmosphere physical processes evaporation condensation precipitation infiltration runoff subsurface flow water goes different phases liquid solid ice gas vapor
water cycle involves exchange energy leads temperature changes instance water evaporates takes energy surroundings cools environment condenses releases energy warms environment heat exchanges influence climate
evaporative phase cycle purifies water replenishes land freshwater flow liquid water ice transports minerals across globe also involved reshaping geological features earth processes including erosion sedimentation water cycle also essential maintenance life ecosystems planet

processesedit
precipitation
condensed water vapor falls earths surface precipitation occurs rain also includes snow hail fog drip graupel sleet approximately km cu mi water falls precipitation year km cu mi oceans rain land contains km cu mi water per year snowing km cu mi global precipitation occurs ocean
canopy interception
precipitation intercepted plant foliage eventually evaporates back atmosphere rather falling ground
snowmelt
runoff produced melting snow
runoff
variety ways water moves across land includes surface runoff channel runoff flows water may seep ground evaporate air become stored lakes reservoirs extracted agricultural human uses
infiltration
flow water ground surface ground infiltrated water becomes soil moisture groundwater recent global study using water stable isotopes however shows soil moisture equally available groundwater recharge plant transpiration
subsurface flow
flow water underground vadose zone aquifers subsurface water may return surface eg spring pumped eventually seep oceans water returns land surface lower elevation infiltrated force gravity gravity induced pressures groundwater tends move slowly replenished slowly remain aquifers thousands years
evaporation
transformation water liquid gas phases moves ground bodies water overlying atmosphere source energy evaporation primarily solar radiation evaporation often implicitly includes transpiration plants though together specifically referred evapotranspiration total annual evapotranspiration amounts approximately km cu mi water km cu mi evaporates oceans global evaporation occurs ocean
sublimation
state change directly solid water snow ice water vapor
deposition
refers changing water vapor directly ice
advection
movement water solid liquid vapor states atmosphere without advection water evaporated oceans could precipitate land
condensation
transformation water vapor liquid water droplets air creating clouds fog
transpiration
release water vapor plants soil air water vapor gas cannot seen
percolation
water flows vertically soil rocks influence gravity
plate tectonics
water enters mantle via subduction oceanic crust water returns surface via volcanism
residence timesedit
residence time reservoir within hydrologic cycle average time water molecule spend reservoir see adjacent table measure average age water reservoir
groundwater spend years beneath earths surface leaving particularly old groundwater called fossil water water stored soil remains briefly spread thinly across earth readily lost evaporation transpiration stream flow groundwater recharge evaporating residence time atmosphere days condensing falling earth precipitation
major ice sheets antarctica greenland store ice long periods ice antarctica reliably dated years present though average residence time shorter
hydrology residence times estimated two ways common method relies principle conservation mass assumes amount water given reservoir roughly constant method residence times estimated dividing volume reservoir rate water either enters exits reservoir conceptually equivalent timing long would take reservoir become filled empty water leave long would take reservoir empty full water enter
alternative method estimate residence times gaining popularity dating groundwater use isotopic techniques done subfield isotope hydrology
