existence is commonly held to be that which objectively persists independent of one's presence
ontology is the philosophical study of the nature of being existence or reality in general as well as of the basic categories of being and their relations traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics ontology deals with questions concerning what entities exist or can be said to exist (for instance does the stellar structure udfj-39546284 exist?") and how such entities can be grouped related within a hierarchy and subdivided according to similarities and differences a lively debate continues about the existence of god
epistemology studies criteria of truth defining primary truths inherently accepted in the investigation of knowledge the first is existence it is inherent in every analysis it is self-evident a priori nature cannot be consistently doubted since a person objecting to existence according to some standard of proof must implicitly accept the standard's existence as a premise
materialism holds that the only thing that exists is matter that all things are composed of material and all phenomena (including consciousness) are the result of material interactions
life is a characteristic that distinguishes objects that have self-sustaining biological processes from those that do noteither because such functions have ceased (death) or else because they lack such functions and are classified as inanimate
== etymology ==
the word existence comes from the latin word exsistere meaning to appear to arise to become or to be but literally it means to stand out (ex- being the latin prefix for out added to the causative of the verb stare meaning to stand")
== historical conceptions ==
in the western tradition of philosophy the earliest known comprehensive treatments of the subject are from plato's phaedo republic and statesman and aristotle's metaphysics though earlier fragmentary writing exists aristotle developed a comprehensive theory of being according to which only individual things called substances fully have being but other things such as relations quantity time and place (called the categories) have a derivative kind of being dependent on individual things in aristotle's metaphysics there are four causes of existence or change in nature the material cause the formal cause the efficient cause and the final cause
the neo-platonists and some early christian philosophers argued about whether existence had any reality except in the mind of god some taught that existence was a snare and a delusion that the world the flesh and the devil existed only to tempt weak humankind away from god
the medieval philosopher thomas aquinas argued that god is pure being and that in god essence and existence are the same at about the same time the nominalist philosopher william of ockham argued in book i of his summa totius logicae (treatise on all logic written some time before 1327) that categories are not a form of being in their own right but derivative on the existence of individuals
=== early modern philosophy ===
the early modern treatment of the subject derives from antoine arnauld and pierre nicole's logic or the art of thinking better known as the port-royal logic first published in 1662 arnauld thought that a proposition or judgment consists of taking two different ideas and either putting them together or rejecting them
after conceiving things by our ideas we compare these ideas and finding that some belong together and others do not we unite or separate them this is called affirming or denying and in general judging this judgment is also called a proposition and it is easy to see that it must have two terms one term of which one affirms or denies something is called the subject the other term which is affirmed or denied is called the attribute or praedicatum
the two terms are joined by the verb is (or is not if the predicate is denied of the subject) thus every proposition has three components the two terms and the copula that connects or separates them even when the proposition has only two words the three terms are still there for example god loves humanity really means god is a lover of humanity god exists means god is a thing
this theory of judgment dominated logic for centuries but it has some obvious difficulties it only considers proposition of the form all a are b. a form logicians call universal it does not allow propositions of the form some a are b a form logicians call existential if neither a nor b includes the idea of existence then some a are b simply adjoins a to b conversely if a or b do include the idea of existence in the way that triangle contains the idea three angles equal to two right angles then a exists is automatically true and we have an ontological proof of a's existence (indeed arnauld's contemporary descartes famously argued so regarding the concept god (discourse 4 meditation 5)) arnauld's theory was current until the middle of the nineteenth century
david hume argued that the claim that a thing exists when added to our notion of a thing does not add anything to the concept for example if we form a complete notion of moses and superadd to that notion the claim that moses existed we are not adding anything to the notion of moses
kant also argued that existence is not a real predicate but gave no explanation of how this is possible indeed his famous discussion of the subject is merely a restatement of arnauld's doctrine that in the proposition god is omnipotent the verb is signifies the joining or separating of two concepts such as god and omnipotence
schopenhauer claimed that everything that exists for knowledge and hence the whole of this world is only object in relation to the subject perception of the perceiver in a word representation according to him there can be no object without subject because everything objective is already conditioned as such in manifold ways by the knowing subject with the forms of its knowing and presupposes these forms
== predicative nature ==
john stuart mill (and also kant's pupil herbart) argued that the predicative nature of existence was proved by sentences like a centaur is a poetic fiction or a greatest number is impossible (herbart) franz brentano challenged this so also (as is better known) did frege brentano argued that we can join the concept represented by a noun phrase an a to the concept represented by an adjective b to give the concept represented by the noun phrase a b-a for example we can join a man to wise to give a wise man but the noun phrase a wise man is not a sentence whereas some man is wise is a sentence hence the copula must do more than merely join or separate concepts furthermore adding exists to a wise man to give the complete sentence a wise man exists has the same effect as joining some man to wise using the copula so the copula has the same effect as exists brentano argued that every categorical proposition can be translated into an existential one without change in meaning and that the exists and does not exist of the existential proposition take the place of the copula he showed this by the following examples
the categorical proposition some man is sick has the same meaning as the existential proposition a sick man exists or there is a sick man
the categorical proposition no stone is living has the same meaning as the existential proposition a living stone does not exist or there is no living stone
the categorical proposition all men are mortal has the same meaning as the existential proposition an immortal man does not exist or there is no immortal man
the categorical proposition some man is not learned has the same meaning as the existential proposition a non-learned man exists or there is a non-learned man
frege developed a similar view (though later) in his great work the foundations of arithmetic as did charles sanders peirce (but peirce held that the possible and the real are not limited to the actually individually existent) the frege-brentano view is the basis of the dominant position in modern anglo-american philosophy that existence is asserted by the existential quantifier (as expressed by quine's slogan to be is to be the value of a variable. on what there is 1948)
=== semantics ===
in mathematical logic there are two quantifiers some and all though as brentano (18381917) pointed out we can make do with just one quantifier and negation the first of these quantifiers some is also expressed as there exists thus in the sentence there exists a man the term man is asserted to be part of existence but we can also assert there exists a triangle. is a triangle an abstract idea part of existence in the same way that a man a physical body is part of existence do abstractions such as goodness blindness and virtue exist in the same sense that chairs tables and houses exist what categories or kinds of thing can be the subject or the predicate of a proposition
worse does existence exist
in some statements existence is implied without being mentioned the statement a bridge crosses the thames at hammersmith cannot just be about a bridge the thames and hammersmith it must be about existence as well on the other hand the statement a bridge crosses the styx at limbo has the same form but while in the first case we understand a real bridge in the real world made of stone or brick what existence would mean in the second case is less clear
the nominalist approach is to argue that certain noun phrases can be eliminated by rewriting a sentence in a form that has the same meaning but does not contain the noun phrase thus ockham argued that socrates has wisdom which apparently asserts the existence of a reference for wisdom can be rewritten as socrates is wise which contains only the referring phrase socrates this method became widely accepted in the twentieth century by the analytic school of philosophy
however this argument may be inverted by realists in arguing that since the sentence socrates is wise can be rewritten as socrates has wisdom this proves the existence of a hidden referent for wise
a further problem is that human beings seem to process information about fictional characters in much the same way that they process information about real people for example in the 2008 united states presidential election a politician and actor named fred thompson ran for the republican party nomination in polls potential voters identified fred thompson as a law and order candidate thompson plays a fictional character on the television series law and order doubtless the people who make the comment are aware that law and order is fiction but at some level they process fiction as if it were fact another example of this is the common experience of actresses who play the villain in a soap opera being accosted in public as if they are to blame for the actions of the characters they play
a scientist might make a clear distinction about objects that exist and assert that all objects that exist are made up of either matter or energy but in the layperson's worldview existence includes real fictional and even contradictory objects thus if we reason from the statement pegasus flies to the statement pegasus exists we are not asserting that pegasus is made up of atoms but rather that pegasus exists in a particular worldview the worldview of classical myth when a mathematician reasons from the statement abc is a triangle to the statement triangles exist she is not asserting that triangles are made up of atoms but rather that triangles exist within a particular mathematical model
== modern approaches ==
according to bertrand russell's theory of descriptions the negation operator in a singular sentence can take either wide or narrow scope we distinguish between some s is not p (where negation takes narrow scope") and it is not the case that some s is p (where negation takes wide scope") the problem with this view is that there appears to be no such scope distinction in the case of proper names the sentences socrates is not bald and it is not the case that socrates is bald both appear to have the same meaning and they both appear to assert or presuppose the existence of someone (socrates) who is not bald so that negation takes narrow scope however russell's theory analyses proper names into a logical structure which makes sense of this problem according to russell socrates can be analysed into the form the philosopher of greece. in the wide scope this would then read it is not the case that there existed a philosopher of greece who was bald in the narrow scope it would read the philosopher of greece was not bald
according to the direct-reference view an early version of which was originally proposed by bertrand russell and perhaps earlier by gottlob frege a proper name strictly has no meaning when there is no object to which it refers this view relies on the argument that the semantic function of a proper name is to tell us which object bears the name and thus to identify some object but no object can be identified if none exists thus a proper name must have a bearer if it is to be meaningful
=== existence in the wide and narrow senses ===
according to the two sense view of existence which derives from alexius meinong existential statements fall into two classes
those asserting existence in a wide sense these are typically of the form n is p for singular n or some s is p
those asserting existence in a narrow sense these are typically of the form n exists or ss exist
the problem is then evaded as follows pegasus flies implies existence in the wide sense for it implies that something flies but it does not imply existence in the narrow sense for we deny existence in this sense by saying that pegasus does not exist in effect the world of all things divides on this view into those (like socrates the planet venus and new york city) that have existence in the narrow sense and those (like sherlock holmes the goddess venus and minas tirith) that do not
however common sense suggests the non-existence of such things as fictional characters or places
=== european views ===
influenced by the views of brentano's pupil alexius meinong and by edmund husserl germanophone and francophone philosophy took a different direction regarding the question of existence
=== anti-realist arguments ===
anti-realism is the view of idealists who are skeptics about the physical world maintaining either 1) that nothing exists outside the mind or 2) that we would have no access to a mind-independent reality even if it may exist realists in contrast hold that perceptions or sense data are caused by mind-independent objects an anti-realist who denies that other minds exist (i e. a solipsist) is different from an anti-realist who claims that there is no fact of the matter as to whether or not there are unobservable other minds (i e. a logical behaviorist)
== dharmic middle way view ==
the indian philosopher nagarjuna (c 150 250 ce) largely advanced existence concepts and founded the madhyamaka school of mahyna buddhism
in eastern philosophy anicca (sanskrit anitya) or impermanence describes existence it refers to the fact that all conditioned things (sankhara) are in a constant state of flux in reality there is no thing that ultimately ceases to exist only the appearance of a thing ceases as it changes from one form to another imagine a leaf that falls to the ground and decomposes while the appearance and relative existence of the leaf ceases the components that formed the leaf become particulate material that goes on to form new plants buddhism teaches a middle way avoiding the extreme views of eternalism and nihilism the middle way recognizes there are vast differences between the way things are perceived to exist and the way things really exist the differences are reconciled in the concept of shunyata by addressing the existing object's served purpose for the subject's identity in being what exists is in non-existence because the subject changes
trailokya elaborates on three kinds of existence those of desire form and formlessness in which there are karmic rebirths taken further to the trikaya doctrine it describes how the buddha exists in this philosophy it is accepted that the buddha exists in more than one absolute way
