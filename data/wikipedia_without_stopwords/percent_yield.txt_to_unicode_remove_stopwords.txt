chemistry yield also referred reaction yield amount product obtained chemical reaction absolute yield given weight grams moles molar yield percentage yield fractional yield relative yield serves measure effectiveness synthetic procedure calculated dividing amount desired product obtained theoretical yield unit measure must
theoretical yield amount predicted stoichiometric calculation based number moles reactants present calculation assumes one reaction occurs limiting reactant reacts completely however actual yield often smaller percent yield less several reasons
many reactions incomplete reactants completely converted products reverse reaction occurs final state contains reactants products state chemical equilibrium
two reactions may occur simultaneously reactant converted undesired byproducts
losses occur separation purification desired product reaction mixture
impurities present react
ideal theoretical yield chemical reaction would according vogels textbook practical organic chemistry yields around called quantitative yields called excellent yields good yields good yields fair yields called poor however noted names arbitrary universally accepted many reactions expectations may unrealistically high yields may appear products impure measured weight product include weight impurities purification steps always lower yield reported yields usually refer yield final purified product
one reactant participates reaction yield usually calculated based amount limiting reactant whose amount less stoichiometrically equivalent equivalent amounts reactants present reagents present amounts greater required react limiting reagent present considered excess result yield automatically taken measure reaction efficiency
