in physics particularly in quantum physics a system observable is a measurable operator or gauge where the property of the system state can be determined by some sequence of physical operations for example these operations might involve submitting the system to various electromagnetic fields and eventually reading a value in systems governed by classical mechanics any experimentally observable value can be shown to be given by a real-valued function on the set of all possible system states
physically meaningful observables must also satisfy transformation laws which relate observations performed by different observers in different frames of reference these transformation laws are automorphisms of the state space that is bijective transformations which preserve some mathematical property
== quantum mechanics ==
in quantum physics the relation between system state and the value of an observable requires some basic linear algebra for its description in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics states are given by non-zero vectors in a hilbert space v (where two vectors are considered to specify the same state if and only if they are scalar multiples of each other) and observables are given by self-adjoint operators on v however as indicated below not every self-adjoint operator corresponds to a physically meaningful observable for the case of a system of particles the space v consists of functions called wave functions or state vectors
in the case of transformation laws in quantum mechanics the requisite automorphisms are unitary (or antiunitary) linear transformations of the hilbert space v under galilean relativity or special relativity the mathematics of frames of reference is particularly simple and in fact restricts considerably the set of physically meaningful observables
in quantum mechanics measurement of observables exhibits some seemingly unintuitive properties specifically if a system is in a state described by a vector in a hilbert space the measurement process affects the state in a non-deterministic but statistically predictable way in particular after a measurement is applied the state description by a single vector may be destroyed being replaced by a statistical ensemble the irreversible nature of measurement operations in quantum physics is sometimes referred to as the measurement problem and is described mathematically by quantum operations by the structure of quantum operations this description is mathematically equivalent to that offered by relative state interpretation where the original system is regarded as a subsystem of a larger system and the state of the original system is given by the partial trace of the state of the larger system
in quantum mechanics each dynamical variable (e.g position translational momentum orbital angular momentum spin total angular momentum energy etc.) is associated with a hermitian operator that acts on the state of the quantum system and whose eigenvalues correspond to the possible values of the dynamical variable for example suppose is an eigenket (eigenvector) of the observable  with eigenvalue  and exists in a d-dimensional hilbert space then
=
this eigenket equation says that if a measurement of the observable is made while the system of interest is in the state  then the observed value of that particular measurement must return the eigenvalue with certainty however if the system of interest is in the general state  then the eigenvalue is returned with probability (born rule) one must note that the above definition is somewhat dependent upon our convention of choosing real numbers to represent real physical quantities indeed just because dynamical variables are real and not unreal in the metaphysical sense does not mean that they must correspond to real numbers in the mathematical sense
to be more precise the dynamical variable/observable is a (not necessarily bounded) hermitian operator in a hilbert space and thus is represented by a hermitian matrix if the space is finite-dimensional in an infinite-dimensional hilbert space the observable is represented by a symmetric operator which may not be defined everywhere (i.e its domain is not the whole space - there exist some states that are not in the domain of the operator) the reason for such a change is that in an infinite-dimensional hilbert space the operator becomes unbounded which means that it no longer has a largest eigenvalue this is not the case in a finite-dimensional hilbert space where every operator is bounded - it has a largest eigenvalue for example if we consider the position of a point particle moving along a line this particle's position variable can take on any number on the real-line which is uncountably infinite since the eigenvalue of an observable represents a real physical quantity for that particular dynamical variable then we must conclude that there is no largest eigenvalue for the position observable in this uncountably infinite-dimensional hilbert space since the field we're working over consists of the real-line nonetheless whether we are working in an infinite-dimensional or finite-dimensional hilbert space the role of an observable in quantum mechanics is to assign real numbers to outcomes of particular measurements this means that only certain measurements can determine the value of an observable for some state of a quantum system in classical mechanics any measurement can be made to determine the value of an observable
== incompatibility of observables in quantum mechanics ==
a crucial difference between classical quantities and quantum mechanical observables is that the latter may not be simultaneously measurable this is mathematically expressed by non-commutativity of the corresponding operators to the effect that
this inequality expresses a dependence of measurement results on the order in which measurements of observables and are performed observables corresponding to non-commutative operators are called incompatible
