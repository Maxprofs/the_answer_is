communication general takes place inside three main subject categories human beings living organisms general communicationenabled devices example sensor networks control systems communication category living organisms studied field biosemiotics usually occurs visual auditory biochemical means human communication unique extensive use language
nonverbal communicationedit
nonverbal communication describes process conveying meaning form nonword messages examples nonverbal communication include haptic communication chronemic communication gestures body language facial expression eye contact one dresses speech also contains nonverbal elements known paralanguage eg rhythm intonation tempo stress may even pheromone component research shown human communication may occur nonverbal facial expressions paralanguage affects communication subconscious level establishes trust likewise written texts include nonverbal elements handwriting style spatial arrangement words use emoticons convey emotion
nonverbal communication demonstrates one wazlawicks laws cannot communicate proximity formed awareness living creatures begin interpreting signals received functions nonverbal communication humans complement illustrate reinforce emphasize replace substitute control regulate contradict denotative message
verbal communicationedit
effective verbal spoken communication dependent number factors cannot fully isolated important interpersonal skills nonverbal communication listening skills clarification human language defined system symbols sometimes known lexemes grammars rules symbols manipulated word language also refers common properties languages language learning normally occurs intensively human childhood thousands human languages use patterns sound gesture symbols enable communication others around languages tend share certain properties although exceptions defined line language dialect constructed languages esperanto programming languages various mathematical formalism necessarily restricted properties shared human languages communication twoway process merely oneway
effective communication process
use standard terminology communicating information request provide clarification needed ensure statements direct unambiguous inform appropriate individuals mission plans change communicate information needed individuals teams external team use nonverbal communication appropriately use proper order communicating information formal englishspeaking groups
written communication historical developmentedit
time forms ideas communication evolved continuing progression technology advances include communications psychology media psychology emerging field study
progression written communication divided three information communication revolutions
written communication first emerged use pictographs pictograms made stone hence written communication yet mobile pictograms began develop standardized simplified forms
next step occurred writing began appear paper papyrus clay wax media common shared writing systems leading adaptable alphabets communication became mobile
final stage characterized transfer information controlled waves electromagnetic radiation ie radio microwave infrared electronic signals
communication thus process meaning assigned conveyed attempt create shared understanding gregory bateson called replication tautologies universe process requires vast repertoire skills interpersonal processing listening observing speaking questioning analyzing gestures evaluating enables collaboration cooperation
misunderstandings anticipated solved formulations questions answers paraphrasing examples stories strategic talk written communication clarified planning followup talks critical written communication part everyday way business minutes spent talking present save valuable time later avoiding misunderstandings advance frequent method purpose reiterating one heard ones words asking person really meant paraphrasing
business communicationedit
business communications term wide variety activities including limited strategic communications planning media relations public relations include social media broadcast written communications brand management reputation management speechwriting customerclient relations internalemployee communications
companies limited resources may choose engage activities larger organizations may employ full spectrum communications since difficult develop broad range skills communications professionals often specialize one two areas usually least working knowledge far important qualifications communications professionals possess excellent writing ability good people skills capacity think critically strategically
barriers effective human communicationedit
barriers effective communication retard distort message intention message conveyed may result failure communication process effect undesirable include filtering selective perception information overload emotions language silence communication apprehension gender differences political correctness
also includes lack expressing knowledgeappropriate communication occurs person uses ambiguous complex legal words medical jargon descriptions situation environment understood recipient
physical barriers physical barriers often due nature environment example natural barrier exists staff located different buildings different sites likewise poor outdated equipment particularly failure management introduce new technology may also cause problems staff shortages another factor frequently causes communication difficulties organization
system design system design faults refer problems structures systems place organization examples might include organizational structure unclear therefore makes confusing know communicate examples could inefficient inappropriate information systems lack supervision training lack clarity roles responsibilities lead staff uncertain expected
attitudinal barriers attitudinal barriers come result problems staff organization may brought example factors poor management lack consultation employees personality conflicts result people delaying refusing communicate personal attitudes individual employees may due lack motivation dissatisfaction work brought insufficient training enable carry particular tasks simply resistance change due entrenched attitudes ideas
ambiguity wordsphrases words sounding different meaning convey different meaning altogether hence communicator must ensure receiver receives meaning better words avoided using alternatives whenever possible
individual linguistic ability use jargon difficult inappropriate words communication prevent recipients understanding message poorly explained misunderstood messages also result confusion however research communication shown confusion lend legitimacy research persuasion fails
physiological barriers may result individuals personal discomfort causedfor exampleby ill health poor eyesight hearing difficulties
cultural differences may result cultural differences communities around world within individual country tribalregional differences dialects etc religious groups organisations organisational level companies teams units may different expectations norms idiolects families family groups may also experience effect cultural barriers communication within different family members groups example words colours symbols different meanings different cultures parts world nodding head means agreement shaking head means except parts world
bypassing happens communicators sender receiver attach symbolic meanings words sender expressing thought word receiver take different meaning example asap rest room
fear criticized major factor prevents good communication exercise simple practices improve communication skill become effective communicators example read article newspaper collect news television present front mirror boost confidence also improve language vocabulary
communication high achieversedit
daily life see people good field want discuss something hold self back fear getting neglected think good enough discuss something kind behavior mostly turns harmful get knowledge dont indeed knowledge also connections high profile peoples lead us many opportunities
benefits contacts high achieversin era connection high profile peoples important making connections high profile peoples area great way learn grow communicating high achievers one know important harmful respective field also someone talks leader achiever provides positive energy inspires one like
interact contact high profile people still question ask biggest thing stops someone fear energized presentation good time approach positive energy helps get past fear high profile person gives talk also energetic involved listeners great time contact whenever get chance communicate high achiever try waste time ask straight questions much time time connect leader try end conversation way contact
want interaction says want talk well case try positive instead thinking important may want talk personal issues like busy something overwhelmed even dont want talk anyone focused end also people like also want communicate others comfort

broad field animal communication encompasses issues ethology animal communication defined behavior one animal affects current future behavior another animal study animal communication called zoo semiotics distinguishable anthroposemiotics study human communication played important part development ethology sociobiology study animal cognition animal communication indeed understanding animal world general rapidly growing field even st century far great share prior understanding related diverse fields personal symbolic name use animal emotions animal culture learning even sexual conduct long thought well understood revolutionized
plants fungiedit
communication observed within plant organism ie within plant cells plant cells plants related species plants nonplant organisms especially root zone plant roots communicate rhizome bacteria fungi insects within soil interactions governed syntactic pragmatic semantic rules possible decentralized nervous system plants original meaning word neuron greek vegetable fiber recent research shown microorganism plant communication processes neuronlike plants also communicate via volatiles exposed herbivory attack behavior thus warning neighboring plants parallel produce volatiles attract parasites attack herbivores stress situations plants overwrite genomes inherited parents revert grand greatgrandparents
fungi communicate coordinate organize growth development formation marcelia fruiting bodies fungi communicate related species well non fungal organisms great variety symbiotic interactions especially bacteria unicellular eukaryote plants insects biochemicals biotic origin biochemicals trigger fungal organism react specific manner chemical molecules part biotic messages trigger fungal organism react implies fungal organisms differentiate molecules taking part biotic messages similar molecules irrelevant situation far five different primary signalling molecules known coordinate different behavioral patterns filamentation mating growth pathogenicity behavioral coordination production signaling substances achieved interpretation processes enables organism differ self nonself biotic indicator biotic message similar related nonrelated species even filter noise ie similar molecules without biotic content
bacteria quorum sensingedit
communication tool used humans plants animals also used microorganisms like bacteria process called quorum sensing quorum sensing bacteria able sense density cells regulate gene expression accordingly seen gram positive gram negative bacteria first observed fuqua et al marine microorganisms like v harveyi v fischeri
models communicationedit
first major model communication introduced claude shannon warren weaver bell laboratories original model designed mirror functioning radio telephone technologies initial model consisted three primary parts sender channel receiver sender part telephone person spoke channel telephone receiver part phone one could hear person shannon weaver also recognized often static interferes one listening telephone conversation deemed noise
simple model often referred transmission model standard view communication information content eg message natural language sent form spoken language emisor sender encoder destination receiver decoder common conception communication simply views communication means sending receiving information strengths model simplicity generality quantifiability claude shannon warren weaver structured model based following elements
information source produces message
transmitter encodes message signals
channel signals adapted transmission
noise source distorts signal propagates channel
receiver decodes reconstructs message signal
destination message arrives
shannon weaver argued three levels problems communication within theory
technical problem accurately message transmitted
semantic problem precisely meaning conveyed
effectiveness problem effectively received meaning affect behavior
daniel chandler critiques transmission model stating
assumes communicators isolated individuals
allowance differing purposes
allowance differing interpretations
allowance unequal power relations
allowance situational contexts
david berlo expanded shannon weavers linear model communication created smcr model communication sendermessagechannelreceiver model communication separated model clear parts expanded upon scholars
communication usually described along major dimensions message type things communicated source emisor sender encoder form form channel medium destination receiver target decoder receiver wilbur schram also indicated also examine impact message desired undesired target message parties communication includes acts confer knowledge experiences give advice commands ask questions acts may take many forms one various manners communication form depends abilities group communicating together communication content form make messages sent towards destination target oneself another person another entity corporation group beings
communication seen processes information transmission governed three levels semiotic rules
pragmatic concerned relations signsexpressions users
semantic study relationships signs symbols represent
syntactic formal properties signs symbols
therefore communication social interaction least two interacting agents share common set signs common set semiotic rules commonly held rule sense ignores autocommunication including intrapersonal communication via diaries selftalk secondary phenomena followed primary acquisition communicative competences within social interactions
light weaknesses barnlund proposed transactional model communication basic premise transactional model communication individuals simultaneously engaging sending receiving messages
slightly complex form sender receiver linked reciprocally second attitude communication referred constitutive model constructionist view focuses individual communicates determining factor way message interpreted communication viewed conduit passage information travels one individual another information becomes separate communication particular instance communication called speech act senders personal filters receivers personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions cultures gender may alter intended meaning message contents presence communication noise transmission channel air case reception decoding content may faulty thus speech act may achieve desired effect one problem encodetransmitreceivedecode model processes encoding decoding imply sender receiver possess something functions codebook two code books least similar identical although something like code books implied model nowhere represented model creates many conceptual difficulties
theories coregulation describe communication creative dynamic continuous process rather discrete exchange information canadian media scholar harold innis theory people use different types media communicate one choose use offer different possibilities shape durability society wark mckenzie famous example using ancient egypt looking ways built media different properties stone papyrus papyrus called space binding made possible transmission written orders across space empires enables waging distant military campaigns colonial administration stone time binding construction temples pyramids sustain authority generation generation media change shape communication society wark mckenzie
noiseedit
communication model noise interference decoding messages sent channel encoder many examples noise
environmental noise noise physically disrupts communication standing next loud speakers party noise construction site next classroom making difficult hear professor
physiologicalimpairment noise physical maladies prevent effective communication actual deafness blindness preventing messages received intended
semantic noise different interpretations meanings certain words example word weed interpreted undesirable plant yard euphemism marijuana
syntactical noise mistakes grammar disrupt communication abrupt changes verb tense sentence
organizational noise poorly structured communication prevent receiver accurate interpretation example unclear badly stated directions make receiver even lost
cultural noise stereotypical assumptions cause misunderstandings unintentionally offending nonchristian person wishing merry christmas
psychological noise certain attitudes also make communication difficult instance great anger sadness may cause someone lose focus present moment disorders autism may also severely hamper effective communication
