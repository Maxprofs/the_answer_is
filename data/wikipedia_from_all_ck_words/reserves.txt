a professor informally often known as full professor is the highest academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries literally professor derives from latin as a person who professes being usually an expert in arts or sciences a teacher of the highest rank in some countries the word professor is also used in titles of lower ranks such as associate professor and assistant professor
professors conduct original research and commonly teach undergraduate graduate and/or professional courses in their field of expertise in universities with graduate schools professors may mentor and supervise graduate students who are conducting research for a thesis or dissertation professors typically hold a ph.d. another doctorate or a different terminal degree some professors hold a master's degree or a professional degree such as an md as their highest degree
== descriptionedit ==
a professor is an accomplished and recognized academic in most commonwealth nations as well as northern europe the title professor is reserved only for the highest academic rank at a university in the united states and canada the title of professor is granted to a larger percentage about a quarter of scholars with doctorate degrees (typically ph.d degrees) or equivalent qualifications who teach in four-year colleges and universities and is used in the titles assistant professor and associate professor which are not considered professor-level positions in many other countries as well as for full professors in australia the title associate professor is used in place of reader ranking above senior lecturer and below full professor and being of comparable rank to full professors in north america
beyond holding the proper academic title universities in many countries also give notable artists athletes and foreign dignitaries the title honorary professor even if these persons do not have the academic qualifications typically necessary for professorship however such professors usually do not undertake academic work for the granting institution in general the title of professor is strictly used for academic positions rather than for those holding it on honorary basis
== tasksedit ==
professors are qualified experts in their field who generally perform the following tasks
managing teaching research and publications in their departments (in countries where a professor is head of a department)
conducting lectures and seminars in their specialties (i.e. they profess") such as the fields of mathematics science humanities social sciences education literature music or the applied fields of engineering design medicine law or business
performing and leading advanced research in their fields
providing pro bono community service including consulting functions (such as advising government and nonprofit organizations) or providing expert commentary on tv or radio news or public affairs programs
teaching campus-based or online courses adopting instructional technology
mentoring graduate students in their academic training
conducting administrative or managerial functions usually at a high level (e.g deans heads of departments librarians etc.) and
assessing students in their fields of expertise (e.g. through examinations or viva voce defenses)
courses are often taught by adjunct instructors with advanced degrees such as a masters or doctorate adjunct instructors are often not involved in program design accreditation reports or many of the other duties that fall within the purview of tenured or more senior faculty members but they offer a university a flexible labor pool tenured professors also offer courses online
other roles of professorial tasks depend on the institution its legacy protocols place (country) and time for example professors at research-oriented universities in north america and generally at european universities are promoted primarily on the basis of research achievements and external fund-raising success depending on the professor's professional status expertise and tenure he or she may also serve as a public intellectual offering opinions to media and in other forums on current events controversies and other complex matters that may require erudite illumination
== tenureedit ==
a tenured professor has an appointment that lasts until retirement age except for dismissal with due cause. a common justification for existence of such a privileged position is the principle of academic freedom which holds that it is beneficial for state society and academy in the long run if scholars are free to examine hold and advance controversial views without fear of dismissal from their jobs
some have argued that modern tenure systems actually diminish academic freedom forcing those seeking tenured positions to profess conformance to the same views (political and academic) as those awarding the tenured professorships according to physicist lee smolin ...it is practically career suicide for a young theoretical physicist not to join the field [of string theory]. however in institutions without tenure systems academic freedom and the ability to espouse non-conformist views are afforded no protections tenure has enabled some academics such as the american professor noam chomsky to espouse controversial positions

== historical islamic usageedit ==
in muslim civilisation the chair was designated by the caliph himself mostly through recommendation the caliph made appointments to a professorial chair (kursi in arabic) in a jami (university or congregational madrasah) such was the case of ibn aqil (died 1119 ce) who was appointed to a well-known chair in jami al-mansur (baghdad) becoming the main teacher of the madrasah in other cases a scholar could be appointed to two chairs at the same time holding a chair in one jami and simultaneously holding another in another jami or in one of the exclusive institutions
this is the case of particularly distinguished and popular scholars for example a certain ibn al-banna (d 1079) had a chair in jami al-mansur (baghdad) located in the centre of the riwaq (nave of the mosque) while simultaneously holding another in jami al-qasr (also baghdad) around the maqsura (a separate room inside the mosque) some chairs were also known by the discipline they represented as for instance the chair or study-circle of the traditionalists (halqat ahl al-hadith) and that of the grammarians (halqat al-nahwiyin) others were known by the name of the family whose members occupied it in succession as for instance the chair of the barmakids (halqat al-barmika) sometimes institutions were specialised in particular study and therefore received a corresponding chair e.g the nizamiya did not have a chair of islamic theology but only a chair of islamic law
as to tenure of the chair once a professor was appointed by the caliph to a chair in one of the main madrasahs (jamii) he ordinarily held it for the remainder of his lifetime cases of lengthy tenure are often reported by biographers for example abu all al-kattani (d 1061) who was in his eighties when he died had occupied his chair for 50 years according to george makdisi and hugh goddard the fact that we still talk of professors holding the chair of their subject is based on the traditional islamic pattern of teaching where the professor sits on a chair and the students sit around him and the term academic circles derives from the way islamic students sat in a circle around their professor. the term professor itself is believed a translation of the arabic term mufti which meant professor of legal opinions.

== in fictionedit ==
traditionally as portrayed in fiction in accordance with a stereotype professors are often depicted as being shy and absent-minded obvious examples include the 1961 movie the absent-minded professor or professor calculus who features in the adventures of tintin stories professors have also been portrayed as being misguided such as professor metz who helped the villain blofeld in the james bond film diamonds are forever or simply evil like professor moriarty who is the archenemy of sherlock holmes the animated series futurama has a typical absent-minded but genius-level professor named professor hubert farnsworth (see also mad scientist.) vladimir nabokov author and professor of english at cornell frequently used professors as the protagonists in his novels professor henry higgins is also a main character in my fair lady in the popular harry potter series a few students are the most important characters but all their magic and wizarding teachers are known as professors who play many important parts in the board game cluedo professor plum has been depicted as absent-minded in the movie clue professor plum was a psychologist who had an affair with one of his patients he was played by christopher lloyd
in more recent times various stereotypes were being re-evaluated and professors are one of them the mainstream literature began to realize that many professors are just normal human beings and might be quite well-rounded in abilities excelling both in intelligence and in action an example of a fictional professor not depicted as shy or absent-minded is indiana jones a professor as well as an archeologist-adventurer the airing of indiana jones movie franchise had a significant impact on the previous stereotype and created a new archetype which is both deeply knowledgeable and physically capable the character generally referred to simply as the professor on the television series gilligan's island although described alternatively as a high-school science teacher or research scientist is depicted as a sensible advisor a clever inventor and a helpful friend to his fellow castaways john houseman's portrayal of law school professor charles w kingsfield jr. in the paper chase (1973) remains the epitome of the strict authoritarian professor who demands perfection from students
mysterious older men with magical powers (and unclear academic standing) are sometimes given the title of professor in literature and theater notable examples include professor marvel in the wizard of oz and professor drosselmeyer (as he is sometimes known) from the ballet the nutcracker also the magician played by christian bale in the film the prestige adopts the professor as his stage name a variation of this type of non-academic professor is the crackpot inventor, as portrayed by professor potts in the film version of chitty chitty bang bang or the jerry lewis-inspired professor frink character on the simpsons other professors of this type are the thoughtful and kind professor digory kirke of c.s lewis chronicles of narnia
the title has been used by comedians such as professor irwin corey and soupy sales in his role as the big professor. in the past pianists in saloons and other rough environments have been called professor. the puppeteer of a punch and judy show is also traditionally known as a professor.
the stereotype of a professor as an aloof individual with a narrow range of intense interests led hans asperger to call children with asperger's syndrome little professors.
