juice is a liquid (drink) that is naturally contained in fruit and vegetables it can also refer to liquids that are flavored with these or other biological food sources such as meat and seafood it is commonly consumed as a beverage or used as an ingredient or flavoring in foods it is also a common practice to mix juices of different fruits/vegetables juice did not emerge as a popular beverage choice until the development of pasteurization methods allowed for the preservation of juice without fermentation the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao) estimated the total world production of citrus fruit juices to be 12,840,318 tonnes in 2012
== preparation ==
juice is prepared by mechanically squeezing or macerating (sometimes referred to as cold pressed) fruit or vegetable flesh without the application of heat or solvents for example orange juice is the liquid extract of the fruit of the orange tree and tomato juice is the liquid that results from pressing the fruit of the tomato plant juice may be prepared in the home from fresh fruit and vegetables using a variety of hand or electric juicers
many commercial juices are filtered to remove fiber or pulp but high-pulp fresh orange juice is a popular beverage
common methods for preservation and processing of fruit juices include canning pasteurization concentrating freezing evaporation and spray drying
although processing methods vary between juices the general processing method of juices includes
washing and sorting
juice extraction
straining filtration and clarification
blending pasteurisation
filling sealing and sterilization
cooling labeling and packing
after the fruits are picked and washed the juice is extracted by one of two automated methods in the first method two metal cups with sharp metal tubes on the bottom cup come together removing the peel and forcing the flesh of the fruit through the metal tube the juice of the fruit then escapes through small holes in the tube the peels can then be used further and are washed to remove oils which are reclaimed later for usage the second method requires the fruits to be cut in half before being subjected to reamers which extract the juice
after the juice is filtered it may be concentrated which reduces the size of juice by a factor of 5 making it easier to transport and increasing its expiration date juices are concentrated by heating under a vacuum to remove water and then cooling to around 13 degrees celsius about two thirds of the water in a juice is removed the juice is then later reconstituted in which the concentrate is mixed with water and other factors to return any lost flavor from the concentrating process juices can also be sold in a concentrated state in which the consumer adds water to the concentrated juice as preparation
juices are then pasteurized and filled into containers often while still hot if the juice is poured into a container while hot it is cooled as quickly as possible packages that cannot stand heat require sterile conditions for filling chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide can be used to sterilize containers plants can make anywhere from 1 to 20 tonnes a day
== terminology ==
in the united kingdom the name or names of the fruit followed by juice can only legally be used to describe a product which is 100% fruit juice as required by the fruit juices and fruit nectars (england) regulations and the fruit juices & fruit nectars (scotland) regulations 2003 however a juice made by reconstituting concentrate can be called juice a product described as fruit nectar must contain at least 25% to 50% juice depending on the fruit a juice or nectar including concentrate must state that it does the term juice drink is not defined in the regulations and can be used to describe any drink which includes juice however little comparable rules apply in all eu member states in their respective languages
in the us fruit juice can only legally be used to describe a product which is 100% fruit juice a blend of fruit juice(s) with other ingredients such as high-fructose corn syrup is called a juice cocktail or juice drink according to the food and drug administration (fda) the term nectar is generally accepted in the us and in international trade for a diluted juice to denote a beverage that contains fruit juice or puree water and which may contain artificial sweeteners
no added sugar is commonly printed on labels of juice containers but the products may contain large amounts of naturally occurring sugars however sugar content is listed with other carbohydrates on labels in many countries
== health effects ==
juices are often consumed for their perceived health benefits for example orange juice is rich in vitamin c folic acid potassium is an excellent source of bioavailable antioxidant phytochemicals and significantly improves blood lipid profiles in people affected with hypercholesterolemia prune juice is associated with a digestive health benefit cranberry juice has long been known to help prevent or even treat bladder infections and it is now known that a substance in cranberries prevents bacteria from binding to the bladder
many fruit juices have a higher sugar (fructose) content than sweetened soft drinks e.g. typical grape juice has 50% more sugar than coca-cola while soft drinks (e.g coca-cola) cause oxidative stress when ingested and may even lead to insulin resistance in the long term the same thing cannot be attributed to fruit juices on the contrary fruit juices are actually known for their ability to raise serum antioxidant capacity and even offset the oxidative stress and inflammation normally caused by high-fat and high-sugar meals however frequent consumption of fruits and fruit juice causes dental decay and may be a more significant factor in the development of dental caries (cavities) than eating candy fruit juice causes dental decay because it naturally contains acids which chemically dissolve the enamel off the surface of the tooth and sugars that the bacteria in the mouth ferment to create even more tooth-destroying acids
fruit juice consumption overall in europe australia new zealand and the us has increased in recent years probably due to public perception of juices as a healthy natural source of nutrients and increased public interest in health issues indeed fruit juice intake has been consistently associated with reduced risk of many cancer types might be protective against stroke and delay the onset of alzheimer's disease
some fruit juices have filtered out the dietary fiber present in the fruit in other cases other ingredients are added high-fructose corn syrup an ingredient in many juice cocktails has been linked to the increased incidence of type ii diabetes high consumption of juice is also linked to weight gain in some studies but not in others in a controlled clinical study regular consumption of grape juice for 12 weeks did not cause any weight gain in volunteers but consumption of a soft drink did fruit juice in moderate amounts can help children and adults meet daily recommendations for fruit consumption nutrient intake and calories
the american academy of pediatrics says that fruit juice should not be given to infants before 6 months of age for children ages 1 to 6 intake of fruit juice should be limited to 4 to 6 ounces per day (about a half to three-quarters of a cup) giving children excessive juice can lead to poor nutrition diarrhea gas abdominal pain bloating and tooth decay
juice cleanses have become a popular diet the key concept of juice cleanses detoxification bases on the assertion that by consuming only nutrient rich substances (juice) and eliminating dairy wheat gluten and fermented foods the body can better heal physical problems a juice cleanse requires the consumption of nothing except for juice for multiple days with proposed health benefits including reduction in appetite rest for the stomach and liver elimination of harmful foods flooding the body with super nutrition weight loss energy improvement re-hydration detoxification and cell healing unlike most diets juice cleanses do not last for extended periods usually ending in less than a week
== juice bars ==
a juice bar is an establishment that primarily serves prepared juice beverages such as freshly squeezed or extracted fruit juices juice blends fruit smoothies (a thick fruit drink often iced) or other juices such as fresh wheatgrass juice sometimes other solid ingredients or nutritional supplements may be added as boosters such as fresh bananas eggs nuts or nut butter bodybuilding supplements soy protein powder or others such as whey or hemp protein powders wheat germ or spirulina (dietary supplement) or chlorella also if less juice is used with these same ingredients drinks called health shakes may be produced
juice bars share some of the characteristics of a coffeehouse a soda fountain a caf and a snack bar

== history ==
groups of grape pits dated to 8000 bce show early evidence of juice production although it is thought that the grapes may have been alternatively used to produce wine
one of the first regularly produced juices was lemonade appearing in 16th century italy as an import after its conception in the middle east orange juice originated in the 17th century in the 18th century james lind linked citrus fruits to the prevention of scurvy which a century later lead to the implementation of the merchant shipping act of 1867 requiring all ocean-bound british ships to carry citrus-based juice on board
a dentist by the name thomas b welch developed a pasteurization method that allowed for the storage of juice without the juice fermenting into alcohol in 1869 his method involved filtering squeezed grape juice into bottles sealing them with cork and wax and then placing them in boiling water this method kills the yeast responsible for fermentation he then sold his new product as dr welch's unfermented wine
in late 18th century united states circulation of foreign fruit juices were heavily regulated by tariffs the mckinley tariff act of 1890 increased import takes from 38 to 49.5 percent and set taxes on fruit juices based on the alcohol content of the drink juices with 18% or less alcohol were taxed 60 cents per gallon while anything above 18% was taxed $2.50 per proof gallon
