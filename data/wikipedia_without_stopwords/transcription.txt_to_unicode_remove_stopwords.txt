stemloop intramolecular base pairing pattern occur singlestranded dna commonly rna structure also known hairpin hairpin loop occurs two regions strand usually complementary nucleotide sequence read opposite directions basepair form double helix ends unpaired loop resulting structure key building block many rna secondary structures
formation stability
formation stemloop structure dependent stability resulting helix loop regions first prerequisite presence sequence fold back form paired double helix stability helix determined length number mismatches bulges contains small number tolerable especially long helix base composition paired region pairings guanine cytosine three hydrogen bonds stable compared adenineuracil pairings two rna adenineuracil pairings featuring one hydrogen bonds equal adeninethymine bond dna base stacking interactions align pi orbitals bases aromatic rings favorable orientation also promote helix formation
stability loop also influences formation stemloop structure loops less three bases long sterically impossible form large loops secondary structure pseudoknot pairing also unstable optimal loop length tends bases long one common loop sequence uncg known tetraloop particularly stable due basestacking interactions component nucleotides
structural contexts
stemloops occur premicrorna structures famously transfer rna contain three true stemloops one stem meet cloverleaf pattern anticodon recognizes codon translation process located one unpaired loops trna two nested stemloop structures occur rna pseudoknots loop one structure forms part second stem
many ribozymes also feature stemloop structures selfcleaving hammerhead ribozyme contains three stemloops meet central unpaired region cleavage site lies hammerhead ribozymes basic secondary structure required selfcleavage activity
hairpin loops often elements found within utr prokaryotes structures often bound proteins cause attenuation transcript order regulate translation
mrna stemloop structure forming ribosome binding site may control initiation translation
stemloop structures also important prokaryotic rhoindependent transcription termination hairpin loop forms mrna strand transcription causes rna polymerase become dissociated dna template strand process known rhoindependent intrinsic termination sequences involved called terminator sequences
