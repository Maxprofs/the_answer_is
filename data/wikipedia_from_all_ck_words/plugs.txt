bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants known for their role in pollination and in the case of the best-known bee species the european honey bee for producing honey and beeswax bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily apoidea presently considered as a clade anthophila there are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven to nine recognized families though many are undescribed and the actual number is probably higher they are found on every continent except antarctica in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants
some species including honey bees bumblebees and stingless bees live socially in colonies bees are adapted for feeding on nectar and pollen the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients most pollen is used as food for larvae bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees
bees range in size from tiny stingless bee species whose workers are less than 2 millimetres (0.08 in) long to megachile pluto the largest species of leafcutter bee whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres (1.54 in) the most common bees in the northern hemisphere are the halictidae or sweat bees but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies vertebrate predators of bees include birds such as bee-eaters insect predators include beewolves and dragonflies
human beekeeping or apiculture has been practised for millennia since at least the times of ancient egypt and ancient greece apart from honey and pollination honey bees produce beeswax royal jelly and propolis bees have appeared in mythology and folklore again since ancient times and they feature in works of literature as varied as beatrix potter's the tale of mrs tittlemouse w b yeats's poem the lake isle of innisfree and laline paull's the bees bee larvae are included in the javanese dish botok tawon where they are eaten steamed with shredded coconut
== evolution ==
the ancestors of bees were wasps in the family crabronidae which were predators of other insects the switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the consumption of prey insects which were flower visitors and were partially covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae this same evolutionary scenario may have occurred within the vespoid wasps where the pollen wasps evolved from predatory ancestors until recently the oldest non-compression bee fossil had been found in new jersey amber cretotrigona prisca of cretaceous age a corbiculate bee a bee fossil from the early cretaceous (~100 mya) melittosphex burmensis is considered an extinct lineage of pollen-collecting apoidea sister to the modern bees derived features of its morphology (apomorphies) place it clearly within the bees but it retains two unmodified ancestral traits (plesiomorphies) of the legs (two mid-tibial spurs and a slender hind basitarsus) showing its transitional status by the eocene (~45 mya) there was already considerable diversity among eusocial bee lineages
the highly eusocial corbiculate apidae appeared roughly 87 mya and the allodapini (within the apidae) around 53 mya the colletidae appear as fossils only from the late oligocene (~25 mya) to early miocene the melittidae are known from palaeomacropis eocenicus in the early eocene the megachilidae are known from trace fossils (characteristic leaf cuttings) from the middle eocene the andrenidae are known from the eocene-oligocene boundary around 34 mya of the florissant shale the halictidae first appear in the early eocene with species found in amber the stenotritidae are known from fossil brood cells of pleistocene age
=== coevolution ===
the earliest animal-pollinated flowers were shallow cup-shaped blooms pollinated by insects such as beetles so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established before the first appearance of bees the novelty is that bees are specialized as pollination agents with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination and are the most efficient pollinating insects in a process of coevolution flowers developed longer tubes and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar this drove the adaptive radiation of the angiosperms and in turn the bees themselves
=== phylogeny ===
==== external ====
this cladogram is based on debevic et al 2012 which used molecular phylogeny to demonstrate that the bees arose from deep within the crabronidae which is therefore paraphyletic the heterogynaidae is also broken up
==== internal ====
this cladogram of the bee families is based on gullan and cranston 2014 they note the melittidae (sensu lato) as paraphyletic but do not resolve it into its separate families the cladogram uses danforth et al. 2006 and michez 2007 for this purpose english names where available are given in parentheses
== description ==
it is usually easy to recognise that a particular insect is a bee they differ from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or plume-like setae (bristles) combs on the forelimbs for cleaning their antennae small anatomical differences in the limb structure and the venation of the hind wings and in females by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half-plates
behaviourally one of the most obvious characteristics of bees is that they collect pollen to provide provisions for their young and have the necessary adaptations to do this however certain wasp species such as pollen wasps have similar behaviours and a few species of bee scavenge from carcases to feed their offspring the world's largest species of bee is thought to be the indonesian resin bee megachile pluto whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres (1.54 in) the smallest species may be dwarf stingless bees in the tribe meliponini whose workers are less than 2 millimetres (0.08 in) in length
a bee has a pair of large compound eyes which cover much of the surface of the head between and above these are three small simple eyes (ocelli) which provide information for the bee on light intensity the antennae usually have thirteen segments in males and twelve in females and are geniculate having an elbow joint part way along they house large numbers of sense organs that can detect touch (mechanoreceptors) smell and taste and small hairlike mechanoreceptors that can detect air movement so as to hear sounds the mouthparts are adapted for both chewing and sucking by having both a pair of mandibles and a long proboscis for sucking up nectar
the thorax has three segments each with a pair of robust legs and a pair of membranous wings on the hind two segments the front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for cleaning the antennae and in many species the hind legs bear pollen baskets flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen the wings are synchronised in flight and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing the abdomen has nine segments the hindermost three being modified into the sting
== sociality ==
=== haplodiploid breeding system ===
according to inclusive fitness theory organisms can gain fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output but also that of close relatives in evolutionary terms individuals should help relatives when cost < relatedness * benefit the requirements for eusociality are more easily fulfilled by haplodiploid species such as bees because of their unusual relatedness structure in haplodiploid species females develop from fertilized eggs and males from unfertilized eggs because a male is haploid (has only one copy of each gene) his daughters (which are diploid with two copies of each gene) share 100% of his genes and 50% of their mother's therefore they share 75% of their genes with each other this mechanism of sex determination gives rise to what w d hamilton termed supersisters more closely related to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring workers often do not reproduce but they can pass on more of their genes by helping to raise their sisters (as queens) than they would by having their own offspring (each of which would only have 50% of their genes) this unusual situation has been proposed as an explanation of the multiple independent evolutions of eusociality (arising at least nine separate times) within the hymenoptera however some eusocial species such as termites are not haplodiploid conversely many bees are haplodiploid yet are not eusocial and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males creating half-sisters that share only 25% of their genes haplodiploidy is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality but monogamy (queens mating singly) is the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated so it is likely that haplodiploidy contributed to the evolution of eusociality in bees
=== eusociality ===
bees may be solitary or may live in various types of communities the most advanced of these are eusocial colonies found among the honey bees bumblebees and stingless bees these are characterised by having cooperative brood care and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive adults sociality of several different types is believed to have evolved separately many times within the bees in some species groups of cohabiting females may be sisters and if there is a division of labour within the group they are considered semisocial the group is called eusocial if in addition the group consists of a mother (the queen) and her daughters (workers) with male drones at certain stages when the castes are purely behavioural alternatives the system is considered primitively eusocial as in many paper wasps when the castes are morphologically discrete the system is considered highly eusocial
there are many more species of primitively eusocial than highly eusocial bees but they have rarely been studied most are in the family halictidae or sweat bees colonies are typically small with a dozen or fewer workers on average queens and workers differ only in size if at all most species have a single season colony cycle even in the tropics and only mated females hibernate a few species have long active seasons and attain colony sizes in the hundreds the orchid bees include some primitively eusocial species with similar biology some allodapine bees are primitively eusocial colonies with progressive provisioning a larva's food is supplied gradually as it develops as is the case in honey bees and some bumblebees
bumblebees are eusocial like the eusocial vespidae such as hornets the queen initiates a nest on her own bumblebee colonies typically have from 50 to 200 bees at peak population which occurs in mid to late summer nest architecture is simple limited by the size of the pre-existing nest cavity and colonies rarely last more than a year in 2011 the international union for conservation of nature set up the bumblebee specialist group to review the threat status of all bumblebee species world-wide using the iucn red list criteria
stingless bees are highly eusocial they practise mass provisioning with complex nest architecture and perennial colonies
the true honey bees (genus apis) are highly eusocial and are among the best known of all insects there are 29 subspecies of apis mellifera native to europe the middle east and africa africanized bees are a hybrid strain of a mellifera that escaped from experiments involving crossing european and african subspecies they are unusually defensive
=== solitary and communal bees ===
most other bees including familiar insects such as carpenter bees leafcutter bees and mason bees are solitary in the sense that every female is fertile and typically inhabits a nest she constructs herself there are no worker bees for these species solitary bees typically produce neither honey nor beeswax
solitary bees are important pollinators they gather pollen to provision their nests with food for their brood often it is mixed with nectar to form a paste-like consistency some solitary bees have advanced types of pollen-carrying structures on their bodies a very few species of solitary bees are being cultured for commercial pollination most of these species belong to a distinct set of genera namely carpenter bees sweat bees mason bees polyester bees squash bees dwarf carpenter bees leafcutter bees alkali bees and digger bees
solitary bees are often oligoleges in that they only gather pollen from one or a few species or genera of closely related plants (unlike honey bees and bumblebees which are generalists) specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen and male orchid bees which gather aromatic compounds from orchids (one of the few cases where male bees are effective pollinators) the bees are often drawn to their specialist flower by the odour of the pollen defence chemicals created by the plant in a very few cases only one species of bee can effectively pollinate a single plant species and some plants are endangered at least in part because their pollinator is also threatened there is however a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bees to be associated with common widespread plants which are visited by multiple pollinators there are some forty oligoleges associated with the creosote bush in the arid parts of the united states southwest for example
solitary bees create nests in hollow reeds or twigs holes in wood or most commonly in tunnels in the ground the female typically creates a compartment (a cell") with an egg and some provisions for the resulting larva then seals it off a nest may consist of numerous cells when the nest is in wood usually the last (those closer to the entrance) contain eggs that will become males the adult does not provide care for the brood once the egg is laid and usually dies after making one or more nests the males typically emerge first and are ready for mating when the females emerge solitary bees are either stingless or very unlikely to sting (only in self-defense if ever)
while solitary females each make individual nests some species such as the european mason bee hoplitis anthocopoides and the dawson's burrowing bee amegilla dawsoni are gregarious preferring to make nests near others of the same species and giving the appearance of being social large groups of solitary bee nests are called aggregations to distinguish them from colonies in some species multiple females share a common nest but each makes and provisions her own cells independently this type of group is called communal and is not uncommon the primary advantage appears to be that a nest entrance is easier to defend from predators and parasites when there are multiple females using that same entrance on a regular basis
== biology ==
=== life cycle ===
the life cycle of a bee be it a solitary or social species involves the laying of an egg the development through several moults of a legless larva a pupation stage during which the insect undergoes complete metamorphosis followed by the emergence of a winged adult most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom the males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate the sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised after mating a female stores the sperm and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs males tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no diapause stage
the egg is generally oblong slightly curved and tapering at one end in the case of solitary bees each one is laid in a cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it this may be rolled into a pellet or placed in a pile and is known as mass provisioning in social species of bee there is progressive provisioning with the larva being fed regularly while it grows the nest varies from a hole in the ground or in wood in solitary bees to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey bees
the larvae are generally whitish grubs roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends they have fifteen segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing they have no legs but are able to move within the confines of the cell helped by tubercles on their sides they have short horns on the head jaws for chewing their food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle there is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce their cocoons the pupa can be seen through the semi-transparent cocoon and over the course of a few days the insect undergoes metamorphosis into the form of the adult bee when ready to emerge it splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the exuviae as a winged adult and breaks out of the cell
=== flight ===
in antoine magnan's 1934 book le vol des insectes he wrote that he and andr sainte-lagu had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found that their flight could not be explained by fixed-wing calculations but that one shouldn't be surprised that the results of the calculations don't square with reality this has led to a common misconception that bees violate aerodynamic theory but in fact it merely confirms that bees do not engage in fixed-wing flight and that their flight is explained by other mechanics such as those used by helicopters in 1996 it was shown that vortices created by many insects wings helped to provide lift high-speed cinematography and robotic mock-up of a bee wing showed that lift was generated by the unconventional combination of short choppy wing strokes a rapid rotation of the wing as it flops over and reverses direction and a very fast wing-beat frequency wing-beat frequency normally increases as size decreases but as the bee's wing beat covers such a small arc it flaps approximately 230 times per second faster than a fruitfly (200 times per second) which is 80 times smaller
=== navigation communication and finding food ===
the ethologist karl von frisch studied navigation in the honey bee he showed that honey bees communicate by the waggle dance in which a worker indicates the location of a food source to other workers in the hive he demonstrated that bees can recognize a desired compass direction in three different ways by the sun by the polarization pattern of the blue sky and by the earths magnetic field he showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark beehive bees navigate using spatial memory with a rich map-like organization
== ecology ==
=== as mimics and models ===
many bees are aposematically coloured typically orange and black warning of their ability to defend themselves with a powerful sting as such they are models for batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects such as bee-flies robber flies and hoverflies all of which gain a measure of protection by superficially looking and behaving like bees
bees are themselves mllerian mimics of other aposematic insects with the same colour scheme including wasps lycid and other beetles and many butterflies and moths (lepidoptera) which are themselves distasteful often through acquiring bitter and poisonous chemicals from their plant food all the mllerian mimics including bees benefit from the reduced risk of predation that results from their easily recognised warning coloration
bees are also mimicked by plants such as the bee orchid which imitates both the appearance and the scent of a female bee male bees attempt to mate (pseudocopulation) with the furry lip of the flower thus pollinating it
=== as brood parasites ===
brood parasites occur in several bee families including the apid subfamily nomadinae females of these bees lack pollen collecting structures (the scopa) and do not construct their own nests they typically enter the nests of pollen collecting species and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by the host bee when the cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes the host larva's pollen ball and often the host egg also the arctic bee species bombus hyperboreus in particular are an aggressive species that attack and enslave other bees of the same subgenus however unlike many other bee brood parasites they have pollen baskets and often collect pollen
in the south of africa hives of african honeybees (a mellifera scutellata) are being destroyed by parasitic workers of the cape honeybee a m capensis these lay diploid eggs ("thelytoky") escaping normal worker policing leading to the colony's destruction the parasites can then move to other hives
the cuckoo bees in the bombus subgenus psithyrus are closely related to and resemble their hosts in looks and size this common pattern gave rise to the ecological principle emery's rule others parasitize bees in different families like townsendiella a nomadine apid two species of which are cleptoparasites of the dasypodaid genus hesperapis while the other species in the same genus attacks halictid bees
=== nocturnal bees ===
four bee families (andrenidae colletidae halictidae and apidae) contain some species that are crepuscular most are tropical or subtropical but there are some which live in arid regions at higher latitudes these bees have greatly enlarged ocelli which are extremely sensitive to light and dark though incapable of forming images some have refracting superposition compound eyes these combine the output of many elements of their compound eyes to provide enough light for each retinal photoreceptor their ability to fly by night enables them to avoid many predators and to exploit flowers that produce nectar only or also at night
=== predators parasites and pathogens ===
vertebrate predators of bees include bee-eaters shrikes and flycatchers which make short sallies to catch insects in flight swifts and swallows fly almost continually catching insects as they go the honey buzzard attacks bees nests and eats the larvae the greater honeyguide interacts with humans by guiding them to the nests of wild bees the humans break open the nests and take the honey and the bird feeds on the larvae and the wax among mammals predators such as the badger dig up bumblebee nests and eat both the larvae and any stored food
specialist ambush predators of visitors to flowers include crab spiders which wait on flowering plants for pollinating insects predatory bugs and praying mantises some of which (the flower mantises of the tropics) wait motionless aggressive mimics camouflaged as flowers beewolves are large wasps that habitually attack bees the ethologist niko tinbergen estimated that a single colony of the beewolf philanthus triangulum might kill several thousand honeybees in a day all the prey he observed were honeybees other predatory insects that sometimes catch bees include robber flies and dragonflies
honey bees are affected by parasites including acarine and varroa mites
== bees and humans ==
=== in mythology and folklore ===
three bee maidens with the power of divination and thus speaking truth are described in homer's hymn to hermes and the food of the gods is identified as honey the bee maidens were originally associated with apollo and are probably not correctly identified with the thriae honey according to a greek myth was discovered by a nymph called melissa ("bee") and honey was offered to the greek gods from mycenean times bees were associated too with the delphic oracle and the prophetess was sometimes called a bee
the image of a community of honey bees has been used from ancient to modern times in aristotle and plato in virgil and seneca in erasmus and shakespeare tolstoy and by political and social theorists such as bernard mandeville and karl marx as a model for human society in english folklore bees would be told of important events in the household in a custom known as telling the bees
=== in literature ===
beatrix potter's illustrated book the tale of mrs tittlemouse (1910) features babbity bumble and her brood (pictured)
w b yeats's poem the lake isle of innisfree (1888) contains the couplet nine bean rows will i have there a hive for the honey bee / and live alone in the bee loud glade. at the time he was living in bedford park in the west of london
sue monk kidd's the secret life of bees (2004) and the 2009 film starring dakota fanning tells the story of a girl who escapes her abusive home and finds her way to live with a family of beekeepers the boatwrights
dave goulson's a sting in the tale (2014) describes his efforts to save bumblebees in britain as well as much about their biology
the playwright laline paull's fantasy the bees (2015) tells the tale of a hive bee named flora 717 from hatching onwards
the humorous 2007 animated film bee movie used jerry seinfeld's first script and was his first work for children he starred as a bee named barry b benson alongside rene zellweger critics found its premise awkward and its delivery tame
=== beekeeping ===
humans have kept honey bee colonies commonly in hives for millennia beekeepers collect honey beeswax propolis pollen and royal jelly from hives bees are also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers
depictions of humans collecting honey from wild bees date to 15,000 years ago efforts to domesticate them are shown in egyptian art around 4,500 years ago simple hives and smoke were used jars of honey were found in the tombs of pharaohs such as tutankhamun from the 18th century european understanding of the colonies and biology of bees allowed the construction of the moveable comb hive so that honey could be harvested without destroying the colony among classical era authors beekeeping with the use of smoke is described in the history of animals book 9 (a book not written by aristotle himself) the account mentions that bees die after stinging that workers remove corpses from the hive and guard it castes including workers and non-working drones but kings rather than queens predators including toads and bee-eaters and the waggle dance with the irresistible suggestion of p (aroseiontai it waggles) and (parakolouthousin they watch)
beekeeping is described in detail by virgil in his eclogues it is also mentioned in his aeneid and in pliny's natural history
=== as commercial pollinators ===
bees play an important role in pollinating flowering plants and are the major type of pollinator in many ecosystems that contain flowering plants it is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on pollination by insects birds and bats most of which is accomplished by bees especially the domesticated european honey bee
contract pollination has overtaken the role of honey production for beekeepers in many countries from 1972 to 2006 feral honey bees declined dramatically in the us and they are now almost absent the number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly through urbanization systematic pesticide use tracheal and varroa mites and the closure of beekeeping businesses in 2006 and 2007 the rate of attrition increased and was described as colony collapse disorder in 2010 invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus nosema ceranae were shown to be in every killed colony and deadly in combination winter losses increased to about 1/3 varroa mites were thought to be responsible for about half the losses
apart from colony collapse disorder losses outside the us have been attributed to causes including pesticide seed dressings such as clothianidin imidacloprid and thiamethoxam from 2013 the european union restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further in 2014 the intergovernmental panel on climate change report warned that bees faced increased risk of extinction because of global warming
however farmers have focused on alternative solutions in order to mitigate these problems by raising native plants they provide food for native bee pollinators like l vierecki and l leucozonium leading to less reliance on honey bee populations
=== as food ===
honey is a natural product produced by bees and stored for their own use but its sweetness has always appealed to humans before domestication of bees was even attempted humans were raiding their nests for their honey smoke was often used to subdue the bees and such activities are depicted in rock paintings in spain which have been dated to 15,000 bc indigenous people in many countries eat insects including consuming the larvae and pupae of bees mostly stingless bees they also gather bee brood (the larvae pupae and surrounding cells) for consumption in the indonesian dish botok tawon from central and east java bee larvae are eaten as a companion to rice after being mixed with shredded coconut wrapped in banana leaves and steamed
honey bees are used commercially to produce honey they also produce some substances used as dietary supplements with possible health benefits pollen propolis and royal jelly though all of these can also cause allergic reactions
