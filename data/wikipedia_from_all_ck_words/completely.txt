in the united states and canada an attending physician (also known as an attending rendering doc or staff physician) is a physician (m.d. d.o. or d.p.m.) who has completed residency and practices medicine in a clinic or hospital in the specialty learned during residency an attending physician can supervise fellows residents and medical students attending physicians may also have an academic title at an affiliated university such as professor this is common if the supervision of trainees is a significant part of the physician's work attending physicians have final responsibility legally and otherwise for patient care even when many of the minute-to-minute decisions are being made by house officers (residents) medical students and other clinicians (i.e physician assistants and nurse practitioners) attending physicians are sometimes the rendering physician listed on the patient's official medical record but if they are overseeing a resident or another staff member they are supervising.
attending physicians may also still be in training such as a fellow in a subspecialty for example a cardiology fellow may function as an internal medicine attending as he or she has already finished residency in internal medicine the term is used more commonly in teaching hospitals in non-teaching hospitals essentially all physicians function as attendings in some respects after completing residency
the term attending physician or attending also refers to the formal relationship of a hospitalized patient and their primary medic during the hospitalization as opposed to ancillary physicians assisting the primary care physician however even on a consultation service at an academic center the physician who has finished his training is called the attending or consultant as opposed to a resident physician
