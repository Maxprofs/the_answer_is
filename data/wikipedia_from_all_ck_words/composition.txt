== beginnings ==
the atlantis community was started in denver colorado in 1974 by the reverend wade blank a nondisabled former nursing home recreational director who assisted several residents to move out and start their own community the atlantis community started adapt in 1983 after several years of local bus protests originally adapt's name was an acronym that stood for americans disabled for accessible public transit since the group's initial issue was to get wheelchair accessible lifts on buses on july 5 and 6 1978 a denver intersection was the site of the first demonstration for wheelchair accessible public transportation when nineteen members of the atlantis community (known as the gang of nineteen) chanting we will ride blocked buses with their wheelchairs staying in the streets all night
throughout the 1980s the campaign for bus lifts expanded out from denver to cities nationwide adapters became well known for their tactic of immobilizing buses to draw attention to the need for lifts wheelchair users would stop a bus in front and back and others would get out of their chairs and crawl up the steps of an inaccessible bus to dramatize the issue not only city buses but interstate bus services like greyhound were targeted
by the end of the decade after protests and lawsuits adapt finally saw bus lifts required by law as passed by the americans with disabilities act in 1990 at that time the group began looking for the next logical step in disability rights advocacy while ensuring follow-through of transportation provisions in the ada
in 1993 wade blank died in 1991 adapt had decided to make community supports for people with disabilities its major issue many members of adapt had struggled for years to leave nursing homes and institutions where they had been warehoused they felt it was important to work to free other people with disabilities unable to get out
== micassa and community choice act campaign ==
adapt developed micassa which stands for medicaid community attendant services and supports act which is intended to help people with disabilities on medicaid choose whether to spend their support services money on nursing homes or on personal care attendants according to adapt community supports are far cheaper than nursing homes and micassa if passed will begin easing the significant burden of health care costs for the united states government in 2003 health care for the first time outpaced education as the single largest spending item for the us government and will continue to grow as the nation deals with the baby boom
today adapt convenes twice a year for national actions in different cities but most frequently washington d.c adapt continues to fight for the passage of micassa now known as the community choice act in addition adapters in the states are working to ensure that states receive funds from money follows the person and adapters are also working on access across america a campaign to ensure safe affordable accessible integrated housing for people with disabilities
== other programs ==
adapt has served a critical role in developing grassroots leaders with disabilities adapt organizers train its new chapter leaders with a curriculum that borrows from the national training and information center's (ntic) community organizing training but with a disability rights spin and including insights gained by adapters through over two decades of organized direct action for change
