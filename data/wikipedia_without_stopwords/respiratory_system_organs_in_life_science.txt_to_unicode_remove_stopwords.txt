respiratory system called also respiratory apparatus ventilatory system biological system consisting specific organs structures used process respiration organism respiratory system involved intake exchange oxygen carbon dioxide organism environment
airbreathing vertebrates like human beings respiration takes place respiratory organs called lungs passage air lungs supply body oxygen known inhalation passage air lungs expel carbon dioxide known exhalation process collectively called breathing ventilation humans mammals anatomical features respiratory system include trachea bronchi bronchioles lungs diaphragm molecules oxygen carbon dioxide passively exchanged diffusion gaseous external environment blood exchange process occurs alveoli air sacs lungs
fish many invertebrates respiration takes place gills animals insects respiratory systems simple anatomical features amphibians even skin plays vital role gas exchange plants also respiratory systems directionality gas exchange opposite animals respiratory system plants also includes anatomical features holes undersides leaves known stomata
comparative anatomy physiology
horses
horses obligate nasal breathers means different many mammals option breathing mouths must take oxygen noses
elephants
elephant animal known pleural space rather parietal visceral pleura composed dense connective tissue joined via loose connective tissue lack pleural space along unusually thick diaphragm thought evolutionary adaptations allowing elephant remain underwater long periods time breathing trunk emerges snorkel
birds
respiratory system birds differs significantly found mammals containing unique anatomical features air sacs lungs birds also capacity inflate birds lack diaphragm pleural cavity gas exchange birds occurs air capillaries blood capillaries rather alveoli
reptiles
anatomical structure lungs less complex reptiles mammals reptiles lacking extensive airway tree structure found mammalian lungs gas exchange reptiles still occurs alveoli however reptiles possess diaphragm thus breathing occurs via change volume body cavity controlled contraction intercostal muscles reptiles except turtles turtles contraction specific pairs flank muscles governs inspiration expiration
amphibians
lungs skin serve respiratory organs amphibians skin animals highly vascularized moist moisture maintained via secretion mucus specialized cells lungs primary importance breathing control skins unique properties aid rapid gas exchange amphibians submerged oxygenrich water
fish
fish respiration takes place gills see also aquatic respiration lungfish however possess one two lungs labyrinth fish developed special organ allows take advantage oxygen air
anatomy invertebrates
arthropods
species crab use respiratory organ called branchiostegal lung gill tissue formed increase surface area lung suited taking oxygen air water smallest spiders mites breathe simply exchanging gas surface body larger spiders scorpions arthropods use primitive book lung
insects
insects breath passively spiracles special openings exoskeleton air reaches body means series smaller smaller pipes called trachaea diameter relatively large tracheoles diameter small diffusion gases effective small distances larger ones one reasons insects relatively small insects spiracles trachaea collembola breathe directly skins also diffusion gases number spiracles insect variable species however always come pairs one side body usually one per segment diplura eleven four pairs thorax ancient forms insects dragonflies grasshoppers two thoracic eight abdominal spiracles however remaining insects less level tracheoles oxygen delivered cells respiration trachea waterfilled due permeable membrane surrounding tissues exercise water level retracts due increase concentration lactic acid muscle cells lowers water potential water drawn back cells via osmosis air brought closer muscle cells diffusion pathway reduced gases transferred easily
insects believed exchange gases environment continuously simple diffusion gases tracheal system recently however large variation insect ventilatory patterns documented insect respiration appears highly variable small insects demonstrate continuous respiration may lack muscular control spiracles others however utilize muscular contraction abdomen along coordinated spiracle contraction relaxation generate cyclical gas exchange patterns reduce water loss atmosphere extreme form patterns termed discontinuous gas exchange cycles dgc
molluscs
molluscs generally possess gills allow exchange oxygen aqueous environment circulatory system animals also possess heart pumps blood contains hemocyaninine oxygencapturing molecule hence respiratory system similar vertebrate fish respiratory system gastropods include either gills lung
physiology mammals
ventilation
respiratory physiology ventilation rate rate gas enters leaves lung categorized following definitions
control
ventilation occurs control autonomic nervous system medulla oblongata pons brainstem areas brain form respiration regulatory center series interconnected brain cells within lower middle brain stem coordinate respiratory movements sections pneumotaxic center apneustic center dorsal ventral respiratory groups section especially sensitive infancy neurons destroyed infant dropped andor shaken violently result death due shaken baby syndrome
breathing rate increases concentration carbon dioxide blood detected peripheral chemoreceptors aorta carotid artery central chemoreceptors medulla exercise also increases respiratory rate due action proprioceptors increase body temperature release epinephrine motor impulses originating brain addition increase due increased inflation lungs detected stretch receptors
inhalation
inhalation initiated diaphragm supported external intercostal muscles normal resting respirations breaths per minute time period seconds vigorous inhalation rates exceeding breaths per minute approaching respiratory failure accessory muscles respiration recruited support consist sternocleidomastoid platysma scalene muscles neck pectoral muscles latissimus dorsi also accessory muscles
normal conditions diaphragm primary driver inhalation diaphragm contracts ribcage expands contents abdomen moved downward results larger thoracic volume negative pressure respect atmospheric pressure inside thorax pressure chest falls air moves conducting zone air filtered warmed humidified flows lungs
forced inhalation taking deep breath external intercostal muscles accessory muscles aid expanding thoracic cavity inhalation diaphragm contracts
exhalation
exhalation generally passive process however active forced exhalation achieved abdominal internal intercostal muscles process air forced exhaled
lungs natural elasticity recoil stretch inhalation air flows back pressures chest atmosphere reach equilibrium
forced exhalation blowing candle expiratory muscles including abdominal muscles internal intercostal muscles generate abdominal thoracic pressure forces air lungs
gas exchange
major function respiratory system gas exchange external environment organisms circulatory system humans mammals exchange facilitates oxygenation blood concomitant removal carbon dioxide gaseous metabolic wastes circulation gas exchange occurs acidbase balance body maintained part homeostasis proper ventilation maintained two opposing conditions could occur respiratory acidosis lifethreatening condition respiratory alkalosis
upon inhalation gas exchange occurs alveoli tiny sacs basic functional component lungs alveolar walls extremely thin approx micrometres walls composed single layer epithelial cells type type ii epithelial cells close pulmonary capillaries composed single layer endothelial cells close proximity two cell types allows permeability gases hence gas exchange whole mechanism gas exchange carried simple phenomenon pressure difference air pressure high inside lungs air lungs flow air pressure low inside air flows lungs
immune functions
airway epithelial cells secrete variety molecules aid defense lungs secretory immunoglobulins iga collectins including surfactant d defensins peptides proteases reactive oxygen species reactive nitrogen species generated airway epithelial cells secretions act directly antimicrobials help keep airway free infection airway epithelial cells also secrete variety chemokines cytokines recruit traditional immune cells others site infections
respiratory system lined mucous membranes contain mucosalassociated lymphoid tissue produces white blood cells lymphocytes
metabolic endocrine functions lungs
addition functions gas exchange lungs number metabolic functions manufacture surfactant local use noted also contain fibrinolytic system lyses clots pulmonary vessels release variety substances enter systemic arterial blood remove substances systemic venous blood reach via pulmonary artery prostaglandins removed circulation also synthesized lungs released blood lung tissue stretched lungs also activate one hormone physiologically inactive decapeptide angiotensin converted pressor aldosteronestimulating octapeptide angiotensin ii pulmonary circulation reaction occurs tissues well particularly prominent lungs large amounts angiotensinconverting enzyme responsible activation located surface endothelial cells pulmonary capillaries converting enzyme also inactivates bradykinin circulation time pulmonary capillaries less one second yet angiotensin reaching lungs converted angiotensin ii single trip capillaries four peptidases identified surface pulmonary endothelial cells
vocalization
movement gas larynx pharynx mouth allows humans speak phonate vocalization singing birds occurs via syrinx organ located base trachea vibration air flowing across larynx vocal cords humans syrinx birds results sound gas movement extremely vital communication purposes
temperature control
panting dogs cats animals provides means controlling body temperature physiological response used cooling mechanism
coughing sneezing
irritation nerves within nasal passages airways induce cough reflex sneezing responses cause air expelled forcefully trachea nose respectively manner irritants caught mucus lines respiratory tract expelled moved mouth swallowed coughing contraction smooth muscle narrows trachea pulling ends cartilage plates together pushing soft tissue lumen increases expired airflow rate dislodge remove irritant particle mucus
development
humans mammals
respiratory system lies dormant human fetus pregnancy birth respiratory system becomes fully functional upon exposure air although lung development growth continues throughout childhood preterm birth lead infants underdeveloped lungs lungs show incomplete development alveolar type ii cells cells produce surfactant lungs preterm infants may function well lack surfactant leads increased surface tension within alveoli thus many alveoli collapse gas exchange occur within regions infants lungs condition termed respiratory distress syndrome basic scientific experiments carried using cells chicken lungs support potential using steroids means furthering development type ii alveolar cells fact premature birth threatened every effort made delay birth series steroid shots frequently administered mother delay effort promote lung growth
disease
disorders respiratory system classified four general areas
obstructive conditions eg emphysema bronchitis asthma
restrictive conditions eg fibrosis sarcoidosis alveolar damage pleural effusion
vascular diseases eg pulmonary edema pulmonary embolism pulmonary hypertension
infectious environmental diseases eg pneumonia tuberculosis asbestosis particulate pollutants
coughing major importance bodys main method remove dust mucus saliva debris lungs inability cough lead infection deep breathing exercises may help keep finer structures lungs clear particulate matter etc
respiratory tract constantly exposed microbes due extensive surface area respiratory system includes many mechanisms defend prevent pathogens entering body
disorders respiratory system usually treated internally pulmonologist respiratory therapist
plants
plants use carbon dioxide gas process photosynthesis exhale oxygen gas waste chemical equation photosynthesis co carbon dioxide ho water makes o oxygen cho glucose expressed chemical equation capture energy sunlight occurs photosynthesis uses electrons carbon atoms repository energy respiration opposite photosynthesis reclaims energy power chemical reactions cells carbon atoms electrons combined oxygen forming gas easily removed cells organism plants use processes photosynthesis capture energy respiration use
plant respiration limited process diffusion plants take carbon dioxide holes undersides leaves known stoma pores however plants require little air plants relatively living cells outside surface air required metabolic content penetrate skin deep however plants involved highly aerobic activities thus need living cells
