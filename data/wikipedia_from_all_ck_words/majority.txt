a majority is a subset of a set consisting of more than half of the set's elements this can be compared to a plurality which is a subset larger than any other subset considered i.e a plurality is not necessarily a majority as the largest subset considered may consist of less than half the set's elements in british english the term majority is also alternatively used to refer to the winning margin i.e the number of votes separating the first-place finisher from the second-place finisher
a majority may be called a simple majority to contrast with other types of majority an overall majority in parliamentary systems is the difference of legislators between the government and its opposition an absolute majority is a majority of all electors not just those who voted and a supermajority is a stronger majority than a simple majority
== example ==
imagine that tennessee is having an election on the location of its capital the population of tennessee is concentrated around its four major cities which are spread throughout the state for this example suppose that the entire electorate lives in these four cities and that everyone wants to live as near to the capital as possible
the candidates for the capital are
memphis the state's largest city with 42% of the voters but located far from the other cities
nashville with 26% of the voters near the center of the state
knoxville with 17% of the voters
chattanooga with 15% of the voters
the preferences of the voters would be divided like this
here memphis has a plurality (42%) of the first preferences but not a majority we can contrast this by looking at the fourth preferences where the majority of voters (58%) have placed memphis last in all single-winner voting systems apart from the simple plurality voting memphis will lose as a majority of voters do not want the city as capital
== parliamentary rules ==
in parliamentary procedure the term majority refers to more than half. as it relates to a vote a majority is more than half of the votes cast (noting that an abstention is simply the refusal to vote) the definition of majority vote can differ however from one parliamentary authority to another robert's rules of order defines a majority as being more than one half of the votes cast including votes for ineligible candidates or choices the standard code of parliamentary procedure (abbreviated tsc) defines a majority as being more than half all eligible votes cast
for example assume that votes are cast for three people for an office alice and bob who are eligible and carol who is ineligible
by robert's rules of order no candidate has been elected as no candidate gained 11 votes however by the standard code alice is elected as she gained more than half of the seventeen eligible votes
