as is the case for any base in its system ten is the first two-digit number in decimal and thus the lowest number where the position of a numeral affects its value any integer written in the decimal system can be multiplied by ten by adding a zero to the end (e.g 855 * 10 = 8550)
==== roman numerals ====
the roman numeral for ten is x (which looks like two v's [the roman numeral for 5] put together) it is thought that the v for five is derived from an open hand (five digits displayed) and x for ten from both hands incidentally the chinese word numeral for ten is also a cross
