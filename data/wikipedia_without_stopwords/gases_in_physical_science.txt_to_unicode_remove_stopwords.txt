proxies tree rings ice cores last yearsedit
proxy measurements used reconstruct temperature record historical period quantities tree ring widths coral growth isotope variations ice cores ocean lake sediments cave deposits fossils ice cores borehole temperatures glacier length records correlated climatic fluctuations proxy temperature reconstructions last years performed northern hemisphere shorter time scales southern hemisphere tropics
geographic coverage proxies necessarily sparse various proxies sensitive faster fluctuations example tree rings ice cores corals generally show variation annual time scale borehole reconstructions rely rates thermal diffusion small scale fluctuations washed even best proxy records contain far fewer observations worst periods observational record spatial temporal resolution resulting reconstructions correspondingly coarse connecting measured proxies variable interest temperature rainfall highly nontrivial data sets multiple complementary proxies covering overlapping time periods areas reconciled produce final reconstructions
