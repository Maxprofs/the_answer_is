temperatures measured directly on the ground may exceed air temperatures by 30 to 50 c a ground temperature of 84 c (183.2 f) has been recorded in port sudan sudan a ground temperature of 93.9 c (201 f) was recorded in furnace creek death valley california usa on 15 july 1972 this may be the highest natural ground surface temperature ever recorded the theoretical maximum possible ground surface temperature has been estimated to be between 90 and 100 c for dry darkish soils of low thermal conductivity
satellite measurements of ground temperature taken between 2003 and 2009 taken with the modis infrared spectroradiometer on the aqua satellite found a maximum temperature of 70.7 c (159.3 f) which was recorded in 2005 in the lut desert iran the lut desert was also found to have the highest maximum temperature in 5 of the 7 years measured (2004 2005 2006 2007 and 2009.) these measurements reflect averages over a large region and so are lower than the maximum point surface temperature
satellite measurements of the surface temperature of antarctica taken between 1982 and 2013 found a coldest temperature of 93.2 c (136 f) on 10 august 2010 at 81.8s 59.3e / -81.8 59.3 although this is not comparable to an air temperature it is believed that the air temperature at this location would have been lower than the official record lowest air temperature of 89.2 c
