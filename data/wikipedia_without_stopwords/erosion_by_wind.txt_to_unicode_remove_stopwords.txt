history plant systematicsthe biological classification plantsstretches work ancient greek modern evolutionary biologists field science plant systematics came slowly early plant lore usually treated part study medicine later classification description driven natural history natural theology advent theory evolution nearly classification based scala naturae professionalization botany th th century marked shift toward holistic classification methods eventually based evolutionary relationships
antiquity
peripatetic philosopher theophrastus bc student aristotle ancient greece wrote historia plantarum earliest surviving treatise plants listed names plant species articulate formal classification scheme relied common groupings folk taxonomy combined growth form tree shrub undershrub herb
de materia medica dioscorides important early compendium plant descriptions five hundred classifying plants chiefly medicinal effects use publication st century th century making major herbal throughout middle ages
early modern period
th century works otto brunfels hieronymus bock leonhart fuchs helped revive interest natural history based firsthand observation bock particular included environmental life cycle information descriptions influx exotic species age exploration number known species expanded rapidly authors far interested medicinal properties individual plants overarching classification system later influential renaissance books include caspar bauhin andrea cesalpino bauhin described plants arranged books sections based wide range common characteristics cesalpino based system structure organs fructification using aristotelian technique logical division
late th century influential classification schemes english botanist natural theologian john ray french botanist joseph pitton de tournefort ray listed plant species works credited establishing monocotdicot division groups mustards mints legumes grasses stand today though modern family names tournefort used artificial system based logical division widely adopted france elsewhere europe linnaeus
book enormous accelerating effect science plant systematics species plantarum linnaeus presented complete list plant species known europe ordered purpose easy identification using number arrangement male female sexual organs plants groups book highest rank continues used today genus consistent use binomial nomenclature along complete listing plants provided huge stimulus field
although meticulous classification linnaeus served merely identification manual based phenetics regard evolutionary relationships among species assumed plant species given god remained humans recognise use christian reformulation scala naturae great chain linnaeus quite aware arrangement species species plantarum natural system ie express relationships however present ideas plant relationships elsewhere
modern contemporary periods
significant contributions plant classification came de jussieu inspired work adanson early nineteenth century saw start work de candolle culminating prodromus
major influence plant systematics theory evolution charles darwin published origin species resulting aim group plants phylogenetic relationships added interest plant anatomy aided use light microscope rise chemistry allowing analysis secondary metabolites
currently strict use epithets botany although regulated international codes considered unpractical outdated notion species fundamental classification unit often subjective intuition thus well defined result estimate total number existing species ranging million million becomes matter preference
scientists agreed time functional objective classification system must reflect actual evolutionary processes genetic relationships technological means creating system exist recently dna technology saw immense progress resulting unprecedented accumulation dna sequence data various genes present compartments plant cells groundbreaking classification angiosperms apg system consolidated molecular phylogenetics especially cladistics phylogenetic systematics best available method first time relatedness could measured real terms namely similarity molecules comprising genetic code
