an hourglass (or sandglass sand timer sand watch or sand clock) is a mechanical device used to measure the passage of time it comprises two glass bulbs connected vertically by narrow neck that allows a regulated trickle of material (historically sand) from the upper bulb to the lower one factors affecting the time interval measured include the sand quantity the sand coarseness the bulb size and the neck width hourglasses may be reused indefinitely by inverting the bulbs once the upper bulb is empty
== history ==
=== antiquity ===
the origin of the hourglass is unclear its predecessor the clepsydra or water clock may have been invented in ancient egypt according to the american institute of new york the clepsammia or sand-glass was invented at alexandria about 150 bc according to the journal of the british archaeological association the so-called clepsammia were in use before the time of st jerome (335 ad) and the first representation of an hourglass is in a sarcophagus dated c 350 ad representing the wedding of peleus and thetis discovered in rome in the 18th century and studied by winckelmann in the 19th century who remarked the hourglass held by morpheus in his hands
=== reappearance in the early middle ages ===
there are no records of the hourglass existing in europe prior to the early middle ages in the 8th century it is mentioned by a monk named luitprand who served at the cathedral in chartres france but it was not until the 14th century that the hourglass was seen commonly the earliest firm evidence being a depiction in the 1338 fresco allegory of good government by ambrogio lorenzetti
use of the marine sandglass has been recorded since the 14th century the written records about it were mostly from logbooks of european ships in the same period it appears in other records and lists of ships stores the earliest recorded reference that can be said with certainty to refer to a marine sandglass dates from c 1345 in a receipt of thomas de stetesham clerk of the king's ship la george in the reign of edward iii of england translated from the latin the receipt says in 1345
the same thomas accounts to have paid at lescluse in flanders for twelve glass horologes ( pro xii orlogiis vitreis ) price of each 4 gross in sterling 9s item for four horologes of the same sort ( de eadem secta ) bought there price of each five gross making in sterling 3s 4d.
marine sandglasses were very popular on board ships as they were the most dependable measurement of time while at sea unlike the clepsydra the motion of the ship while sailing did not affect the hourglass the fact that the hourglass also used granular materials instead of liquids gave it more accurate measurements as the clepsydra was prone to get condensation inside it during temperature changes seamen found that the hourglass was able to help them determine longitude distance east or west from a certain point with reasonable accuracy
the hourglass also found popularity on land as the use of mechanical clocks to indicate the times of events like church services became more common creating a need to keep track of time the demand for time-measuring devices increased hourglasses were essentially inexpensive as they required no rare technology to make and their contents were not hard to come by and as the manufacturing of these instruments became more common their uses became more practical
hourglasses were commonly seen in use in churches homes and work places to measure sermons cooking time and time spent on breaks from labor because they were being used for more everyday tasks the model of the hourglass began to shrink the smaller models were more practical and very popular as they made timing more discreet
after 1500 a.d. the hourglass was not as widespread as it had been this was due to the development of the mechanical clock which became more accurate smaller and cheaper and made keeping time easier the hourglass however did not disappear entirely although they became relatively less useful as clock technology advanced hourglasses remained desirable in their design some of the most famous hourglasses are the twelve-hour hourglass of charlemagne of france and the hourglasses of henry viii of england made by the artist holbein in the 16th century the oldest known surviving hourglass resides in the british museum in london
not until the 18th century did the harrison brothers john and james come up with a marine chronometer that significantly improved on the stability of the hourglass at sea taking elements from the design logic behind the hourglass they made a marine chronometer in 1761 that was able to accurately measure the journey from england to jamaica accurate within five seconds
== design ==
little written evidence exists to explain why its external form is the shape that it is the glass bulbs used however have changed in style and design over time while the main designs have always been ampoule in shape the bulbs were not always connected the first hourglasses were two separate bulbs with a cord wrapped at their union that was then coated in wax to hold the piece together and let sand flow in between it was not until 1760 that both bulbs were blown together to keep moisture out of the bulbs and regulate the pressure within the bulb that varied the flow
== material ==
while some hourglasses actually did use sand as the granular mixture to measure time many did not use sand at all the material used in most bulbs was a combination of powdered marble tin/lead oxides and pulverized burnt eggshell over time different textures of granule matter were tested to see which gave the most constant flow within the bulbs it was later discovered that for the perfect flow to be achieved the ratio of granule bead to the width of the bulb neck needed to be 1/12 or more but not greater than 1/2 the neck of the bulb
== practical uses ==
hourglasses were an early dependable reusable and accurate measure of time the rate of flow of the sand is independent of the depth in the upper reservoir and the instrument will not freeze in cold weather
from the 15th century onwards they were being used in a range of applications at sea in the church in industry and in cookery
during the voyage of ferdinand magellan around the globe 18 hourglasses from barcelona were in the ship's inventory after the trip being authorized by emperor charles v it was the job of a ship's page to turn the hourglasses and thus provide the times for the ship's log noon was the reference time for navigation which did not depend on the glass as the sun would be at its zenith a number of sandglasses could be fixed in a common frame each with a different operating time e.g as in a four-way italian sandglass likely from the 17th century in the collections of the science museum in south kensington london which could measure intervals of quarter half three-quarters and one hour (and which were also used in churches for priests and ministers to measure lengths of sermons)
=== modern practical uses ===
while they are no longer widely used for keeping time some institutions do maintain them both houses of the australian parliament use three hourglasses to time certain procedures such as divisions
the sandglass is still widely used as the kitchen egg timer for cooking eggs a three-minute timer is typical hence the name egg timer for three-minute hourglasses egg timers are sold widely as souvenirs sand timers are also sometimes used in games such as pictionary and boggle to implement a time constraint on rounds of play and provide a sense of urgency to the game of quicksand
== symbolic uses ==
unlike most other methods of measuring time the hourglass concretely represents the present as being between the past and the future and this has made it an enduring symbol of time itself
the hourglass sometimes with the addition of metaphorical wings is often depicted as a symbol that human existence is fleeting and that the sands of time will run out for every human life it was used thus on pirate flags to strike fear into the hearts of the pirates victims in england hourglasses were sometimes placed in coffins and they have graced gravestones for centuries the hourglass was also used in alchemy as a symbol for hour
the former metropolitan borough of greenwich in london used an hourglass on its coat of arms symbolising greenwich's role as the origin of gmt the district's successor the royal borough of greenwich uses two hourglasses on its coat of arms
=== modern symbolic uses ===
recognition of the hourglass as a symbol of time has survived its obsolescence as a timekeeper for example the american television soap opera days of our lives since its first broadcast in 1965 has displayed an hourglass in its opening credits with the narration like sands through the hourglass so are the days of our lives, spoken by macdonald carey
various computer graphical user interfaces may change the pointer to an hourglass during a period when the program is in the middle of a task and may not accept user input during that period other programs for example in different windows may work normally when such an hourglass does not disappear it suggests a program is in an infinite loop and needs to be terminated or is waiting for some external event (such as the user inserting a cd) unicode has an hourglass symbol at u+231b ()
== hourglass motif ==
because of its symmetry graphic signs resembling an hourglass are seen in the art of cultures which never encountered such objects vertical pairs of triangles joined at the apex are common in native american art both in north america where it can represent for example the body of the thunderbird or (in more elongated form) an enemy scalp and in south america where it is believed to represent a chuncho jungle dweller in zulu textiles they symbolise a married man as opposed to a pair of triangles joined at the base which symbolise a married woman neolithic examples can be seen among spanish cave paintings observers have even given the name hourglass motif to shapes which have more complex symmetry such as a repeating circle and cross pattern from the solomon islands both the members of project tic toc,from television series the time tunnel and the challengers of the unknown use symbols of the hourglasse representing either time travel or time running out
