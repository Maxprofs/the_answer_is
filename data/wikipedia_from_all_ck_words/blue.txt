blue is the colour between violet and green on the optical spectrum of visible light human eyes perceive blue when observing light with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometres blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength gradually look more violet while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green pure blue in the middle has a wavelength of 470 nanometres in painting and traditional colour theory blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments along with red and yellow which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours red and blue mixed together form violet blue and yellow together form green blue is also a primary colour in the rgb colour model used to create all the colours on the screen of a television or computer monitor
the modern english word blue comes from middle english bleu or blewe from the old french bleu a word of germanic origin related to the old high german word blao the clear sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as rayleigh scattering when sunlight passes through the atmosphere the blue wavelengths are scattered more widely by the oxygen and nitrogen molecules and more blue comes to our eyes rayleigh scattering also explains blue eyes there is no blue pigment in blue eyes distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called atmospheric perspective
blue has been used for art decoration and as a clothing dye since ancient times the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli coming from mines in afghanistan was used in ancient egypt for jewelry and ornament and later in the renaissance to make the pigment ultramarine the most expensive of all pigments in the middle ages cobalt blue was used to colour the stained glass windows of cathedrals beginning in the 9th century chinese artists used cobalt to make fine blue and white porcelain blue dyes for clothing were made from woad in europe and indigo in asia and africa in 1828 a synthetic ultramarine pigment was developed and synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced mineral pigments and vegetable dyes pierre-auguste renoir vincent van gogh and other late 19th century painters used ultramarine and cobalt blue not just to depict nature but to create moods and emotions in the late 18th century and 19th century blue became a popular colour for military uniforms and police uniforms in the 20th century because blue was commonly associated with harmony it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the united nations and the european union toward the end of the 20th century dark blue replaced black and grey as the most common colour for business suits because it was seen as serious without being grim
surveys in the us and europe show that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony faithfulness confidence distance infinity the imagination cold and sometimes with sadness in us and european public opinion polls it is overwhelmingly the most popular colour chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour
== shades and variations ==
blue is the colour of light between violet and green on the visible spectrum hues of blue include indigo and ultramarine closer to violet pure blue without any mixture of other colours cyan which is midway on the spectrum between blue and green and the other blue-greens turquoise teal and aquamarine
blues also vary in shade or tint darker shades of blue contain black or grey while lighter tints contain white darker shades of blue include ultramarine cobalt blue navy blue and prussian blue while lighter tints include sky blue azure and egyptian blue (for a more complete list see the list of colours)
blue pigments were originally made from minerals such as lapis lazuli cobalt and azurite and blue dyes were made from plants usually woad in europe and indigofera tinctoria or true indigo in asia and africa today most blue pigments and dyes are made by a chemical process
== etymology and linguistic differences ==
the modern english word blue comes from middle english bleu or blewe from the old french bleu a word of germanic origin related to the old high german word blao in heraldry the word azure is used for blue
in russian and some other languages there is no single word for blue but rather different words for light blue ( goluboy) and dark blue ( siniy) see colour term
several languages including japanese thai korean and lakota sioux use the same word to describe blue and green for example in vietnamese the colour of both tree leaves and the sky is xanh in japanese the word for blue ( ao) is often used for colours that english speakers would refer to as green such as the colour of a traffic signal meaning go (for more on this subject see distinguishing blue from green in language)
== history ==
=== in the ancient world ===
blue was a latecomer among colours used in art and decoration as well as language and literature reds blacks browns and ochres are found in cave paintings from the upper paleolithic period but not blue blue was also not used for dyeing fabric until long after red ochre pink and purple this is probably due to the perennial difficulty of making good blue dyes and pigments the earliest known blue dyes were made from plants woad in europe indigo in asia and africa while blue pigments were made from minerals usually either lapis lazuli or azurite
lapis lazuli a semi-precious stone has been mined in afghanistan for more than three thousand years and was exported to all parts of the ancient world in iran and mesopotamia it was used to make jewellery and vessels in egypt it was used for the eyebrows on the funeral mask of king tutankhamun (13411323 bc)
the cost of importing lapis lazuli by caravan across the desert from afghanistan to egypt was extremely high beginning in about 2500 bc the ancient egyptians began to produce their own blue pigment known as egyptian blue made by grinding silica lime copper and alkalai and heating it to 800 or 900 c (1,470 or 1,650 f) this is considered the first synthetic pigment egyptian blue was used to paint wood papyrus and canvas and was used to colour a glaze to make faience beads inlays and pots it was particularly used in funeral statuary and figurines and in tomb paintings blue was considered a beneficial colour which would protect the dead against evil in the afterlife blue dye was also used to colour the cloth in which mummies were wrapped
in egypt blue was associated with the sky and with divinity the egyptian god amun could make his skin blue so that he could fly invisible across the sky blue could also protect against evil many people around the mediterranean still wear a blue amulet representing the eye of god to protect them from misfortune
blue glass was manufactured in mesopotamia and egypt as early as 2500 bc using the same copper ingredients as egyptian blue pigment they also added cobalt which produced a deeper blue the same blue produced in the middle ages in the stained glass windows of the cathedrals of saint-denis and chartres
the ishtar gate of ancient babylon (604562 bc) was decorated with deep blue glazed bricks used as a background for pictures of lions dragons and aurochs
the ancient greeks classified colours by whether they were light or dark rather than by their hue the greek word for dark blue kyaneos could also mean dark green violet black or brown the ancient greek word for a light blue glaukos also could mean light green grey or yellow
the greeks imported indigo dye from india calling it indikon they used egyptian blue in the wall paintings of knossos in crete (2100 bc) it was not one of the four primary colours for greek painting described by pliny the elder (red yellow black and white) but nonetheless it was used as a background colour behind the friezes on greek temples and to colour the beards of greek statues
the romans also imported indigo dye but blue was the colour of working class clothing the nobles and rich wore white black red or violet blue was considered the colour of mourning it was also considered the colour of barbarians julius caesar reported that the celts and germans dyed their faces blue to frighten their enemies and tinted their hair blue when they grew old
nonetheless the romans made extensive use of blue for decoration according to vitruvius they made dark blue pigment from indigo and imported egyptian blue pigment the walls of roman villas in pompeii had frescoes of brilliant blue skies and blue pigments were found in the shops of colour merchants the romans had many different words for varieties of blue including caeruleus caesius glaucus cyaneus lividus venetus aerius and ferreus but two words both of foreign origin became the most enduring blavus from the germanic word blau which eventually became bleu or blue and azureus from the arabic word lazaward which became azure
=== in the byzantine empire and the islamic world ===
dark blue was widely used in the decoration of churches in the byzantine empire in byzantine art christ and the virgin mary usually wore dark blue or purple blue was used as a background colour representing the sky in the magnificent mosaics which decorated byzantine churches
in the islamic world blue was of secondary importance to green believed to be the favourite colour of the prophet mohammed at certain times in moorish spain and other parts of the islamic world blue was the colour worn by christians and jews because only muslims were allowed to wear white and green dark blue and turquoise decorative tiles were widely used to decorate the facades and interiors of mosques and palaces from spain to central asia lapis lazuli pigment was also used to create the rich blues in persian miniatures
=== during the middle ages ===
in the art and life of europe during the early middle ages blue played a minor role the nobility wore red or purple while only the poor wore blue clothing coloured with poor-quality dyes made from the woad plant blue played no part in the rich costumes of the clergy or the architecture or decoration of churches this changed dramatically between 1130 and 1140 in paris when the abbe suger rebuilt the saint denis basilica he installed stained glass windows coloured with cobalt which combined with the light from the red glass filled the church with a bluish violet light the church became the marvel of the christian world and the colour became known as the bleu de saint-denis in the years that followed even more elegant blue stained glass windows were installed in other churches including at chartres cathedral and sainte-chapelle in paris
another important factor in the increased prestige of the colour blue in the 12th century was the veneration of the virgin mary and a change in the colours used to depict her clothing in earlier centuries her robes had usually been painted in sombre black grey violet dark green or dark blue in the 12th century the roma catholic church dictated that the painters in italy first and the rest of europe consequently would have painted the holy virgin's shall with the new most expensive pigment imported from asia ultramarine blue became associated with holiness humility and virtue
ultramarine was made from lapis lazuli from the mines of badakshan in the mountains of afghanistan near the source of the oxus river the mines were visited by marco polo in about 1271 he reported here is found a high mountain from which they extract the finest and most beautiful of blues. ground lapis was used in byzantine manuscripts as early as the 6th century but it was impure and varied greatly in colour ultramarine refined out the impurities through a long and difficult process creating a rich and deep blue it was called bleu outremer in french and blu oltremare in italian since it came from the other side of the sea it cost far more than any other colour and it became the luxury colour for the kings and princes of europe
king louis ix of france better known as saint louis (12141270) became the first king of france to regularly dress in blue this was copied by other nobles paintings of the mythical king arthur began to show him dressed in blue the coat of arms of the kings of france became an azure or light blue shield sprinkled with golden fleur-de-lis or lilies blue had come from obscurity to become the royal colour
once blue became the colour of the king it also became the colour of the wealthy and powerful in europe in the middle ages in france and to some extent in italy the dyeing of blue cloth was subject to license from the crown or state in italy the dyeing of blue was assigned to a specific guild the tintori di guado and could not be done by anyone else without severe penalty the wearing of blue implied some dignity and some wealth
besides ultramarine several other blues were widely used in the middle ages and later in the renaissance azurite a form of copper carbonate was often used as a substitute for ultramarine the romans used it under the name lapis armenius or armenian stone the british called it azure of amayne or german azure the germans themselves called it bergblau or mountain stone it was mined in france hungary spain and germany and it made a pale blue with a hint of green which was ideal for painting skies it was a favourite background colour of the german painter albrecht drer
another blue often used in the middle ages was called tournesol or folium it was made from the plant crozophora tinctoria which grew in the south of france it made a fine transparent blue valued in medieval manuscripts
another common blue pigment was smalt which was made by grinding blue cobalt glass into a fine powder it made a deep violet blue similar to ultramarine and was vivid in frescoes but it lost some of its brilliance in oil paintings it became especially popular in the 17th century when ultramarine was difficult to obtain it was employed at times by titian tintoretto veronese el greco van dyck rubens and rembrandt
=== in the european renaissance ===
in the renaissance a revolution occurred in painting artists began to paint the world as it was actually seen with perspective depth shadows and light from a single source artists had to adapt their use of blue to the new rules in medieval paintings blue was used to attract the attention of the viewer to the virgin mary and identify her in renaissance paintings artists tried to create harmonies between blue and red lightening the blue with lead white paint and adding shadows and highlights raphael was a master of this technique carefully balancing the reds and the blues so no one colour dominated the picture
ultramarine was the most prestigious blue of the renaissance and patrons sometimes specified that it be used in paintings they commissioned the contract for the madone des harpies by andrea del sarto (1514) required that the robe of the virgin mary be coloured with ultramarine costing at least five good florins an ounce. good ultramarine was more expensive than gold in 1508 the german painter albrecht drer reported in a letter that he had paid twelve ducats- the equivalent of forty-one grams of gold - for just thirty grams of ultramarine
often painters or clients saved money by using less expensive blues such as azurite smalt or pigments made with indigo but this sometimes caused problems pigments made from azurite were less expensive but tended to turn dark and green with time an example is the robe of the virgin mary in the madonna enthroned with saints by raphael in the metropolitan museum in new york the virgin mary's azurite blue robe has degraded into a greenish-black
the introduction of oil painting changed the way colours looked and how they were used ultramarine pigment for instance was much darker when used in oil painting than when used in tempera painting in frescoes to balance their colours renaissance artists like raphael added white to lighten the ultramarine the sombre dark blue robe of the virgin mary became a brilliant sky blue titian created his rich blues by using many thin glazes of paint of different blues and violets which allowed the light to pass through which made a complex and luminous colour like stained glass he also used layers of finely ground or coarsely ground ultramarine which gave subtle variations to the blue
=== blue and white porcelain ===
in about the 9th century chinese artisans abandoned the han blue colour they had used for centuries and began to use cobalt blue made with cobalt salts of alumina to manufacture fine blue and white porcelain the plates and vases were shaped dried the paint applied with a brush covered with a clear glaze then fired at a high temperature beginning in the 14th century this type of porcelain was exported in large quantity to europe where it inspired a whole style of art called chinoiserie european courts tried for many years to imitate chinese blue and white porcelain but only succeeded in the 18th century after a missionary brought the secret back from china
other famous white and blue patterns appeared in delft meissen staffordshire and saint petersburg russia
=== the war of the blues indigo versus woad ===
while blue was an expensive and prestigious colour in european painting it became a common colour for clothing during the renaissance the rise of the colour blue in fashion in the 12th and 13th centuries led to the creation of a thriving blue dye industry in several european cities notably amiens toulouse and erfurt they made a dye called pastel from woad a plant common in europe which had been used to make blue dye by the celts and german tribes blue became a colour worn by domestics and artisans not just nobles in 1570 when pope pius v listed the colours that could be used for ecclesiastical dress and for altar decoration he excluded blue because he considered it too common
the process of making blue with woad was particularly long and noxious- it involved soaking the leaves of the plant for from three days to a week in human urine ideally urine from men who had been drinking a great deal of alcohol which was said to improve the colour the fabric was then soaked for a day in the urine then put out in the sun where as it dried it turned blue
the pastel industry was threatened in the 15th century by the arrival from india of new blue dye indigo made from a shrub widely grown in asia indigo blue had the same chemical composition as woad but it was more concentrated and produced a richer and more stable blue in 1498 vasco de gama opened a trade route to import indigo from india to europe in india the indigo leaves were soaked in water fermented pressed into cakes dried into bricks then carried to the ports london marseille genoa and bruges later in the 17th century the british spanish and dutch established indigo plantations in jamaica south carolina the virgin islands and south america and began to import american indigo to europe
the countries with large and prosperous pastel industries tried to block the use of indigo the german government outlawed the use of indigo in 1577 describing it as a pernicious deceitful and corrosive substance the devil's dye. in france henry iv in an edict of 1609 forbade under pain of death the use of the false and pernicious indian drug it was forbidden in england until 1611 when british traders established their own indigo industry in india and began to import it into europe
the efforts to block indigo were in vain the quality of indigo blue was too high and the price too low for pastel made from woad to compete in 1737 both the french and german governments finally allowed the use of indigo this ruined the dye industries in toulouse and the other cities that produced pastel but created a thriving new indigo commerce to seaports such as bordeaux nantes and marseille
another war of the blues took place at the end of the 19th century between indigo and the new synthetic indigo first discovered in 1868 by the german chemist johann friedrich wilhelm adolf von baeyer the german chemical firm basf put the new dye on the market in 1897 in direct competition with the british-run indigo industry in india which produced most of the world's indigo in 1897 britain sold ten thousand tons of natural indigo on the world market while basf sold six hundred tons of synthetic indigo the british industry cut prices and reduced the salaries of its workers but it was unable to compete the synthetic indigo was more pure made a more lasting blue and was not dependent upon good or bad harvests in 1911 india sold only 660 tons of natural indigo while basf sold 22,000 tons of synthetic indigo
not long after the battle between natural and synthetic indigo chemists discovered a new synthetic blue dye called indanthrene which made a blue which did not fade by the 1950s almost all fabrics including blue jeans were dyed with the new synthetic dye in 1970 basf stopped making synthetic indigo and switched to newer synthetic blues
=== the blue uniform ===
in the 17th century frederick william elector of brandenburg was one of the first rulers to give his army blue uniforms the reasons were economic the german states were trying to protect their pastel dye industry against competition from imported indigo dye when brandenburg became the kingdom of prussia in 1701 the uniform colour was adopted by the prussian army most german soldiers wore dark blue uniforms until the first world war with the exception of the bavarians who wore light blue
thanks in part to the availability of indigo dye the 18th century saw the widespread use of blue military uniforms prior to 1748 british naval officers simply wore upper-class civilian clothing and wigs in 1748 the british uniform for naval officers was officially established as an embroidered coat of the colour then called marine blue now known as navy blue when the continental navy of the united states was created in 1775 it largely copied the british uniform and colour
in the late 18th century the blue uniform became a symbol of liberty and revolution in october 1774 even before the united states declared its independence george mason and one hundred virginia neighbours of george washington organised a voluntary militia unit (the fairfax county independent company of volunteers) and elected washington the honorary commander for their uniforms they chose blue and buff the colours of the whig party the opposition party in england whose policies were supported by george washington and many other patriots in the american colonies
when the continental army was established in 1775 at the outbreak of the american revolution the first continental congress declared that the official uniform colour would be brown but this was not popular with many militias whose officers were already wearing blue in 1778 the congress asked george washington to design a new uniform and in 1779 washington made the official colour of all uniforms blue and buff blue continued to be the colour of the field uniform of the us army until 1902 and is still the colour of the dress uniform
in france the gardes franaises the elite regiment which protected louis xvi wore dark blue uniforms with red trim in 1789 the soldiers gradually changed their allegiance from the king to the people and they played a leading role in the storming of the bastille after the fall of bastille a new armed force the garde nationale was formed under the command of the marquis de lafayette who had served with george washington in america lafayette gave the garde nationale dark blue uniforms similar to those of the continental army blue became the colour of the revolutionary armies opposed to the white uniforms of the royalists and the austrians
napoleon bonaparte abandoned many of the doctrines of the french revolution but he kept blue as the uniform colour for his army although he had great difficulty obtaining the blue dye since the british controlled the seas and blocked the importation of indigo to france napoleon was forced to dye uniforms with woad which had an inferior blue colour the french army wore a dark blue uniform coat with red trousers until 1915 when it was found to be a too visible target on the battlefields of world war i it was replaced with uniforms of a light blue-grey colour called horizon blue
blue was the colour of liberty and revolution in the 18th century but in the 19th it increasingly became the colour of government authority the uniform colour of policemen and other public servants it was considered serious and authoritative without being menacing in 1829 when robert peel created the first london metropolitan police he made the colour of the uniform jacket a dark almost black blue to make the policemen look different from soldiers who until then had patrolled the streets the traditional blue jacket with silver buttons of the london bobbie was not abandoned until the mid-1990s when it was replaced by a light blue shirt and a jumper or sweater of the colour officially known as nato blue
the new york city police department modelled after the london metropolitan police was created in 1844 and in 1853 they were officially given a navy blue uniform the colour they wear today
=== the search for the perfect blue ===
during the 17th and 18th centuries chemists in europe tried to discover a way to create synthetic blue pigments avoiding the expense of importing and grinding lapis lazuli azurite and other minerals the egyptians had created a synthetic colour egyptian blue three thousand years bc but the formula had been lost the chinese had also created synthetic pigments but the formula was not known in the west
in 1709 a german druggist and pigment maker named diesbach accidentally discovered a new blue while experimenting with potassium and iron sulphides the new colour was first called berlin blue but later became known as prussian blue by 1710 it was being used by the french painter antoine watteau and later his successor nicolas lancret it became immensely popular for the manufacture of wallpaper and in the 19th century was widely used by french impressionist painters
beginning in the 1820s prussian blue was imported into japan through the port of nagasaki it was called bero-ai or berlin blue and it became popular because it did not fade like traditional japanese blue pigment ai-gami made from the dayflower prussian blue was used by both hokusai in his famous wave paintings and hiroshige
in 1824 the societ pour l'encouragement d'industrie in france offered a prize for the invention of an artificial ultramarine which could rival the natural colour made from lapis lazuli the prize was won in 1826 by a chemist named jean baptiste guimet but he refused to reveal the formula of his colour in 1828 another scientist christian gmelin then a professor of chemistry in tbingen found the process and published his formula this was the beginning of new industry to manufacture artificial ultramarine which eventually almost completely replaced the natural product
in 1878 a german chemist named a von baeyer discovered a synthetic substitute for indigotine the active ingredient of indigo this product gradually replaced natural indigo and after the end of the first world war it brought an end to the trade of indigo from the east and west indies
in 1901 a new synthetic blue dye called indanthrone blue was invented which had even greater resistance to fading during washing or in the sun this dye gradually replaced artificial indigo whose production ceased in about 1970 today almost all blue clothing is dyed with an indanthrone blue
=== the impressionist painters ===
the invention of new synthetic pigments in the 18th and 19th centuries considerably brightened and expanded the palette of painters j.m.w turner experimented with the new cobalt blue and of the twenty colours most used by the impressionists twelve were new and synthetic colours including cobalt blue ultramarine and cerulean blue
another important influence on painting in the 19th century was the theory of complementary colours developed by the french chemist michel eugene chevreul in 1828 and published in 1839 he demonstrated that placing complementary colours such as blue and yellow-orange or ultramarine and yellow next to each other heightened the intensity of each colour to the apogee of their tonality. in 1879 an american physicist ogden rood published a book charting the complementary colours of each colour in the spectrum this principle of painting was used by claude monet in his impression sunrise fog (1872) where he put a vivid blue next to a bright orange sun (1872) and in rgate argenteuil (1872) where he painted an orange sun against blue water the colours brighten each other renoir used the same contrast of cobalt blue water and an orange sun in canotage sur la seine (18791880) both monet and renoir liked to use pure colours without any blending
monet and the impressionists were among the first to observe that shadows were full of colour in his la gare saint-lazare the grey smoke vapour and dark shadows are actually composed of mixtures of bright pigment including cobalt blue cerulean blue synthetic ultramarine emerald green guillet green chrome yellow vermilion and ecarlate red blue was a favourite colour of the impressionist painters who used it not just to depict nature but to create moods feelings and atmospheres cobalt blue a pigment of cobalt oxide-aluminium oxide was a favourite of auguste renoir and vincent van gogh it was similar to smalt a pigment used for centuries to make blue glass but it was much improved by the french chemist louis jacques thnard who introduced it in 1802 it was very stable but extremely expensive van gogh wrote to his brother theo cobalt [blue] is a divine colour and there is nothing so beautiful for putting atmosphere around things 
van gogh described to his brother theo how he composed a sky the dark blue sky is spotted with clouds of an even darker blue than the fundamental blue of intense cobalt and others of a lighter blue like the bluish white of the milky way  the sea was very dark ultramarine the shore a sort of violet and of light red as i see it and on the dunes a few bushes of prussian blue.
=== the blue suit ===
blue had first become the high fashion colour of the wealthy and powerful in europe in the 13th century when it was worn by louis ix of france better known as saint louis (1214-1270) wearing blue implied dignity and wealth and blue clothing was restricted to the nobility however blue was replaced by black as the power colour in the 14th century when european princes and then merchants and bankers wanted to show their seriousness dignity and devoutness (see black)
blue gradually returned to court fashion in the 17th century as part of a palette of peacock-bright colours shown off in extremely elaborate costumes the modern blue business suit has its roots in england in the middle of the 17th century following the london plague of 1665 and the london fire of 1666 king charles ii of england ordered that his courtiers wear simple coats waistcoats and breeches and the palette of colours became blue grey white and buff widely imitated this style of men's fashion became almost a uniform of the london merchant class and the english country gentleman
during the american revolution the leader of the whig party in england charles james fox wore a blue coat and buff waistcoat and breeches the colours of the whig party and of the uniform of george washington whose principles he supported the men's suit followed the basic form of the military uniforms of the time particularly the uniforms of the cavalry
in the early 19th century during the regency of the future king george iv the blue suit was revolutionised by a courtier named george beau brummel brummel created a suit that closely fitted the human form the new style had a long tail coat cut to fit the body and long tight trousers to replace the knee-length breeches and stockings of the previous century he used plain colours such as blue and grey to concentrate attention on the form of the body not the clothes brummel observed if people turn to look at you in the street you are not well dressed. this fashion was adopted by the prince regent then by london society and the upper classes originally the coat and trousers were different colours but in the 19th century the suit of a single colour became fashionable by the late 19th century the black suit had become the uniform of businessmen in england and america in the 20th century the black suit was largely replaced by the dark blue or grey suit
=== in the 20th and 21st century ===
at the beginning of the 20th century many artists recognised the emotional power of blue and made it the central element of paintings during his blue period (19011904) pablo picasso used blue and green with hardly any warm colours to create a melancholy mood in russia the symbolist painter pavel kuznetsov and the blue rose art group (19061908) used blue to create a fantastic and exotic atmosphere in germany wassily kandinsky and other russian migrs formed the art group called der blaue reiter (the blue rider) and used blue to symbolise spirituality and eternity henri matisse used intense blues to express the emotions he wanted viewers to feel matisse wrote a certain blue penetrates your soul.
in the art of the second half of the 20th century painters of the abstract expressionist movement began to use blue and other colours in pure form without any attempt to represent anything to inspire ideas and emotions painter mark rothko observed that colour was only an instrument; his interest was in expressing human emotions tragedy ecstasy doom and so on.
in fashion blue particularly dark blue was seen as a colour which was serious but not grim in the mid-20th century blue passed black as the most common colour of men's business suits the costume usually worn by political and business leaders public opinion polls in the united states and europe showed that blue was the favourite colour of over fifty per cent of respondents green was far behind with twenty per cent while white and red received about eight per cent each
in 1873 a german immigrant in san francisco levi strauss invented a sturdy kind of work trousers made of denim fabric and coloured with indigo dye called blue jeans in 1935 they were raised to the level of high fashion by vogue magazine beginning in the 1950s they became an essential part of uniform of young people in the united states europe and around the world
blue was also seen as a colour which was authoritative without being threatening following the second world war blue was adopted as the colour of important international organisations including the united nations the council of europe unesco the european union and nato united nations peacekeepers wear blue helmets to stress their peacekeeping role blue is used by the nato military symbols for land based systems to denote friendly forces hence the term blue on blue for friendly fire and blue force tracking for location of friendly units the people's liberation army of china (formerly known as the red army") uses the term blue army to refer to hostile forces during exercises
the 20th century saw the invention of new ways of creating blue such as chemiluminescence making blue light through a chemical reaction
in the 20th century it also became possible to own your own colour of blue the french artist yves klein with the help of a french paint dealer created a specific blue called international klein blue which he patented it was made of ultramarine combined with a resin called rhodopa which gave it a particularly brilliant colour the baseball team the los angeles dodgers developed its own blue called dodger blue and several american universities invented new blues for their colours
with the dawn of the world wide web blue has become the standard colour for hyperlinks in graphic browsers (though in most browsers links turn purple if you visit their target) to make their presence within text obvious to readers

=== optics ===
human eyes perceive blue when observing light which has a wavelength between 450-495 nanometres blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength gradually look more violet while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green pure blue in the middle has a wavelength of 470 nanometres
isaac newton included blue as one of the seven colours in his first description the visible spectrum he chose seven colours because that was the number of notes in the musical scale which he believed was related to the optical spectrum he included indigo the hue between blue and violet as one of the separate colours though today it is usually considered a hue of blue
in painting and traditional colour theory blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments (red yellow blue) which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours red and blue mixed together form violet blue and yellow together form green mixing all three primary colours together produces a dark grey from the renaissance onwards painters used this system to create their colours (see ryb colour system.)
the ryb model was used for colour printing by jacob christoph le blon as early as 1725 later printers discovered that more accurate colours could be created by using combinations of magenta cyan yellow and black ink put onto separate inked plates and then overlaid one at a time onto paper this method could produce almost all the colours in the spectrum with reasonable accuracy
in the 19th century the scottish physicist james clerk maxwell found a new way of explaining colours by the wavelength of their light he showed that white light could be created by combining red blue and green light and that virtually all colours could be made by different combinations of these three colours his idea called additive colour or the rgb colour model is used today to create colours on televisions and computer screens the screen is covered by tiny pixels each with three fluorescent elements for creating red green and blue light if the red blue and green elements all glow at once the pixel looks white as the screen is scanned from behind with electrons each pixel creates its own designated colour composing a complete picture on the screen
on the hsv colour wheel the complement of blue is yellow that is a colour corresponding to an equal mixture of red and green light on a colour wheel based on traditional colour theory (ryb) where blue was considered a primary colour its complementary colour is considered to be orange (based on the munsell colour wheel)

of the colours in the visible spectrum of light blue has a very short wavelength while red has the longest wavelength when sunlight passes through the atmosphere the blue wavelengths are scattered more widely by the oxygen and nitrogen molecules and more blue comes to our eyes this effect is called rayleigh scattering after lord rayleigh the british physicist who discovered it it was confirmed by albert einstein in 1911
near sunrise and sunset most of the light we see comes in nearly tangent to the earth's surface so that the light's path through the atmosphere is so long that much of the blue and even green light is scattered out leaving the sun rays and the clouds it illuminates red therefore when looking at the sunset and sunrise you will see the colour red more than any of the other colours
the sea is seen as blue for largely the same reason the water absorbs the longer wavelengths of red and reflects and scatters the blue which comes to the eye of the viewer the colour of the sea is also affected by the colour of the sky reflected by particles in the water and by algae and plant life in the water which can make it look green or by sediment which can make it look brown
=== atmospheric perspective ===
the farther away an object is the more blue it often appears to the eye for example mountains in the distance often appear blue this is the effect of atmospheric perspective the farther an object is away from the viewer the less contrast there is between the object and its background colour which is usually blue in a painting where different parts of the composition are blue green and red the blue will appear to be more distant and the red closer to the viewer the cooler a colour is the more distant it seems
=== blue eyes ===
blue eyes do not actually contain any blue pigment eye colour is determined by two factors the pigmentation of the eye's iris and the scattering of light by the turbid medium in the stroma of the iris in humans the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black the appearance of blue green and hazel eyes results from the rayleigh scattering of light in the stroma an optical effect similar to that which accounts for the blueness of the sky the irises of the eyes of people with blue eyes contain less dark melanin than those of people with brown eyes which means that they absorb less short-wavelength blue light which is instead reflected out to the viewer eye colour also varies depending on the lighting conditions especially for lighter-coloured eyes
blue eyes are most common in ireland the baltic sea area and northern europe and are also found in eastern central and southern europe blue eyes are also found in parts of western asia most notably in afghanistan syria iraq and iran in estonia 99% of people have blue eyes in denmark 30 years ago only 8% of the population had brown eyes though through immigration today that number is about 11% in germany about 75% have blue eyes
in the united states as of 2006 one out of every six people or 16.6% of the total population and 22.3% of the white population have blue eyes compared with about half of americans born in 1900 and a third of americans born in 1950 blue eyes are becoming less common among american children in the us boys are 3-5 per cent more likely to have blue eyes than girls
=== lasers ===
lasers emitting in the blue region of the spectrum became widely available to the public in 2010 with the release of inexpensive high-powered 445-447 nm laser diode technology previously the blue wavelengths were accessible only through dpss which are comparatively expensive and inefficient however these technologies are still widely used by the scientific community for applications including optogenetics raman spectroscopy and particle image velocimetry due to their superior beam quality blue gas lasers are also still commonly used for holography dna sequencing optical pumping and other scientific and medical applications
