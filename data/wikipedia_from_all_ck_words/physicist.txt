a physicist is a scientist who specializes in physics research physicists study a wide range of physical phenomena in many branches of physics spanning all length scales from sub-atomic particles of which all ordinary matter is made (particle physics) to the behavior of the material universe as a whole (cosmology)
the term physicist was coined by william whewell in his 1840 book the philosophy of the inductive sciences
== education ==
most material a student encounters in the undergraduate physics curriculum is based on discoveries and insights of a century or more in the past alhazen's intromission theory of light was formulated in the 11th century newton's laws of motion and newton's law of universal gravitation were formulated in the 17th century maxwell's equations 19th century and quantum mechanics early 20th century the undergraduate physics curriculum generally includes the following range of courses chemistry classical physics kinematics astronomy and astrophysics physics laboratory electricity and magnetism thermodynamics optics modern physics quantum physics nuclear physics particle physics and solid state physics undergraduate physics students must also take extensive mathematics courses (calculus differential equations linear algebra complex analysis etc.) and computer science and programming undergraduate physics students often perform research with faculty members
many positions especially in research require a doctoral degree at the master's level and higher students tend to specialize in a particular field fields of specialization include experimental and theoretical astrophysics atomic physics molecular physics biophysics chemical physics medical physics condensed matter physics cosmology geophysics gravitational physics material science nuclear physics optics particle physics and plasma physics post-doctoral experience may be required for certain positions
== honors and awards ==
the highest honor awarded to physicists is the nobel prize in physics awarded since 1901 by the royal swedish academy of sciences
== employment ==
the three major employers of career physicists are academic institutions government laboratories and private industries with the largest employer being the last many trained physicists however apply their skills to other activities in particular to engineering computing and finance often quite successfully some physicists take up additional careers where their knowledge of physics can be combined with further training in other disciplines such as patent law in industry or private practice in the united states a majority of those in the private sections having a physics degree actually work outside the fields of physics astronomy and engineering altogether
nobel laureate sir joseph rotblat has suggested that physicists going into employment in scientific research should honour a hippocratic oath for scientists
