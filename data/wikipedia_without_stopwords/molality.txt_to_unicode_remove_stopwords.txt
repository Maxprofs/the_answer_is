molality also called molal concentration measure concentration solute solution terms amount substance specified amount mass solvent contrasts definition molarity based specified volume solution
commonly used unit molality chemistry molkg solution concentration molkg also sometimes denoted molal
definitionedit
molality b solution defined amount substance mol solute divided mass kg solvent
originedit
term molality formed analogy molarity molar concentration solution earliest intensive property molality adjectival unit nowdeprecated molal appears published g n lewis m randall publication thermodynamics free energies chemical substances though two terms subject confused one another molality molarity weak aqueous solution nearly one kilogram water solvent occupies volume liter room temperature small amount solute little effect volume
unitedit
si unit molality molkg
solution molality molkg often described molal m however following si system units national institute standards technology united states authority measurement considers term molal unit symbol m obsolete suggests molkg related unit si recommendation universally implemented academia yet

advantages
compared molar concentration mass concentration preparation solution given molality requires good scale solvent solute need weighed opposed measured volumetrically would subject variations density due ambient conditions temperature pressure advantage chemical compositions mass amount pure known substance relevant volume contained measured amount substance may change volume ambient conditions amount mass unvarying chemical reactions occur proportions mass volume massbased nature molality implies readily converted mass ratio mass fraction w ratio
symbol m stands molar mass kgmole mole ratio mole fraction x ratio
advantage molality massbased fractions fact molality one solute singlesolvent solution independent presence absence solutes
problem areas
unlike compositional properties listed relation section molality depends choice substance called solvent arbitrary mixture one pure liquid substance mixture choice clear solutions clearcut alcoholwater solution either one could called solvent alloy solid solution clear choice constituents may treated alike situations mass mole fraction preferred compositional specification

example conversionedit
acid mixture consists mass fractions hno hf ho percentages refer mass fractions bottled acids carrying balance ho first step determining mass fractions constituents
approximate molar masses kgmol
first derive molality solvent molkg
use derive others use equal ratios
actually bho cancels needed case direct equation use derive molality hf
