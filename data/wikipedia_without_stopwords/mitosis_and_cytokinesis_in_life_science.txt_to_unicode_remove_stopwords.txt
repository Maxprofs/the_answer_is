overview mitosis
primary result mitosis cytokinesis transfer parent cells genome two daughter cells genome composed number chromosomescomplexes tightly coiled dna contain genetic information vital proper cell function resultant daughter cell genetically identical parent cell parent cell must make copy chromosome mitosis occurs phase interphase chromosome duplication results two identical sister chromatids bound together cohesin proteins centromere
mitosis begins chromosomes condense become visible eukaryotes example animals nuclear envelope segregates dna cytoplasm disintegrates small vesicles nucleolus makes ribosomes cell also disappears microtubules project opposite ends cell attach centromeres align chromosomes centrally within cell microtubules contract pull sister chromatids chromosome apart sister chromatids point called daughter chromosomes cell elongates corresponding daughter chromosomes pulled toward opposite ends cell new nuclear envelope forms around separated daughter chromosomes
mitosis concludes cell may begin cytokinesis animal cells cell membrane pinches inward two developing nuclei produce two new cells plant cells cell plate forms two nucleicytokinesis always occur coenocytic type multinucleate condition cells undergo mitosis without cytokinesis
phases cell cycle mitosis
interphase
mitotic phase relatively short period cell cycle alternates much longer interphase cell prepares process cell division interphase divided three phases g first gap synthesis g second gap three phases cell grows producing proteins cytoplasmic organelles however chromosomes replicated phase thus cell grows g continues grow duplicates chromosomes grows prepares mitosis g finally divides m restarting cycle phases cell cycle highly regulated cyclins cyclindependent kinases cell cycle proteins phases follow one another strict order checkpoints give cell cues proceed one phase another cells may also temporarily permanently leave cell cycle enter g phase stop dividing occur cells become overcrowded densitydependent inhibition differentiate carry specific functions organism case human heart muscle cells neurons g cells ability reenter cell cycle
preprophase plant cells
plant cells prophase preceded preprophase stage highly vacuolated plant cells nucleus migrate center cell mitosis begin achieved formation phragmosome transverse sheet cytoplasm bisects cell along future plane cell division addition phragmosome formation preprophase characterized formation ring microtubules actin filaments called preprophase band underneath plasma membrane around equatorial plane future mitotic spindle band marks position cell eventually divide cells higher plants flowering plants lack centrioles instead microtubules form spindle surface nucleus organized spindle chromosomes nuclear envelope breaks preprophase band disappears nuclear envelope breakdown spindle formation prometaphase
prophase
prophase occurs g interphase cell prepares divide tightly condensing chromosomes initiating mitotic spindle formation process called chromosome condensation interphase genetic material nucleus consists loosely packed chromatin onset prophase chromatin fibers condense discrete chromosomes typically visible high magnification light microscope gene transcription ceases prophase resume late anaphase early g phase nucleolus also disappears early prophase
close nucleus animal cells structures called centrosomes consisting pair centrioles surrounded loose collection proteins centrosome coordinating center cells microtubules cell inherits single centrosome cell division duplicated cell new round mitosis begins giving pair centrosomes two centrosomes polymerize tubulin help form microtubule spindle apparatus motor proteins push centrosomes along microtubules opposite sides cell although centrosomes help organize microtubule assembly essential formation spindle apparatus since absent plants absolutely required animal cell mitosis
prometaphase
beginning prometaphase animal cells phosphorylation nuclear lamins causes nuclear envelope disintegrate small membrane vesicles happens microtubules invade nuclear space called open mitosis occurs multicellular organisms fungi protists algae trichomonads undergo variation called closed mitosis spindle forms inside nucleus microtubules penetrate intact nuclear envelope
late prometaphase kinetochore microtubules begin search attach chromosomal kinetochores kinetochore proteinaceous microtubulebinding structure forms chromosomal centromere late prophase number polar microtubules find interact corresponding polar microtubules opposite centrosome form mitotic spindle although kinetochore structure function fully understood known contains form molecular motor microtubule connects kinetochore motor activates using energy atp crawl tube toward originating centrosome motor activity coupled polymerisation depolymerisation microtubules provides pulling force necessary later separate chromosomes two chromatids
metaphase
microtubules located attached kinetochores prometaphase two centrosomes begin pulling chromosomes towards opposite ends cell resulting tension causes chromosomes align along metaphase plate equatorial plane imaginary line centrally located two centrosomes approximately midline cell ensure equitable distribution chromosomes end mitosis metaphase checkpoint guarantees kinetochores properly attached mitotic spindle chromosomes aligned along metaphase plate cell successfully passes metaphase checkpoint proceeds anaphase
anaphase
anaphase cohesins bind sister chromatids together cleaved forming two identical daughter chromosomes shortening kinetochore microtubules pulls newly formed daughter chromosomes opposite ends cell anaphase b polar microtubules push causing cell elongate animal cells anaphase precedes anaphase b vertebrate egg cells demonstrate opposite order events
telophase
telophase greek word meaning end reversal prophase prometaphase events telophase polar microtubules continue lengthen elongating cell even nuclear envelope broken new nuclear envelope forms using membrane vesicles parent cells old nuclear envelope new envelope forms around set separated daughter chromosomes though membrane enclose centrosomes nucleolus reappears sets chromosomes surrounded new nuclear membrane begin relax decondense mitosis complete daughter nucleus identical set chromosomes cell division may may occur time depending organism
cytokinesis
cytokinesis phase mitosis rather separate process necessary completing cell division animal cells cleavage furrow pinch containing contractile ring develops metaphase plate used pinching separated nuclei animal plant cells cell division also driven vesicles derived golgi apparatus move along microtubules middle cell plants structure coalesces cell plate center phragmoplast develops cell wall separating two nuclei phragmoplast microtubule structure typical higher plants whereas green algae use phycoplast microtubule array cytokinesis daughter cell complete copy genome parent cell end cytokinesis marks end mphase
many cells mitosis cytokinesis occur separately forming single cells multiple nuclei notable occurrence among fungi slime molds coenocytic algae phenomenon found various organisms even animals cytokinesis mitosis may occur independently instance certain stages fruit fly embryonic development
significance
mitosis important maintenance chromosomal set cell formed receives chromosomes alike composition equal number chromosomes parent cell
mitosis occurs following circumstances
development growth
number cells within organism increases mitosis basis development multicellular body single cell ie zygote also basis growth multicellular body
cell replacement
parts body eg skin digestive tract cells constantly sloughed replaced new ones new cells formed mitosis exact copies cells replaced like manner red blood cells short lifespan months new rbcs formed mitosis
regeneration
organisms regenerate body parts production new cells instances achieved mitosis example starfish regenerate lost arms mitosis
asexual reproduction
organisms produce genetically similar offspring asexual reproduction example hydra reproduces asexually budding cells surface hydra undergo mitosis form mass called bud mitosis continues cells bud grows new individual division happens asexual reproduction vegetative propagation plants
cell shape changes mitosis
animal tissue cells round nearspherical shape mitosis epithelia epidermis efficient rounding process correlated proper mitotic spindle alignment subsequent correct positioning daughter cells moreover researchers found rounding heavily suppressed may result spindle defects primarily pole splitting failure efficiently capture chromosomes therefore mitotic cell rounding thought play protective role ensuring accurate mitosis
rounding forces driven reorganization factin myosin actomyosin contractile homogeneous cell cortex rigidifies cell periphery facilitates generation intracellular hydrostatic pressure fold higher interphase generation intracellular pressure particularly critical confinement would important tissue scenario outward forces must produced round surrounding cells andor extracellular matrix generation pressure dependent forminmediated factin nucleation rho kinase rockmediated myosin ii contraction governed upstream signaling pathways rhoa ect activity cdk due importance mitosis molecular components dynamics mitotic actomyosin cortex area active research
errors variations mitosis
errors occur mitosis especially early embryonic development humans mitotic errors create aneuploid cells many one chromosomes condition associated cancer early human embryos cancer cells infected intoxicated cells also suffer pathological division three daughter cells tripolar multipolar mitosis resulting severe errors chromosomal complements
nondisjunction sister chromatids fail separate anaphase one daughter cell receives sister chromatids nondisjoining chromosome cell receives none result former cell gets three copies chromosome condition known trisomy latter one copy condition known monosomy occasion cells experience nondisjunction fail complete cytokinesis retain nuclei one cell resulting binucleated cells
anaphase lag occurs movement one chromatid impeded anaphase may caused failure mitotic spindle properly attach chromosome lagging chromatid excluded nuclei lost therefore one daughter cells monosomic chromosome
endoreduplication endoreplication occurs chromosomes duplicate cell subsequently divide results polyploid cells chromosomes duplicates repeatedly polytene chromosomes endoreduplication found many species appears normal part development endomitosis variant endoreduplication cells replicate chromosomes phase enter prematurely terminate mitosis instead divided two new daughter nuclei replicated chromosomes retained within original nucleus cells reenter g phase replicate chromosomes may occur multiple times increasing chromosome number round replication endomitosis plateletproducing megakaryocytes go endomitosis cell differentiation
