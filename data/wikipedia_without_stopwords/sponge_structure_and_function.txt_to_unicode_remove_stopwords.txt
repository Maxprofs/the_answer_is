spicules structural elements found sponges provide structural support deter predators large spicules visible naked eye referred megascleres smaller microscopic ones termed microscleres
structureedit
spicules found range symmetry types
monaxons form simple cylinders pointed ends ends diactinal monaxons similar whereas monactinal monaxons different ends one pointed one rounded diactinal monaxons classified nature ends oxea pointed ends strongyles rounded spinecovered oxea strongyles termed acanthoxea acanthostrongyles respectively monactical monaxons always one pointed end termed styles end blunt tylostyles blunt end forms knob acanthostyles covered spines
triaxons three axes triods axis bears similar ray pentacts triaxon five rays four lie single plane pinnules pentacts large spines nonplanar ray
tetraxons four axes polyaxons description types incorporated sigmac spicules shape c
dendroclones might unique extinct sponges branching spicules may take irregular forms may form structures y x shape
spicule typesedit
megascleres large spicules measuring m often function main support elements skeleton
acanthostyles spiny styles
anatriaenes orthotriaenes protriaenes triaenes megascleres one long three short rays
strongyles megascleres ends blunt rounded
styles megascleres one end pointed end rounded
tornotes megascleres spear shaped ends
tylotes megascleres knobs ends
microscleres small spicules measuring m scattered throughout tissue part main support element
anisochelas microscleres dissimilar ends
chelae microscleres shovellike structures ends
euasters starshaped microscleres multiple rays radiating common centre
forceps microscleres bent back
isochelas microscleres two similar ends
microstrongyles microscleres ends blunt rounded
oxeas microscleres ends pointed
oxyasters starshaped microscleres thin pointed rays
sigmas c shaped microscleres
spherasters microscleres multiple rays radiating spherical centre
compositionedit
sponges calcareous siliceous composed spongin
functionedit
meshing many spicules serves sponges skeleton
taxonomic importanceedit
composition size shape spicules one largest determining factors sponge taxonomy
formationedit
spicules formed sclerocytes derived archaeocytes sclerocyte begins organic filament adds silica spicules generally elongated rate m per hour spicule reaches certain length protrudes sclerocyte cell body remains within cells membrane occasion sclerocytes may begin second spicule first still progress
