an error (from the latin error meaning wandering") is an action which is inaccurate or incorrect in some usages an error is synonymous with a mistake (for instance a cook who misses a step from a recipe might describe it as either an error or a mistake) though in technical contexts the two are often distinguished for instance in statistics error refers to the difference between the value which has been computed and the correct value
== human behavior ==
one reference differentiates between error and mistake as follows
an error is a deviation from accuracy or correctness a mistake is an error caused by a fault the fault being misjudgment carelessness or forgetfulness now say that i run a stop sign because i was in a hurry and wasn't concentrating and the police stop me that is a mistake if however i try to park in an area with conflicting signs and i get a ticket because i was incorrect on my interpretation of what the signs meant that would be an error the first time it would be an error the second time it would be a mistake since i should have known better
in human behavior the norms or expectations for behavior or its consequences can be derived from the intention of the actor or from the expectations of other individuals or from a social grouping or from social norms (see deviance.) gaffes and faux pas can be labels for certain instances of this kind of error more serious departures from social norms carry labels such as misbehavior and labels from the legal system such as misdemeanor and crime departures from norms connected to religion can have other labels such as sin
=== oral and written language ===
an individual language user's deviations from standard language norms in grammar syntax pronunciation and punctuation are sometimes referred to as errors however in light of the role of language usage in everyday social class distinctions many feel that linguistics should be descriptive rather than prescriptive to avoid reinforcing dominant class value judgments about what linguistic forms should and should not be used one may distinguish various kinds of linguistic errors some such as aphasia or speech disorders where the user is unable to say what they intend to are generally considered errors while cases where natural intended speech is non-standard (as in dialects) are considered correct speech in descriptive linguistics but errors in prescriptive linguistics see also error analysis (linguistics)
=== gaffe ===
a gaffe is a verbal mistake usually made in a social environment the mistake may come from saying something that is true but inappropriate it may also be an erroneous attempt to reveal a truth finally gaffes can be malapropisms grammatical errors or other verbal and gestural weaknesses or revelations through body language actually revealing factual or social truth through words or body language however can commonly result in embarrassment or when the gaffe has negative connotations friction between people involved
philosophers and psychologists interested in the nature of the gaffe include freud and gilles deleuze deleuze in his logic of sense places the gaffe in a developmental process that can culminate in stuttering
as used by some journalists particularly sportswriters gaffe becomes an imagined synonym for any kind of mistake e.g. a dropped ball by a player in a baseball game
=== medicine ===
see medical error for a description of error in medicine
== science and engineering ==
in statistics an error (or residual) is not a mistake but rather a difference between a computed estimated or measured value and the accepted true specified or theoretically correct value
in science and engineering in general an error is defined as a difference between the desired and actual performance or behavior of a system or object this definition is the basis of operation for many types of control systems in which error is defined as the difference between a set point and the process value an example of this would be the thermostat in a home heating systemthe operation of the heating equipment is controlled by the difference (the error) between the thermostat setting and the sensed air temperature another approach is related to considering a scientific hypothesis as true or false giving birth to two types of errors type 1 and type 2 the first one is when a true hypothesis is considered false while the second is the reverse (a false one is considered true)
engineers seek to design devices machines and systems and in such a way as to mitigate or preferably avoid the effects of error whether unintentional or not such errors in a system can be latent design errors that may go unnoticed for years until the right set of circumstances arises that cause them to become active other errors in engineered systems can arise due to human error which includes cognitive bias human factors engineering is often applied to designs in an attempt to minimize this type of error by making systems more forgiving or error-tolerant
(in computational mechanics when solving a system such as ax = b there is a distinction between the error the inaccuracy in x and residualthe inaccuracy in ax.)
== numerical analysis ==
numerical analysis provides a variety of techniques to represent (store) and compute approximations to mathematical numerical values errors arise from a trade-off between efficiency (space and computation time) and precision which is limited anyway since (using common floating-point arithmetic) only a finite amount of values can be represented exactly the discrepancy between the exact mathematical value and the stored/computed value is called the approximation error
== cybernetics ==
the word cybernetics stems from the greek (kybernts steersman governor pilot or rudder the same root as government) in applying corrections to the trajectory or course being steered cybernetics can be seen as the most general approach to error and its correction for the achievement of any goal the term was suggested by norbert wiener to describe a new science of control and information in the animal and the machine wiener's early work was on noise
the cybernetician gordon pask held that the error that drives a servomechanism can be seen as a difference between a pair of analogous concepts in a servomechanism the current state and the goal state later he suggested error can also be seen as an innovation or a contradiction depending on the context and perspective of interacting (observer) participants the founder of management cybernetics stafford beer applied these ideas most notably in his viable system model
== biology ==
in biology an error is said to occur when perfect fidelity is lost in the copying of information for example in an asexually reproducing species an error (or mutation) has occurred for each dna nucleotide that differs between the child and the parent many of these mutations can be harmful but unlike other types of errors some are neutral or even beneficial mutations are an important force driving evolution mutations that make organisms more adapted to their environment increase in the population through natural selection as organisms with favorable mutations have more offspring
== philately ==
in philately an error refers to a postage stamp or piece of postal stationery that exhibits a printing or production mistake that differentiates it from a normal specimen or from the intended result examples are stamps printed in the wrong color or missing one or more colors printed with a vignette inverted in relation to its frame produced without any perforations on one or more sides when the normal stamps are perforated or printed on the wrong type of paper legitimate errors must always be produced and sold unintentionally such errors may or may not be scarce or rare a design error may refer to a mistake in the design of the stamp such as a mislabeled subject even if there are no printing or production mistakes
== law ==
in appellate review error typically refers to mistakes made by a trial court or some other court of first instance in applying the law in a particular legal case this may involve such mistakes as improper admission of evidence inappropriate instructions to the jury or applying the wrong standard of proof
== governmental policy ==
within united states government intelligence agencies such as central intelligence agency agencies error refers to intelligence error as previous assumptions that used to exist at a senior intelligence level within senior intelligence agencies but has since been disproven and is sometimes eventually listed as unclassified and therefore more available to the american public and citizenry of the united states the freedom of information act provides american citizenry with a means to read intelligence reports that were mired in error per united states central intelligence agency's website (as of august 2008) intelligence error is described as
intelligence errors are factual inaccuracies in analysis resulting from poor or missing data intelligence failure is systemic organizational surprise resulting from incorrect missing discarded or inadequate hypotheses.
== numismatics ==
in numismatics an error refers to a coin or medal that has a minting mistake similar to errors found in philately because the u.s bureau of the mint keeps a careful eye on all potential errors errors on u.s coins are very few and usually very scarce examples of numismatic errors extra metal attached to a coin a clipped coin caused by the coin stamp machine stamping a second coin too early double stamping of a coin a coin that has been overdated e.g. 1942/41 is also considered an error
