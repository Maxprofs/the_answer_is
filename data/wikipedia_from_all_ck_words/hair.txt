== historyedit ==
hair was conceived by actors james rado and gerome ragni the two met in 1964 when they performed together in the off-broadway flop hang down your head and die and they began writing hair together in late 1964 the main characters were autobiographical with rado's claude being a pensive romantic and ragni's berger an extrovert their close relationship including its volatility was reflected in the musical rado explained we were great friends it was a passionate kind of relationship that we directed into creativity into writing into creating this piece we put the drama between us on stage.
rado described the inspiration for hair as a combination of some characters we met in the streets people we knew and our own imaginations we knew this group of kids in the east village who were dropping out and dodging the draft and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked out of school for growing their hair long he recalled there was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful we hung out with them and went to their be-ins [and] let our hair grow. many cast members (shelley plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street rado said it was very important historically and if we hadn't written it there'd not be any examples you could read about it and see film clips but you'd never experience it we thought this is happening in the streets, and we wanted to bring it to the stage.
rado and ragni came from different artistic backgrounds in college rado wrote musical revues and aspired to be a broadway composer in the rodgers and hammerstein tradition he went on to study acting with lee strasberg ragni on the other hand was an active member of the open theater one of several groups mostly off-off broadway that were developing experimental theatre techniques he introduced rado to the modern theatre styles and methods being developed at the open theater in 1966 while the two were developing hair ragni performed in the open theater's production of megan terry's play viet rock a story about young men being deployed to the vietnam war in addition to the war theme viet rock employed the improvisational exercises being used in the experimental theatre scene and later used in the development of hair
rado and ragni brought their drafts of the show to producer eric blau who through common friend nat shapiro connected the two with canadian composer galt macdermot macdermot had won a grammy award in 1961 for his composition african waltz (recorded by cannonball adderley) the composer's lifestyle was in marked contrast to his co-creators i had short hair a wife and at that point four children and i lived on staten island. i never even heard of a hippie when i met rado and ragni. but he shared their enthusiasm to do a rock and roll show we work independently, explained macdermot in may 1968 i prefer it that way they hand me the material i set it to music. macdermot wrote the first score in three weeks starting with the songs i got life ain't got no where do i go and the title song he first wrote aquarius as an unconventional art piece but later rewrote it into an uplifting anthem
=== off-broadway productionsedit ===
the creators pitched the show to broadway producers and received many rejections eventually joe papp who ran the new york shakespeare festival decided he wanted hair to open the new public theater (still under construction) in new york city's east village the musical was papp's first non-shakespeare offering the production did not go smoothly the rehearsal and casting process was confused the material itself incomprehensible to many of the theaters staff the director gerald freedman the theater's associate artistic director withdrew in frustration during the final week of rehearsals and offered his resignation papp accepted it and the choreographer anna sokolow took over the show after a disastrous final dress rehearsal papp wired mr freedman in washington where he'd fled please come back. mr freedman did.
hair premiered off-broadway at the public on october 17 1967 and ran for a limited engagement of six weeks the lead roles were played by walker daniels as claude ragni as berger jill o'hara as sheila steve dean as woof arnold wilkerson as hud sally eaton as jeanie and shelley plimpton as crissy set design was by ming cho lee costume design by theoni aldredge and although anna sokolow began rehearsals as choreographer freedman received choreographer credit although the production had a tepid critical reception it was popular with audiences a cast album was released in 1967
chicago businessman michael butler was planning to run for the u.s senate on an anti-war platform after seeing an ad for hair in the new york times that led him to believe the show was about native americans he watched the public's production several times and joined forces with joe papp to reproduce the show at another new york venue after the close of its run at the public papp and butler first moved the show to the cheetah a discothque at 53rd street and broadway it opened there on december 22 1967 and ran for 45 performances there was no nudity in either the public theater or cheetah production
=== revision for broadwayedit ===
hair underwent a thorough overhaul between its closing at the cheetah in january 1968 and its broadway opening three months later the off-broadway book already light on plot was loosened even further and made more realistic for example claude had been written as a space alien who aspires to be a cinematic director he became human for the broadway version moreover 13 new songs were added the song let the sun shine in was added so that the ending would be more uplifting
before the move to broadway the creative team hired director tom o'horgan who had built a reputation directing experimental theater at the la mama experimental theatre club he had been the authors first choice to direct the public theater production but he was in europe at the time newsweek described o'horgan's directing style as sensual savage and thoroughly musical [he] disintegrates verbal structure and often breaks up and distributes narrative and even character among different actors he enjoys sensory bombardment. in rehearsals o'horgan used techniques passed down by viola spolin and paul sills involving role playing and improvisational games many of the improvisations tried during this process were incorporated into the broadway script o'horgan and new choreographer julie arenal encouraged freedom and spontaneity in their actors introducing an organic expansive style of staging that had never been seen before on broadway the inspiration to include nudity came when the authors saw an anti-war demonstration in central park where two men stripped naked as an expression of defiance and freedom and they decided to incorporate the idea into the show o'horgan had used nudity in many of the plays he directed and he helped integrate the idea into the fabric of the show
papp declined to pursue a broadway production and so butler produced the show himself for a time it seemed that butler would be unable to secure a broadway theater as the shuberts nederlanders and other theater owners deemed the material too controversial however butler had family connections and knew important people he persuaded biltmore theatre owner david cogan to make his venue available

=== broadwayedit ===
hair opened on broadway at the biltmore theatre on april 29 1968 the production was directed by tom o'horgan and choreographed by julie arenal with set design by robin wagner costume design by nancy potts and lighting design by jules fisher the original broadway tribe (i.e. cast) included authors rado and ragni who played the lead roles of claude and berger respectively and lynn kellogg as sheila lamont washington as hud sally eaton and shelley plimpton reprising their off-broadway roles as jeanie and crissy melba moore as dionne steve curry as woof ronnie dyson (who sang aquarius") paul jabara and diane keaton (both moore and keaton later played sheila) among the performers who appeared in hair during its original broadway run were ben vereen keith carradine barry mcguire ted lange meat loaf kenny seymour (of little anthony and the imperials) joe butler (of the lovin spoonful) peppy castro (of the blues magoos) robin mcnamara heather macrae (daughter of gordon macrae and sheila macrae) eddie rambeau vicki sue robinson beverly bremers and kim milford
the hair team soon became embroiled in a lawsuit with the organizers of the tony awards after assuring producer michael butler that commencing previews by april 3 1968 would assure eligibility for consideration for the 1968 tonys the new york theatre league ruled hair ineligible moving the cutoff date to march 19 the producers brought suit but were unable to force the league to reconsider at the 1969 tonys hair was nominated for best musical and best director but lost out to 1776 in both categories the production ran for four years and 1,750 performances closing on july 1 1972
=== early regional productionsedit ===
the west coast version played at the aquarius theatre in los angeles beginning about six months after the broadway opening and running for an unprecedented two years the los angeles tribe included rado ragni robert rothman ben vereen (who replaced ragni) red shepard ted neeley (who replaced rado) meat loaf gloria jones tta vega jobriath jennifer warnes and dobie gray
there were soon nine simultaneous productions in u.s cities followed by national tours among the performers in these were joe mantegna andr deshields and alaina reed (chicago) david lasley david patrick kelly meat loaf and shaun murphy (detroit) arnold mcculler (tour) bob bingham (seattle) and philip michael thomas (san francisco) the creative team from broadway worked on hair in los angeles chicago and san francisco as the broadway staging served as a rough template for these and other early regional productions a notable addition to the team in los angeles was tom smothers who served as co-producer regional casts consisted mostly of local actors although a few broadway cast members reprised their roles in other cities o'horgan or the authors sometimes took new ideas and improvisations from a regional show and brought them back to new york such as when live chickens were tossed onto the stage in los angeles
it was rare for so many productions to run simultaneously during an initial broadway run producer michael butler who had declared that hair is the strongest anti-war statement ever written said the reason that he opened so many productions was to influence public opinion against the vietnam war and end it as soon as possible
=== west endedit ===
hair opened at the shaftesbury theatre in london on september 27 1968 led by the same creative team as the broadway production the opening night was delayed until the abolition of theatre censorship in england under the theatres act 1968 so that the show could include nudity and profanity as with other early productions the london show added a sprinkling of local allusions and other minor departures from the broadway version
the original london tribe included sonja kristina peter straker paul nicholas melba moore elaine paige paul korda marsha hunt floella benjamin alex harvey oliver tobias richard o'brien and tim curry this was curry's first full-time theatrical acting role where he met future rocky horror show collaborator o'brien hair's engagement in london surpassed the broadway production running for 1,997 performances until its closure was forced by the roof of the theatre collapsing in july 1973
=== early international productionsedit ===
the job of leading the foreign language productions of hair was given to bertrand castelli butler's partner and executive producer of the broadway show castelli was a writer/producer who traveled in paris art circles and rubbed elbows with pablo picasso and jean cocteau butler described him as a crazy showman  the guy with the business suit and beads castelli decided to do the show in the local language of each country at a time when broadway shows were always done in english the translations followed the original script closely and the broadway stagings were used each script contained local references such as street names and the names or depictions of local politicians and celebrities castelli produced companies in france germany mexico and other countries sometimes also directing the productions
a german production directed by castelli opened in 1968 in munich the tribe included donna summer liz mitchell and donna wyant a successful parisian production of hair opened on june 1 1969 the original australian production premiered in sydney on june 6 1969 produced by harry m miller and directed by jim sharman who also designed the production the tribe included keith glass and then reg livermore as berger john waters as claude and sharon redd as the magician redd was one of six african-americans brought to australia to provide a racially integrated tribe the production broke local box-office records and ran for two years but because of some of the language in the show the cast album was banned in queensland and new zealand the production transferred to melbourne in 1971 and then had a national tour it marked the stage debut of boston-born australian vocalist marcia hines in mexico the production was banned by the government after one night in acapulco an 18-year-old snia braga appeared in the 1969 brazilian production
another notable production was in the former yugoslavia (belgrade) the first hair to be produced in a communist country directed by local female producer-director mira trailovi and attended by president tito the belgrade production was a favorite of authors rado and ragni with ragni declaring there's no middle class prejudices here local references in the script included barbs aimed at mao zedong as well as albania yugoslavia's traditional rival
by 1970 hair was a huge financial success and nineteen productions had been staged outside of north america in addition to those named above these included productions in scandinavia south america italy israel japan canada the netherlands switzerland and austria according to billboard the various productions of the show were raking in almost $1 million every ten days and royalties were being collected for 300 different recordings of the show's songs making it the most successful score in history as well as the most performed score ever written for the broadway stage.
== themesedit ==
hair explores many of the themes of the hippie movement of the 1960s theatre writer scott miller described these as follows
[t]he youth of america especially those on college campuses started protesting all the things that they saw wrong with america racism environmental destruction poverty sexism and sexual repression violence at home and the war in vietnam depersonalization from new technologies and corruption in politics  contrary to popular opinion the hippies had great respect for america and believed that they were the true patriots the only ones who genuinely wanted to save our country and make it the best it could be once again  [long] hair was the hippies flag their  symbol not only of rebellion but also of new possibilities a symbol of the rejection of discrimination and restrictive gender roles (a philosophy celebrated in the song my conviction") it symbolized equality between men and women  [t]he hippies chosen clothing also made statements drab work clothes (jeans work shirts pea coats) were a rejection of materialism clothing from other cultures particularly the third world and native americans represented their awareness of the global community and their rejection of u.s imperialism and selfishness simple cotton dresses and other natural fabrics were a rejection of synthetics a return to natural things and simpler times some hippies wore old world war ii or civil war jackets as way of co-opting the symbols of war into their newfound philosophy of nonviolence
=== race and the tribeedit ===
extending the precedents set by show boat (1927) and porgy and bess (1935) hair opened the broadway musical to racial integration fully one-third of the cast was african american except for satirically in skits the roles for the black members of the tribe portrayed them as equals breaking away from the traditional roles for blacks in entertainment as slaves or servants an ebony magazine article declared that the show was the biggest outlet for black actors in the history of the u.s stage
several songs and scenes from the show address racial issues colored spade which introduces the character hud a militant black male is a long list of racial slurs ("jungle bunny little black sambo") topped off with the declaration that hud is the president of the united states of love at the end of his song he tells the tribe that the boogie man will get them as the tribe pretends to be frightened dead end sung by black tribe members is a list of street signs that symbolize black frustration and alienation one of the tribe's protest chants is what do we think is really great to bomb lynch and segregate! black boys/white boys is an exuberant acknowledgement of miscegenation the u.s supreme court had struck down laws against the practice in 1967 another of the tribe's protest chants is black white yellow red copulate in a king-sized bed.
abie baby is part of the act 2 trip sequence four african witch doctors who have just killed various american historical cultural and fictional characters sing the praises of abraham lincoln portrayed by a black female tribe member whom they decide not to kill the first part of the song contains stereotypical language that black characters used in old movies like i's finished  pluckin y'all's chickens and i's free now thanks to y'all master lincoln the lincoln character then recites a modernized version of the gettysburg address while a white female tribe member polishes lincoln's shoes with her blond hair
the many references to native americans throughout the script are part of the anti-consumerism naturalism focus of the hippie movement and of hair the characters in the show are referred to as the tribe borrowing the term for native american communities the cast of each production chooses a tribal name the practice is not just cosmetic  the entire cast must work together must like each other and often within the show must work as a single organism all the sense of family of belonging of responsibility and loyalty inherent in the word tribe has to be felt by the cast. to enhance this feeling o'horgan put the cast through sensitivity exercises based on trust touching listening and intensive examination that broke down barriers between the cast and crew and encouraged bonding these exercises were based on techniques developed at the esalen institute and polish lab theater the idea of claude berger and sheila living together is another facet of the 1960s concept of tribe
=== nudity sexual freedom and drug useedit ===
the brief nude scene at the end of act i was a subject of controversy and notoriety miller writes that nudity was a big part of the hippie culture both as a rejection of the sexual repression of their parents and also as a statement about naturalism spirituality honesty openness and freedom the naked body was beautiful something to be celebrated and appreciated not scorned and hidden they saw their bodies and their sexuality as gifts not as dirty things.
hair glorifies sexual freedom in a variety of ways in addition to acceptance of miscegenation mentioned above the characters lifestyle acts as a sexually and politically charged updating of la bohme as rado explained the love element of the peace movement was palpable. in the song sodomy woof exhorts everyone to join the holy orgy kama sutra toward the end of act 2 the tribe members reveal their free love tendencies when they banter back and forth about who will sleep with whom that night woof has a crush on mick jagger and a three-way embrace between claude berger and sheila turns into a claudeberger kiss
various illegal drugs are taken by the characters during the course of the show most notably a hallucinogen during the trip sequence the song walking in space begins the sequence and the lyrics celebrate the experience declaring how dare they try to end this beauty  in this dive we rediscover sensation  our eyes are open wide wide wide similarly in the song donna berger sings that i'm evolving through the drugs that you put down. at another point jeanie smokes marijuana and dismisses the critics of pot generally the tribe favors hallucinogenic or mind expanding drugs such as lsd and marijuana while disapproving of other drugs such as speed and depressants for example jeanie after revealing that she is pregnant by a speed freak says that methedrine is a bad scene the song hashish provides a list of pharmaceuticals both illegal and legal including cocaine alcohol lsd opium and thorazine which is used as an antipsychotic
=== pacifism and environmentalismedit ===
the theme of opposition to the war that pervades the show is unified by the plot thread that progresses through the book claude's moral dilemma over whether to burn his draft card pacifism is explored throughout the extended trip sequence in act 2 the lyrics to three-five-zero-zero which is sung during that sequence evoke the horrors of war ("ripped open by metal explosion") the song is based on allen ginsberg's 1966 poem wichita vortex sutra in the poem general maxwell taylor proudly reports to the press the number of enemy soldiers killed in one month repeating it digit by digit for effect three-five-zero-zero. the song begins with images of death and dying and turns into a manic dance number echoing maxwell's glee at reporting the enemy casualties as the tribe chants take weapons up and begin to kill the song also includes the repeated phrase prisoners in niggertown/ it's a dirty little war
don't put it down satirizes the unexamined patriotism of people who are literally crazy for the american flag be in (hare krishna) praises the peace movement and events like the san francisco and central park be-ins throughout the show the tribe chants popular protest slogans like what do we want peace when do we want it now! and do not enter the induction center the upbeat song let the sun shine in is a call to action to reject the darkness of war and change the world for the better
hair also aims its satire at the pollution caused by our civilization jeanie appears from a trap door in the stage wearing a gas mask and then sings the song air welcome sulfur dioxide hello carbon monoxide the air  is everywhere she suggests that pollution will eventually kill her vapor and fume at the stone of my tomb breathing like a sullen perfume in a comic pro-green vein when woof introduces himself he explains that he grows things like beets and corn  and sweet peas and that he loves the flowers and the fuzz and the trees
=== religion and astrologyedit ===
religion particularly catholicism appears both overtly and symbolically throughout the piece and it is often made the brunt of a joke berger sings of looking for my donna giving it the double meaning of the woman he's searching for and the madonna during sodomy a hymn-like paean to all that is dirty about sex the cast strikes evocative religious positions the piet and christ on the cross before the song woof recites a modified rosary in act ii when berger gives imaginary pills to various famous figures he offers a pill for the pope in going down after being kicked out of school berger compares himself to lucifer just like the angel that fell / banished forever to hell / today have i been expelled / from high school heaven. claude becomes a classic christ figure at various points in the script in act i claude enters saying i am the son of god i shall vanish and be forgotten, then gives benediction to the tribe and the audience claude suffers from indecision and in his gethsemane at the end of act i he asks where do i go? there are textual allusions to claude being on a cross and in the end he is chosen to give his life for the others berger has been seen as a john the baptist figure preparing the way for claude
songs like good morning starshine and aquarius reflect the 1960s cultural interest in astrological and cosmic concepts aquarius was the result of rado's research into his own astrological sign the company's astrologer maria crummere was consulted about casting sheila was usually played by a libra or capricorn and berger by a leo although ragni the original berger was a virgo crummere was also consulted when deciding when the show would open on broadway and in other cities the 1971 broadway playbill reported that she chose april 29 1968 for the broadway premiere the 29th was auspicious  because the moon was high indicating that people would attend in masses the position of the history makers (pluto uranus jupiter) in the 10th house made the show unique powerful and a money-maker and the fact that neptune was on the ascendancy foretold that hair would develop a reputation involving sex.
in mexico where crummere did not pick the opening date the show was closed down by the government after one night she was not pleased with the date of the boston opening (where the producers were sued over the show's content) saying jupiter will be in opposition to naughty saturn and the show opens the very day of the sun's eclipse terrible. but there was no astrologically safe time in the near future
=== literary themes and symbolismedit ===
hair makes many references to shakespeare's plays especially romeo and juliet and hamlet and at times takes lyrical material directly from shakespeare for example the lyrics to the song what a piece of work is man are from hamlet (ii scene 2) and portions of flesh failures ("the rest is silence") are from hamlet's final lines in flesh failures/let the sun shine in the lyrics eyes look your last!/ arms take your last embrace and lips o you/ the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss are from romeo and juliet (v iii 11114) according to miller the romeo suicide imagery makes the point that with our complicity in war we are killing ourselves
symbolically the running plot of claude's indecision especially his resistance to burning his draft card which ultimately causes his demise has been seen as a parallel to hamlet the melancholy hippie the symbolism is carried into the last scene where claude appears as a ghostly spirit among his friends wearing an army uniform in an ironic echo of an earlier scene where he says i know what i want to be  invisible according to public theater artistic director oskar eustis both [hair and hamlet] center on idealistic brilliant men as they struggle to find their place in a world marred by war violence and venal politics they see both the luminous possibilities and the harshest realities of being human in the end unable to effectively combat the evil around them they tragically succumb.
other literary references include the song three-five-zero-zero based on ginsberg's poem wichita vortex sutra and in the psychedelic drug trip sequence the portrayal of scarlett o'hara from gone with the wind and activist african-american poet leroi jones
== dramaticsedit ==
in his introduction to the published script of viet rock richard schechner says performance action and event are the key terms of our theatre and these terms are not literary. in the 1950s off-off broadway theaters began experimenting with non-traditional theater roles blurring the lines between playwright director and actor the playwright's job was not just to put words on a page but to create a theatrical experience based on a central idea by 1967 theaters such as the living theatre la mama e.t.c and the open theatre were actively devising plays from improvisational scenes crafted in the rehearsal space rather than following a traditional script
=== viet rock and hairedit ===
megan terry's viet rock was created using this improvisational process scenes in viet rock were connected in prelogical ways a scene could be built from a tangent from the scene before it could be connected psychologically or it could be in counterpoint to the previous scene actors were asked to switch roles in the middle of a show and frequently in mid-scene in her stage directions for a senate hearing scene in viet rock terry wrote the actors should take turns being senators and witnesses the transformations should be abrupt and total when the actor is finished with one character he becomes another or just an actor.
hair was designed in much the same way tom o'horgan the show's broadway director was intimately involved in the experimental theatre movement in the transition to broadway o'horgan and the writers rearranged scenes to increase the experimental aspects of the show hair asks its actors to assume several different characters throughout the course of the piece and as in claude's psychedelic trip in act 2 sometimes during the same scene both hair and viet rock include rock music borrowed heavily from mass media and frequently break down the invisible fourth wall to interact with the audience for example in the opening number the tribe mingles with audience members and at the end of the show the audience is invited on stage
=== production designedit ===
in the original broadway production the stage was completely open with no curtain and the fly area and grid exposed to the audience the proscenium arch was outlined with climb-ready scaffolding wagner's spare set was painted in shades of grey with street graffiti stenciled on the stage the stage was raked and a tower of abstract scaffolding upstage at the rear merged a native american totem pole and a modern sculpture of a crucifix-shaped tree this scaffolding was decorated with found objects that the cast had gathered from the streets of new york these included a life-size papier-mch bus driver the head of jesus and a neon marquee of the waverly movie theater in greenwich village potts costumes were based on hippie street clothes made more theatrical with enhanced color and texture some of these included mixed parts of military uniforms bell bottom jeans with ukrainian embroidery tie dyed t-shirts and a red white and blue fringed coat early productions were primarily reproductions of this basic design
=== nude sceneedit ===
much has been written about that scene  most of it silly, wrote gene lees in high fidelity the scene was inspired by two men who took off their clothes to antagonize the police during an informal anti-war gathering during where do i go? the stage was covered in a giant scrim beneath which those choosing to participate in the scene removed their clothes at the musical cue they [stood] naked and motionless their bodies bathed in fisher's light projection of floral patterns they chant[ed] of beads flowers freedom and happiness. it lasted only twenty seconds indeed the scene happened so quickly and was so dimly lit that it prompted jack benny during the interval at a london preview to quip did you happen to notice if any of them were jewish? nevertheless the scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places it also became fodder for pop-cultural jokes groucho marx quipped i was gonna go see it and then i called up the theater  they said the tickets were $11 apiece i told them i'd call back went into my bathroom took off all my clothes and looked at myself in the full-length mirror then i called the theater and said forget it.
the nudity was optional for the performers the french cast was the nudest of the foreign groups while the london cast found the nudity the hardest to achieve. the swedish cast was reluctant to disrobe but in copenhagen the tribe thought the nudity too tame and decided to walk naked up and down the aisle during the show's prelude in some early performances the germans played their scene behind a big sheet labeled censored original broadway cast member natalie mosco said i was dead set against the nude scene at first but i remembered my acting teacher having said that part of acting is being private in public so i did it. according to melba moore it doesn't mean anything except what you want it to mean we put so much value on clothing  it's like so much else people get uptight about. donna summer who was in the german production said that it was not meant to be sexual  we stood naked to comment on the fact that society makes more of nudity than killing. rado said that being naked in front of an audience you're baring your soul not only the soul but the whole body was being exposed it was very apt very honest and almost necessary.
== musicedit ==
after studying the music of the bantu at cape town university macdermot incorporated african rhythms into the score of hair he listened to what [the bantu] called quaylas [which have a] very characteristic beat very similar to rock much deeper though hair is very african a lot of [the] rhythms not the tunes so much. quaylas stress beats on unexpected syllables and this influence can be heard in songs like what a piece of work is man and ain't got no grass macdermot said my idea was to make a total funk show they said they wanted rock & roll but to me that translated to funk. that funk is evident throughout the score notably in songs like colored spade and walking in space
macdermot has claimed that the songs can't all be the same you've got to get different styles i like to think they're all a little different. as such the music in hair runs the gamut of rock from the rockabilly sensibilities of don't put it down to the folk rock rhythms of frank mills and what a piece of work is man easy to be hard is pure rhythm and blues and protest rock anthems abound ain't got no and the flesh failures the acid rock of walking in space and aquarius are balanced by the mainstream pop of good morning starshine scott miller ties the music of hair to the hippies political themes the hippies were determined to create art of the people and their chosen art form rock/folk music was by its definition populist [t]he hippies music was often very angry its anger directed at those who would prostitute the constitution who would sell america out who would betray what america stood for in other words directed at their parents and the government. theatre historian john kenrick explains the application of rock music to the medium of the stage
the same hard rock sound that had conquered the world of popular music made its way to the musical stage with two simultaneous hits your own thing [and] hair this explosion of revolutionary proclamations profanity and hard rock shook the musical theatre to its roots most people in the theatre business were unwilling to look on hair as anything more than a noisy accident tony voters tried to ignore hair's importance shutting it out from any honors however some now insisted it was time for a change new york times critic clive barnes gushed that hair was the first broadway musical in some time to have the authentic voice of today rather than the day before yesterday.
the music did not resonate with everyone leonard bernstein remarked the songs are just laundry lists and walked out of the production richard rodgers could only hear the beat and called it one-third music john fogerty said hair is such a watered down version of what is really going on that i cant get behind it at all. gene lees writing for high fidelity claimed that john lennon found it dull and he wrote i do not know any musician who thinks it's good.
=== songsedit ===
the score had many more songs than were typical of broadway shows of the day most broadway shows had about six to ten songs per act hair's total is in the thirties this list reflects the most common broadway lineup
the show was under almost perpetual re-write thirteen songs were added between the production at the public theater and broadway including i believe in love the climax and dead end were cut between the productions and exanaplanetooch and you are standing on my bed were present in previews but cut before broadway the shakespearean speech what a piece of work is a man was originally spoken by claude and musicalized by macdermot for broadway and hashish was formed from an early speech of berger's subsequent productions have included hello there dead end and hippie life a song originally written for the film that rado included in several productions in europe in the mid-nineties the current broadway revival includes the ten-second sheila franklin and o great god of power two songs that were cut from the original production
=== recordingsedit ===
the first recording of hair was made in 1967 featuring the off-broadway cast the original broadway cast recording received a grammy award in 1968 for best score from an original cast show album and sold nearly 3 million copies in the u.s by december 1969 the new york times noted in 2007 that the cast album of hair was a must-have for the middle classes its exotic orange-and-green cover art imprinted itself instantly and indelibly on the psyche [it] became a pop-rock classic that like all good pop has an appeal that transcends particular tastes for genre or period. the 1993 london revival cast album contains new music that has been incorporated into the standard rental version
rca victor also released disinhairited (rca victor lso-1163) an album of songs that had been written for the show but saw varying amounts of stage time some of the songs were cut between the public and broadway some had been left off the original cast album due to space and a few were never performed onstage
songs from hair have been recorded by numerous artists including shirley bassey barbra streisand and diana ross good morning starshine was sung on a 1969 episode of sesame street by cast member bob mcgrath and versions by artists such as sarah brightman petula clark and strawberry alarm clock have been recorded artists as varied as liza minnelli and the lemonheads have recorded frank mills and andrea mcardle jennifer warnes and srgio mendes have each contributed versions of easy to be hard hair also helped launch recording careers for performers meat loaf dobie gray jennifer warnes jobriath bert sommer ronnie dyson donna summer and melba moore among others
the score of hair saw chart successes as well the 5th dimension released aquarius/let the sunshine in in 1969 which won record of the year in 1970 and topped the charts for six weeks the cowsills recording of the title song hair climbed to #2 on the billboard hot 100 while oliver's rendition of good morning starshine reached #3 three dog night's version of easy to be hard went to #4 nina simone's 1968 medley of ain't got no / i got life reached the top 5 on the british charts in 1970 ascap announced that aquarius was played more frequently on u.s radio and television than any other song that year
productions in england germany france sweden japan israel the netherlands australia and elsewhere released cast albums and over 1,000 vocal and/or instrumental performances of individual songs from hair have been recorded such broad attention was paid to the recordings of hair that after an unprecedented bidding war abc records was willing to pay a record amount for macdermot's next broadway adaptation two gentlemen of verona the 2009 revival recording released on june 23 debuted at #1 on billboard's top cast album chart and at #63 in the top 200 qualifying it as the highest debuting album in ghostlight records history
== critical receptionedit ==
reception to hair upon its broadway premiere was with exceptions overwhelmingly positive clive barnes wrote in the new york times what is so likable about hair i think it is simply that it is so likable so new so fresh and so unassuming even in its pretensions. john j o'connor of the wall street journal said the show was exuberantly defiant and the production explodes into every nook and cranny of the biltmore theater richard watts jr of the new york post wrote that it has a surprising if perhaps unintentional charm its high spirits are contagious and its young zestfulness makes it difficult to resist.
television reviews were even more enthusiastic allan jeffreys of abc said the actors were the most talented hippies you'll ever see directed in a wonderfully wild fashion by tom o'horgan. leonard probst of nbc said hair is the only new concept in musicals on broadway in years and it's more fun than any other this season john wingate of wor tv praised macdermot's dynamic score that blasts and soars and len harris of cbs said i've finally found the best musical of the broadway season it's that sloppy vulgar terrific tribal love rock musical hair.
a reviewer from variety on the other hand called the show loony and without a story form music dancing beauty or artistry it's impossible to tell whether [the cast has] talent maybe talent is irrelevant in this new kind of show business. reviews in the news weeklies were mixed jack kroll in newsweek wrote there is no denying the sheer kinetic drive of this new hair there is something hard grabby slightly corrupt about o'horgan's virtuosity like busby berkeley gone bitchy. but a reviewer from time wrote that although the show thrums with vitality [it is] crippled by being a bookless musical and like a boneless fish it drifts when it should swim.
reviews were mixed when hair opened in london irving wardle in the times wrote its honesty and passion give it the quality of a true theatrical celebration the joyous sound of a group of people telling the world exactly what they feel. in the financial times b a young agreed that hair was not only a wildly enjoyable evening but a thoroughly moral one. however in his final review before retiring after 48 years 78-year-old w a darlington of the daily telegraph wrote that he had tried hard but found the evening a complete bore noisy ugly and quite desperately funny.
acknowledging the show's critics scott miller wrote in 2001 that some people can't see past the appearance of chaos and randomness to the brilliant construction and sophisticated imagery underneath. miller notes not only did many of the lyrics not rhyme but many of the songs didn't really have endings just a slowing down and stopping so the audience didn't know when to applaud the show rejected every convention of broadway of traditional theatre in general and of the american musical in specific and it was brilliant.

== social changeedit ==
hair challenged many of the norms held by western society in 1968 the name itself inspired by the name of a jim dine painting depicting a comb and a few strands of hair was a reaction to the restrictions of civilization and consumerism and a preference for naturalism rado remembers that long hair was a visible form of awareness in the consciousness expansion the longer the hair got the more expansive the mind was long hair was shocking and it was a revolutionary act to grow long hair it was kind of a flag really.
the musical caused controversy when it was first staged the act i finale was the first time a broadway show had seen totally naked actors and actresses and the show was charged with the desecration of the american flag and the use of obscene language these controversies in addition to the antivietnam war theme attracted occasional threats and acts of violence during the show's early years and became the basis for legal actions both when the show opened in other cities and on tour two cases eventually reached the u.s supreme court
=== legal challenges and violent reactionsedit ===
the touring company of hair met with resistance throughout the united states in south bend indiana the morris civic auditorium refused booking and in evansville indiana the production was picketed by several church groups in indianapolis indiana the producers had difficulty securing a theater and city authorities suggested that the cast wear body stockings as a compromise to the city's ordinance prohibiting publicly displayed nudity productions were frequently confronted with the closure of theaters by the fire marshal as in gladewater texas chattanooga's 1972 refusal to allow the play to be shown at the city-owned memorial auditorium was later found by the u.s supreme court to be an unlawful prior restraint
the legal challenges against the boston production were appealed to the u.s supreme court the chief of the licensing bureau took exception to the portrayal of the american flag in the piece saying anyone who desecrates the flag should be whipped on boston common. although the scene was removed before opening the district attorney's office began plans to stop the show claiming that lewd and lascivious actions were taking place onstage the hair legal team obtained an injunction against criminal prosecution from the superior court and the d.a appealed to the massachusetts supreme judicial court at the request of both parties several of the justices viewed the production and handed down a ruling that each member of the cast [must] be clothed to a reasonable extent. the cast defiantly played the scene nude later that night stating that the ruling was vague as to when it would take effect the next day april 10 1970 the production closed and movie houses fearing the ruling on nudity began excising scenes from films in their exhibition after the federal appellate bench reversed the massachusetts court's ruling the d.a appealed the case to the u.s supreme court in a 44 decision the court upheld the lower court's decision allowing hair to re-open on may 22
in april 1971 a bomb was thrown at the exterior of a theater in cleveland ohio that had been housing a production bouncing off the marquee and shattering windows in the building and in nearby storefronts that same month the families of cast member jonathon johnson and stage manager rusty carlson died in a fire in the cleveland hotel where 33 members of the show's troupe had been staying the sydney australia production's opening night was interrupted by a bomb scare in june 1969
=== worldwide reactionsedit ===
local reactions to the controversial material varied greatly san francisco's large hippie population considered the show an extension of the street activities there often blurring the barrier between art and life by meditating with the cast and frequently finding themselves onstage during the show an 18-year-old princess anne was seen dancing onstage in london and in washington dc henry kissinger attended in st paul minnesota a protesting clergyman released 18 white mice into the lobby hoping to frighten the audience capt jim lovell and jack swigert after dubbing apollo 13's lunar module aquarius after the song walked out of the production at the biltmore in protest of perceived anti-americanism and disrespect of the flag
an acapulco mexico production of hair directed by castelli played in 1969 for one night after the performance the theater located across the street from a popular local bordello was padlocked by the government which said the production was detrimental to the morals of youth. the cast was arrested soon after the performance and taken to immigration where they agreed to leave the country but because of legal complications they were forced to go into hiding they were expelled from mexico days later
hair effectively marked the end of stage censorship in the united kingdom london's stage censor the lord chamberlain originally refused to license the musical and the opening was delayed until parliament passed a bill stripping him of his licensing power in munich authorities threatened to close the production if the nude scene remained however after a local hair spokesman declared that his relatives had been marched nude into auschwitz the authorities relented in bergen norway local citizens formed a human barricade to try to prevent the performance
the parisian production encountered little controversy and the cast disrobed for the nude scene almost religiously according to castelli nudity being common on stage in paris even in paris there was nevertheless occasional opposition however such as when a member of the local salvation army used a portable loud speaker to exhort the audience to halt the presentation

a movie version of hair with a screenplay by michael weller was directed by milo forman and released in 1979 filmed primarily in new york city's central park and washington square park the cast includes treat williams beverly d'angelo john savage foley and golden several of the songs were deleted and the film's storyline departs significantly from the musical the character of claude is rewritten as an innocent draftee from oklahoma newly arrived in new york to join the military and sheila is a high-society debutante who catches his eye in perhaps the greatest diversion from the stage version a mistake leads berger to go to vietnam in claude's place where he is killed
rado and ragni were unhappy with the film feeling that forman portrayed the hippies as oddballs and some sort of aberration without any connection to the peace movement failing to capture the essence of the original stage production they stated any resemblance between the 1979 film and the original biltmore version other than some of the songs the names of the characters and a common title eludes us. in their view the screen version of hair has not yet been produced
however the film received generally favorable reviews writing in the new york times vincent canby called it a rollicking musical memoir weller's inventions make this hair seem much funnier than i remember the show's having been they also provide time and space for the development of characters who on the stage had to express themselves almost entirely in song [t]he entire cast is superb mostly the film is a delight.

critical response was almost uniformly positive the new york daily news headline proclaimed hair revival's high fun the review praised the daring direction colorfully kinetic choreography and technical accomplishments of the show especially the lighting commening that as a smile-inducing celebration of life and freedom [hair is] highly communicable but warning if you're seated on the aisle count on [the cast] to be in your face or your lap or  braiding your tresses. the new york post wrote that the production has emerged triumphant these days the nation is fixated less on war and more on the economy as a result the scenes that resonate most are the ones in which the kids exultantly reject the rat race. variety enthused director diane paulus and her prodigiously talented cast connect with the material in ways that cut right to the 1967 rock musical's heart generating tremendous energy that radiates to the rafters  what could have been mere nostalgia instead becomes a full-immersion happening  if this explosive production doesn't stir something in you it may be time to check your pulse. the boston globe dissented saying that the production felt canned and overblown and that the revival feels unbearably naive and unforgivably glib ben brantley writing for the new york times reflected the majority however delivering a glowing review
having moved indoors to broadway from the delacorte theater  the young cast members  show no signs of becoming domesticated on the contrary theyre tearing down the house  this emotionally rich revival  delivers what broadway otherwise hasn't felt this season the intense unadulterated joy and anguish of that bi-polar state called youth  karole armitage's happy hippie choreography with its group gropes and mass writhing looks as if it's being invented on the spot but there's intelligent form within the seeming formlessness  [paulus finds] depths of character and feeling in [the 1968 show about kids] frightened of how the future is going to change them and of not knowing what comes next  every single ensemble member emerges as an individual  after the show i couldnt stop thinking about what would happen to [the characters] mr macdermot's music which always had more pop than acid holds up beautifully given infectious life by the onstage band and the flavorfully blended voices of the cast
the public theater struggled to raise the $5.5 million budgeted for the broadway transfer because of the severity of the economic recession in late 2008 but it reached its goal by adding new producing partners director diane paulus helped keep costs low by using an inexpensive set the show grossed a healthy $822,889 in its second week on april 30 2009 on the late show with david letterman the cast recreated a performance on the same stage at the ed sullivan theater by the original tribe the production won the tony award for best revival of a musical the drama desk award for outstanding revival of a musical and the drama league award for distinguished revival of a musical its cast album won the grammy award for best musical show album by august 2009 the revival had recouped its entire $5,760,000 investment becoming one of the fastest-recouping musicals in broadway history

the production received mostly enthusiastic reviews michael billington of the guardian described it as a vibrant joyous piece of living theatre writing it celebrates a period when the joy of life was pitted against the forces of intolerance and the death-dealing might of the military-industrial complex as shakespeare once said there's sap in't yet. charles spencer in the daily telegraph agreed this is a timely and irresistibly vital revival of the greatest of all rock musicals  the verve and energy of the company  is irresistible. michael coveney of the independent wrote that hair is one of the great musicals of all time and a phenomenon that i'm relieved to discover stands up as a period piece in the times benedict nightingale commented that it's exhilarating as well as oddly poignant when a multihued cast dressed in everything from billowing kaftans to ruritanian army jackets race downstage while delivering that tuneful salute to an age of aquarius that still refuses to dawn. quentin letts was a dissenting voice in the daily mail though praising the performances and the production he wrote by the end the fraudulence of the gaiety becomes sickening there is a lack of truthfulness in hair which may not have been apparent when it was first performed in new york city in 1967 but which today is unavoidable.

=== legacyedit ===
hair was broadway's first concept musical a form that dominated the musical theatre of the seventies including shows like company follies pacific overtures and a chorus line while the development of the concept musical was an unexpected consequence of hair's tenure on broadway the expected rock music revolution on broadway turned out to be less than complete
macdermot followed hair with three successive rock scores two gentlemen of verona (1971) dude (1972) a second collaboration with ragni and via galactica (1972) while two gentlemen of verona found receptive audiences and a tony for best musical dude failed after just sixteen performances and via galactica flopped after a month according to horn these and other such failures may have been the result of producers simply relying on the label rock musical to attract audiences without regard to the quality of the material presented. jesus christ superstar (1970) and godspell (1971) were two religiously themed successes of the genre grease (1971) reverted to the rock sounds of the 1950s and black-themed musicals like the wiz (1975) were heavily influenced by gospel r&b and soul music by the late 1970s the genre had played itself out except for a few outposts of rock like dreamgirls (1981) and little shop of horrors (1982) audience tastes in the 1980s turned to megamusicals with pop scores like les misrables (1985) and the phantom of the opera (1986) some later rock musicals such as rent (1996) and spring awakening (2006) as well as jukebox musicals featuring rock music like we will rock you (2002) and rock of ages (2009) have found success but the rock musical did not quickly come to dominate the musical theatre stage after hair critic clive barnes commented there really weren't any rock musicals no major rock musician ever did a rock score for broadway  you might think of the musical tommy but it was never conceived as a broadway show  and one can see why there's so much more money in records and rock concerts i mean why bother going through the pain of a musical which may close in philadelphia?
on the other hand hair had a profound effect not only on what was acceptable on broadway but as part of the very social movements that it celebrated for example in 1970 butler castelli and the various hair casts contributed to fundraising for the world youth assembly a united nations-sponsored organization formed in connection with the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the united nations the assembly enabled 750 young representatives from around the world to meet in new york in july 1970 to discuss social issues for about a week cast members worldwide collected donations at every show for the fund hair raised around $250,000 and ended up being the principal financier of the assembly tribe members and hair crews also contributed a days pay and butler contributed a days profits from these productions moreover as ellen stewart la mama's founder noted
hair came with blue jeans comfortable clothing colors beautiful colors sounds movement  and you can go to at&t and see a secretary today and she's got on blue jeans  you can go anywhere you want and what hair did it is still doing twenty years later a kind of emancipation a spiritual emancipation that came from [o'horgan's] staging  hair until this date has influenced every single thing that you see on broadway off-broadway off-off-broadway anywhere in the world you will see elements of the experimental techniques that hair brought not just to broadway but to the entire world
