carbonatehosted leadzinc ore deposits important highly valuable concentrations lead zinc sulfide ores hosted within carbonate limestone marl dolomite formations share common genetic origin
ore bodies range million tonnes contained ore million tonnes grade combined lead zinc combined lead zinc ore bodies tend compact fairly uniform pluglike pipelike replacements host carbonate sequences extremely profitable mines

source
ultimate source mineralizing fluids mvt deposits unknown ore fluids mvt deposits typically low temperature cc composition basinal brines wt nacl equivalent phs buffered host carbonates hydrothermal fluid may may carry required sulfur form sulfide minerals mobile hydrocarbons may played role delivering reduced sulfur certain mvt systems methane organic matter potentially reduce sulfate carried acidic fluid ore fluid suspected derived clastic red bed sequences potential metal source contain evaporitespotential sulfur source
transport
two potential transportation mechanisms metalbearing ore fluid proposed first involves compaction sediments basins rapid sedimentation mineralizing fluids within basin become trapped within discrete overpressured aquifers escape episodically rapidly second fluid transportation mechanism topographicallydriven gravitational fluid flow occurs uplift commonly associated orogenic event one edge basin uplifted formation foreland fold thrust belt basinal fluids migrate laterally away deformation front basin uplifted migration fluids deep portions basin may result acquisition metals sulfur contained within basin
trap

mineralogy alteration

concept cogeneration hydrocarbons precursor brines process allows many leadzinc explorers use hydrocarbon basin models predict carbonate sequence likely host mvt irish type mineralization
exploration
exploration mvt deposits relatively complex theory straightforward practise area selection phase attention must paid nature carbonate sequences especially dolomite front alteration identified within oil exploration wells commonly associated leadzinc mineralisation
thereafter attention must paid picking floral facies reef carbonates formed coral reef accumulations facies carbonate sequence critical controlled mostly faults ultimate target exploration forereefbackreef transition sweet spot thus depending age carbonate sequence familiarity coral palaeontology considered essential
finally basin model carbonate sequence formulated primary basinmargin faults roughly identified gravity survey often carried geophysical technique directly detect mvt deposits gravity surveys aim detect significant accumulations lead zinc due greater density relative surrounding host rocks
