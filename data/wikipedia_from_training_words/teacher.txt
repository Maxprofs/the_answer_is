a teacher (also called a school teacher) is a person who provides education for students
== duties and functionsedit ==
the role of teacher is often formal and ongoing carried out at a school or other place of formal education in many countries a person who wishes to become a teacher must first obtain specified professional qualifications or credentials from a university or college these professional qualifications may include the study of pedagogy the science of teaching teachers like other professionals may have to continue their education after they qualify a process known as continuing professional development teachers may use a lesson plan to facilitate student learning providing a course of study which is called the curriculum
a teacher's role may vary among cultures teachers may provide instruction in literacy and numeracy craftsmanship or vocational training the arts religion civics community roles or life skills
a teacher who facilitates education for an individual may also be described as a personal tutor or largely historically a governess
in some countries formal education can take place through home schooling informal learning may be assisted by a teacher occupying a transient or ongoing role such as a family member or by anyone with knowledge or skills in the wider community setting
religious and spiritual teachers such as gurus mullahs rabbis pastors/youth pastors and lamas may teach religious texts such as the quran torah or bible
== professional educatorsedit ==
teaching may be carried out informally within the family which is called homeschooling or in the wider community formal teaching may be carried out by paid professionals such professionals enjoy a status in some societies on a par with physicians lawyers engineers and accountants (chartered or cpa)
a teacher's professional duties may extend beyond formal teaching outside of the classroom teachers may accompany students on field trips supervise study halls help with the organization of school functions and serve as supervisors for extracurricular activities in some education systems teachers may have responsibility for student discipline
around the world teachers are often required to obtain specialized education knowledge codes of ethics and internal monitoring
there are a variety of bodies designed to instill preserve and update the knowledge and professional standing of teachers around the world many governments operate teacher's colleges which are generally established to serve and protect the public interest through certifying governing and enforcing the standards of practice for the teaching profession
the functions of the teacher's colleges may include setting out clear standards of practice providing for the ongoing education of teachers investigating complaints involving members conducting hearings into allegations of professional misconduct and taking appropriate disciplinary action and accrediting teacher education programs in many situations teachers in publicly funded schools must be members in good standing with the college and private schools may also require their teachers to be college peoples in other areas these roles may belong to the state board of education the superintendent of public instruction the state education agency or other governmental bodies in still other areas teaching unions may be responsible for some or all of these duties
== pedagogy and teachingedit ==
in education teachers facilitate student learning often in a school or academy or perhaps in another environment such as outdoors a teacher who teaches on an individual basis may be described as a tutor
the objective is typically accomplished through either an informal or formal approach to learning including a course of study and lesson plan that teaches skills knowledge and/or thinking skills different ways to teach are often referred to as pedagogy when deciding what teaching method to use teachers consider students background knowledge environment and their learning goals as well as standardized curricula as determined by the relevant authority many times teachers assist in learning outside of the classroom by accompanying students on field trips the increasing use of technology specifically the rise of the internet over the past decade has begun to shape the way teachers approach their roles in the classroom
the objective is typically a course of study lesson plan or a practical skill a teacher may follow standardized curricula as determined by the relevant authority the teacher may interact with students of different ages from infants to adults students with different abilities and students with learning disabilities
teaching using pedagogy also involve assessing the educational levels of the students on particular skills understanding the pedagogy of the students in a classroom involves using differentiated instruction as well as supervision to meet the needs of all students in the classroom pedagogy can be thought of in two manners first teaching itself can be taught in many different ways hence using a pedagogy of teaching styles second the pedagogy of the learners comes into play when a teacher assesses the pedagogic diversity of his/her students and differentiates for the individual students accordingly for example an experienced teacher and parent described the place of a teacher in learning as follows the real bulk of learning takes place in self-study and problem solving with a lot of feedback around that loop the function of the teacher is to pressure the lazy inspire the bored deflate the cocky encourage the timid detect and correct individual flaws and broaden the viewpoint of all this function looks like that of a coach using the whole gamut of psychology to get each new class of rookies off the bench and into the game.
perhaps the most significant difference between primary school and secondary school teaching is the relationship between teachers and children in primary schools each class has a teacher who stays with them for most of the week and will teach them the whole curriculum in secondary schools they will be taught by different subject specialists each session during the week and may have ten or more different teachers the relationship between children and their teachers tends to be closer in the primary school where they act as form tutor specialist teacher and surrogate parent during the course of the day
this is true throughout most of the united states as well however alternative approaches for primary education do exist one of these sometimes referred to as a platoon system involves placing a group of students together in one class that moves from one specialist to another for every subject the advantage here is that students learn from teachers who specialize in one subject and who tend to be more knowledgeable in that one area than a teacher who teaches many subjects students still derive a strong sense of security by staying with the same group of peers for all classes
co-teaching has also become a new trend amongst educational institutions co-teaching is defined as two or more teachers working harmoniously to fulfill the needs of every student in the classroom co-teaching focuses the student on learning by providing a social networking support that allows them to reach their full cognitive potential co-teachers work in sync with one another to create a climate of learning
== rights to enforce school disciplineedit ==
throughout the history of education the most common form of school discipline was corporal punishment while a child was in school a teacher was expected to act as a substitute parent with all the normal forms of parental discipline open to them
in past times corporal punishment (spanking or paddling or caning or strapping or birching the student in order to cause physical pain) was one of the most common forms of school discipline throughout much of the world most western countries and some others have now banned it but it remains lawful in the united states following a us supreme court decision in 1977 which held that paddling did not violate the us constitution
30 us states have banned corporal punishment the others (mostly in the south) have not it is still used to a significant (though declining) degree in some public schools in alabama arkansas georgia louisiana mississippi oklahoma tennessee and texas private schools in these and most other states may also use it corporal punishment in american schools is administered to the seat of the student's trousers or skirt with a specially made wooden paddle this often used to take place in the classroom or hallway but nowadays the punishment is usually given privately in the principal's office
official corporal punishment often by caning remains commonplace in schools in some asian african and caribbean countries for details of individual countries see school corporal punishment
currently detention is one of the most common punishments in schools in the united states the uk ireland singapore and other countries it requires the pupil to remain in school at a given time in the school day (such as lunch recess or after school) or even to attend school on a non-school day e.g saturday detention held at some schools during detention students normally have to sit in a classroom and do work write lines or a punishment essay or sit quietly
a modern example of school discipline in north america and western europe relies upon the idea of an assertive teacher who is prepared to impose their will upon a class positive reinforcement is balanced with immediate and fair punishment for misbehavior and firm clear boundaries define what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior teachers are expected to respect their students sarcasm and attempts to humiliate pupils are seen as falling outside of what constitutes reasonable discipline
whilst this is the consensus viewpoint amongst the majority of academics some teachers and parents advocate a more assertive and confrontational style of discipline such individuals claim that many problems with modern schooling stem from the weakness in school discipline and if teachers exercised firm control over the classroom they would be able to teach more efficiently this viewpoint is supported by the educational attainment of countriesin east asia for instancethat combine strict discipline with high standards of education
it's not clear however that this stereotypical view reflects the reality of east asian classrooms or that the educational goals in these countries are commensurable with those in western countries in japan for example although average attainment on standardized tests may exceed those in western countries classroom discipline and behavior is highly problematic although officially schools have extremely rigid codes of behavior in practice many teachers find the students unmanageable and do not enforce discipline at all
where school class sizes are typically 40 to 50 students maintaining order in the classroom can divert the teacher from instruction leaving little opportunity for concentration and focus on what is being taught in response teachers may concentrate their attention on motivated students ignoring attention-seeking and disruptive students the result of this is that motivated students facing demanding university entrance examinations receive disproportionate resources given the emphasis on attainment of university places administrators and governors may regard this policy as appropriate
== obligation to honor students rightsedit ==
sudbury model democratic schools claim that popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority for governments and schools alike they also claim that in these schools the preservation of public order is easier and more efficient than anywhere else primarily because rules and regulations are made by the community as a whole thence the school atmosphere is one of persuasion and negotiation rather than confrontation since there is no one to confront sudbury model democratic schools proponents argue that a school that has good clear laws fairly and democratically passed by the entire school community and a good judicial system for enforcing these laws is a school in which community discipline prevails and in which an increasingly sophisticated concept of law and order develops against other schools today where rules are arbitrary authority is absolute punishment is capricious and due process of law is unknown
== teacher enthusiasmedit ==
since teachers can affect how students perceive the course materials it has been found that teachers who showed enthusiasm towards the course materials and students can affect a positive learning experience towards the course materials on teacher/course evaluations it was found that teachers who have a positive disposition towards the course content tend to transfer their passion to receptive students these teachers do not teach by rote but attempt to find new invigoration for the course materials on a daily basis one of the difficulties in this approach is that teachers may have repeatedly covered a curriculum until they begin to feel bored with the subject which in turn bores the students as well students who had enthusiastic teachers tend to rate them higher than teachers who didn't show much enthusiasm for the course materials
teachers that exhibit enthusiasm can lead to students who are more likely to be engaged interested energetic and curious about learning the subject matter recent research has found a correlation between teacher enthusiasm and students intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom controlled experimental studies exploring intrinsic motivation of college students has shown that nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm such as demonstrative gesturing dramatic movements which are varied and emotional facial expressions result in college students reporting higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn students who experienced a very enthusiastic teacher were more likely to read lecture material outside of the classroom
there are various mechanisms by which teacher enthusiasm may facilitate higher levels of intrinsic motivation teacher enthusiasm may contribute to a classroom atmosphere full of energy and enthusiasm which feed student interest and excitement in learning the subject matter enthusiastic teachers may also lead to students becoming more self-determined in their own learning process the concept of mere exposure indicates that the teacher's enthusiasm may contribute to the student's expectations about intrinsic motivation in the context of learning also enthusiasm may act as a motivational embellishment increasing a student's interest by the variety novelty and surprise of the enthusiastic teacher's presentation of the material finally the concept of emotional contagion may also apply students may become more intrinsically motivated by catching onto the enthusiasm and energy of the teacher
research shows that student motivation and attitudes towards school are closely linked to student-teacher relationships enthusiastic teachers are particularly good at creating beneficial relations with their students their ability to create effective learning environments that foster student achievement depends on the kind of relationship they build with their students useful teacher-to-student interactions are crucial in linking academic success with personal achievement here personal success is a student's internal goal of improving himself whereas academic success includes the goals he receives from his superior a teacher must guide his student in aligning his personal goals with his academic goals students who receive this positive influence show stronger self-confidence and greater personal and academic success than those without these teacher interactions
students are likely to build stronger relations with teachers who are friendly and supportive and will show more interest in courses taught by these teachers teachers that spend more time interacting and working directly with students are perceived as supportive and effective teachers effective teachers have been shown to invite student participation and decision making allow humor into their classroom and demonstrate a willingness to play
the way a teacher promotes the course they are teaching the more the student will get out of the subject matter the three most important aspects of teacher enthusiasm are enthusiasm about teaching enthusiasm about the students and enthusiasm about the subject matter a teacher must enjoy teaching if they do not enjoy what they are doing the students will be able to tell they also must enjoy being around their students a teacher who cares for their students is going to help that individual succeed in their life in the future the teacher also needs to be enthusiastic about the subject matter they are teaching for example a teacher talking about chemistry needs to enjoy the art of chemistry and show that to their students a spark in the teacher may create a spark of excitement in the student as well an enthusiastic teacher has the ability to be very influential in the young students life
== misconduct and gender balanceedit ==
misconduct by teachers especially sexual misconduct has been getting increased scrutiny from the media and the courts a study by the american association of university women reported that 9.6% of students in the united states claim to have received unwanted sexual attention from an adult associated with education be they a volunteer bus driver teacher administrator or other adult sometime during their educational career
a study in england showed a 0.3% prevalence of sexual abuse by any professional a group that included priests religious leaders and case workers as well as teachers it is important to note however that the british study referenced above is the only one of its kind and consisted of a random  probability sample of 2,869 young people between the ages of 18 and 24 in a computer-assisted study and that the questions referred to sexual abuse with a professional, not necessarily a teacher it is therefore logical to conclude that information on the percentage of abuses by teachers in the united kingdom is not explicitly available and therefore not necessarily reliable the aauw study however posed questions about fourteen types of sexual harassment and various degrees of frequency and included only abuses by teachers the sample was drawn from a list of 80,000 schools to create a stratified two-stage sample design of 2,065 8th to 11th grade students"its reliability was gauged at 95% with a 4% margin of error
in the united states especially several high-profile cases such as debra lafave pamela rogers and mary kay letourneau have caused increased scrutiny on teacher misconduct
chris keates the general secretary of national association of schoolmasters union of women teachers said that teachers who have sex with pupils over the age of consent should not be placed on the sex offenders register and that prosecution for statutory rape is a real anomaly in the law that we are concerned about. this has led to outrage from child protection and parental rights groups fears of being labelled a pedophile or hebephile has led to several men who enjoy teaching avoiding the profession this has in some jurisdictions reportedly led to a shortage of male teachers
== occupational hazardsedit ==
teachers face several occupational hazards in their line of work including occupational stress which can negatively impact teachers mental and physical health productivity and students performance stress can be caused by organizational change relationships with students fellow teachers and administrative personnel working environment expectations to substitute long hours with a heavy workload and inspections teachers are also at high risk for occupational burnout
a 2000 study found that 42% of uk teachers experienced occupational stress twice the figure for the average profession a 2012 study found that teachers experienced double the rate of anxiety depression and stress than average workers
there are several ways to mitigate the occupational hazards of teaching organizational interventions like changing teachers schedules providing support networks and mentoring changing the work environment and offering promotions and bonuses may be effective in helping to reduce occupational stress among teachers individual-level interventions including stress-management training and counseling are also used to relieve occupational stress among teachers
== teaching around the worldedit ==
there are many similarities and differences among teachers around the world in almost all countries teachers are educated in a university or college governments may require certification by a recognized body before they can teach in a school in many countries elementary school education certificate is earned after completion of high school the high school student follows an education specialty track obtain the prerequisite student-teaching time and receive a special diploma to begin teaching after graduation in addition to certification many educational institutions especially within the us require that prospective teachers pass a background check and psychiatric evaluation to be able to teach in classroom this is not always the case with adult further learning institutions but is fast becoming the norm in many countries as security concerns grow

== spiritual teacheredit ==
there are many forms of spiritual or religious teachers in christianity across all three major traditions - (roman) catholic (eastern) orthodox catholic and protestant/non-denominational with a stronger tradition of spiritual formation in the more historic and authoritarian/hierarchical christian traditions with a long tradition of discernment of spirits of vocations and other aspects of spiritual life especially the roman and orthodox catholic churches these positions include the honoured but informal position of starets or elder - a man (or less often woman) often a monastic considered to be graced by god with certain gifts for the guidance of souls and the detection and correction of prelest (spiritual pride or deception) - who acts as a spiritual guide or father in the orthodox catholic tradition especially russian orthodoxy (see optina monastery which had a long line of said starets) the priest or confessor in roman catholicism who is often a man in holy orders but may be a monastic or other person respected for his spiritual accomplishments or acumen (even the pope of rome has a confessor who is not always a bishop and due to the hierarchical structure of the roman church can not be his equal in authority) which is often a semi-official to official position as opposed to the unofficial positions of spiritual guides in the orthodox catholic and protestant traditions and the almost-exclusively informal arrangements (generally formal only in members who are under some form of church discipline) of mentorship (both of adults and children in the latter case often a youth pastor) in the protestant and non-denominational traditions which boundaries can be blurred with the more typically roman confessor position in some of the more historic and conservative reformation churches such as some of the lutheran and anglican in keeping with the individualistic nature of most protestant denominations the emphasis on being guided in spiritual development is small with a heavy emphasis placed on heavy reading and personal spirit-enlightened interpretation of the holy bible
in the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints (lds church) the teacher is an office in the aaronic priesthood generally conferred on young boys or recent converts and has little in common with the spiritual teacher archetype the role of spiritual teacher may be filled by many individuals in the lds church often a trusted friend who may hold any office from elder to bishop or no office at all the emphasis on spiritual mentorship in the lds church is similar to that in the more low-church traditions of protestantism with a stronger emphasis placed on the husband and father of a family to provide spiritual guidance for all of his family ideally in consultation with his wife even if the husband is not a member of the lds church based on interpretatios of certain biblical texts which proclaim the spiritual authority of husbands in marriage even priesthood representatives are expected to defer to the father of the house when in his home further additional spiritual guidance is offered by those holding the office of patriarch which is supposed by latter-day saints to grant certain gifts of the spirit such as the ability to prophesy to its holders this guidance is generally offered during a ceremony called the patriarchal blessing
in hinduism the spiritual teacher is known as a guru and in many traditions of hinduism - especially those common in the west - the emphasis on spiritual mentorship is extremely high with gurus often exercising a great deal of control over the lives of their disciples
