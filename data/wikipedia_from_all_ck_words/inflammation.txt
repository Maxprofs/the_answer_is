inflammation (latin inflammatio) is part of the complex biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli such as pathogens damaged cells or irritants
inflammation is a protective response that involves immune cells blood vessels and molecular mediators the purpose of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury clear out necrotic cells and tissues damaged from the original insult and the inflammatory process and to initiate tissue repair
the classical signs of acute inflammation are pain heat redness swelling and loss of function inflammation is a generic response and therefore it is considered as a mechanism of innate immunity as compared to adaptive immunity which is specific for each pathogen
too little inflammation could lead to progressive tissue destruction by the harmful stimulus (e.g bacteria) and compromise the survival of the organism in contrast chronic inflammation may lead to a host of diseases such as hay fever periodontitis atherosclerosis rheumatoid arthritis and even cancer (e.g. gallbladder carcinoma) inflammation is therefore normally closely regulated by the body
inflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of plasma and leukocytes (especially granulocytes) from the blood into the injured tissues a series of biochemical events propagates and matures the inflammatory response involving the local vascular system the immune system and various cells within the injured tissue prolonged inflammation known as chronic inflammation leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells present at the site of inflammation and is characterized by simultaneous destruction and healing of the tissue from the inflammatory process
inflammation is not a synonym for infection infection describes the interaction between the action of microbial invasion and the reaction of the body's inflammatory defensive response the two components are considered together when discussing an infection and the word is used to imply a microbial invasive cause for the observed inflammatory reaction inflammation on the other hand describes purely the body's immunovascular response whatever the cause may be but because of how often the two are correlated words ending in the suffix -itis (which refers to inflammation) are sometimes informally described as referring to infection for example the word urethritis strictly means only urethral inflammation but clinical health care providers usually discuss urethritis as a urethral infection because urethral microbial invasion is the most common cause of urethritis
it is useful to differentiate inflammation and infection as there are many pathological situations where inflammation is not driven by microbial invasion - for example atherosclerosis type iii hypersensitivity trauma ischaemia there are also pathological situations where microbial invasion does not result in classic inflammatory responsefor example parasitosis eosinophilia

=== cardinal signs ===
acute inflammation is a short-term process usually appearing within a few minutes or hours and begins to cease upon the removal of the injurious stimulus it is characterized by five cardinal signs
an acronym that may be used to remember the key symptoms is prish for pain redness immobility (loss of function) swelling and heat
the traditional names for signs of inflammation come from latin
dolor (pain)
calor (heat)
rubor (redness)
tumor (swelling)
functio laesa (loss of function)
the first four (classical signs) were described by celsus (ca 30 bc38 ad) while loss of function was added later by galen even though the attribution is disputed and the origination of the fifth sign has also been ascribed to thomas sydenham and virchow
redness and heat are due to increased blood flow at body core temperature to the inflamed site swelling is caused by accumulation of fluid pain is due to the release of chemicals such as bradykinin and histamine that stimulate nerve endings loss of function has multiple causes
acute inflammation of the lung (pneumonia) does not cause pain unless the inflammation involves the parietal pleura which does have pain-sensitive nerve endings
=== process of acute inflammation ===
the process of acute inflammation is initiated by resident immune cells already present in the involved tissue mainly resident macrophages dendritic cells histiocytes kupffer cells and mast cells these cells possess surface receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (prrs) which recognize (i.e. bind) two subclasses of molecules pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) and damage-associated molecular patterns (damps) pamps are compounds that are associated with various pathogens but which are distinguishable from host molecules damps are compounds that are associated with host-related injury and cell damage
at the onset of an infection burn or other injuries these cells undergo activation (one of the prrs recognize a pamp or damp) and release inflammatory mediators responsible for the clinical signs of inflammation vasodilation and its resulting increased blood flow causes the redness (rubor) and increased heat (calor) increased permeability of the blood vessels results in an exudation (leakage) of plasma proteins and fluid into the tissue (edema) which manifests itself as swelling (tumor) some of the released mediators such as bradykinin increase the sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia dolor) the mediator molecules also alter the blood vessels to permit the migration of leukocytes mainly neutrophils and macrophages outside of the blood vessels (extravasation) into the tissue the neutrophils migrate along a chemotactic gradient created by the local cells to reach the site of injury the loss of function (functio laesa) is probably the result of a neurological reflex in response to pain
in addition to cell-derived mediators several acellular biochemical cascade systems consisting of preformed plasma proteins act in parallel to initiate and propagate the inflammatory response these include the complement system activated by bacteria and the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems activated by necrosis e.g a burn or a trauma
the acute inflammatory response requires constant stimulation to be sustained inflammatory mediators are short-lived and are quickly degraded in the tissue hence acute inflammation begins to cease once the stimulus has been removed
== vascular component ==
=== vasodilation and increased permeability ===
as defined acute inflammation is an immunovascular response to an inflammatory stimulus this means acute inflammation can be broader divided into a vascular phase that occurs first followed by a cellular phase involving immune cells (more specifically myeloid granulocytes in the acute setting) the vascular component of acute inflammation involves the movement of plasma fluid containing important proteins such as fibrin and immunoglobulins (antibodies) into inflamed tissue
upon contact with pamps tissue macrophages and mastocytes release vasoactive amines such as histamine and serotonin as well as eicosanoids such as prostaglandin e2 and leukotriene b4 to remodel the local vasculature macrophages and endothelial cells release nitric oxide these mediators vasodilate and permeabilize the blood vessels which results in the net distribution of blood plasma from the vessel into the tissue space the increased collection of fluid into the tissue causes it to swell (edema) this exuded tissue fluid contain various antimicrobial mediators from the plasma such as complement lysozyme antibodies which can immediately deal damage to microbes and opsonise the microbes in preparation for the cellular phase if the inflammatory stimulus is a lacerating wound exuded platelets coagulants plasmin and kinins can clot the wounded area and provide haemostasis in the first instance these clotting mediators also provide a structural staging framework at the inflammatory tissue site in the form of a fibrin lattice - as would construction scaffolding at a construction site - for the purpose of aiding phagocytic debridement and wound repair later on some of the exuded tissue fluid is also funneled by lymphatics to the regional lymph nodes flushing bacteria along to start the recognition and attack phase of the adaptive immune system
acute inflammation is characterized by marked vascular changes including vasodilation increased permeability and increased blood flow which are induced by the actions of various inflammatory mediators vasodilation occurs first at the arteriole level progressing to the capillary level and brings about a net increase in the amount of blood present causing the redness and heat of inflammation increased permeability of the vessels results in the movement of plasma into the tissues with resultant stasis due to the increase in the concentration of the cells within blood - a condition characterized by enlarged vessels packed with cells stasis allows leukocytes to marginate (move) along the endothelium a process critical to their recruitment into the tissues normal flowing blood prevents this as the shearing force along the periphery of the vessels moves cells in the blood into the middle of the vessel
=== plasma cascade systems ===
the complement system when activated creates a cascade of chemical reactions that promotes opsonization chemotaxis and agglutination and produces the mac
the kinin system generates proteins capable of sustaining vasodilation and other physical inflammatory effects
the coagulation system or clotting cascade which forms a protective protein mesh over sites of injury
the fibrinolysis system which acts in opposition to the coagulation system to counterbalance clotting and generate several other inflammatory mediators
=== plasma-derived mediators ===
* non-exhaustive list
== cellular component ==
the cellular component involves leukocytes which normally reside in blood and must move into the inflamed tissue via extravasation to aid in inflammation some act as phagocytes ingesting bacteria viruses and cellular debris others release enzymatic granules that damage pathogenic invaders leukocytes also release inflammatory mediators that develop and maintain the inflammatory response in general acute inflammation is mediated by granulocytes whereas chronic inflammation is mediated by mononuclear cells such as monocytes and lymphocytes
=== leukocyte extravasation ===
various leukocytes are critically involved in the initiation and maintenance of inflammation these cells must be able to get to the site of injury from their usual location in the blood therefore mechanisms exist to recruit and direct leukocytes to the appropriate place the process of leukocyte movement from the blood to the tissues through the blood vessels is known as extravasation and can be divided up into a number of broad steps
leukocyte margination and endothelial adhesion activated tissue macrophages release cytokines such as il-1 and tnf which bind to their respective g protein-coupled receptors on the endothelial wall signal transduction induces the immediate expression of p-selectin on endothelial cell surfaces this receptor binds weakly to carbohydrate ligands on leukocyte surfaces and causes them to roll along the endothelial surface as bonds are made and broken cytokines from injured cells induce the expression of e-selectin on endothelial cells which functions similarly to p-selectin cytokines also induce the expression of integrin ligands such as icam-1 and vcam-1 on endothelial cells which further slow leukocytes down these weakly bound leukocytes are free to detach if not activated by chemokines produced in injured tissue activation increases the affinity of bound integrin receptors for icam-1 and vcam-1 on the endothelial cell surface firmly binding the leukocytes to the endothelium
migration across the endothelium known as transmigration via the process of diapedesis chemokine gradients stimulate the adhered leukocytes to move between endothelial cells and pass the basement membrane into the tissues
movement of leukocytes within the tissue via chemotaxis leukocytes reaching the tissue interstitium bind to extracellular matrix proteins via expressed integrins and cd44 to prevent their loss from the site chemoattractants cause the leukocytes to move along a chemotactic gradient towards the source of inflammation
=== phagocytosis ===
extravasated neutrophils in the cellular phase come into contact with microbes at the inflamed tissue phagocytes express cell-surface endocytic pattern recognition receptors (prrs) that have affinity and efficacy against non-specific microbe-associated molecular patterns (pamps) most pamps that bind to endocytic prrs and initiate phagocytosis are cell wall components including complex carbohydrates such as mannans and -glucans lipopolysaccharides (lps) peptidoglycans and surface proteins endocytic prrs on phagocytes reflect these molecular patterns with c-type lectin receptors binding to mannans and -glucans and scavenger receptors binding to lps
upon endocytic prr binding actin-myosin cytoskeletal rearrangement adjacent to the plasma membrane occurs in a way that endocytoses the plasma membrane containing the prr-pamp complex and the microbe phosphatidylinositol and vps34-vps15-beclin1 signalling pathways have been implicated to traffic the endocytosed phagosome to intracellular lysosomes where fusion of the phagosome and the lysosome produces a phagolysosome the reactive oxygen species superoxides and hypochlorite bleach within the phagolysosomes then kill microbes inside the phagocyte
phagocytic efficacy can be enhanced by opsonization plasma derived complement c3b and antibodies that exude into the inflamed tissue during the vascular phase bind to and coat the microbial antigens as well as endocytic prrs phagocytes also express opsonin receptors fc receptor and complement receptor 1 (cr1) which bind to antibodies and c3b respectively the co-stimulation of endocytic prr and opsonin receptor increases the efficacy of the phagocytic process enhancing the lysosomal elimination of the infective agent
=== cell-derived mediators ===
* non-exhaustive list
== morphologic patterns ==
specific patterns of acute and chronic inflammation are seen during particular situations that arise in the body such as when inflammation occurs on an epithelial surface or pyogenic bacteria are involved
granulomatous inflammation characterised by the formation of granulomas they are the result of a limited but diverse number of diseases which include among others tuberculosis leprosy sarcoidosis and syphilis
fibrinous inflammation inflammation resulting in a large increase in vascular permeability allows fibrin to pass through the blood vessels if an appropriate procoagulative stimulus is present such as cancer cells a fibrinous exudate is deposited this is commonly seen in serous cavities where the conversion of fibrinous exudate into a scar can occur between serous membranes limiting their function the deposit sometimes forms a pseudomembrane sheet during inflammation of the intestine (pseudomembranous colitis) pseudomembranous tubes can be formed
purulent inflammation inflammation resulting in large amount of pus which consists of neutrophils dead cells and fluid infection by pyogenic bacteria such as staphylococci is characteristic of this kind of inflammation large localised collections of pus enclosed by surrounding tissues are called abscesses
serous inflammation characterised by the copious effusion of non-viscous serous fluid commonly produced by mesothelial cells of serous membranes but may be derived from blood plasma skin blisters exemplify this pattern of inflammation
ulcerative inflammation inflammation occurring near an epithelium can result in the necrotic loss of tissue from the surface exposing lower layers the subsequent excavation in the epithelium is known as an ulcer
== inflammatory disorders ==
inflammatory abnormalities are a large group of disorders that underlie a vast variety of human diseases the immune system is often involved with inflammatory disorders demonstrated in both allergic reactions and some myopathies with many immune system disorders resulting in abnormal inflammation non-immune diseases with etiological origins in inflammatory processes include cancer atherosclerosis and ischaemic heart disease
a large variety of proteins are involved in inflammation and any one of them is open to a genetic mutation which impairs or otherwise dysregulates the normal function and expression of that protein
examples of disorders associated with inflammation include
=== atherosclerosis ===
atherosclerosis formerly considered a bland lipid storage disease actually involves an ongoing inflammatory response recent advances in basic science have established a fundamental role for inflammation in mediating all stages of this disease from initiation through progression and ultimately the thrombotic complications of atherosclerosis these new findings provide important links between risk factors and the mechanisms of atherogenesis clinical studies have shown that this emerging biology of inflammation in atherosclerosis applies directly to human patients elevation in markers of inflammation predicts outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndromes independently of myocardial damage in addition low-grade chronic inflammation as indicated by levels of the inflammatory marker c-reactive protein prospectively defines risk of atherosclerotic complications thus adding to prognostic information provided by traditional risk factors moreover certain treatments that reduce coronary risk also limit inflammation in the case of lipid lowering with statins this anti-inflammatory effect does not appear to correlate with reduction in low-density lipoprotein levels these new insights into inflammation in atherosclerosis not only increase our understanding of this disease but also have practical clinical applications in risk stratification and targeting of therapy for this scourge of growing worldwide importance
=== allergies ===
an allergic reaction formally known as type 1 hypersensitivity is the result of an inappropriate immune response triggering inflammation vasodilation and nerve irritation a common example is hay fever which is caused by a hypersensitive response by mast cells to allergens pre-sensitised mast cells respond by degranulating releasing vasoactive chemicals such as histamine these chemicals propagate an excessive inflammatory response characterised by blood vessel dilation production of pro-inflammatory molecules cytokine release and recruitment of leukocytes severe inflammatory response may mature into a systemic response known as anaphylaxis
other hypersensitivity reactions (type 2 and type 3) are mediated by antibody reactions and induce inflammation by attracting leukocytes that damage surrounding tissue
=== myopathies ===
inflammatory myopathies are caused by the immune system inappropriately attacking components of muscle leading to signs of muscle inflammation they may occur in conjunction with other immune disorders such as systemic sclerosis and include dermatomyositis polymyositis and inclusion body myositis
=== leukocyte defects ===
due to the central role of leukocytes in the development and propagation of inflammation defects in leukocyte functionality often result in a decreased capacity for inflammatory defense with subsequent vulnerability to infection dysfunctional leukocytes may be unable to correctly bind to blood vessels due to surface receptor mutations digest bacteria (chediak-higashi syndrome) or produce microbicides (chronic granulomatous disease) in addition diseases affecting the bone marrow may result in abnormal or few leukocytes
=== pharmacological ===
certain drugs or exogenous chemical compounds are known to affect inflammation vitamin a deficiency causes an increase in inflammatory responses and anti-inflammatory drugs work specifically by inhibiting the enzymes that produce inflammatory eicosanoids certain illicit drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy may exert some of their detrimental effects by activating transcription factors intimately involved with inflammation (e.g nf-b)
=== cancer ===
inflammation orchestrates the microenvironment around tumours contributing to proliferation survival and migration cancer cells use selectins chemokines and their receptors for invasion migration and metastasis on the other hand many cells of the immune system contribute to cancer immunology suppressing cancer molecular intersection between receptors of steroid hormones which have important effects on cellular development and transcription factors that play key roles in inflammation such as nf-b may mediate some of the most critical effects of inflammatory stimuli on cancer cells this capacity of a mediator of inflammation to influence the effects of steroid hormones in cells is very likely to affect carcinogenesis on the one hand on the other hand due to the modular nature of many steroid hormone receptors this interaction may offer ways to interfere with cancer progression through targeting of a specific protein domain in a specific cell type such an approach may limit side effects that are unrelated to the tumor of interest and may help preserve vital homeostatic functions and developmental processes in the organism
according to a review of 2009 recent data suggests that cancer-related inflammation (cri) may lead to accumulation of random genetic alterations in cancer cells
=== resolution of inflammation ===
the inflammatory response must be actively terminated when no longer needed to prevent unnecessary bystander damage to tissues failure to do so results in chronic inflammation and cellular destruction resolution of inflammation occurs by different mechanisms in different tissues mechanisms that serve to terminate inflammation include
short half-life of inflammatory mediators in vivo
production and release of transforming growth factor (tgf) beta from macrophages
production and release of interleukin 10 (il-10)
production of anti-inflammatory lipoxins
downregulation of pro-inflammatory molecules such as leukotrienes
upregulation of anti-inflammatory molecules such as the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist or the soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (tnfr)
apoptosis of pro-inflammatory cells
desensitization of receptors
increased survival of cells in regions of inflammation due to their interaction with the extracellular matrix (ecm)
downregulation of receptor activity by high concentrations of ligands
cleavage of chemokines by matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) might lead to production of anti-inflammatory factors
production of resolvins protectins or maresins
=== connection to depression ===
there is evidence for a link between inflammation and depression inflammatory processes can be triggered by negative cognitions or their consequences such as stress violence or deprivation thus negative cognitions can cause inflammation that can in turn lead to depression in addition there is increasing evidence that inflammation can cause depression because of the increase of cytokines setting the brain into a sickness mode classical symptoms of being physically sick like lethargy show a large overlap in behaviors that characterize depression levels of cytokines tend to increase sharply during depressive episodes in manics and drop off during remission furthermore it has been shown in clinical trials that anti-inflammatory medicines taken in addition to antidepressants not only significantly improves symptoms but also increases the proportion of subjects positively responding to treatment inflammations that lead to serious depression could be caused by common infections such as those caused by a virus bacteria or even parasites
== systemic effects ==
an infectious organism can escape the confines of the immediate tissue via the circulatory system or lymphatic system where it may spread to other parts of the body if an organism is not contained by the actions of acute inflammation it may gain access to the lymphatic system via nearby lymph vessels an infection of the lymph vessels is known as lymphangitis and infection of a lymph node is known as lymphadenitis when lymph nodes cannot destroy all pathogens the infection spreads further a pathogen can gain access to the bloodstream through lymphatic drainage into the circulatory system
when inflammation overwhelms the host systemic inflammatory response syndrome is diagnosed when it is due to infection the term sepsis is applied with the terms bacteremia being applied specifically for bacterial sepsis and viremia specifically to viral sepsis vasodilation and organ dysfunction are serious problems associated with widespread infection that may lead to septic shock and death
=== acute-phase proteins ===
inflammation also induces high systemic levels of acute-phase proteins in acute inflammation these proteins prove beneficial however in chronic inflammation they can contribute to amyloidosis these proteins include c-reactive protein serum amyloid a and serum amyloid p which cause a range of systemic effects including
=== leukocyte numbers ===
inflammation often affects the numbers of leukocytes present in the body
leukocytosis is often seen during inflammation induced by infection where it results in a large increase in the amount of leukocytes in the blood especially immature cells leukocyte numbers usually increase to between 15 000 and 20 000 cells per microliter but extreme cases can see it approach 100 000 cells per microliter bacterial infection usually results in an increase of neutrophils creating neutrophilia whereas diseases such as asthma hay fever and parasite infestation result in an increase in eosinophils creating eosinophilia
leukopenia can be induced by certain infections and diseases including viral infection rickettsia infection some protozoa tuberculosis and some cancers
=== systemic inflammation and obesity ===
with the discovery of interleukins (il) the concept of systemic inflammation developed although the processes involved are identical to tissue inflammation systemic inflammation is not confined to a particular tissue but involves the endothelium and other organ systems
chronic inflammation is widely observed in obesity the obese commonly have many elevated markers of inflammation including
il-6 (interleukin-6)
il-8 (interleukin-8)
il-18 (interleukin-18)
tnf- (tumor necrosis factor-alpha)
crp (c-reactive protein)
insulin
blood glucose
leptin
low-grade chronic inflammation is characterized by a two- to threefold increase in the systemic concentrations of cytokines such as tnf- il-6 and crp waist circumference correlates significantly with systemic inflammatory response a predominant factor in this correlation is due to the autoimmune response triggered by adiposity whereby immune cells may mistake fatty deposits for intruders the body attacks fat similar to bacteria and fungi when expanded fat cells leak or break open macrophages mobilize to clean up and embed into the adipose tissue then macrophages release inflammatory chemicals including tnf- and (il-6) tnf's primary role is to regulate the immune cells and induce inflammation white blood cells then assist by releasing more cytokines this link between adiposity and inflammation has been shown to produce 10-35% of il-6 in a resting individual and this production increases with increasing adiposity
during clinical studies inflammatory-related molecule levels were reduced and increased levels of anti-inflammatory molecules were seen within four weeks after patients began a very low calorie diet the association of systemic inflammation with insulin resistance and atherosclerosis is the subject of intense research
in the obese mouse models inflammation and macrophage-specific genes are upregulated in white adipose tissue (wat) there were also signs of dramatic increase in circulating insulin level adipocyte lipolysis and formation of multinucleate giant cells the fat-derived protein called angiopoietin-like protein 2 (angptl2) elevates in fat tissues higher than normal angptl2 level in fat tissues develop inflammation as well as insulin and leptin resistance stored fat secretes leptin to signal satiety leptin resistance plays a role in the process where appetite overrules the message of satiety angptl2 then starts an inflammatory cascade causing blood vessels to remodel and attract macrophages angptl2 is an adipocyte-derived inflammatory mediator linking obesity to systemic insulin resistance it is possible that as an inflammatory marker leptin responds specifically to adipose-derived inflammatory cytokines
c-reactive protein (crp) is generated at a higher level in obese people it raises when there is inflammation throughout the body mild elevation in crp increase risk of heart attacks strokes high blood pressure muscle weakness and fragility
=== systemic inflammation and overeating ===
hyperglycemia induces il-6 production from endothelial cells and macrophages meals high in saturated fat as well as meals high in calories have been associated with increases in inflammatory markers while the inflammatory responses are acute and arise in response to overeating the response may become chronic if the overeating is chronic
bente klarlund pedersen wrote in 2013 that interstitial abdominal adiposity (also referred to as accumulated intra-abdominal fat) is a major and possibly primary factor in increasing systemic risk for multiple inflammatory diseases however she indicates that this is mediated via tnf- rather than interleukin 6 which she identified as a myokine in 2003 dr pedersen concludes until the beginning of this millennium it was commonly thought that the increase in il-6 during exercise was a consequence of an immune response due to local damage in the working muscles and it was hypothesized that macrophages were responsible for this increase however an early study demonstrated that il-6 mrna in monocytes did not increase as a result of exercise further work confirmed this finding at the protein level in addition the liver clears rather than secretes il-6 during exercise the finding that the nuclear transcription rate for il-6 and the il-6mrna levels were rapidly and markedly increased after the onset of exercise suggested that a factor associated with contraction was responsible for the increase in il-6 transcriptional rate within the nuclei from myocytes we recently reported that insulin-resistant individuals demonstrated il-6 resistance accordingly we suspect that muscle disuse may lead to il-6 resistance the elevated circulating levels of il-6 that accompany obesity and physical inactivity may represent a compensatory mechanism this would be in line with the well-known facts that insulin resistance is accompanied by hyperinsulinemia and that chronic high circulating levels of leptin may reflect leptin resistance.
dr pedersen continues (in the same article) abdominal adiposity is associated with cvd type 2 diabetes dementia colon cancer and breast cancer as well as all-cause mortality independently of body mass index that is also in people with a normal body weight thus it appears that the health consequences of abdominal adiposity and physical inactivity are very similar it is well known that both physical inactivity and abdominal adiposity are associated with persistent systemic low-grade inflammation models of lipodystrophy suggest that if the subcutaneous fat becomes inflamed and adipocytes undergo apoptosis/necrosis the fat storing capacity is impaired and fat will as a consequence be deposited as ectopic fat one obvious explanation to the differential outcome of accumulating fat subcutaneously or as ectopic fat could be that when fat is stored in the wrong places it will stimulate an inflammatory response evidence exists that visceral fat is more inflamed than subcutaneous fat and constitutes an important source of systemic inflammation accumulating data suggest that although tnf- is not the pathogenetic factor it plays a direct role in the metabolic syndrome in short patients with diabetes have a high protein expression of tnf- in skeletal muscle and increased tnf- levels in plasma and it is likely that adipose tissue which produces tnf- is the main source of the circulating tnf- in vitro studies demonstrate that tnf- has direct inhibitory effects on insulin signaling in addition tnf- infusion in healthy humans induces insulin resistance in skeletal muscle without an effect on egp [endogenous glucose production] it has also been proposed that tnf- causes insulin resistance indirectly in vivo by increasing the release of ffas from adipose tissue tnf- increases lipolysis in human and 3t3-l1 adipocytes however tnf- has no effect on muscle fatty acid oxidation but increases fatty acid incorporation into diacylglycerol which may be involved in the development of the tnf--induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle in addition evidence suggests that tnf- plays a direct role in linking insulin resistance to vascular disease moreover in cvds activated immune cells also play major roles particularly in the etiology of atherosclerosis importantly also tumor initiation promotion and progression is stimulated by systemic elevation of proinflammatory cytokines.
== outcomes ==
the outcome in a particular circumstance will be determined by the tissue in which the injury has occurred and the injurious agent that is causing it here are the possible outcomes to inflammation
resolution
the complete restoration of the inflamed tissue back to a normal status inflammatory measures such as vasodilation chemical production and leukocyte infiltration cease and damaged parenchymal cells regenerate in situations where limited or short-lived inflammation has occurred this is usually the outcome
fibrosis
large amounts of tissue destruction or damage in tissues unable to regenerate cannot be regenerated completely by the body fibrous scarring occurs in these areas of damage forming a scar composed primarily of collagen the scar will not contain any specialized structures such as parenchymal cells hence functional impairment may occur
abscess formation
a cavity is formed containing pus an opaque liquid containing dead white blood cells and bacteria with general debris from destroyed cells
chronic inflammation
in acute inflammation if the injurious agent persists then chronic inflammation will ensue this process marked by inflammation lasting many days months or even years may lead to the formation of a chronic wound chronic inflammation is characterised by the dominating presence of macrophages in the injured tissue these cells are powerful defensive agents of the body but the toxins they release (including reactive oxygen species) are injurious to the organism's own tissues as well as invading agents as a consequence chronic inflammation is almost always accompanied by tissue destruction
== examples ==
inflammation is usually indicated by adding the suffix itis as shown below however some conditions such as asthma and pneumonia do not follow this convention more examples are available at list of types of inflammation
== exercise and inflammation ==
=== exercise-induced acute inflammation ===
acute inflammation of the muscle cells as understood in exercise physiology can result after induced eccentric and concentric muscle training participation in eccentric training and conditioning including resistance training and activities that emphasize eccentric lengthening of the muscle including downhill running on a moderate to high incline can result in considerable soreness within 24 to 48 hours even though blood lactate levels previously thought to cause muscle soreness were much higher with level running this delayed onset muscle soreness (doms) results from structural damage to the contractile filaments and z-disks which has been noted especially in marathon runners whose muscle fibers revealed remarkable damage to the muscle fibers after both training and marathon competition the onset and timing of this gradient damage to the muscle parallels the degree of muscle soreness experienced by the runners
z-disks are the point of contact for the contractile proteins they provide structural support for transmission of force when muscle fibers are activated to shorten however in marathon runners and those who subscribe to the overload principle to enhance their muscles show moderate z-disk streaming and major disruption of thick and thin filaments in parallel groups of sarcomeres as a result of the force of eccentric actions or stretching of tightened muscle fibers
this disruption of muscle fibers triggers white blood cells to increase following induced muscle soreness leading to the inflammatory response observation from induced muscle soreness elevations in plasma enzymes myoglobinemia and abnormal muscle histology and ultrastructure are concluded to be associated with inflammatory response high tension in the contractile-elastic system of muscle results in structural damage to the muscle fiber and plasmalemma and its epimysium perimysium and/or endomysium the mysium damage disrupts calcium homeostasis in injured fibers and fiber bundles resulting in necrosis that peaks about 48 hours after exercise the products of macrophage activity and intracellular contents (such as histamines kinins and k+) accumulate outside cells these substances then stimulate free nerve endings in the muscle a process that appears accentuated by eccentric exercise in which large forces are distributed over a relatively small cross-sectional area of the muscle
=== post-inflammatory muscle growth and repair ===
there is a known relationship between inflammation and muscle growth for instance,high doses of anti-inflammatory medicines (e.g. nsaids) are able to blunt muscle growth cold therapy has been shown to negatively effect muscle growth as well reducing inflammation results in decreased macrophage activity and lower levels of igf-1 acute effects of cold therapy on training adaptations show reduced satellite cell proliferation long term effects include less muscular hypertrophy and an altered cell structure of muscle fibers
it has been further theorized that the acute localized inflammatory responses to muscular contraction during exercise as described above are a necessary precursor to muscle growth as a response to muscular contractions the acute inflammatory response initiates the breakdown and removal of damaged muscle tissue muscles can synthesize cytokines in response to contractions such that the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (il-1) tnf- and il-6 are expressed in skeletal muscle up to 5 days after exercise
in particular the increase in levels of il-6 (interleukin 6) a myokine can reach up to one hundred times that of resting levels depending on volume intensity and other training factors the il-6 increase associated with training initiates about 4 hours after resistance training and remains elevated for up to 24 hours
these acute increases in cytokines as a response to muscle contractions help initiate the process of muscle repair and growth by activating satellite cells within the inflamed muscle satellite cells are crucial for skeletal muscle adaption to exercise they contribute to hypertrophy by providing new myonuclei and repair damaged segments of mature myofibers for successful regeneration following injury- or exercise-induced muscle damage high-level powerlifters can have up to 100% more satellite cells than untrained controls
a rapid and transient localization of the il-6 receptor and increased il-6 expression occurs in satellite cells following contractions il-6 has been shown to mediate hypertrophic muscle growth both in vitro and in vivo unaccustomed exercise can increase il-6 by up to sixfold at 5 hours post-exercise and threefold 8 days after exercise also telling is the fact that nsaids can decrease satellite cell response to exercise thereby reducing exercise-induced protein synthesis
the increase in cytokines (myokines) after resistance exercise coincides with the decrease in levels of myostatin a protein that inhibits muscle differentiation and growth the cytokine response to resistance exercise and moderate-intensity running occur differently with the latter causing a more prolonged response especially at the 12-24 hour mark
developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ that is contracting muscles release multiple substances known as myokines including but not limited to those cited in the above description which promote the growth of new tissue tissue repair and various anti-inflammatory functions which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases the new view that muscle is an endocrine organ is transforming our understanding of exercise physiology and with it of the role of inflammation in adaptation to stress
=== chronic inflammation and muscle loss ===
both chronic and extreme inflammation are associated with disruptions of anabolic signals initiating muscle growth chronic inflammation has been implicated as part of the cause of the muscle loss that occurs with aging increased protein levels of myostatin have been described in patients with diseases characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation increased levels of tnf- can suppress the akt/mtor pathway a crucial pathway for regulating skeletal muscle hypertrophy thereby increasing muscle catabolism cytokines may antagonize the anabolic effects of insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf-1) in the case of sepsis an extreme whole body inflammatory state the synthesis of both myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins are inhibited with the inhibition taking place preferentially in fast-twitch muscle fibers sepsis is also able to prevent leucine from stimulating muscle protein synthesis in animal models when inflammation is created mtor loses its ability to be stimulated by muscle growth
=== exercise as a treatment for inflammation ===
regular physical activity is reported to decrease markers of inflammation although the correlation is imperfect and seems to reveal differing results contingent upon training intensity for instance while baseline measurements of circulating inflammatory markers do not seem to differ greatly between healthy trained and untrained adults long-term training may help reduce chronic low-grade inflammation on the other hand levels of the anti-inflammatory myokine il-6 (interleukin 6) remained elevated longer into the recovery period following an acute bout of exercise in patients with inflammatory diseases relative to the recovery of healthy controls it may well be that low-intensity training can reduce resting pro-inflammatory markers (crp il-6) while moderate-intensity training has milder and less-established anti-inflammatory benefits there is a strong relationship between exhaustive exercise and chronic low-grade inflammation marathon running may enhance il-6 levels as much as 100 times over normal and increases total leuckocyte count and neturophil mobilization
regarding the above il-6 had previously been classified as a proinflammatory cytokine therefore it was first thought that the exercise-induced il-6 response was related to muscle damage however it has become evident that eccentric exercise is not associated with a larger increase in plasma il-6 than exercise involving concentric nondamaging muscle contractions this finding clearly demonstrates that muscle damage is not required to provoke an increase in plasma il-6 during exercise as a matter of fact eccentric exercise may result in a delayed peak and a much slower decrease of plasma il-6 during recovery
recent work has shown that both upstream and downstream signalling pathways for il-6 differ markedly between myocytes and macrophages it appears that unlike il-6 signalling in macrophages which is dependent upon activation of the nfb signalling pathway intramuscular il-6 expression is regulated by a network of signalling cascades including the ca2+/nfat and glycogen/p38 mapk pathways thus when il-6 is signalling in monocytes or macrophages it creates a pro-inflammatory response whereas il-6 activation and signalling in muscle is totally independent of a preceding tnf-response or nfb activation and is anti-inflammatory
several studies show that markers of inflammation are reduced following longer-term behavioural changes involving both reduced energy intake and a regular program of increased physical activity and that in particular il-6 was miscast as an inflammatory marker for example the anti-inflammatory effects of il-6 have been demonstrated by il-6 stimulating the production of the classical anti-inflammatory cytokines il-1ra and il-10 as such individuals pursuing exercise as a means to treat the causal factors underlying chronic inflammation are pursuing a course of action strongly supported by current research as an inactive lifestyle is strongly associated with the development and progression of multiple inflammatory diseases note that cautions regarding over-exertion may apply in certain cases as discussed above though this concern rarely applies to the general population
=== signal-to-noise theory ===
given that localized acute inflammation is a necessary component for muscle growth and that chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with a disruption of anabolic signals initiating muscle growth it has been theorized that a signal-to-noise model may best describe the relationship between inflammation and muscle growth by keeping the noise of chronic inflammation to a minimum the localized acute inflammatory response signals a stronger anabolic response than could be achieved with higher levels of chronic inflammation
