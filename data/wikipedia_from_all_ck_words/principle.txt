a principle is a law or rule that has to be or usually is to be followed or can be desirably followed or is an inevitable consequence of something such as the laws observed in nature or the way that a system is constructed the principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system or reflecting system's designed purpose and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored
examples of principles are descriptive comprehensive and fundamental law doctrine or assumption the normative rule or code of conduct and the law or fact of nature underlying the working of an artificial device
as cause the principle of any effect is the cause that produces it
depending on the way the cause is understood the basic law governing that cause may acquire some distinction in its expression
== causality as efficient cause ==
the efficient cause is the one that produces the necessary effect as long as the necessary and sufficient conditions are provided.the scientific process generally consists of establishing a cause by analyzing its effect upon objects in this way a description can be established to explain what principle brought about the change-effect for this reason the principle of cause is considered to be a determining factor in the production of facts
the principle of causality states that every event has a cause for instance everything that begins to exist must have a cause it was formulated by aristotle's theory which states that everything that moves is moved by another this principle in conjunction with the principle that an infinite regress is not possible has been used to argue for god's existence the principle of causality is often associated with the similar though distinct principle of sufficient reason according to which there is a reason why everything is the particular way it is rather than some other way
== as a final cause ==
final cause is the end or goal which guides one to take the necessary actions to obtain it
for that there needs to be an intelligence capable of conceiving the end and realizing that certain actions must be taken to achieve the goal
science does not recognize the finality of the natural causes as a guiding principle of investigation
it is also understood therefore that the principle guides the action as a norm or rule of behaviour which produces two types of principle
== principle as law ==
=== principle as moral law ===
a principle represents values that orient and rule the conduct of persons in a particular society principles are absorbed in childhood through a process of socialization there is a presumption of liberty of individuals that is restrained exemplary principles include first do no harm the golden rule and the doctrine of the mean
=== principle as a juridic law ===
it represents a set of values that inspire the written norms that organize the life of a society submitting to the powers of an authority generally the state the law establishes a legal obligation in a coercive way it therefore acts as principle conditioning of the action that limits the liberty of the individuals see for examples the territorial principle homestead principle and precautionary principle
=== principle as scientific law ===
archimedes principle relating buoyancy to the weight of displaced water is an early example of a law in science another early one developed by malthus is the population principle now called the malthusian principle freud also wrote on principles especially the reality principle necessary to keep the id and pleasure principle in check biologists use the principle of priority and principle of binominal nomenclature for precision in naming species there are many principles observed in physics notably in cosmology which observes the mediocrity principle the anthropic principle the principle of relativity and the cosmological principle other well-known principles include the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics and the pigeonhole principle and superposition principle in mathematics
== principle as axiom or logical fundament ==
=== principle of sufficient reason ===
the principle states that every event has a rational explanation the principle has a variety of expressions all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following
for every entity x if x exists then there is a sufficient explanation for why x exists
for every event e if e occurs then there is a sufficient explanation for why e occurs
for every proposition p if p is true then there is a sufficient explanation for why p is true
however one realizes that in every sentence there is a direct relation between the predicate and the subject to say that the earth is round corresponds to a direct relation between the subject and the predicate taking this to the sentence the being is the being we realize the principle of identity that the being possesses
=== principle of non-contradiction ===
one thing can't not be and be at the same time under the same aspect. example it is not possible that in exactly the same moment and place it rains and doesn't rain
this principle does not work for non physical events example the move it or lose it rule...if you are not moving you are losing what ever it is at the very same time procrastination is putting something off yet at the same time it is doing harm to character building
=== principle of excluded middle ===
the principle of the excluding third or principium tertium exclusum is a principle of the traditional logic formulated canonically by leibniz as either a is b or a isn't b it is read the following way either p is true or its denial p is it is also known as tertium non datur ('a third (thing) is not) classically it is considered to be one of the most important fundamental principles or laws of thought (along with the principles of identity no contradiction and sufficient reason)
