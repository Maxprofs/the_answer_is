daylight or the light of day is the combination of all direct and indirect sunlight during the daytime this includes direct sunlight diffuse sky radiation and (often) both of these reflected from the earth and terrestrial objects sunlight scattered or reflected from objects in outer space (that is beyond the earth's atmosphere) is not generally considered daylight thus moonlight is never considered daylight despite being indirect sunlight daytime is the period of time each day when daylight occurs daylight happens because the earth rotates and either side the sun shines on is considered daylight
== definitionedit ==
daylight is present at a particular location to some degree whenever the sun is above the horizon at that location (this is true for slightly more than 50% of the earth at any given time for an explanation of why it is not exactly half see here) however the outdoor illuminance can vary from 120,000 lux for direct sunlight at noon which may cause eye pain to less than 5 lux for thick storm clouds with the sun at the horizon (even <1 lux for the most extreme case) which may make shadows from distant street lights visible it may be darker under unusual circumstances such as a solar eclipse or very high levels of atmospheric smoke (see new england's dark day) dust or volcanic ash

== effectsedit ==
daylighting is lighting an indoor space with openings such as windows and skylights that allow daylight into the building this type of lighting is chosen to save energy to avoid hypothesized adverse health effects of over-illumination by artificial light and also for aesthetics the amount of daylight received into an indoor space or room is defined as a daylight factor being the ratio between the measured internal and external light levels artificial lighting energy use can be reduced by simply installing fewer electric lights because daylight is present or by dimming/switching electric lights automatically in response to the presence of daylight a process known as daylight harvesting
in recent years work has taken place to recreate the effects of daylight artificially this is however expensive in terms of both equipment and energy consumption and is applied almost exclusively in specialist areas such as filmmaking where light of such intensity is required anyway in some filmmaking locations such as sweden there is too much light due to long summer days as a result in location films like marianne night scenes have to be shot during the daylight hours and digitally altered later
