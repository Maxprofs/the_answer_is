synthesis
peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway
lipid ii final intermediate peptidoglycan biosynthesis formed transferase murg catalyzes addition nacetylglucosamine glcnac lipid resulting complete disaccharidepentapeptide monomer bactoprenolpyrophosphate anchor occurs interior cytoplasmic membrane bactoprenol chain embedded inner leaflet bilayer lipid ii flipped across membrane expose disaccharidepentapeptide monomer pentapeptide stem consisting laladglumdapdaladala glcnac nacetylmuramic acid murnac polymerization crosslinking peptidoglycan remaining bactoprenolpyrophosphate recycled interior membrane lipid ii referred shuttle carrier peptidoglycan building blocks essential flippase translocates lipid ii across cytoplasmic membrane published july decades searching

functions
polymers lipid ii form linear glycan chain reaction catalyzed glycosyltransferases family gt transpeptidases cross link chains form netlike peptidoglycan macromolecule resulting glycopeptide essential part envelope many bacteria lipidii estimated exist concentration less molecules per bacterial cell

antibiotics
since lipid ii must flipped outside cytoplasmic membrane incorporation disaccharidepeptide unit peptidoglycan relatively accessible target antibiotics antibiotics fight bacteria either directly inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis binding lipid ii form destructive pores cytoplasmic membrane examples antibiotics target lipid ii include
vancomycin synthetic derivatives
ramoplanin
several lantibiotics including common food preservative nisin
teixobactin
copsin
human alpha defensins
