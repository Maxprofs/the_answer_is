a supply is the procurement distribution maintenance while in storage and salvage of supplies including the determination of kind and quantity of supplies the producer phase of a military supply extends from determination of procurement schedules to acceptance of finished supplies by the military services the consumer phase of a military supply extends from receipt of finished supplies by the military services through issue for use or consumption

== logistics versus supply chain managementedit ==
the major difference between the concept of logistic management and supply chain management is the level of information gathered processes analysed and used for decision making an scm-based organization not only having concerns with its immediate clients but also handles and forecasts the factors affecting directly or indirectly their supplier or suppliers or on their client or clients if we exclude this information part out of supply chain model then we can see the logistic management part of the business
== limitations of military supply chainedit ==
unlike standard supply chain management practices world-wide some major concepts are not supported in the military domain for example the just-in-time (jit) model emphasizes holding less (or no) inventory whereas in military supply chains due to the high costs of a stock-out (potentially placing lives in danger) keeping huge inventory is a more acceptable practice some examples of these are the ammunition dump and oil depot
likewise the military procurement process has much different criteria than the normal business procurement process military needs call for reliability of supply during peace and war as compared to price and technology factors
