ground tissue plants includes tissues neither dermal vascular divided three classes based nature cell walls parenchyma cells thin primary walls usually remain alive become mature parenchyma forms filler tissue soft parts plants collenchyma cells thin primary walls areas secondary thickening collenchyma provides extra structural support particularly regions new growth sclerenchyma cells thick lignified secondary walls often die mature sclerenchyma provides main structural support plant
parenchyma
parenchyma prkm para meaning beside chyma meaning filling versatile ground tissue generally constitutes filler tissue soft parts plants forms among things cortex pith stems cortex roots mesophyll leaves pulp fruits endosperm seeds parenchyma cells living cells may remain meristematic maturitymeaning capable cell division stimulated thin flexible cellulose cell walls generally polyhedral closepacked roughly spherical isolated neighbours large central vacuoles allow cells store regulate ions waste products water tissue specialised food storage commonly formed parenchyma cells
parenchyma cells variety functions
leaves form mesophyll responsible photosynthesis exchange gases parenchyma cells mesophyll leaves specialised parenchyma cells called chlorenchyma cells parenchyma cells chloroplasts
storage starch protein fats oils water roots tubers eg potatoes seed endosperm eg cereals cotyledons eg pulses peanuts
secretion eg parenchyma cells lining inside resin ducts
wound repair potential renewed meristematic activity
specialised functions aeration aerenchyma support
shape parenchyma cells varies function spongy mesophyll leaf parenchyma cells range nearspherical loosely arranged large intercellular spaces branched stellate mutually interconnected neighbours ends arms form threedimensional network like red kidney bean phaseolus vulgaris mesophytes cells along epidermal guard cells stoma form system air spaces chambers regulate exchange gases works cells leaf epidermis regarded specialised parenchymal cells modern preference long classify epidermis plant dermal tissue parenchyma ground tissue
collenchyma
first use collenchyma klkm link used describe sticky substance bletia orchidaceae pollen complaining links excessive nomenclature schleiden stated mockingly term collenchyma could easily used describe elongated subepidermal cells unevenly thickened cell walls
collenchyma tissue composed elongated cells irregularly thickened walls provide structural support particularly growing shoots leaves collenchyma tissue makes things resilient strands stalks celery collenchyma cells usually living thick primary cell wall made cellulose pectin cell wall thickness strongly affected mechanical stress upon plant walls collenchyma shaken plants mimic effects wind etc may thicker shaken
four main types collenchyma
angular collenchyma thickened intercellular contact points
tangential collenchyma cells arranged ordered rows thickened tangential face cell wall
annular collenchyma uniformly thickened cell walls
lacunar collenchyma collenchyma intercellular spaces
collenchyma cells often found adjacent outer growing tissues vascular cambium known increasing structural support integrity
collenchyma cell conspicuous microscope due higher refractive index thickened cell wall
sclerenchyma
sclerenchyma supporting tissue plants two types sclerenchyma cells exist fibres sclereids cell walls consist cellulose hemicellulose lignin sclerenchyma cells principal supporting cells plant tissues ceased elongation sclerenchyma fibres great economic importance since constitute source material many fabrics eg flax hemp jute ramie
unlike collenchyma mature sclerenchyma composed dead cells extremely thick cell walls secondary walls make whole cell volume term sclerenchyma derived greek sklrs meaning hard hard thick walls make sclerenchyma cells important strengthening supporting elements plant parts ceased elongation difference fibres sclereids always clear transitions exist sometimes even within plant
fibers
fibers bast generally long slender socalled prosenchymatous cells usually occurring strands bundles bundles totality stems bundles colloquially called fibres high loadbearing capacity ease processed since antiquity made source material number things like ropes fabrics mattresses fibres flax linum usitatissimum known europe egypt years hemp cannabis sativa china long fibres jute corchorus capsularis ramie boehmeria nivea nettle extremely soft elastic especially well suited processing textiles principal cell wall material cellulose
contrasting hard fibres mostly found monocots typical examples fibres many grasses agaves sisal agave sisalana lilies yucca phormium tenax musa textilis others cell walls contain besides cellulose high proportion lignin loadbearing capacity phormium tenax high kgmm good steel wire kg mm fibre tears soon great strain placed upon wire distorts tear strain kgmm thickening cell wall studied linum starting centre fibre thickening layers secondary wall deposited one growth tips cell leads simultaneous elongation development layers secondary material seem like tubes outer one always longer older next completion growth missing parts supplemented wall evenly thickened tips fibres
fibres usually originate meristematic tissues cambium procambium main centres production usually associated xylem phloem vascular bundles fibres xylem always lignified phloem cellulosic reliable evidence fibre cells evolutionary origin tracheids exists evolution strength tracheid cell walls enhanced ability conduct water lost size pits reduced fibres belong xylem bast outside ring cambium fibres arranged characteristic patterns different sites shoot
sclereids
sclereids reduced form sclerenchyma cells highly thickened lignified walls shape star
small bundles sclerenchyma tissue plants form durable layers cores apples gritty texture pears pyrus communis sclereids variable shape cells isodiametric prosenchymatic forked elaborately branched grouped bundles form complete tubes located periphery occur single cells small groups cells within parenchyma tissues compared fibres sclereids relatively short characteristic examples brachysclereids stone cells called stone cells hardness pears quinces cydonia oblonga shoot wax plant hoya carnosa cell walls fill nearly cells volume layering walls existence branched pits clearly visible branched pits called ramiform pits shell many seeds like nuts well stones drupes like cherries plums made sclereids
