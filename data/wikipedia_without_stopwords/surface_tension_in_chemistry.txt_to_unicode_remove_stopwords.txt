materials science surface tension used either surface stress surface free energy
causes
cohesive forces among liquid molecules responsible phenomenon surface tension bulk liquid molecule pulled equally every direction neighboring liquid molecules resulting net force zero molecules surface molecules sides therefore pulled inwards creates internal pressure forces liquid surfaces contract minimal area
surface tension responsible shape liquid droplets although easily deformed droplets water tend pulled spherical shape imbalance cohesive forces surface layer absence forces including gravity drops virtually liquids would approximately spherical spherical shape minimizes necessary wall tension surface layer according laplaces law
another way view surface tension terms energy molecule contact neighbor lower state energy alone contact neighbor interior molecules many neighbors possibly boundary molecules missing neighbors compared interior molecules therefore higher energy liquid minimize energy state number higher energy boundary molecules must minimized minimized quantity boundary molecules results minimal surface area result surface area minimization surface assume smoothest shape mathematical proof smooth shapes minimize surface area relies use eulerlagrange equation since curvature surface shape results greater area higher energy also result consequently surface push back curvature much way ball pushed uphill push back minimize gravitational potential energy
