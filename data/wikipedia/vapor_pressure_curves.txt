in chemistry and physics volatility is the tendency of a substance to vaporize volatility is directly related to a substance's vapor pressure at a given temperature a substance with higher vapor pressure vaporizes more readily than a substance with a lower vapor pressure
the term is primarily written to be applied to liquids; however it may be used to describe the process of sublimation which is associated with solid substances such as dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) and ammonium chloride which can change directly from the solid state to a vapor without becoming liquid
== relations between vapor pressure temperature and boiling pointedit ==
the vapor pressure of a substance is the pressure at which its gas phase is in equilibrium with its condensed phases (liquid or solid) it is a measure of the tendency of molecules and atoms to escape from a liquid or a solid a liquid's atmospheric pressure boiling point corresponds to the temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to the surrounding atmospheric pressure and it is often called the normal boiling point
the higher the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature the higher the volatility and the lower the normal boiling point of the liquid the vapor pressure chart (right hand side) displays the vapor pressures dependency for a variety of liquids as a function of temperature
for example at any given temperature methyl chloride has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart it also has the lowest normal boiling point (24.2 c) which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride (the blue line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere (atm) of absolute vapor pressure
