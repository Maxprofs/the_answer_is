trends ionic radii
ions may larger smaller neutral atom depending ions charge atom loses electron form cation lost electron longer contributes shielding electrons charge nucleus consequently electrons strongly attracted nucleus radius atom gets smaller similarly electron added atom forming anion added electron shields electrons nucleus result size atom increases
ionic radius fixed property given ion varies coordination number spin state parameters nevertheless ionic radius values sufficiently transferable allow periodic trends recognized types atomic radius ionic radii increase descending group ionic size ion also increases increasing coordination number ion highspin state larger ion lowspin state general ionic radius decreases increasing positive charge increases increasing negative charge
anomalous ionic radius crystal often sign significant covalent character bonding bond completely ionic supposedly ionic compounds especially transition metals particularly covalent character illustrated unit cell parameters sodium silver halides table basis fluorides one would say ag larger na basis chlorides bromides opposite appears true greater covalent character bonds agcl agbr reduces bond length hence apparent ionic radius ag effect present halides electropositive sodium silver fluoride fluoride ion relatively unpolarizable
