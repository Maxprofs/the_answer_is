a boil also called a furuncle is a deep folliculitis infection of the hair follicle it is most commonly caused by infection by the bacterium staphylococcus aureus resulting in a painful swollen area on the skin caused by an accumulation of pus and dead tissue boils which are expanded are basically pus-filled nodules individual boils clustered together are called carbuncles most human infections are caused by coagulase-positive s aureus strains notable for the bacteria's ability to produce coagulase an enzyme that can clot blood almost any organ system can be infected by s aureus
== signs and symptomsedit ==
boils are bumpy red pus-filled lumps around a hair follicle that are tender warm and very painful they range from pea-sized to golf ball-sized a yellow or white point at the center of the lump can be seen when the boil is ready to drain or discharge pus in a severe infection an individual may experience fever swollen lymph nodes and fatigue a recurring boil is called chronic furunculosis skin infections tend to be recurrent in many patients and often spread to other family members systemic factors that lower resistance commonly are detectable including diabetes obesity and hematologic disorders boils can be caused by other skin conditions that cause the person to scratch and damage the skin
boils may appear on the buttocks or near the anus the back the neck the stomach the chest the arms or legs or even in the ear canal boils may also appear around the eye where they are called styes a boil on the gum is called intraoral dental sinus or more commonly a gumboil
== causesedit ==
=== bacteriaedit ===
usually the cause is bacteria such as staphylococci that are present on the skin bacterial colonisation begins in the hair follicles and can cause local cellulitis and inflammation additionally myiasis caused by the tumbu fly in africa usually presents with cutaneous furuncles risk factors for furunculosis include bacterial carriage in the nostrils diabetes mellitus obesity lymphoproliferative neoplasms malnutrition and use of immunosuppressive drugs
=== family historyedit ===
people with recurrent boils are as well more likely to have a positive family history take antibiotics and to have been hospitalised anemic or diabetic they are also more likely to have associated skin diseases and multiple lesions
=== otheredit ===
other causes include poor immune system function such as from hiv/aids diabetes malnutrition or alcoholism poor hygiene and obesity have also been linked it may occur following antibiotic use due to the development of resistance to the antibiotics used an associated skin disease favors recurrence this may be attributed to the persistent colonization of abnormal skin with s aureus strains such as is the case in persons with atopic dermatitis boils which recur under the arm breast or in the groin area may be associated with hidradenitis suppurativa (hs)
== complicationsedit ==
the most common complications of boils are scarring and infection or abscess of the skin spinal cord brain kidneys or other organs infections may also spread to the bloodstream (bacteremia) and become life-threatening s aureus strains first infect the skin and its structures (for example sebaceous glands hair follicles) or invade damaged skin (cuts abrasions) sometimes the infections are relatively limited (such as a stye boil furuncle or carbuncle) but other times they may spread to other skin areas (causing cellulitis folliculitis or impetigo) unfortunately these bacteria can reach the bloodstream (bacteremia) and end up in many different body sites causing infections (wound infections abscesses osteomyelitis endocarditis pneumonia) that may severely harm or kill the infected person s aureus strains also produce enzymes and exotoxins that likely cause or increase the severity of certain diseases such diseases include food poisoning septic shock toxic shock syndrome and scalded skin syndrome almost any organ system can be infected by s aureus
== treatmentedit ==
a boil may clear up on its own without bursting but more often it will need to open and drain this will usually happen spontaneously within two weeks regular application of a warm moist compress both before and after a boil opens can help speed healing the area must be kept clean hands washed after touching it and any dressings disposed of carefully in order to avoid spreading the bacteria a doctor may cut open or lance a boil to allow it to drain but squeezing or cutting should not be attempted at home as this may further spread the infection antibiotic therapy may be recommended for large or recurrent boils or those that occur in sensitive areas (such as the groin breasts armpits around or in the nostrils or in the ear) doctors that are not specialists tend to treat boils with antibiotics a less-than-ideal but common treatment but this method should not be used for longer than one month with at least two months (preferably longer) between uses otherwise it will lose its effectiveness if the patient has chronic (more than two years) boils removal by plastic surgery is the best treatment as plastic surgeons have a better understanding of the healing process of skin especially on the outermost layers
furuncles at risk of leading to serious complications should be incised and drained if antibiotics or steroid injections are not effective these include furuncles that are unusually large last longer than two weeks or occur in the middle of the face or near the spine fever and chills are signs of sepsis and indicate immediate treatment is needed
staphylococcus aureus has the ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance easily making treatment difficult knowledge of the antimicrobial resistance of s aureus is important in the selection of antimicrobials for treatment
