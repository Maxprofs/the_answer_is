aims chemical nomenclatureedit
primary function chemical nomenclature ensure spoken written chemical name leaves ambiguity concerning chemical compound name refers chemical name refer single substance less important aim ensure substance single name although limited number alternative names acceptable cases
preferably name also conveys information structure chemistry compound cas numbers form extreme example names perform function cas number refers single compound none contain information structure
form nomenclature used depends audience addressed single correct form exists rather different forms less appropriate different circumstances
common name often suffice identify chemical compound particular set circumstances generally applicable name indicate least chemical formula specific still threedimensional arrangement atoms may need specified
specific circumstances construction large indices becomes necessary ensure compound unique name requires addition extra rules standard iupac system cas system commonly used context expense names longer less familiar readers another system gaining popularity international chemical identifier inchi reflects substances structure composition making general cas number
iupac system often criticized failures become relevant example differing reactivity sulfur allotropes iupac distinguish iupac humanreadable advantage cas numbering would difficult claim iupac names larger relevant molecules rapamycin humanreadable researchers simply use informal names

typei ionic binary compoundsedit
typei ionic binary compounds cation metal cases named first anion usually nonmetal named second cation retains elemental name eg iron zinc suffix nonmetal changes ide example compound libr made li cations br anions thus called lithium bromide compound bao composed ba cations o anions referred barium oxide
oxidation state element unambiguous ions combine typei binary compound equalbutopposite charges neutralized compounds net charge zero
typeii ionic binary compoundsedit
typeii ionic binary compounds cation one oxidation state common among transition metals name compounds one must determine charge cation write name would done type ionic compounds except roman numeral indicating charge cation written parentheses next cation name sometimes referred stock nomenclature example take compound fecl cation iron occur fe fe order compound net charge zero cation must fe three cl anions balanced balance thus compound called ironiii chloride another example could compound pbs anion subscript formula giving charge compound must balanced charge pb cation lead transition metal form cations charge thus compound made one pb cation every two anions compound balanced name written leadiv sulfide older system relying latin names elements also sometimes used name type ii ionic binary compounds system metal instead roman numeral next ic ous suffix added indicate oxidation state ous lower ic higher example compound feo contains fe cation balances o anion since oxidation state lower possibility fe compound sometimes called ferrous oxide compound sno tin ion sn balancing charge two o anions higher oxidation state alternative sn compound called stannic oxide
ionic compounds contain polyatomic ions charged entities containing two covalently bonded types atoms important know names common polyatomic ions include
ammonium nh
nitrite
nitrate
sulfite
sulfate
hydrogen sulfate bisulfate hso
hydroxide oh
cyanide cn
phosphate po
hydrogen phosphate hpo
dihydrogen phosphate hpo
carbonate co
hydrogen carbonate bicarbonate hco
hypochlorite clo
chlorite clo
chlorate clo
perchlorate clo
acetate cho permanganate mno
dichromate cro
chromate cro
peroxide o
formula naso denotes cation sodium na anion sulfite ion therefore compound named sodium sulfite given formula caoh seen oh hydroxide ion since charge calcium ion makes sense must two oh ions balance charge therefore name compound calcium hydroxide one asked write formula copperi chromate roman numeral indicates copper ion cu one identify compound contains chromate ion cro two copper ions needed balance charge one chromate ion formula cucro
typeiii binary compoundsedit
typeiii binary compounds covalently bonded covalent bonding occurs nonmetal elements covalentlybonded compounds also known molecules compound first element named first full elemental name second element named anion root name element ide suffix prefixes used indicate numbers atom present prefixes mono one di two tri three tetra four penta five hexa six hepta seven octa eight nona nine deca ten prefix mono never used first element thus ncl called nitrogen trichloride po called diphosphorus pentoxide penta prefix dropped vowel easier pronunciation bf called boron trifluoride
carbon dioxide written co sulfur tetrafluoride written sf compounds however common names prevail ho example usually called water rather dihydrogen monoxide nh preferentially called ammonia rather hydrogen nitride
substitutive nomenclatureedit
naming method generally follows established iupac organic nomenclature hydrides main group elements groups given ane base name eg borane b h oxidane ho phosphane p h although name phosphine also common use recommended iupac compound pcl would thus named substitutively trichlorophosphane chlorine substituting however names stems derived element name example n h called azane
additive nomenclatureedit
naming method developed principally coordination compounds although widely applied example application coclnhcl pentaamminechloridocobaltiii chloride
ligands special naming convention whereas chloride becomes prefix chloro substitutive naming ligand becomes chlorido
