a chirp is a signal in which the frequency increases (up-chirp) or decreases (down-chirp) with time in some sources the term chirp is used interchangeably with sweep signal it is commonly used in sonar and radar but has other applications such as in spread-spectrum communications in spread-spectrum usage surface acoustic wave (saw) devices such as reflective array compressors (racs) are often used to generate and demodulate the chirped signals in optics ultrashort laser pulses also exhibit chirp which in optical transmission systems interacts with the dispersion properties of the materials increasing or decreasing total pulse dispersion as the signal propagates the name is a reference to the chirping sound made by birds see bird vocalization

=== linearedit ===
in a linear chirp the instantaneous frequency varies linearly with time
where is the starting frequency (at time ) and is the rate of frequency increase or chirp rate
where is the final frequency and is the starting frequency is the time it takes to sweep from to 
the corresponding time-domain function for the phase of any oscillating signal is the integral of the frequency function since one expects the phase to grow like  i.e. that the derivative of the phase is the angular frequency 
for the linear chirp this results in
where is the initial phase (at time ) thus this is also called quadratic-phase signal
the corresponding time-domain function for a sinusoidal linear chirp is the sine of the phase in radians
in the frequency domain the instantaneous frequency described by the equation is accompanied by additional frequencies (harmonics) which exist as a fundamental consequence of frequency modulation these harmonics are quantifiably described through the use of bessel functions however with the aid of a frequency vs time profile spectrogram one can readily see that the linear chirp has spectral components at harmonics of the fundamental chirp
=== exponentialedit ===
in a geometric chirp also called an exponential chirp the frequency of the signal varies with a geometric relationship over time in other words if two points in the waveform are chosen and  and the time interval between them is kept constant the frequency ratio will also be constant
in an exponential chirp the frequency of the signal varies exponentially as a function of time
where is the starting frequency (at ) and is the rate of exponential increase in frequency unlike the linear chirp which has a constant chirp rate an exponential chirp has an exponentially increasing chirp rate
the corresponding time-domain function for the phase of an exponential chirp is the integral of the frequency
where is the initial phase (at )
the corresponding time-domain function for a sinusoidal exponential chirp is the sine of the phase in radians
as was the case for the linear chirp the instantaneous frequency of the exponential chirp consists of the fundamental frequency accompanied by additional harmonics
== generationedit ==
a chirp signal can be generated with analog circuitry via a voltage-controlled oscillator (vco) and a linearly or exponentially ramping control voltage it can also be generated digitally by a digital signal processor (dsp) and digital to analog converter (dac) using a direct digital synthesizer (dds) and by varying the step in the numerically controlled oscillator it can also be generated by a yig oscillator
== relation to an impulse signaledit ==
a chirp signal shares the same spectral content with an impulse signal however unlike in the impulse signal spectral components of the chirp signal have different phases i.e. their power spectra are alike but the phase spectra are distinct dispersion of a signal propagation medium may result in unintentional conversion of impulse signals into chirps on the other hand many practical applications such as chirped pulse amplifiers or echolocation systems use chirp signals instead of impulses because of their inherently lower papr

=== chirp modulationedit ===
chirp modulation or linear frequency modulation for digital communication was patented by sidney darlington in 1954 with significant later work performed by winkler in 1962 this type of modulation employs sinusoidal waveforms whose instantaneous frequency increases or decreases linearly over time these waveforms are commonly referred to as linear chirps or simply chirps
hence the rate at which their frequency changes is called the chirp rate in binary chirp modulation binary data is transmitted by mapping the bits into chirps of opposite chirp rates for instance over one bit period 1 is assigned a chirp with positive rate a and 0 a chirp with negative rate a chirps have been heavily used in radar applications and as a result advanced sources for transmission and matched filters for reception of linear chirps are available
=== chirplet transformedit ===
another kind of chirp is the projective chirp of the form
having the three parameters a (scale) b (translation) and c (chirpiness) the projective chirp is ideally suited to image processing and forms the basis for the projective chirplet transform
=== key chirpedit ===
a change in frequency of morse code from the desired frequency due to poor stability in the rf oscillator is known as chirp and in the rst code is given an appended letter c
== chirp rate edit ==
chirp rate is the instantaneous rate of change of the frequency of a waveform if a waveform is defined as
then the instantaneous frequency is defined to be
and the chirp rate is defined to be
