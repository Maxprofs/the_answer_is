birds
paleontologists regard birds surviving dinosaurs see origin birds thought nonavian theropods became extinct including thenflourishing groups like enantiornithines hesperornithiforms recent research however suggests one nonavian ornithuromorph species may survived extinction event several analyses bird fossils show divergence species prior kpg boundary duck chicken ratite bird relatives coexisted nonavian dinosaurs large collections bird fossils representing range different species provides definitive evidence persistence archaic birds within years kpg boundary none known survive paleogene persistence latest maastrichtian therefore provides strong evidence mass extinction archaic birds coinciding chicxulub asteroid impact small fraction cretaceous bird species survived impact giving rise todays birds far single bird species named confidently identified kpg boundary present maastrichtian hell creek formation danian fort union formation bird group known certain survived kpg boundary aves though one paleogene species qinornis paleocenica may represent surviving nonneornithine bird avians may able survive extinction result abilities dive swim seek shelter water marshlands many species avians build burrows nest tree holes termite nests provided shelter environmental effects kpg boundary longterm survival past boundary assured result filling ecological niches left empty extinction nonavian dinosaurs
nonavian dinosaurs
excluding controversial claims scientists agree nonavian dinosaurs became extinct kpg boundary dinosaur fossil record interpreted show decline diversity decline diversity last million years cretaceous may quality dinosaur fossil record simply good enough permit researchers distinguish options since evidence late maastrichtian nonavian dinosaurs could burrow swim dive unable shelter worst parts environmental stress occurred kpg boundary possible small dinosaurs birds survive would deprived food herbivorous dinosaurs would found plant material scarce carnivores would quickly found prey short supply

effects impact
impact would inhibited photosynthesis creating dust cloud blocked sunlight year injecting sulfuric acid aerosols stratosphere might reduced sunlight reaching earths surface argued would take least ten years aerosols dissipate would account extinction plants phytoplankton organisms dependent including predatory animals well herbivores small creatures whose food chains based detritus would reasonable chance survival consequences reentry ejecta earths atmosphere would include brief hours long intense pulse infrared radiation killing exposed organisms global firestorms likely resulted heat pulse fall back earth incendiary fragments blast recent research indicates global debris layer deposited impact contained enough soot suggest entire terrestrial biosphere burned high o

alternative hypotheses
fact extinctions occur time chicxulub asteroid impact strongly supports impact hypothesis extinction however scientists continue dispute role chicxulub impact driving extinction suggest events may contributed endcretaceous mass extinction particular volcanic eruptions climate change sea level change impact events suggested play role driving kpg extinction
deccan traps
arguments deccan traps flood basalts caused extinction usually linked view extinction gradual flood basalt events thought started around mya lasted million years recent evidence shows traps erupted period years spanning kpg boundary therefore may responsible extinction delayed biotic recovery thereafter
deccan traps could caused extinction several mechanisms including release dust sulfuric aerosols air might blocked sunlight thereby reduced photosynthesis plants addition deccan trap volcanism might resulted carbon dioxide emissions increased greenhouse effect dust aerosols cleared atmosphere
years deccan traps hypothesis linked slower extinction luis alvarez died replied paleontologists misled sparse data assertion initially wellreceived later intensive field studies fossil beds lent weight claim eventually paleontologists began accept idea mass extinctions end cretaceous largely least partly due massive earth impact however even walter alvarez acknowledged major changes earth even impact drop sea level massive volcanic eruptions produced indian deccan traps may contributed extinctions duration event less ky time span short explained deccan volcanism geophysics model highprecision radiometric dating suggest chicxulub impact may induce state shift deccan volcanism

maastrichtian sealevel regression
clear evidence sea levels fell final stage cretaceous time mesozoic era maastrichtian stage rock layers various parts world later layers terrestrial earlier layers represent shorelines earliest layers represent seabeds layers show tilting distortion associated mountain building therefore likeliest explanation regression drop sea level direct evidence cause regression explanation currently accepted likely midocean ridges became less active therefore sank weight
severe regression would greatly reduced continental shelf area speciesrich part sea therefore could enough cause marine mass extinction however research concludes change would insufficient cause observed level ammonite extinction regression would also caused climate changes partly disrupting winds ocean currents partly reducing earths albedo therefore increasing global temperatures
marine regression also resulted loss epeiric seas western interior seaway north america loss seas greatly altered habitats removing coastal plains ten million years host diverse communities found rocks dinosaur park formation another consequence expansion freshwater environments since continental runoff longer distances travel reaching oceans change favorable freshwater vertebrates prefer marine environments sharks suffered
