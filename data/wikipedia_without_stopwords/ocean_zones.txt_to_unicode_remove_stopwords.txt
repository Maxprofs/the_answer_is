sub zones
oceanic zone subdivided epipelagic mesopelagic bathypelagic zones
epipelagic euphotic zone also called sunlit zone receives enough sunlight support photosynthesis temperatures zone range anywhere c fnhptv
mesopelagic disphotic zone small amounts light penetrate lies epipelagic zone zone often referred twilight zone due scarce amount light temperatures mesopelagic zone range c f pressure higher pounds per square inch pa increases depth nhptv
ocean lies bathypelagic aphotic zone light penetrates also called midnight zone water pressure intense temperatures near freezing range c f
marine life
oceanographers divided ocean zones based far light reaches light zones found oceanic zone epipelagic zone one closest surface best lit extends meters contains phytoplankton zooplankton support larger organisms like marine mammals types fish past meters enough light penetrates water support life plant life exists nhptv
creatures however thrive around hydrothermal vents geysers located ocean floor expel super heated water rich minerals organisms feed chemosynthetic bacteria use super heated water chemicals hydrothermal vents create energy place photosynthesis existence bacteria allow creatures like squids hatchet fish octopuses tube worms giant clams spider crabs organisms survive knight
due total darkness zones past epipelagic zone many organisms survive deep oceans eyes organisms make light bioluminescence often light blue green colour many marine organisms sensitive blue light two chemicals luciferin luciferase react one another create soft glow process bioluminescence created similar happens glow stick broken deepsea organisms use bioluminescence everything luring prey navigation knight
