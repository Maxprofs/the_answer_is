altitudinal migration shortdistance animal migration lower altitudes higher altitudes back commonly thought happen response climate food availability changes well increasingly due anthropogenic influence migrations occur reproductive nonreproductive seasons altitudinal avian migration common also found vertebrates seen invertebrates

regions
many documented examples migratory range shifts along elevation gradient among temperate species migrations understood temperate regions far less understood among tropical ecosystems species documented cases altitudinal migration typically seen among taxa found montane areas generally elevation increases species richness decreases
tropics
tropics altitudinal migrations commonly seen among frugivores nectarvores seen among tropical hummingbirds migrate altitudinally response shifts food abundance availability migration pattern observed neotropical birds also seen terrestrial tropical montane species bairds tapir whitelipped peccary
tropical avian species altitudinal migrants include whiteruffed manakin resplendent quetzal least species raptor many species hummingbird

temperates
less common avian species temperate regions altitudinal migration still plays part migration patterns montane zones seen ungulates rocky mountains avian temperate species migrate altitudinally include mountain chickadee american dipper
ungulates observed migrate altitudinally include roe deer bighorn sheep mountain goats

food abundance nutrition
migration response food abundance accepted hypothesis species migrate altitudinally hypothesis states peaks food abundance along elevational gradient slope mountain drive migration patterns species exploit available food resources peaks food abundance along gradient often coincide breeding season frugivorous birds whiteruffed manakins corapipo altera migrate higher elevations exploit peaks fruit abundance evidence supports possibility migrants competitive advantage compared nonmigrant sedentary species due increased foraging ability larger area resulting greater food nutrient uptake shown diet differs nonmigratory migratory species largescale analyses speciespair comparisons frugivorous tropical birds

reproduction

nest predation

conservation implications
climate change
climate change could causing migration patterns shift earlier time frame coinciding earlier start growing period means migratory species may leave lower altitudes higheraltitude breeding sites breeding sites still lack necessary resources species shorter migratory paths may able return lower elevations wait run risk running resources lower altitude food cover may available short set period time
birds species montane forests show altitudinal migration patterns changes climate seasonality decrease increase would affect large portion tropical species potential cause trophic cascade communitylevel
furthermore climate change may cause seasonal storms rainfall patterns change shifting timing andor need altitudinal migration future shifting availability resources believed driving cause altitudinal migration
upward shift species caused climate change also holds potential cause mountaintop extinction lowland biotic attrition lowland tropics lack species cope increasing temperatures overall loss species richness occur due fewer migratory species replace lost ones

migrational corridors
migrational corridors connecting lowland montane habitats essential upkeep survival migratory species species cross cleared lands suchs pastures many require closed forest areas provided migrational corridors
seed dispersal
