in geography a plain is a flat area plains occur as lowlands and at the bottoms of valleys but also on plateaus or uplands at high elevations in a valley a plain is enclosed on two sides but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a complete or partial ring of hills by mountains or cliffs where a geological region contains more than one plain they may be connected by a pass (sometime termed a gap) plains may have been formed from flowing lava deposited by water ice wind or formed by erosion by these agents from hills and mountains
plains in many areas are important for agriculture because where the soils were deposited as sediments they may be deep and fertile and the flatness facilitates mechanization of crop production or because they support grasslands which provide good grazing for livestock
== types of plainsedit ==
structural plains relatively undisturbed horizontal surfaces of the earth they are structurally depressed areas of the world that make up some of the most extensive natural lowlands on the earth's surface
erosional plains that have been leveled by various agents of denudation such as running water rivers wind and glacier which wear out the rugged surface and smoothens them plain resulting from the action of these agents of denudation are called peneplains (almost plain) while plains formed from wind action are called pediplains
depositional plains formed by the deposition of materials brought by various agents of transportation such as rivers wind waves and glaciers their fertility and economic relevance depend greatly on the types of sediments that are laid down
depositional plains are grouped into the following
alluvial plains formed by rivers and may be one of these overlapping types
alluvial plain formed over a long period of time by a river depositing sediment on its flood plain or bed which becomes alluvial soil the difference between a flood plain and an alluvial plain is that the flood plain represents the area experiencing flooding fairly regularly in the present or recently whereas an alluvial plain includes areas where the flood plain is now and used to be or areas which only experience flooding a few times a century
flood plain adjacent to a stream river lake or wetland that experiences occasional or periodic flooding
scroll plain a plain through which a river meanders with a very low gradient
lacustrine plain a plain that originally formed in a lacustrine environment that is as the bed of a lake
lava plain formed by sheets of flowing lava
glacial plains formed by the movement of glaciers under the force of gravity
sandur (plural sandar) a glacial out-wash plain formed of sediments deposited by melt-water at the terminus of a glacier sandar consist mainly of stratified (layered and sorted) gravel and sand
till plain a plain of glacial till that forms when a sheet of ice becomes detached from the main body of a glacier and melts in place depositing the sediments it carries till plains are composed of unsorted material (till) of all sizes
abyssal plain a flat or very gently sloping area of the deep ocean basin
planitia the latin word for plain is used in the naming of plains on extraterrestrial objects (planets and moons) such as hellas planitia on mars or sedna planitia on venus
