pines are conifer trees in the genus pinus /pinus/ in the family pinaceae they are the only genus in the subfamily pinoideae counting varieties and subspecies the plant list of the royal botanic gardens kew and missouri botanical garden accepts 175 names of pines as current together with some thirty or forty unresolved and many more synonyms or misapplied
== etymologyedit ==
the modern english name pine derives from latin pinus which some have traced to the indo-european base *pt- resin (source of english pituitary) in the past (pre-19th century) they were often known as fir from old norse fyrre by way of middle english firre the old norse name is still used for pines in some modern north european languages in danish fyr in norwegian fura/fure/furu swedish fura/furu dutch vuren and fhre in german but in modern english fir is now restricted to fir (abies) and douglas-fir (pseudotsuga)
== taxonomy nomenclature and codificationedit ==
pines are gymnosperms the genus is divided into three subgenera based on cone seed and leaf characters
pinus subg pinus the yellow or hard pine group generally with harder wood and two or three needles per fascicle
pinus subg ducampopinus the foxtail or pinyon group
pinus subg strobus the white or soft pine group generally with softer wood and five needles per fascicle
== distributionedit ==
most regions of the northern hemisphere (see list of pines by region) host some native species of pines one species (sumatran pine) crosses the equator in sumatra to 2s in north america various species occur in regions at latitudes from as far as 66n to as far south as 12n
various species have been introduced to temperate and subtropical regions of both hemispheres where they are grown as timber or cultivated as ornamental plants in parks and gardens a number of such introduced species have become invasive and threaten native ecosystems
== descriptionedit ==
pines are evergreen coniferous resinous trees (or rarely shrubs) growing 380 m tall with the majority of species reaching 1545 m tall the smallest are siberian dwarf pine and potosi pinyon and the tallest is a 268.35-feet (81.79-meter) tall ponderosa pine located in southern oregon's rogue river-siskiyou national forest
the bark of most pines is thick and scaly but some species have thin flaky bark the branches are produced in regular pseudo whorls actually a very tight spiral but appearing like a ring of branches arising from the same point many pines are uninodal producing just one such whorl of branches each year from buds at the tip of the year's new shoot but others are multinodal producing two or more whorls of branches per year the spiral growth of branches needles and cone scales are arranged in fibonacci number ratios the new spring shoots are sometimes called candles they are covered in brown or whitish bud scales and point upward at first then later turn green and spread outward these candles offer foresters a means to evaluate fertility of the soil and vigour of the trees
pines are long-lived typically reaching ages of 1001,000 years some even more the longest-lived is the great basin bristlecone pine pinus longaeva one individual of this species dubbed methuselah is one of the world's oldest living organisms at around 4,600 years old this tree can be found in the white mountains of california an older tree now cut down was dated at 4,900 years old it was discovered in a grove beneath wheeler peak and it is now known as prometheus after the greek immortal
=== foliageedit ===
pines have four types of leaf
seed leaves (cotyledons) on seedlings born in a whorl of 424
juvenile leaves which follow immediately on seedlings and young plants 26 cm long single green or often blue-green and arranged spirally on the shoot these are produced for six months to five years rarely longer
scale leaves similar to bud scales small brown and non-photosynthetic and arranged spirally like the juvenile leaves
needles the adult leaves which are green (photosynthetic) bundled in clusters (fascicles) of 16 commonly 25 needles together each fascicle produced from a small bud on a dwarf shoot in the axil of a scale leaf these bud scales often remain on the fascicle as a basal sheath the needles persist for 1.540 years depending on species if a shoot is damaged (e.g eaten by an animal) the needle fascicles just below the damage will generate a bud which can then replace the lost leaves
=== conesedit ===
pines are mostly monoecious having the male and female cones on the same tree though a few species are sub-dioecious with individuals predominantly but not wholly single-sex the male cones are small typically 15 cm long and only present for a short period (usually in spring though autumn in a few pines) falling as soon as they have shed their pollen the female cones take 1.53 years (depending on species) to mature after pollination with actual fertilization delayed one year at maturity the female cones are 360 cm long each cone has numerous spirally arranged scales with two seeds on each fertile scale the scales at the base and tip of the cone are small and sterile without seeds the seeds are mostly small and winged and are anemophilous (wind-dispersed) but some are larger and have only a vestigial wing and are bird-dispersed (see below) at maturity the cones usually open to release the seeds but in some of the bird-dispersed species (e.g whitebark pine) the seeds are only released by the bird breaking the cones open in others the seeds are stored in closed ("serotinous") cones for many years until an environmental cue triggers the cones to open releasing the seeds the most common form of serotiny is pyriscence in which a resin binds the cones shut until melted by a forest fire
== ecologyedit ==
pines grow well in acid soils some also on calcareous soils most require good soil drainage preferring sandy soils but a few (e.g lodgepole pine) will tolerate poorly drained wet soils a few are able to sprout after forest fires (e.g canary island pine) some species of pines (e.g bishop pine) need fire to regenerate and their populations slowly decline under fire suppression regimes several species are adapted to extreme conditions imposed by elevation and latitude (e.g siberian dwarf pine mountain pine whitebark pine and the bristlecone pines) the pinyon pines and a number of others notably turkish pine and gray pine are particularly well adapted to growth in hot dry semi-desert climates
the seeds are commonly eaten by birds and squirrels some birds notably the spotted nutcracker clark's nutcracker and pinyon jay are of importance in distributing pine seeds to new areas pine needles are sometimes eaten by some lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species (see list of lepidoptera that feed on pines) the symphytan species pine sawfly and goats
== useedit ==
pines are among the most commercially important tree species valued for their timber and wood pulp throughout the world in temperate and tropical regions they are fast-growing softwoods that will grow in relatively dense stands their acidic decaying needles inhibiting the sprouting of competing hardwoods commercial pines are grown in plantations for timber that is denser more resinous and therefore more durable than spruce (picea) pine wood is widely used in high-value carpentry items such as furniture window frames panelling floors and roofing and the resin of some species is an important source of turpentine
many pine species make attractive ornamental plantings for parks and larger gardens with a variety of dwarf cultivars being suitable for smaller spaces pines are also commercially grown and harvested for christmas trees pine cones the largest and most durable of all conifer cones are craft favorites pine boughs appreciated especially in wintertime for their pleasant smell and greenery are popularly cut for decorations a number of species are attacked by nematodes causing pine wilt disease which can kill some quickly pine needles are also used for making decorative articles like baskets trays pots etc this native american skill is now being replicated across the world pine needle handicrafts are made in the us canada mexico nicaragua and india pine needles serve as food for various lepidoptera see list of lepidoptera that feed on pines
because pines have no insect or decay resistant qualities after logging they are generally recommended for construction purposes as indoor use only (ex indoor drywall framing) this wood left outside can be expected to last no more than 1218 months depending on the local climate it is commonly referred to by several different names which include north american timber spf (spruce pine fir) and whitewood
=== foodedit ===
some species have large seeds called pine nuts that are harvested and sold for cooking and baking they are an essential ingredient of pesto alla genovese
the soft moist white inner bark (cambium) found clinging to the woody outer bark is edible and very high in vitamins a and c it can be eaten raw in slices as a snack or dried and ground up into a powder for use as an ersatz flour or thickener in stews soups and other foods such as bark bread adirondack indians got their name from the mohawk indian word atir:taks meaning tree eaters
=== biomedicaledit ===
a tea made by steeping young green pine needles in boiling water (known as tallstrunt in sweden) is high in vitamins a and c
pine has been listed as one of the 38 substances used to prepare bach flower remedies a kind of alternative medicine promoted for its effect on health however according to cancer research uk there is no scientific evidence to prove that flower remedies can control cure or prevent any type of disease including cancer
