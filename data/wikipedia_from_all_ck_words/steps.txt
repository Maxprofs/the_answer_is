== history ==
=== 199799 formation commercial success and step one ===
steps were formed by steve crosby & barry upton (writers of 5 6 7 8") alongside manager tim byrne after auditioning hopefuls who answered an ad in the stage newspaper byrne had previously been involved in the production of the smash hits poll winners party the bbc collaboration with the pop magazine smash hits > after auditions the original line-up of h lisa derek maddy and mitch was finalised and the band started shooting promotional images and recording tracks however derek maddy and mitch left as they wanted more than a one-hit wonder and saw no long-term future with steps new auditions were held on 7 may 1997 this time with h and lisa acting as members of the judging panel and in conjunction with the manufacturers they selected faye lee and claire as the remaining members
their first single 5 6 7 8 was a techno line dance song though not typical of what became their style it was their first hit both in the uk and internationally despite only peaking at number 14 the single achieved considerable longevity in the fast-paced singles climate of 1997-1998 racking up over four months on the uk chart the track remains one of the highest selling singles never to reach the top 10 on the uk singles chart its release in australia gave the group their first number one in 1998
tim byrne then founded a management & production company byrne blood with former bmg head of marketing & video victoria blood which took over sole management of steps and was also instrumental in the creation and management of a1
the group were signed by jive records and following the success of their debut single songwriter pete waterman became involved in the project waterman's stated intention was to try to recreate the sound of abba and blend it with a more modern style he often referred to the group as abba on speed in april 1998 steps launched their second single a cover version of bananarama's last thing on my mind which became their first uk top ten peaking at number 6
by august 1998 steps continued to build momentum with their third single one for sorrow which peaked at number 2 and began an unbroken chain of 14 consecutive top 5 hits on the uk singles chart unlike many other pop acts of the era steps singles success translated into impressive album sales as their debut album step one entered the chart at number 2 it was certified 5x platinum following a run of 50 weeks in the top 20
the next single release was a double a-side which provided steps with their signature song and biggest career seller the single was a cover version of the bee gees tragedy and an original track heartbeat the single was released in november 1998 when it charted at number 2 following enduring popularity over the christmas period the single rebounded up the chart and became their first number one hit in january 1999 seven weeks after it initially charted a feat almost unheard of during the pre- and post-millennium era the single eventually sold over a million copies and occupied the chart for 30 weeks
the final track to be released from step one was better best forgotten because of the continued success of the previous single the cd release was delayed by nearly two months nonetheless better best forgotten could do no wrong and entered the chart at number 2 despite surrendering a midweek lead over the official comic relief song by boyzone
steps were part of the ensemble that released thank abba for the music (a medley of abba's take a chance on me dancing queen mamma mia and thank you for the music") in march 1999 as performed at the brit awards the other artists singing were tina cousins cleopatra b*witched and billie known collectively as the supertroupers the single later peaked at number four the group was also nominated for best newcomer pete waterman claimed to have been told days before the ceremony that steps had won the award as voted for by listeners of bbc radio 1 however on the night the award was handed to the scottish band belle & sebastian who were assumed to be rank outsiders despite the allegation that a significant number of votes for belle & sebastian were traced to one location (two computers sited in a particular uk university campus) the band held onto their award as foul-play was denied by organizers of the brit awards

steps recently said in a recent interview with digital spy that they believe there is a gap in the market for their brand of happy pop scott-lee said times have changed but we are in a recession and steps music was very light-hearted and fun so there could be a place for that in today's society, what else is interesting is that there aren't any boy/girl pop groups out there at the moment so there's definitely a gap there.
