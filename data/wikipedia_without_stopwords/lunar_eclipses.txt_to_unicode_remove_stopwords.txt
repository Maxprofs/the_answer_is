lunar eclipse occurs moon passes directly behind earth umbra shadow occur sun earth moon aligned syzygy exactly closely earth middle hence lunar eclipse occur night full moon type length eclipse depend upon moons location relative orbital nodes
total lunar eclipse direct sunlight completely blocked earths shadow light seen refracted earths shadow light looks red reason sunset looks red due rayleigh scattering blue light reddish color total lunar eclipse sometimes called blood moon
unlike solar eclipse viewed certain relatively small area world lunar eclipse may viewed anywhere night side earth lunar eclipse lasts hours whereas total solar eclipse lasts minutes given place due smaller size moons shadow also unlike solar eclipses lunar eclipses safe view without eye protection special precautions dimmer full moon
date next eclipse see section recent forthcoming lunar eclipses
types lunar eclipse
shadow earth divided two distinctive parts umbra penumbra within umbra direct solar radiation however result suns large angular size solar illumination partially blocked outer portion earths shadow given name penumbra
penumbral eclipse occurs moon passes earths penumbra penumbra causes subtle darkening moons surface special type penumbral eclipse total penumbral eclipse moon lies exclusively within earths penumbra total penumbral eclipses rare occur portion moon closest umbra appear somewhat darker rest moon
partial lunar eclipse occurs portion moon enters umbra moon travels completely earths umbra one observes total lunar eclipse moons speed shadow one kilometer per second mph totality may last nearly minutes nevertheless total time moons first last contact shadow much longer could last four hours relative distance moon earth time eclipse affect eclipses duration particular moon near apogee farthest point earth orbit orbital speed slowest diameter umbra decrease appreciably within changes orbital distance moon thus totally eclipsed moon occurring near apogee lengthen duration totality
central lunar eclipse total lunar eclipse moon passes centre earths shadow relatively rare
selenelion
selenelion selenehelion occurs sun eclipsed moon observed time happen sunset sunrise bodies appear horizon nearly opposite points sky arrangement led phenomenon referred horizontal eclipse typically number high ridges undergoing sunrise sunset see although moon earths umbra sun eclipsed moon seen time refraction light earths atmosphere causes appear higher sky true geometric position
timing
timing total lunar eclipses determined contacts
p first contact beginning penumbral eclipse earths penumbra touches moons outer limb
u second contact beginning partial eclipse earths umbra touches moons outer limb
u third contact beginning total eclipse moons surface entirely within earths umbra
greatest eclipse peak stage total eclipse moon closest center earths umbra
u fourth contact end total eclipse moons outer limb exits earths umbra
u fifth contact end partial eclipse earths umbra leaves moons surface
p sixth contact end penumbral eclipse earths penumbra longer makes contact moon
danjon scale
following scale danjon scale devised andr danjon rating overall darkness lunar eclipses
l dark eclipse moon almost invisible especially midtotality
l dark eclipse gray brownish coloration details distinguishable difficulty
l deep red rustcolored eclipse dark central shadow outer edge umbra relatively bright
l brickred eclipse umbral shadow usually bright yellow rim
l bright copperred orange eclipse umbral shadow bluish bright rim
lunar versus solar eclipse
often confusion solar lunar eclipse involve interactions sun earth moon different interactions
lunar eclipse appearance
moon completely disappear passes umbra refraction sunlight earths atmosphere shadow cone earth atmosphere moon would completely dark eclipse reddish coloration arises sunlight reaching moon must pass long dense layer earths atmosphere scattered shorter wavelengths likely scattered air molecules small particles time light passed atmosphere longer wavelengths dominate resulting light perceive red effect causes sunsets sunrises turn sky reddish color alternative way considering problem realize viewed moon sun would appear setting rising behind earth
amount refracted light depends amount dust clouds atmosphere also controls much light scattered general dustier atmosphere wavelengths light removed compared red light leaving resulting light deeper red color causes resulting copperyred hue moon vary one eclipse next volcanoes notable expelling large quantities dust atmosphere large eruption shortly eclipse large effect resulting color
solar eclipse appearance
solar eclipse occurs moon casts shadow earth whilst passing sun earth moons orbit degrees tilted earths orbit around sun solar eclipse rare moon elliptical orbit around earth separation two varies miles moons distance earth low moon appears significantly larger completely obscure sun causing total solar eclipse annular solar eclipse occurs moon furthest earth occasions moon appear smaller fully eclipse sun
march lunar eclipse
christopher columbus came new worldspecifically north coast jamaicahe able use european scientific understanding correctly predict lunar eclipse event known march lunar eclipse occurred columbus wanted seen godlike stated would make moon disappear night february reason columbus wanted prove could make moon disappear crew eating great deal inhabitants food inhabitants refused feed anymore columbus right prediction used astronomical tables local clocks order predict lunar eclipse would happen able convince inhabitants power make moon disappear reappear inhabitants believed columbus truly able make moon disappear begged return moon previous form roughly allotted amount time amount time columbus discerned long eclipse would last columbus agreed return moon moon began reappear next day inhabitants gave columbus crew food desired
lunar eclipse culture
several cultures myths related lunar eclipses allude lunar eclipse good bad omen egyptians saw eclipse sow swallowing moon short time cultures view eclipse moon swallowed animals jaguar mayan tradition three legged toad china societies thought demon swallowing moon could chase away throwing stones curses greeks ahead time said earth round used shadow lunar eclipse evidence hindus believe importance bathing ganges river following eclipse help achieve salvation
incans
similarly mayans incans believed lunar eclipses occurred jaguar would eat moon blood moon looks red incans also believed jaguar finished eating moon could come devour animals earth would take spears shout moon keep away
mesopotamians
ancient mesopotamians believed lunar eclipse moon attacked seven demons attack one moon however mesopotamians linked happened sky happened land king mesopotamia represented land seven demons thought also attacking king order prevent attack king mesopotamians made someone pretend king would attacked instead true king lunar eclipse substitute king made disappear possibly poisoning
chinese
chinese cultures people would ring bells prevent dragon wild animals biting moon nineteenth century lunar eclipse chinese navy fired artillery belief zhou dynasty book songs sight red moon engulfed darkness believed foreshadow famine disease
blood moon
due reddish color totally eclipsed moon sometimes referred blood moon addition media started associate term four full moons lunar tetrad especially tetrad coinciding feasts passover tabernacles lunar tetrad series four consecutive total lunar eclipses spaced six months apart
blood moon scientific term come used due reddish color seen super moon lunar eclipse sunlight passes earths atmosphere filters reflects way green violet lights spectrum scatters strongly red lightthis results moon get red light
occurrence
every year least two lunar eclipses many five although total lunar eclipses significantly less common one knows date time eclipse possible predict occurrence eclipses using eclipse cycle like saros
