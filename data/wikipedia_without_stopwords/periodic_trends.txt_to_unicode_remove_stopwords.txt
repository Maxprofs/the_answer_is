comparing properties chemical elements recurring periodic trends apparent led creation periodic table useful way display elements rationalize behavior laid tabular form many trends properties observed increase decrease one progresses along row column
period trends explained theories atomic structure elements laid order increasing atomic number represents increasing positive charge atomic nucleus negative electrons arranged orbitals around nucleus recurring properties due recurring configurations electrons
periodic trends distributed among different properties namely physical properties chemical properties basis chemical reactivity chemical properties classified basis two ieperiodicity valence oxidation states anomalous properties second period elements going discuss periodic trends respect physical properties
atomic radiusedit
atomic radius distance atomic nucleus outermost stable electron orbital atom equilibrium atomic radii tend decrease across period left right atomic radius usually increases going group due addition new energy level shell however atomic radii tend increase diagonally since number electrons larger effect sizeable nucleus example lithium picometer smaller atomic radius magnesium picometer
atomic radius specified
covalent radius half distance two atoms diatomic compound singly bonded
van der waals radius half distance nuclei atoms different molecules lattice covalent molecules
metallic radius half distance two adjacent nuclei atoms metallic lattice
ionic radius half distance two nuclei
ionization energyedit
ionization potential minimum amount energy required remove one electron atom mole atoms gaseous state first ionization energy energy required remove two ionization energy energy required remove atoms nth electron n electrons removed trendwise ionization energy tends increase one progresses across period greater number protons higher nuclear charge attract orbiting electrons strongly thereby increasing energy required remove one electrons ionization energy ionization potentials completely different potential intensive property measured volt whereas energy extensive property expressed ev kjmole
one progresses group periodic table ionization energy likely decrease since valence electrons farther away nucleus experience weaker attraction nucleuss positive charge increase ionization energy left right given period decrease top bottom rule requires far less energy remove outershell electron innershell electron result ionization energies given element increase steadily within given shell starting next shell show drastic jump ionization energy simply put lower principal quantum number higher ionization energy electrons within shell exceptions elements boron oxygen family require slightly less energy general trend
electron affinityedit
electron affinity atom described either energy gained atom electron added conversely energy required detach electron singly charged anion sign electron affinity quite confusing atoms become stable addition electron considered higher electron affinity show decrease potential energy ie energy gained atom appears negative atoms become less stable upon gaining electron potential energy increases implies atom gains energy case atoms electron affinity value positive consequently atoms negative electron affinity value considered higher electron affinity receptive gaining electrons vice versa however reverse scenario electron affinity defined energy required detach electron anion energy value obtained magnitude opposite sign atoms high electron affinity less inclined give electron take energy remove electron atom case atom positive energy value higher electron affinity one progresses left right across period electron affinity increase
although may seem fluorine greatest electron affinity small size fluorine generates enough repulsion chlorine greatest electron affinity
electronegativityedit
electronegativity measure ability atom molecule attract pairs electrons context chemical bond type bond formed largely determined difference electronegativity atoms involved using pauling scale trendwise one moves left right across period periodic table electronegativity increases due stronger attraction atoms obtain nuclear charge increases moving group electronegativity decreases due longer distance nucleus valence electron shell thereby decreasing attraction making atom less attraction electrons protons
however group elements electronegativity decreases aluminium thallium group electronegativity lead lower tin
valence electronsedit
valence electrons electrons outermost electron shell isolated atom element sometimes also regarded basis modern periodic table period number valence electrons increases mostly light metalelements move left right side however group periodic trend constant number valence electrons remains
however periodic trend sparsely followed heavier elements elements atomic number greater especially lanthanide actinide series
also important consider core electrons speaking valence electrons
summaryedit
moving left right
atomic radius decreases
ionization energy increases
electronegativity increases
moving top bottom
atomic radius increases
ionization energy decreases
electronegativity decreases
metallic propertiesedit
metallic properties increase groups decreasing attraction nuclei outermost electrons causes outermost electrons loosely bound thus able conduct heat electricity across period increasing attraction nuclei outermost electrons causes metallic character decrease
nonmetallic propertiesedit
nonmetallic property increases across period decreases group due reason
