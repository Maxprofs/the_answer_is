preparationedit
special conditions need met order generate supersaturated solution one easiest ways relies temperature dependence solubility general rule heat added system soluble substance becomes exceptions opposite true therefore high temperatures solute dissolved room temperature solution suddenly cooled rate faster rate precipitation solution become supersaturated solute precipitates temperaturedetermined saturation point precipitation crystallization solute takes longer actual cooling time molecules need meet form precipitate without knocked apart water thus larger molecule longer take crystallize due principles brownian motion
