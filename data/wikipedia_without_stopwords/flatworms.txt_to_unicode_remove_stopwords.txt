distinguishing features
platyhelminthes bilaterally symmetrical animals left right sides mirror images also implies distinct top bottom surfaces distinct head tail ends like bilaterians three main cell layers endoderm mesoderm ectoderm radially symmetrical cnidarians ctenophores comb jellies two cell layers beyond defined particular series specializations unlike bilaterians platyhelminthes internal body cavity described acoelomates also lack specialized circulatory respiratory facts defining features classifying flatworms organs bodies soft unsegmented
features common subgroups
lack circulatory respiratory organs limits platyhelminths sizes shapes enable oxygen reach carbon dioxide leave parts bodies simple diffusion hence many microscopic large species flat ribbonlike leaflike shapes guts large species many branches nutrients diffuse parts body respiration whole surface body makes vulnerable fluid loss restricts environments dehydration unlikely sea freshwater moist terrestrial environments leaf litter grains soil parasites within animals
space skin gut filled mesenchyme connective tissue made cells reinforced collagen fibers act type skeleton providing attachment points muscles mesenchyme contains internal organs allows passage oxygen nutrients waste products consists two main types cell fixed cells fluidfilled vacuoles stem cells transform type cell used regenerating tissues injury asexual reproduction
platyhelminths anus regurgitate undigested material mouth however long species anus complex branched guts one anus since excretion mouth would difficult gut lined single layer endodermal cells absorb digest food species break soften food first secreting enzymes gut pharynx throat
animals need keep concentration dissolved substances body fluids fairly constant level internal parasites freeliving marine animals live environments high concentrations dissolved material generally let tissues level concentration environment freshwater animals need prevent body fluids becoming dilute despite difference environments platyhelminths use system control concentration body fluids flame cells called beating flagella looks like flickering candle flame extract mesenchyme water contains wastes reusable material drive networks tube cells lined flagella microvilli tube cells flagella drive water towards exits called nephridiopores microvilli reabsorb reusable materials much water needed keep body fluids right concentration combinations flame cells tube cells called protonephredia
platyhelminths nervous system concentrated head end least marked acoels nerve nets rather like cnidarians ctenophores densest around head platyhelminths rings ganglia head main nerve trunks running along bodies
major subgroups
early classification divided flatworms four groups turbellaria trematoda monogenea cestoda classification long recognized artificial ehlers proposed phylogenetically correct classification massively polyphyletic turbellaria split dozen orders trematoda monogenea cestoda joined new order neodermata however classification presented early traditional classification still one used everywhere except scientific articles
turbellaria
species mostly freeliving range mm mm length predators scavengers terrestrial species mostly nocturnal live shaded humid locations leaf litter rotting wood however symbiotes animals crustaceans parasites freeliving turbellarians mostly black brown gray larger ones brightly colored acoela nemertodermatida traditionally regarded turbellarians regarded members separate phylum acoelomorpha two separate phyla xenoturbella genus simple animals also reclassified separate phylum
turbellarians cuticle external layer organic noncellular material species skin syncitium collection cells multiple nuclei single shared external membrane however skins species consist single layer cells generally multiple cilia small mobile hairs although large species upper surface cilia skins also covered microvilli cilia many glands usually submerged muscle layers skin connect surface pores secrete mucus adhesives substances
small aquatic species use cilia locomotion larger ones use muscular movements whole body specialized sole creep swim capable burrowing anchoring rear ends bottom burrow stretching head feed pulling back safety terrestrial species throw thread mucus use rope climb one leaf another
acoel convoluta roscoffensis swallows cells green alga tetraselmis feed adult presumably relying algae provide nourishment endosymbionts acoels gut lined syncitium turbellarians simple pharynx lined cilia generally feed using cilia sweep food particles small prey mouths usually middle undersides turbellarians pharynx eversible extended turned insideout mouths different species anywhere along underside freshwater species microstomum caudatum open mouth almost wide body long swallow prey large
turbellarians pigmentcup ocelli little eyes one pair species two even three pairs large species many eyes clusters brain mounted tentacles spaced uniformly around edge body ocelli distinguish direction light coming enable animals avoid groups mainly catenulids acoelomorphs related statocysts fluidfilled chambers containing small solid particle groups two statocysts thought balance acceleration sensors function perform cnidarian medusae ctenophores however turbellarian statocysts sensory cilia sense movements positions solid particles unknown hand ciliated touchsensor cells scattered bodies especially tentacles around edges specialized cells pits grooves head probably smell sensors
planarians subgroup seriates famous ability regenerate divided cuts across bodies experiments show fragments already head new head grows quickly closest original head suggests growth head controlled chemical whose concentration diminishes head tail many turbellarians clone transverse longitudinal division others especially acoels reproduce budding
vast majority turbellarians hermaphrodites female male reproductive cells fertilize eggs internally copulation larger aquatic species mate penis fencing duel tries impregnate loser adopts female role developing eggs species miniature adults emerge eggs hatch large species produce planktonlike larvae
trematoda
parasites name refers cavities holdfasts greek hole resemble suckers anchor within hosts skin species syncitium layer cells shares single external membrane trematodes divided two groups digenea aspidogastrea also known aspodibothrea
digenea
often called flukes flat rhomboid shapes like flounder old english flc species platyhelminthes combined second roundworms among parasites metazoans adults usually two holdfasts ring around mouth larger sucker midway along would underside freeliving flatworm although name digeneans means two generations complex life cycles seven stages depending combinations environments early stages encounter importantly whether eggs deposited land water intermediate stages transfer parasites one host another definitive host adults develop land vertebrate earliest host juvenile stages usually snail may live land water many cases fish arthropod second host example adjoining illustration shows life cycle intestinal fluke metagonimus hatches intestine snail moves fish penetrates body encysts flesh moves small intestine land animal eats fish raw generates eggs excreted ingested snails thereby completing cycle schistosomes cause devastating tropical disease bilharzia belong group
adults range mm mm length individual adult digeneans single sex species slender females live enclosed grooves run along bodies males partially emerge lay eggs species adults complex reproductive systems produce times many eggs freeliving flatworm addition intermediate stages live snails reproduce asexually
adults different species infest different parts definitive host example intestine lungs large blood vessels liver adults use relatively large muscular pharynx ingest cells cell fragments mucus body fluids blood adults stages live snails external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients host adult digeneans live without oxygen long periods
aspidogastrea
members small group either single divided sucker row suckers cover underside infest guts bony cartilaginous fish turtles body cavities marine freshwater bivalves gastropods eggs produce ciliated swimming larvae life cycle one two hosts
cercomeromorpha
parasites attach hosts means disks bear crescentshaped hooks divided monogenea cestoda
monogenea
species monogeneans external parasites require particular host species mainly fish cases amphibians aquatic reptiles however internal parasites adult monogeneans large attachment organs rear haptors greek haptein means catch suckers clamps hooks often flattened bodies species pharynx secretes enzymes digest hosts skin allowing parasite feed blood cellular debris others graze externally mucus flakes hosts skins name monogenea based fact parasites one nonlarval generation
cestoda
often called tapeworms flat slender long bodies name cestode derived latin word cestus means tape adults cestode species internal parasites cestodes mouths guts syncitial skin absorbs nutrients mainly carbohydrates amino acids host also disguises chemically avoid attacks hosts immune system shortage carbohydrates hosts diet stunts growth parasites kills metabolisms generally use simple inefficient chemical processes compensate consuming large amounts food relative size
majority species known eucestodes true tapeworms neck produces chain segments called proglottids process known strobilation hence mature proglottids furthest scolex adults taenia saginata infests humans form proglottid chains metres ft long although metres ft typical proglottid male female reproductive organs hosts gut contains two adults cestode species generally fertilize proglottids worm fertilize even fertilize eggs fully developed proglottids separate excreted host eucestode life cycle less complex digeneans varies depending species example
adults diphyllobothrium infest fish juveniles use copepod crustaceans intermediate hosts excreted proglottids release eggs water eggs hatch ciliated swimming larvae larva swallowed copepod sheds cilia skin becomes syncitium larva makes way copepods hemocoel internal cavity main part circulatory system attached three small hooks copepod eaten fish larva metamorphoses small unsegmented tapeworm drills gut becomes adult
various species taenia infest guts humans cats dogs juveniles use herbivores example pigs cattle rabbits intermediate hosts excreted proglottids release eggs stick grass leaves hatch swallowed herbivore larva makes way herbivores muscles metamorphoses oval worm millimetres long scolex kept inside definitive host eats infested raw undercooked meat intermediate host worms scolex pops attaches gut adult tapeworm develops
members smaller group known cestodaria scolex produce proglottids body shapes like diageneans cestodarians parasitize fish turtles
classification evolutionary relationships

traditional view platyhelminthes formed sister group bilaterians include example arthropods molluscs annelids chordates since molecular phylogenetics aims work evolutionary family trees comparing different organisms biochemicals dna rna proteins radically changed scientists view evolutionary relationships animals detailed morphological analyses anatomical features mids molecular phylogenetics analyses since using different sections dna agree acoelomorpha consisting acoela traditionally regarded simple turbellarians nemertodermatida another small group previously classified turbellarians sister group bilaterians including rest platyhelminthes however study concluded acoela nemertodermatida two distinct groups bilaterians although agreed closely related cnidarians jellyfish etc bilaterians
xenoturbella bilaterian whose welldefined organ statocyst originally classified primitive turbellarian however recently reclassified deuterostome
platyhelminthes excluding acoelomorpha contain two main groups catenulida rhabditophora generally agreed monophyletic contains descendants ancestor member group early molecular phylogenetics analyses catenulida rhabditophora left uncertainties whether could combined single monophyletic group study concluded could therefore platyhelminthes could redefined catenulida plus rhabditophora excluding acoelomorpha
molecular phylogenetics analyses agree redefined platyhelminthes closely related gastrotricha part grouping known platyzoa platyzoa generally agreed least closely related lophotrochozoa superphylum includes molluscs annelid worms majority view platyzoa part lophotrochozoa significant minority researchers regard platyzoa sister group lophotrochozoa
agreed since wholly parasitic platyhelminth groups cestoda monogenea trematoda monophyletic together form larger monophyletic grouping neodermata adults members syncitial skins however debate whether cestoda monogenea combined intermediate monophyletic group cercomeromorpha within neodermata generally agreed neodermata subgroup levels family tree rhabditophora hence traditional subphylum turbellaria paraphyletic since include neodermata although descendants subgroup turbellarians
