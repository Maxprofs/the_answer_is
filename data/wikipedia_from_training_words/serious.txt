== history ==
time magazine was created in 1923 by briton hadden and henry luce making it the first weekly news magazine in the united states the two had previously worked together as chairman and managing editor respectively of the yale daily news they first called the proposed magazine facts they wanted to emphasize brevity so that a busy man could read it in an hour they changed the name to time and used the slogan take timeit's brief hadden was considered carefree and liked to tease luce and saw time as important but also fun which accounted for its heavy coverage of celebrities (including politicians) the entertainment industry and pop culturecriticized as too light for serious news
it set out to tell the news through people and for many decades the magazine's cover depicted a single person the first issue of time was published on march 3 1923 featuring joseph g cannon the retired speaker of the house of representatives on its cover a facsimile reprint of issue no 1 including all of the articles and advertisements contained in the original was included with copies of the february 28 1938 issue as a commemoration of the magazine's 15th anniversary the cover price was 15 (equivalent to $2.08 today) on hadden's death in 1929 luce became the dominant man at time and a major figure in the history of 20th-century media according to time inc. the intimate history of a publishing enterprise 19722004 by robert elson roy edward larsen [...] was to play a role second only to luce's in the development of time inc in his book the march of time 19351951 raymond fielding also noted that larsen was originally circulation manager and then general manager of time later publisher of life for many years president of time inc. and in the long history of the corporation the most influential and important figure after luce
around the time they were raising $100,000 from wealthy yale alumni like henry p davison partner of j.p morgan & co. publicity man martin egan and j.p morgan & co banker dwight morrow henry luce and briton hadden hired larsen in 1922 although larsen was a harvard graduate and luce and hadden were yale graduates after hadden died in 1929 larsen purchased 550 shares of time inc. using money he obtained from selling rko stock which he had inherited from his father who was the head of the benjamin franklin keith theatre chain in new england however after briton hadden's death the largest time stockholder was henry luce who ruled the media conglomerate in an autocratic fashion at his right hand was larsen time's second-largest stockholder according to time inc. the intimate history of a publishing enterprise 19231941 in 1929 roy larsen was also named a time inc director and vice-president j p morgan retained a certain control through two directorates and a share of stocks both over time and fortune other shareholders were brown brothers w a harriman & co. and the new york trust company (standard oil)
by the time henry luce died in 1967 the time inc stock which luce owned was worth about $109 million and yielded him a yearly dividend income of more than $2.4 million according to curtis prendergast's the world of time inc the intimate history of a changing enterprise 19571983 the value of the larsen family's time stock was now worth about $80 million during the 1960s and roy larsen was both a time inc director and the chairman of its executive committee before serving as time's vice-chairman of the board until the middle of 1979 according to the september 10 1979 issue of the new york times mr larsen was the only employee in the company's history given an exemption from its policy of mandatory retirement at age 65
after time magazine began publishing its weekly issues in march 1923 roy larsen was able to increase its circulation by utilizing u.s radio and movie theaters around the world it often promoted both time magazine and u.s political and corporate interests according to the march of time as early as 1924 larsen had brought time into the infant radio business with the broadcast of a 15-minute sustaining quiz show entitled pop question which survived until 1925 then in 1928 larsen undertook the weekly broadcast of a 10-minute programme series of brief news summaries drawn from current issues of time magazine [...] which was originally broadcast over 33 stations throughout the united states
larsen next arranged for a 30-minute radio program the march of time to be broadcast over cbs beginning on march 6 1931 each week the program presented a dramatisation of the week's news for its listeners thus time magazine itself was brought to the attention of millions previously unaware of its existence according to time inc. the intimate history of a publishing enterprise 19231941 leading to an increased circulation of the magazine during the 1930s between 1931 and 1937 larsen's the march of time radio program was broadcast over cbs radio and between 1937 and 1945 it was broadcast over nbc radio except for the 1939 to 1941 period when it was not aired people magazine was based on time's people page
