common era or current era abbreviated ce is a calendar era that is often used as an alternative naming of the anno domini system ("in the year of the lord") abbreviated ad the system uses bce as an abbreviation for before the common (or current) era and ce as an abbreviation for common era the ce/bce designation uses the year-numbering system introduced by the 6th-century christian monk dionysius exiguus who started the anno domini designation intending the beginning of the life of jesus to be the reference date neither notation includes a year zero and the two notations (ce/bce and ad/bc) are numerically equivalent thus 2015 ce corresponds to ad 2015 and 400 bce corresponds to 400 bc
the expression common era can be found as early as 1708 in english and traced back to latin usage among european christians to 1615 as vulgaris aerae and to 1635 in english as vulgar era at those times the expressions were all used interchangeably with christian era the gregorian calendar and the year-numbering system associated with it is the calendar system with most widespread use in the world today for decades it has been the global standard recognized by international institutions such as the united nations and the universal postal union
use of the ce abbreviation was introduced by jewish academics in the mid-19th century since the later 20th century use of ce and bce has been popularized in academic and scientific publications and more generally by authors and publishers wishing to emphasize secularism and/or sensitivity to non-christians because it does not explicitly make use of religious titles for jesus such as christ and dominus ("lord") which are used in the bc/ad notation nor does it give implicit expression to the christian creed that jesus was the christ
== history ==
=== origins ===
the year numbering system used with common era notation was devised by the christian monk dionysius exiguus in the year 525 to replace the era of martyrs system because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted christians he attempted to number years from an event he referred to as the incarnation of jesus
dionysius labeled the column of the easter table in which he introduced the new era anni domini nostri jesu christi
numbering years in this manner became more widespread with its usage by bede in england in 731 bede also introduced the practice of dating years before the supposed year of birth of jesus and the practice of not using a year zero in 1422 portugal became the last western european country to switch to the system begun by dionysius
=== use of the term vulgar era ===
the term common era is traced back in english to its appearance as vulgar era to distinguish it from the regnal dating systems typically used in national law
the first use of the latin equivalent (vulgaris aerae) discovered so far was in a 1615 book by johannes kepler kepler uses it again in a 1616 table of ephemerides and again in 1617 a 1635 english edition of that book has the title page in english so far the earliest-found usage of vulgar era in english a 1701 book edited by john leclerc includes before christ according to the vulgar ra 6 a 1716 book in english by dean humphrey prideaux says before the beginning of the vulgar ra by which we now compute the years from his incarnation. a 1796 book uses the term vulgar era of the nativity
the first so-far-discovered usage of christian era is as the latin phrase aerae christianae on the title page of a 1584 theology book in 1649 the latin phrase r christian appeared in the title of an english almanac a 1652 ephemeris is the first instance so-far-found for english usage of christian era
the english phrase common era appears at least as early as 1708 and in a 1715 book on astronomy is used interchangeably with christian era and vulgar era a 1759 history book uses common ra in a generic sense to refer to the common era of the jews the first-so-far found usage of the phrase before the common era is in a 1770 work that also uses common era and vulgar era as synonyms in a translation of a book originally written in german the 1797 edition of the encyclopdia britannica uses the terms vulgar era and common era synonymously in 1835 in his book living oracles alexander campbell wrote the vulgar era or anno domini the fourth year of jesus christ the first of which was but eight days and also refers to the common era as a synonym for vulgar era with the fact that our lord was born on the 4th year before the vulgar era called anno domini thus making (for example) the 42d year from his birth to correspond with the 38th of the common era... the catholic encyclopedia (1909) used the terms christian vulgar or common era interchangeably
the phrase common era in lower case also appeared in the 19th century in a generic sense not necessarily to refer to the christian era but to any system of dates in common use throughout a civilization thus the common era of the jews the common era of the mahometans common era of the world the common era of the foundation of rome when it did refer to the christian era it was sometimes qualified e.g. common era of the incarnation common era of the nativity or common era of the birth of christ
an adapted translation of common era into pseudo-latin as era vulgaris (in latin this means common mistress) was adopted in the 20th century by some followers of aleister crowley and thus the abbreviation e.v. or ev may sometimes be seen as a replacement for ad
=== history of the use of the ce/bce abbreviation ===
although jews have their own hebrew calendar they often use the gregorian calendar
as early as 1825 the abbreviation ve (for vulgar era) was in use among jews to denote years in the western calendar
common era notation has also been in use for hebrew lessons for more than a century some jewish academics were already using the ce and bce abbreviations by the mid-19th century such as in 1856 when rabbi and historian morris jacob raphall used the abbreviation in his book post-biblical history of the jews
the ratio of usage of bce to bc ce to ad common era to anno domini and before common era to before christ in books has changed dramatically between the years 1800 and 2008 particularly since 1980 with the ce-related variants increasing in usage
== contemporary usage ==
some academics in the fields of theology education and history have adopted ce and bce notation although there is some disagreement
more visible uses of common era notation have recently surfaced at major museums in the english-speaking world the smithsonian institution prefers common era usage though individual museums are not required to use it furthermore several style guides now prefer or mandate its usage even some style guides for christian churches prefer its use for example the episcopal diocese maryland church news
in the united states the usage of the bce/ce notation in textbooks is growing some publications have moved over to using it exclusively for example the 2007 world almanac was the first edition to switch over to the bce/ce usage ending a 138-year usage of the traditional bc/ad dating notation it is used by the college board in its history tests and by the norton anthology of english literature others have taken a different approach the us-based history channel uses bce/ce notation in articles on non-christian religious topics such as jerusalem and judaism
in 2002 england and wales introduced the bce/ce notation system into the official school curriculum
in june 2006 in the united states the kentucky state school board reversed its decision that would have included the designations bce and ce as part of state law leaving education of students about these concepts a matter of discretion at the local level
also in 2011 media reports suggested that the bc/ad notation in australian school textbooks would be replaced by bce/ce notation the story became national news and drew opposition from some politicians and church leaders weeks after the story broke the australian curriculum assessment and reporting authority denied the rumour and stated that the bc/ad notation would remain with ce and bce as an optional suggested learning activity
== rationale ==
=== support ===
the use of ce in jewish scholarship was historically motivated by the desire to avoid the implicit our lord in the abbreviation ad although other aspects of dating systems are based in christian origins ad is a direct reference to jesus as lord
proponents of the common era notation assert that the use of bce/ce shows sensitivity to those who use the same year numbering system as the one that originated with and is currently used by christians but who are not themselves christian
in the 19th century an anarchist journal lucifer the lightbearer published in chicago illinois (1883-1907) used the term common era to mark the year of publication
former united nations secretary-general kofi annan himself a protestant has argued
[t]he christian calendar no longer belongs exclusively to christians people of all faiths have taken to using it simply as a matter of convenience there is so much interaction between people of different faiths and cultures different civilizations if you like that some shared way of reckoning time is a necessity and so the christian era has become the common era.
the label anno domini as such is arguably inaccurate
scholars generally believe that christ was born some years before a.d 1 the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating.
=== opposition ===
some oppose the common era notation for explicitly religious reasons because the bc/ad notation is based on the traditional year of the supposed conception or birth of jesus removing reference to him in era notation is offensive to some christians
the southern baptist convention supports retaining the bc/ad abbreviations as a reminder of the preeminence of christ and his gospel in world history the convention has criticized the use of bce and ce as being the result of secularization anti-supernaturalism religious pluralism and political correctness and encourages its members to retain the traditional method of dating and avoid this revisionism
there are also secular concerns english language expert kenneth g wilson speculated in his style guide that if we do end by casting aside the a.d./b.c convention almost certainly some will argue that we ought to cast aside as well the conventional numbering system [that is the method of numbering years] itself given its christian basis. the short lived french revolutionary calendar for example began with the first year of the first french republic and rejected the seven-day week (with its connections to the book of genesis) for a ten-day week
astrobiologist duncan steel argues further that if one is going to replace bc/ad with bce/ce then one should reject all aspects of the dating system (including time of day days of the week and months of the year) as they all have origins related to pagan astrological jewish or christian beliefs he rejects secular arguments against christian-based bc/ad as selective steel makes note of the consistency of the quaker system (now rarely used) which removed all such references
anthropologist carol delaney argues that the substitution of bce/ce for bc/ad is merely a euphemism that conceals the political implications without modifying the actual source of contention
priest and writer on interfaith issues raimon panikkar contends that using the designation bce/ce is a return to the most bigoted christian colonialism towards non-christians who do not necessarily consider the time period following the beginning of the calendar to be a common era
some critics assert that the use of identifiers which have common spellings is more ambiguous than the use of identifiers with divergent spellings both ce and bce have in common the letters ce which is more likely to cause confusion they claim than identifiers with clearly different spelling
according to a los angeles times report it was a student's use of bce/ce notation inspired by its use within wikipedia which prompted the history teacher andrew schlafly to found conservapedia a cultural conservative wiki one of its conservapedia commandments is that users must always apply bc/ad notation since its sponsors perceive bce/ce notation to deny the historical basis of the dating system
== conventions in style guides ==
the abbreviation bce just as with bc always follows the year number unlike ad which traditionally precedes the year number ce always follows the year number (if context requires that it be written at all) thus the current year is written as 2015 in both notations (or if further clarity is needed as 2015 ce or as ad 2015) and the year that socrates died is represented as 399 bce (the same year that is represented by 399 bc in the bc/ad notation) the abbreviations are sometimes written with small capital letters or with periods (e.g. bce or c.e.") style guides for academic texts on religion generally prefer bce/ce to bc/ad
the terms common era anno domini before the common era and before christ in contemporary english can be applied to dates that rely on either the julian calendar or the gregorian calendar modern dates are understood in the western world to be in the gregorian calendar but for older dates writers can specify the calendar used dates in the gregorian calendar in the western world have always used the era designated in english as anno domini or common era
== similar conventions in other languages ==
several languages other than english also have both religious and non-religious ways of identifying the era used in dates in some communist states during the cold war period usage of non-religious notation was mandated
in angola the abbreviations e.c. ("era comum common era) and a.e.c. ("antes da era comum before common era) is generally used
in arabic (after the birth) corresponds to ce while (before the birth) corresponds to bce the birth referenced is that of jesus this system is in widespread use in all arab countries but is accompanied by the hijri system dates are often given in both in that order in saudi arabia however the hijri system is predominant
in the chinese language common era ( gong yuan) has been predominantly used to refer to the western calendar without any religious connotation
in danish the terms f.kr (fr kristus before christ) and e.kr (efter kristus after christ) have traditionally been used they are now in free variation with f.v.t and e.v.t (fr/efter vor tidsregning before/after our chronology)
in dutch the terms v.chr (voor christus before christ) and n.chr (na christus after christ) have traditionally been used there are alternatives v.g.j and g.j ([vr] gangbare/gewone jaartelling [before] conventional/ordinary chronology) v.o.j and n.o.j (vr/na onze jaartelling before/after our chronology) and v.d.g.j and n.d.g.j (vr/na de gewone jaartelling before/after the ordinary chronology) but there is still no generally accepted alternative for the christian notation the notation v.chr./n.chr remains generally used by the media and scientists
in finland the terms ekr (ennen kristusta before christ) and jkr (jlkeen kristuksen after christ) were largely used until the 1980s but have been mostly replaced during the last couple of decades with terms eaa (ennen ajanlaskun alkua before start of chronology) and jaa (jlkeen ajanlaskun alun after start of chronology)
in germany enlightened jews in berlin seem to have already been using (before the) common era in the 18th century while others like moses mendelssohn opposed this usage as it would hinder the integration of jews into german society the formulation seems to have persisted among german jews in the 19th century in forms like vor der gewhnlichen zeitrechnung (before the common chronology)
in 1938 nazi germany the use of this convention was also prescribed by the national socialist teachers league
however it was soon discovered that many german jews had been using the convention ever since the 18th century and they found it ironic to see aryans following jewish example nearly 200 years later
the german democratic republic (1949-1990) introduced the convention of v u z (vor unserer zeitrechnung before our chronology) and u z (unserer zeitrechnung of our chronology) instead of v chr (vor christus before christ) and n chr (nach christus/christi geburt after christ/the nativity of christ) the use of these terms persists in contemporary german to some extent differing regionally and ideologically in jewish contexts mostly v d z. ("vor der zeitenwende") and n d z. ("nach der zeitenwende") is used
in hebrew the most common term used to refer to bce/ce is simply (according to the count) for ce and (before the count) for bce an alternative term expressing an ideological (sometimes religious) approach aimed at distancing oneself from the source of the count is (according to their count) the later is sometimes added after the former especially in the case of bce (e.g. 150 ) due to technical linguistic reasons
in hungary similarly to the bulgarian case i e (idszmtsunk eltt before our era) and i sz (idszmtsunk szerint according to our era) are still widely used instead of traditional kr e (krisztus eltt before christ) and kr u (krisztus utn after christ) which were unofficially reinstituted after the communist period
in indonesia the terms sm (sebelum masehi before masehi from arabic word of masih referred to jesus) and m (masehi after masehi) were generally used
in italy e.v. ("era volgare from latin expression aera vulgaris") and p.e.v ("prima dell'era volgare before vulgar era) may be used (both in small fonts) but the historical a.c./d.c (avanti cristo/dopo cristo before christ/after christ) are much more frequent
in japanese years reckoned by the western calendar as opposed to the japanese imperial eras are indicated by for example 2013 where (seireki) literally means western calendar which carries no religious connotation aside from the fact that christianity is a western religion (kigenzen) is used to mean before the common era (bce). a.d. and less commonly c.e. are also occasionally seen but the typical japanese person would not care about the religious connotations
in korean ( giwonjeon) which means preceding the [western] era is used to indicate years bce ( seogi) western era short for ( seoryeokgiwon) meaning [from] the origin year of the western calendar is used to indicate years ce christians use (juhu) meaning after [the birth of] the lord as a shorthand calque of anno domini
in poland the only term generally used is naszej ery/przed nasz er (of our era/before our era) the terms przed chrystusem/po chrystusie (before christ/after christ) and roku paskiego (year of the lord) are possible but almost never used in contemporary poland
in romania throughout most of the communist period the preferred standard was to use the secularised  e n (naintea erei noastre before our era) and e n (era noastr our era) after the downfall of communism in the romanian revolution the original convention using  hr (nainte de hristos before christ) and d hr (dup hristos after christ) has become more widespread alternatively  cr and d cr are used mainly due to an alternative spelling of hristos (christ) as cristos the latter being preferred by the roman catholic and protestant churches
in russia the terms  (  before our era) and  (  our era) are often used their use was nearly universal during the soviet rule and while their use in mass media has to some extent been replaced by their christian equivalents the bce/ce terms remain the strongly preferred version in scientific literature business magazines and other serious texts
