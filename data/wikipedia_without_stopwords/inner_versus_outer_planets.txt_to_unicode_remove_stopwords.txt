formationedit
shortly discovering pallas olbers suggested herschel ceres pallas fragments much larger planet occupied marsjupiter region planet suffered internal explosion cometary impact many million years time however hypothesis fallen favor large amount energy required destroy planet combined belts low combined mass mass moon support hypothesis significant chemical differences asteroids become difficult explain come planet today scientists accept rather fragmenting progenitor planet asteroids never formed planet

evolutionedit
asteroids samples primordial solar system undergone considerable evolution since formation including internal heating first tens millions years surface melting impacts space weathering radiation bombardment micrometeorites although scientists refer asteroids residual planetesimals scientists consider distinct

total mass asteroid belt estimated kilograms mass moon four largest objects ceres vesta pallas hygiea account half belts total mass almost onethird accounted ceres alone
compositionedit
current belt consists primarily three categories asteroids ctype carbonaceous asteroids stype silicate asteroids mtype metallic asteroids
carbonaceous asteroids name suggests carbonrich dominate belts outer regions together comprise visible asteroids red hue asteroids low albedo surface composition similar carbonaceous chondrite meteorites chemically spectra match primordial composition early solar system lighter elements volatiles removed
stype silicaterich asteroids common toward inner region belt within au sun spectra surfaces reveal presence silicates metal significant carbonaceous compounds indicates materials significantly modified primordial composition probably melting reformation relatively high albedo form total asteroid population
mtype metalrich asteroids form total population spectra resemble ironnickel believed formed metallic cores differentiated progenitor bodies disrupted collision however also silicate compounds produce similar appearance example large mtype asteroid kalliope appear primarily composed metal within asteroid belt number distribution mtype asteroids peaks semimajor axis au yet clear whether mtypes compositionally similar whether label several varieties fit neatly main c classes

temperature asteroid belt varies distance sun dust particles within belt typical temperatures range k c au k c au however due rotation surface temperature asteroid vary considerably sides alternately exposed solar radiation stellar background
mainbelt cometsedit
several otherwise unremarkable bodies outer belt show cometary activity orbits cannot explained capture classical comets thought many outer asteroids may icy ice occasionally exposed sublimation small impacts mainbelt comets may major source earths oceans deuteriumhydrogen ratio low classical comets principal source
orbitsedit
asteroids within asteroid belt orbital eccentricities less inclination less orbital distribution asteroids reaches maximum eccentricity around inclination thus although typical asteroid relatively circular orbit lies near plane ecliptic asteroid orbits highly eccentric travel well outside ecliptic plane
sometimes term main belt used refer compact core region greatest concentration bodies found lies strong kirkwood gaps au orbital eccentricities less roughly along orbital inclinations core region contains approximately numbered minor planets within solar system
kirkwood gapsedit
semimajor axis asteroid used describe dimensions orbit around sun value determines minor planets orbital period daniel kirkwood announced discovery gaps distances bodies orbits sun located positions period revolution sun integer fraction jupiters orbital period kirkwood proposed gravitational perturbations planet led removal asteroids orbits
mean orbital period asteroid integer fraction orbital period jupiter meanmotion resonance gas giant created sufficient perturb asteroid new orbital elements asteroids become located gap orbits either primordially migration jupiters orbit due prior perturbations collisions gradually nudged different random orbits larger smaller semimajor axis
gaps seen simple snapshot locations asteroids one time asteroid orbits elliptical many asteroids still cross radii corresponding gaps actual spatial density asteroids gaps differ significantly neighboring regions
main gaps occur meanmotion resonances jupiter asteroid kirkwood gap would orbit sun three times jovian orbit instance weaker resonances occur semimajor axis values fewer asteroids found nearby example resonance asteroids semimajor axis au
main core population asteroid belt sometimes divided three zones based prominent kirkwood gaps zone lies resonance au resonance au kirkwood gaps zone ii continues end zone resonance gap au zone iii extends outer edge zone ii resonance gap au
asteroid belt may also divided inner outer belts inner belt formed asteroids orbiting nearer mars kirkwood gap au outer belt formed asteroids closer jupiters orbit authors subdivide inner outer belts resonance gap au whereas others suggest inner middle outer belts
collisionsedit
high population asteroid belt makes active environment collisions asteroids occur frequently astronomical time scales collisions mainbelt bodies mean radius km expected occur every million years collision may fragment asteroid numerous smaller pieces leading formation new asteroid family conversely collisions occur low relative speeds may also join two asteroids billion years processes members asteroid belt bear little resemblance original population
along asteroid bodies asteroid belt also contains bands dust particle radii hundred micrometres fine material produced least part collisions asteroids impact micrometeorites upon asteroids due poyntingrobertson effect pressure solar radiation causes dust slowly spiral inward toward sun
combination fine asteroid dust well ejected cometary material produces zodiacal light faint auroral glow viewed night extending direction sun along plane ecliptic asteroid particles produce visible zodiacal light average m radius typical lifetimes mainbelt zodiacal cloud particles years thus maintain bands dust new particles must steadily produced within asteroid belt thought collisions asteroids form major component zodiacal light however computer simulations nesvorn colleagues attributed percent zodiacallight dust fragmentations jupiterfamily comets rather comets collisions asteroids asteroid belt percent dust attributed asteroid belt

families groupsedit
japanese astronomer kiyotsugu hirayama noticed orbits asteroids similar parameters forming families groups
approximately onethird asteroids asteroid belt members asteroid family share similar orbital elements semimajor axis eccentricity orbital inclination well similar spectral features indicate common origin breakup larger body graphical displays elements members asteroid belt show concentrations indicating presence asteroid family associations almost certainly asteroid families additional groupings found less certain asteroid families confirmed members display common spectral features smaller associations asteroids called groups clusters
prominent families asteroid belt order increasing semimajor axes flora eunoma koronis eos themis families flora family one largest known members may formed collision less billion years ago largest asteroid true member family opposed interloper case ceres gefion family vesta vesta family believed formed result craterforming impact vesta likewise hed meteorites may also originated vesta result collision
three prominent bands dust found within asteroid belt similar orbital inclinations eos koronis themis asteroid families possibly associated groupings

new familiesedit
asteroid families formed recently astronomical terms karin cluster apparently formed million years ago collision progenitor asteroid km radius veritas family formed million years ago evidence includes interplanetary dust recovered ocean sediment
recently datura cluster appears formed thousand years ago collision mainbelt asteroid age estimate based probability members current orbits rather physical evidence however cluster may source zodiacal dust material recent cluster formations iannini cluster circa million years ago may provided additional sources asteroid dust
