aircraft flight
commercial airliners typically cruise altitudes km ft temperate latitudes lower reaches stratosphere optimizes fuel burn mostly due low temperatures encountered near tropopause low air density reducing parasitic drag airframe stated another way allows airliner fly faster amount drag also allows stay hard weather extreme turbulence
