hotspot released as the java hotspot performance engine is a java virtual machine for desktops and servers maintained and distributed by oracle corporation it features techniques such as just-in-time compilation and adaptive optimization designed to improve performance
== history ==
the java hotspot performance engine first released april 27 1999 built on technologies from the strongtalk implementation of the smalltalk programming language originally developed by longview technologies which traded as animorphic animorphic's virtual-machine technology had earlier been successfully used in a sun research project the self programming language in 1997 sun microsystems purchased animorphic
shortly after acquiring animorphic sun intended to write a new just-in-time (jit) compiler for the newly developed virtual machine this new compiler would give rise to the name hotspot which derives from the fact that as the software runs java bytecode it continually analyzes the program's performance for hot spots which are frequently or repeatedly executed these are then targeted for optimization leading to high-performance execution with a minimum of overhead for less performance-critical code in one report the jvm beat some c++ or c code in some benchmarks
initially available as an add-on for java 1.2 hotspot became the default sun jvm in java 1.3
== features ==
sun's jre features two virtual machines one called client and the other server the client version is tuned for quick loading it makes use of interpretation the server version loads more slowly putting more effort into producing highly optimized jit compilations that yield higher performance both vms compile only often-run methods using a configurable invocation-count threshold to decide which methods to compile
the hotspot java virtual machine is written in c++ as stated on the hotspot web page the source contains approximately 250,000 lines of code hotspot provides
a class loader
a bytecode interpreter
client and server virtual machines optimized for their respective uses
several garbage collectors
a set of supporting runtime libraries
=== jvm flags ===
hotspot supports many command-line arguments for options of the virtual machine execution some are standard and must be found in any conforming java virtual machine others are specific to hotspot and may not be found in other jvms (options that begin with -x or -xx are non-standard)
== license ==
on 13 november 2006 the hotspot jvm and the jdk were licensed under the gpl version 2 this is the code that became part of java 7 (codename dolphin)
== supported platforms ==
=== maintained by oracle ===
as for the whole jdk hotspot is supported by oracle corporation on microsoft windows linux solaris and mac os x supported isas are ia-32 x86-64 armv6 armv7 and sparc (exclusive to solaris)
=== ports by third parties ===
ports are also available by third parties for various other unix operating systems several different hardware architectures are supported including x86 powerpc and sparc (solaris only)
porting hotspot is difficult because the code while primarily written in c++ contains a lot of assembly language to remedy this the icedtea project has developed a generic port of the hotspot interpreter called zero-assembler hotspot (or zero) with almost no assembly code this port is intended for easy adaptation of the interpreter component of hotspot to any linux processor architecture the code of zero-assembler hotspot is used for all the non-x86 ports of hotspot (ppc ia-64 s390 and arm) since version 1.6
