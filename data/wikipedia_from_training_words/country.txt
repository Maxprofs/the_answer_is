a country is a region that is identified as a distinct entity in political geography a country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics regardless of the physical geography in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the league of nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the united nations in 1945 a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction
sometimes the word countries is used to refer both to sovereign states and to other political entities while other times it refers only to states for example the cia world factbook uses the word in its country name field to refer to a wide variety of dependencies areas of special sovereignty uninhabited islands and other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent states".[note 1]
== etymology and usageedit ==
the word country comes from old french cuntre itself derived from vulgar latin (terra) contrata ((land) lying opposite (land) spread before) derived from contra (against opposite) it most likely entered english language after the franco-norman invasion during the 11th century
in english the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions so that one sense associated with the indefinite article a country is now a synonym for state or a former sovereign state in the sense of sovereign territory or district native land areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such as the west country in england the black country (a heavily industrialized part of england) constable country (a part of east anglia painted by john constable) the big country (used in various contexts of the american west) coal country (used of parts of the us and elsewhere) and many other terms
the equivalent terms in french and other romance languages (pays and variants) have not carried the process of being identified with political sovereign states as far as the english country instead derived from pagus which designated the territory controlled by a medieval count a title originally granted by the roman church in many european countries the words are used for sub-divisions of the national territory as in the german bundeslnder as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state france has very many pays that are officially recognised at some level and are either natural regions like the pays de bray or reflect old political or economic unities like the pays de la loire at the same time the united states and brazil are also pays in everyday french speech
a version of country can be found in the modern french language as contre based on the word cuntre in old french that is used similarly to the word pays to define regions and unities but can also be used to describe a political state in some particular cases the modern italian contrada is a word with its meaning varying locally but usually meaning a ward or similar small division of a town or a village or hamlet in the countryside
== sovereignty statusedit ==
the term country is frequently used to refer to sovereign states there is no universal agreement on the number of countries in the world since a number of states have disputed sovereignty status there are 206 total states with 193 states participating in the united nations two observer states (the holy see and palestine) and 11 other states all are defined as states by declarative theory of statehood and constitutive theory of statehood the latest proclaimed state is south sudan
although not sovereign states england scotland wales and northern ireland are referred to as separate countries which collectively form the sovereign state known as the united kingdom the degree of autonomy of non-sovereign countries varies widely some are possessions of sovereign states as several states have overseas dependencies (such as the british virgin islands (united kingdom) and saint pierre and miquelon (france)) with citizenry at times identical and at times distinct from their own such dependent territories are usually listed together with sovereign states on lists of countries but may nonetheless be treated as a separate country of origin in international trade as hong kong is
