=== housing ===
paris is the fifth most expensive city in the world for luxury housing 18,499 per square metre (1,720/sq ft) in 2014 according to a 2012 study for the la tribune newspaper the most expensive street is the quai des orfvres in the 1st arrondissement with an average price of 20,665 per square metre (1,920/sq ft) against 3,900 per square metre (360/sq ft) for rue pajol in the 18th arrondissement
the total number of residences in the city of paris in 2011 was 1,356,074 up from a former high of 1,334,815 in 2006 among these 1,165,541 (85.9 percent) were main residences 91,835 (6.8 percent) were secondary residences and the remaining 7.3 percent were empty (down from 9.2 percent in 2006)
paris urban tissue began to fill and overflow its 1860 limits from around the 1920s and because of its density it has seen few modern constructions since then sixty-two percent of its buildings date from 1949 and before 20 percent were built between 1949 and 1974 and only 18 percent of the buildings remaining were built after that date
two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments paris averages 1.9 people per residence a number that has remained constant since the 1980s but it is much less than le-de-france's 2.33 person-per-residence average only 33 percent of principal-residence parisians own their habitation (against 47 percent for the entire le-de-france) the major part of the city's population is a rent-paying one
social housing represents a little more than 17 percent of the city's total residences but these are rather unevenly distributed throughout the capital the vast majority of these are concentrated in a crescent formed by paris's south-western to northern periphery arrondissements
in 2012 the paris agglomeration (urban area) counted 28,800 people without a fixed residence an increase of 84 percent since 2001 it represents 43 percent of the homeless in all of france forty-one percent were women and 29 percent were accompanied by children fifty-six percent of the homeless were born outside of france the largest number coming from africa and eastern europe the city of paris has sixty homeless shelters called centres d'hbergement et de rinsertion sociale or chrs which are funded by the city and operated by private charities and associations
=== paris and its suburbs ===
aside from the 20th century addition of the bois de boulogne bois de vincennes and paris heliport paris's administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860 the seine dpartement had been governing paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790 but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to govern as a unique entity this problem was resolved when its parent district de la rgion parisienne (paris region) was reorganised into several new departments from 1968 paris became a department in itself and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three departments surrounding it the paris region was renamed le-de-france in 1977 but the paris region name is still commonly used today paris will be reunited with its suburbs on january 1 2016 when the mtropole du grand paris comes into existence
paris's disconnect with its suburbs its lack of suburban transportation in particular became all too apparent with the paris agglomeration's growth paul delouvrier promised to resolve the paris-suburbs msentente when he became head of the paris region in 1961 two of his most ambitious projects for the region were the construction of five suburban villes nouvelles ("new cities") and the rer commuter train network many other suburban residential districts (grands ensembles) were built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population these districts were socially mixed at first but few residents actually owned their homes (the growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s) their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere and their repopulation by those with more limited possibilities
these areas quartiers sensibles ("sensitive quarters") are in northern and eastern paris namely around its goutte d'or and belleville neighbourhoods to the north of the city they are grouped mainly in the seine-saint-denis department and to a lesser extreme to the east in the val-d'oise department other difficult areas are located in the seine valley in vry et corbeil-essonnes (essonne) in mureaux mantes-la-jolie (yvelines) and scattered among social housing districts created by delouvrier's 1961 ville nouvelle political initiative
the paris agglomeration's urban sociology is basically that of 19th century paris its fortuned classes are situated in its west and south-west and its middle-to-lower classes are in its north and east the remaining areas are mostly middle-class citizenry dotted with islands of fortuned populations located there due to reasons of historical importance namely saint-maur-des-fosss to the east and enghien-les-bains to the north of paris

the population of paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921 the principal reasons were a significant decline in household size and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975 factors in the migration included de-industrialisation high rent the gentrification of many inner quarters the transformation of living space into offices and greater affluence among working families the city's population loss came to an end in the 21st century the population estimate of july 2004 showed a population increase for the first time since 1954 and the population reached 2,234,000 by 2009
