a writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate ideas writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels short stories poetry plays screenplays and essays as well as various utilitarian forms such as reports and news articles writers texts are published across a range of media skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society the word is also used elsewhere in the arts such as songwriter but as a standalone term writer normally refers to the creation of written language some writers work from an oral tradition
writers can produce material across a number of genres fictional or non-fictional other writers use multiple media for example graphics or illustration to enhance the communication of their ideas another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers whose skills create understandable interpretive documents of a practical or scientific nature some writers may use images (drawing painting graphics) or multimedia to augment their writing in rare instances creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words
as well as producing their own written works writers often write on how they write (that is the process they use) why they write (that is their motivation) and also comment on the work of other writers (criticism) writers work professionally or non-professionally that is for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance (or on acceptance) or only after their work is published payment is only one of the motivations of writers and many are never paid for their work
the term writer is often used as a synonym of author although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing even if its composition is anonymous unknown or collaborative
== types of writers ==
writers choose from a range of literary genres to express their ideas most writing can be adapted for use in another medium for example a writer's work may be read privately or recited or performed in a play or film satire for example may be written as a poem an essay a film a comic play or a piece of journalism the writer of a letter may include elements of criticism biography or journalism
many writers work across genres the genre sets the parameters but all kinds of creative adaptation have been attempted novel to film poem to play history to musical writers may begin their career in one genre and change to another for example historian william dalrymple began in the genre of travel literature and also writes as a journalist many writers have produced both fiction and non-fiction works and others write in a genre that crosses the two for example writers of historical romances such as georgette heyer invent characters and stories set in historical periods in this genre the accuracy of the history and the level of factual detail in the work both tend to be debated some writers write both creative fiction and serious analysis sometimes using different names to separate their work dorothy sayers for example wrote crime fiction but was also a playwright essayist translator and critic

==== poet ====
poets make maximum use of the language to achieve an emotional and sensory impact as well as a cognitive one to create these effects they use rhyme and rhythm and they also exploit the properties of words with a range of other techniques such as alliteration and assonance a common theme is love and its vicissitudes shakespeare's famous love story romeo and juliet for example written in a variety of poetic forms has been performed in innumerable theatres and made into at least eight cinematic versions john donne is another poet renowned for his love poetry
==== novelist ====
novelists write novels stories that explore universal themes through fiction they situate invented characters and plots in a narrative designed to be both credible and entertaining
==== satirist ====
a satirist uses wit to ridicule the shortcomings of society or individuals with the intent of exposing stupidity usually the subject of the satire is a contemporary issue such as ineffective political decisions or politicians although human vices such as greed are also a common and universal subject philosopher voltaire wrote a satire about optimism called candide which was subsequently turned into an opera and many well known lyricists wrote for it there are elements of absurdism in candide just as there are in the work of contemporary satirist barry humphries who writes comic satire for his character dame edna everage to perform on stage
satirists use various techniques such as irony sarcasm and hyperbole to make their point and they choose from the full range of genres the satire may be in the form of prose or poetry or dialogue in a film for example one of the most famous satirists is jonathan swift who wrote the four-volume work gulliver's travels and many other satires including a modest proposal and the battle of the books

==== playwright ====
a playwright writes plays which may or may not be performed on a stage by actors a play's narrative is driven by dialogue like novelists playwrights usually explore a theme by showing how people respond to a set of circumstances as writers playwrights have to make the language and the dialogue succeed in terms of the characters who speak the lines as well as in the play as a whole since most plays are performed rather than read privately the playwright has to produce a text that works in spoken form and can also hold an audience's attention over the period of the performance
playwrights also adapt or re-write other works such as plays written earlier or literary works originally in another genre famous playwrights such as henrik ibsen or anton chekhov have had their works adapted many times the plays of early greek playwrights sophocles euripides and aeschylus are still performed adaptations of a playwright's work may be faithful to the original or creatively interpreted if the writers purpose in re-writing the play is to produce a film they will have to prepare a screenplay shakespeare's plays for example while still regularly performed in the original form are often adapted and abridged especially for the cinema an example of a creative modern adaptation of a play that nonetheless used the original writer's words is baz luhrmann's version of romeo and juliet the amendment of the name to romeo + juliet indicates to the audience that the version will be different from the original tom stoppard's play rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead is a play inspired by shakespeare's hamlet that takes two of shakespeare's most minor characters and creates a new play in which they are the protagonists
==== screenwriter ====

screenwriters playwrights and other writers are inspired by the great themes and often use similar and familiar plot devices to explore them for example in shakespeare's hamlet is a play within a play which the hero uses to demonstrate the king's guilt hamlet gains the co-operation of the actors to set up the play as a thing wherein i'll catch the conscience of the king teleplay writer joe menosky deploys the same play within a play device in an episode of the science fiction television series star trek voyager the bronze-age playwright/hero enlists the support of a star trek crew member to create a play that will convince the ruler (or patron as he is called) of the futility of war
==== speechwriter ====
a speechwriter prepares the text for a speech to be given before a group or crowd on a specific occasion and for a specific purpose they are often intended to be persuasive or inspiring such as the speeches given by skilled orators like cicero charismatic or influential political leaders like nelson mandela or for use in a court of law or parliament the writer of the speech may be the person intended to deliver it or it might be prepared by a person hired for the task on behalf of someone else such is the case when speechwriters are employed by many senior-level elected officials and executives in both government and private sectors

==== critic ====
critics consider and assess the extent to which a work succeeds in its purpose the work under consideration may be literary theatrical musical artistic or architectural in assessing the success of a work the critic takes account of why it was done for example why a text was written for whom in what style and under what circumstances after making such an assessment critics write and publish their evaluation adding the value of their scholarship and thinking to substantiate any opinion the theory of criticism is an area of study in itself a good critic understands and is able to incorporate the theory behind the work they are evaluating into their assessment some critics are already writers in another genre for example they might be novelists or essayists influential and respected writer/critics include the art critic charles baudelaire (18211867) and the literary critic james wood (born 1965) both of whom have books published containing collections of their criticism some critics are poor writers and produce only superficial or unsubstantiated work hence while anyone can be an uninformed critic the notable characteristics of a good critic are understanding insight and an ability to write well
==== editor ====
an editor prepares literary material for publication the material may be the editor's own original work but more commonly an editor works with the material of one or more other people there are different types of editor copy editors format text to a particular style and/or correct errors in grammar and spelling without changing the text substantively on the other hand an editor may suggest or undertake significant changes to a text to improve its readability sense or structure this latter type of editor can go so far as to excise some parts of the text add new parts or restructure the whole the work of editors of ancient texts or manuscripts or collections of works results in differing editions for example there are many editions of shakespeare's plays by notable editors who also contribute original introductions to the resulting publication editors who work on journals and newspapers have varying levels of responsibility for the text they may write original material in particular editorials select what is to be included from a range of items on offer format the material or check its accuracy

==== lexicographer ====
writers who create dictionaries are called lexicographers one of the most famous is samuel johnson (17091784) whose dictionary of the english language was regarded not only as a great personal scholarly achievement but was also dictionary of such pre-eminence that would have been referred to by such writers as jane austen
==== researcher/scholar ====
researchers and scholars who write about their discoveries and ideas sometimes have profound effects on society scientists and philosophers are good examples because their new ideas can revolutionise the way people think and how they behave three of the best known examples of such a revolutionary impact are nicolaus copernicus who wrote de revolutionibus orbium coelestium (1543) charles darwin who wrote on the origin of species (1859) and sigmund freud who wrote the interpretation of dreams (1899)
these three highly influential and initially very controversial works changed the way people understood their place in the world copernicus's heliocentric view of the cosmos displaced humans from their previously accepted place at the centre of the universe darwin's evolutionary theory placed humans firmly within as opposed to above the order of nature and freud's ideas about the power of the unconscious mind overcame the belief that humans were consciously in control of all their own actions
==== translator ====
translators have the task of finding some equivalence in another language to a writer's meaning intention and style translators whose work has had very significant cultural impact include al-ajjj ibn ysuf ibn maar who translated elements from greek into arabic and jean-franois champollion who deciphered egyptian hieroglyphs with the result that he could publish the first translation of the rosetta stone hieroglyphs in 1822 difficulties with translation are exacerbated when words or phrases incorporate rhymes rhythms or puns or when they have connotations in one language that are non-existent in another for example the title of le grand meaulnes by alain-fournier is supposedly untranslatable because no english adjective will convey all the shades of meaning that can be read into the simple [french] word grand which takes on overtones as the story progresses.
=== reportage ===
==== blogger ====
writers of blogs which have appeared on the world wide web since the 1990s need no authorisation to be published the contents of these short opinion pieces or posts form a commentary on issues of specific interest to readers who can use the same technology to interact with the author with an immediacy hitherto impossible the ability to link to other sites means that some blog writers and their writing may become suddenly and unpredictably popular malala yousafzai a young pakistani education activist rose to prominence because of her blog for bbc
a blog writer is using the technology to create a message that is in some ways like a newsletter and in other ways like a personal letter the greatest difference between a blog and a photocopied school newsletter or an annual family letter photocopied and mailed to a hundred friends is the potential audience and the increased potential for direct communication between audience members thus as with other forms of letter the writer knows some of the readers but one of the main differences is that some of the audience will be random and that presumably changes the way we [writers] write. it has been argued that blogs owe a debt to renaissance essayist michel de montaigne whose essais ("attempts") were published in 1580 because montaigne wrote as if he were chatting to his readers just two friends whiling away an afternoon in conversation
==== columnist ====
columnists write regular pieces for newspapers and other periodicals usually containing a lively and entertaining expression of opinion some columnists have had collections of their best work published as a collection in a book so that readers can re-read what would otherwise be no longer available columns are quite short pieces of writing so columnists often write in other genres as well an example is the columnist elizabeth farrelly who besides being a columnist is also an architecture critic and author of books
==== diarist ====
writers who record their experiences thoughts or feelings in a sequential form over a period of time in a diary are known as diarists their writings can provide valuable insights into historical periods specific events or individual personalities examples include samuel pepys (16331703) an english administrator and member of parliament whose detailed private diary provides eyewitness accounts of events during the 17th century most notably of the great fire of london anne frank (19291945) was a 13-year-old girl whose diary from 19421944 records both her experiences as a persecuted jew in world war ii and an adolescent dealing with intra-family relationships
==== journalist ====
journalists write reports about current events after investigating them and gathering information some journalists write reports about predictable or scheduled events such as social or political meetings others are investigative journalists who need to undertake considerable research and analysis in order to write an explanation or account of something complex that was hitherto unknown or not understood often investigative journalists are reporting criminal or corrupt activity which puts them at risk personally and means that what it is likely that attempts may be made to attack or suppress what they write an example is bob woodward a journalist who investigated and wrote about criminal activities by the us president
==== memoirist ====
writers of memoirs produce accounts from the memories of their own lives which are deemed unusual important or scandalous enough to be of interest to general readers although intended to be factual readers are alerted to the likelihood of some inaccuracies or bias towards an idiosyncratic perception by the choice of genre a memoir for example is allowed to have a much more selective set of experiences than an autobiography which is expected to be more complete and make a greater attempt at balance famous memoirists include frances vane viscountess vane and giacomo casanova
=== utilitarian ===

the logs and reports of master mariner william bligh contributed to his being honourably acquitted at the court-martial inquiring into the loss of hms bounty
==== scribe ====
a scribe writes ideas and information on behalf of another sometimes copying from another document sometimes from oral instruction on behalf of an illiterate person sometimes transcribing from another medium such as a tape recording shorthand or personal notes
being able to write was a rare achievement for over 500 years in western europe so monks who copied texts were scribes responsible for saving many texts from classical times the monasteries where monks who knew how to read and write lived provided an environment stable enough for writing irish monks for example came to europe in about 600 and found manuscripts in places like tours and toulouse which they copied the monastic writers also illustrated their books with highly skilled art work using gold and rare colours

== process and methods ==
=== writing process ===
there is a range of approaches that writers take to the task of writing each writer needs to find his or her own process and most describe it as more or less a struggle sometimes writers have had the bad fortune to lose their work and have had to start again before the invention of photocopiers and electronic text storage a writer's work had to be stored on paper which meant it was very susceptible to fire in particular (in very early times writers used vellum and clay which were more robust materials.) writers whose work was destroyed before completion include l l zamenhof the inventor of esperanto whose years of work were thrown into the fire by his father because he was afraid that his son would be thought a spy working code essayist and historian thomas carlyle lost the only copy of a manuscript for the french revolution a history when it was mistakenly thrown into the fire by a maid he wrote it again from the beginning writers usually develop a personal schedule angus wilson for example wrote for a number of hours every morning
writer's block is a relatively common experience among writers especially professional writers when for a period of time the writer feels unable to write for reasons other than lack of skill or commitment
==== sole ====
most writers write alone typically they are engaged in a solitary activity that requires them to struggle with both the concepts they are trying to express and the best way to express it this may mean choosing the best genre or genres as well as choosing the best words writers often develop idiosyncratic solutions to the problem of finding the right words to put on a blank page or screen didn't somerset maugham also write facing a blank wall  goethe couldn't write a line if there was another person anywhere in the same house or so he said at some point.
==== collaborative ====
collaborative writing means that multiple authors write and contribute to a piece of writing in this approach it is highly likely the writers will collaborate on editing the piece too the more usual process is that the editing is done by an independent editor after the writer submits a draft version
in some cases such as that between a librettist and composer a writer will collaborate with another artist on a creative work one of the best known of these types of collaborations is that between gilbert and sullivan librettist w s gilbert wrote the words for the comic operas created by the partnership
==== committee ====
occasionally a writing task is given to a committee of writers the most famous example is the task of translating the bible into english sponsored by king james vi of england in 1604 and accomplished by six committees some in cambridge and some in oxford who were allocated different sections of the text the resulting authorized king james version published in 1611 has been described as an everlasting miracle because its writers (that is its translators) sought to hold themselves consciously poised between the claims of accessibility and beauty plainness and richness simplicity and majesty the people and the king, with the result that the language communicates itself in a way which is quite unaffected neither literary nor academic not historical nor reconstructionist but transmitting a nearly incredible immediacy from one end of human civilisation to another.
==== multimedia ====
some writers support the verbal part of their work with images or graphics that are an integral part of the way their ideas are communicated william blake is one of rare poets who created his own paintings and drawings as integral parts of works such as his songs of innocence and of experience cartoonists are writers whose work depends heavily on hand drawn imagery other writers especially writers for children incorporate painting or drawing in more or less sophisticated ways shaun tan for example is a writer who uses imagery extensively sometimes combining fact fiction and illustration sometimes for a didactic purpose sometimes on commission children's writers beatrix potter may gibbs and theodor seuss geisel are as well known for their illustrations as for their texts
==== crowd sourced ====
some writers contribute very small sections to a piece of writing that cumulates as a result this method is particularly suited to very large works such as dictionaries and encyclopaedias the best known example of the former is the oxford english dictionary under the editorship of lexicographer james murray who was provided with the prolific and helpful contributions of w.c minor at the time an inmate of a hospital for the criminally insane
the best known example of the latter an encyclopaedia that is crowdsourced is wikipedia which relies on the contributions of thousands of volunteer writers and editors worldwide such as simon pulsifer
=== motivations ===
writers have many different reasons for writing among which is usually some combination of self-expression and recording facts history or research results the many physician writers for example have combined their observation and knowledge of the human condition with their desire to write and contributed many poems plays translations essays and other texts some writers write extensively on their motivation and on the likely motivations of other writers for example george orwell's essay why i write (1946) takes this as its subject as to what constitutes success or failure to a writer it has been described as a complicated business where the material rubs up against the spiritual and psychology plays a big part
==== command ====
some writers are the authors of specific military orders whose clarity will determine the outcome of a battle among the most controversial and unsuccessful was lord raglan's order at the charge of the light brigade which being vague and misinterpreted led to defeat with many casualties
==== develop skill/ explore ideas ====
some writers use the writing task to develop their own skill (in writing itself or in another area of knowledge) or explore an idea while they are producing a piece of writing philologist j r r tolkien for example created a new language for his fantasy books
==== entertain ====
some genres are a particularly appropriate choice for writers whose chief purpose is to entertain among them are limericks many comics and thrillers writers of children's literature seek to entertain children but are also usually mindful of the educative function of their work as well
==== influence ====
anger has motivated many writers including martin luther angry at religious corruption who wrote the the ninety-five theses in 1517 to reform the church and mile zola (18401902) who wrote the public letter j'accuse in 1898 to bring public attention to government injustice as a consequence of which he had to flee to england from his native france such writers have had a significant impact on ideas opinion or policy
==== payment ====
writers may write a particular piece for payment (even if at other times they write for another reason) such as when they are commissioned to create a new work transcribe an old one translate another writer's work or write for someone who is illiterate or inarticulate in some cases writing has been the only way an individual could earn an income frances trollope is an example of women who wrote to save herself and her family from penury at a time when there were very few socially acceptable employment opportunities for them her book about her experiences in america called domestic manners of the americans became a great success even though she was over fifty and had never written before in her life after which she continued to write hard carrying this on almost entirely before breakfast according to her writer son anthony trollope her books saved the family from ruin
==== teach ====
aristotle who was tutor to alexander the great wrote to support his teaching he wrote two treatises for the young prince on monarchy and on colonies and his dialogues also appear to have been written either as lecture notes or discussion papers for use in his philosophy school at the athens lyceum between 334 and 323 bc. they encompass both his scientific writings (metaphysics physics biology meteorology and astronomy as well as logic and argument) the non-scientific works (poetry oratory ethics and politics) major elements in traditional greek and roman education
writers of textbooks also use writing to teach and there are numerous instructional guides to writing itself for example many people will find it necessary to make a speech in the service of your company church civic club political party or other organization and so instructional writers have produced texts and guides for speechmaking
==== tell a story ====
many writers use their skill to tell the story of their people community or cultural tradition especially one with a personal significance examples include shmuel yosef agnon miguel ngel asturias doris lessing toni morrison isaac bashevis singer and patrick white writers such as mario vargas llosa herta mller and erich maria remarque write about the impact of conflict dispossession and war

writers use prose poetry and letters as part of courtship rituals edmond rostand's play cyrano de bergerac written in verse is about both the power of love and the power of the self-doubting writer/hero's writing talent
== authorship ==
=== pen names ===
writers sometimes use a pseudonym otherwise known as a pen name or nom de plume the reasons they do this include to separate their writing from other work (or other types of writing) for which they are known to enhance the possibility of publication by reducing prejudice (such as against women writers or writers of a particular ethnicity) to reduce personal risk (such as political risks from individuals groups or states that disagree with them) or to make their name better suit another language
examples of well-known writers who used a pen name include george eliot (18191880) whose real name was mary anne (or marian) evans george orwell (19031950) whose real name was eric blair george sand (18041876) whose real name was lucile aurore dupin dr seuss (19041991) whose real name was theodor seuss geisel stendhal (17831842) whose real name was marie-henri beyle and mark twain (18351910) whose real name was samuel langhorne clemens
apart from the large numbers of works attributable only to anonymous there are a large number of writers who were once known and are now unknown efforts are made to find and re-publish these writers works one example is the publication of books like japan as seen and described by famous writers (a 2010 reproduction of a pre-1923 publication) by anonymous another example is the founding of a library and study centre for the study of early english women's writing in chawton england
=== fictional writers ===
some fictional writers are very well known because of the strength of their characterization by the real writer or the significance of their role as writer in the plot of a work examples of this type of fictional writer include edward casaubon a fictional scholar in george eliot's middlemarch and edwin reardon a fictional writer in george gissing's new grub street casaubon's efforts to complete an authoritative study affect the decisions taken by the protagonists in eliot's novel and drive significant parts of the plot in gissing's work reardon's efforts to produce high quality writing put him in conflict with another character who takes a more commercial approach robinson crusoe is a fictional writer who was originally credited by the real writer (daniel defoe) as being the author of the confessional letters in the work of the same name bridget jones is a comparable fictional diarist created by writer helen fielding both works became famous and popular their protagonists and story were developed further through many adaptations including film versions cyrano de bergerac was a real writer who created a fictional character with his own name the sibylline books a collection of prophecies were supposed to have been purchased from the cumaean sibyl by the last king of rome since they were consulted during periods of crisis it could be said that they are a case of real works created by a fictional writer
=== writers of sacred texts ===
religious texts or scriptures are the texts which various religious traditions consider to be sacred or of central importance to their religious tradition some religions and spiritual movements believe that their sacred texts are divinely or supernaturally revealed or inspired while others have individual authors
== controversial writing ==
skilled writers make an impact on ideas and society so there are many instances where a writer's work or opinion has been unwelcome and controversial in some cases they have been persecuted or punished aware that their writing will cause controversy or put themselves and others into danger some writers self-censor or withhold their work from publication or hide their manuscripts or use some other technique to preserve and protect their work two of the most famous examples are leonardo da vinci and charles darwin da vinci had the habit of conversing with himself in his writings and of putting his thoughts into the clearest and most simple form he used left-handed or mirror writing (a technique described as so characteristic of him") to protect his scientific research from other readers the fear of persecution social disgrace and being proved incorrect are regarded as contributing factors to darwin's delaying the publication of his radical and influential work on the origin of species
one of the results of controversies caused by a writer's work is scandal which is a negative public reaction that causes damage to reputation and depends on public outrage it has been said that it is possible to scandalise the public because the public wants to be shocked in order to confirm its own sense of virtue the scandal may be caused by what the writer wrote or by the style in which it was written in either case the content or the style is likely to have broken with tradition or expectation making such a departure may in fact be part of the writer's intention or at least part of the result of introducing innovations into the genre in which he or she is working for example novelist d.h lawrence challenged ideas of what was acceptable as well as what was expected in form these may be regarded as literary scandals just as in a different way are the scandals involving writers who mislead the public about their identity such as norma khouri or helen darville who in deceiving the public are considered to have committed fraud
writers may also cause the more usual type of scandal whereby the public is outraged by the opinions behaviour or life of the individual (an experience not limited to writers) poet paul verlaine outraged society with his behaviour and treatment of his wife and child as well as his lover among the many writers whose writing or life was affected by scandals are oscar wilde lord byron jean-paul sartre and albert camus and h g wells one of the most famously scandalous writers was the marquis de sade who offended the public both by his writings and by his behaviour
=== punishment ===
the consequence of scandal for a writer may be censorship or discrediting of the work or social ostracism of its creator in some instances punishment persecution or prison follow the list of journalists killed in russia is an example others include
