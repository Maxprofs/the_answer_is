the holocene /hlsin/ is the geological epoch that began after the pleistocene at approximately 11,700 years before the year 2000ad and continues to the present the term recent (usually capitalised) has often been used as an exact synonym of holocene although this usage is discouraged in 21st-century work the holocene is part of the quaternary period its name comes from the greek words (holos whole or entire) and (kainos new) meaning entirely recent it has been identified with the current warm period known as mis 1 and can be considered an interglacial in the current ice age based on that evidence
the holocene also encompasses the growth and impacts of the human species worldwide including all its written history development of major civilizations and overall significant transition toward urban living in the present human impacts on modern-era earth and its ecosystems may be considered of global significance for future evolution of living species including approximately synchronous lithospheric evidence or more recently atmospheric evidence of human impacts given these a new term anthropocene is specifically proposed and used informally only for the very latest part of modern history and of significant human impact since the epoch of the neolithic revolution (around 12,000 years bp)
== overview ==
it is accepted by the international commission on stratigraphy that the holocene started approximately 11,700 years bp (before present) the epoch follows the pleistocene and the last glacial period (local names for the last glacial period include the wisconsinan in north america the weichselian in europe the devensian in the united kingdom the llanquihue in chile and the otiran in new zealand) the holocene can be subdivided into five time intervals or chronozones based on climatic fluctuations
preboreal (10 ka9 ka)
boreal (9 ka8 ka)
atlantic (8 ka5 ka)
subboreal (5 ka2.5 ka) and
subatlantic (2.5 kapresent)
note ka means thousand years (non-calibrated c14 dates)
the blyttsernander classification of climatic periods defined initially by plant remains in peat mosses is now being explored currently by geologists working in different regions studying sea levels peat bogs and ice core samples by a variety of methods with a view toward further verifying and refining the blyttsernander sequence they find a general correspondence across eurasia and north america though the method was once thought to be of no interest the scheme was defined for northern europe but the climate changes were claimed to occur more widely the periods of the scheme include a few of the final pre-holocene oscillations of the last glacial period and then classify climates of more recent prehistory
paleontologists have defined no faunal stages for the holocene if subdivision is necessary periods of human technological development such as the mesolithic neolithic and bronze age are usually used however the time periods referenced by these terms vary with the emergence of those technologies in different parts of the world
climatically the holocene may be divided evenly into the hypsithermal and neoglacial periods the boundary coincides with the start of the bronze age in european civilization according to some scholars a third division the anthropocene began in the 18th century
== geology ==
continental motions due to plate tectonics are less than a kilometre over a span of only 10,000 years however ice melt caused world sea levels to rise about 35 m (115 ft) in the early part of the holocene in addition many areas above about 40 degrees north latitude had been depressed by the weight of the pleistocene glaciers and rose as much as 180 m (590 ft) due to post-glacial rebound over the late pleistocene and holocene and are still rising today
the sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea holocene marine fossils are known from vermont quebec ontario maine new hampshire and michigan other than higher-latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed floodplain and cave deposits holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely tectonic uplift of non-glacial origin
post-glacial rebound in the scandinavia region resulted in the formation of the baltic sea the region continues to rise still causing weak earthquakes across northern europe the equivalent event in north america was the rebound of hudson bay as it shrank from its larger immediate post-glacial tyrrell sea phase to near its present boundaries
== climate ==
climate has been fairly stable over the holocene ice core records show that before the holocene there was global warming after the end of the last ice age and cooling periods but climate changes became more regional at the start of the younger dryas during the transition from the last glacial to the holocene the huelmomascardi cold reversal in the southern hemisphere began before the younger dryas and the maximum warmth flowed south to north from 11,000 to 7,000 years ago it appears that this was influenced by the residual glacial ice remaining in the northern hemisphere until the later date
the hypsithermal was a period of warming in which the global climate became warmer however the warming was probably not uniform across the world this period of warmth ended about 5,500 years ago with the descent into the neoglacial at that time the climate was not unlike today's but there was a slightly warmer period from the 10th14th centuries known as the medieval warm period this was followed by the little ice age from the 13th or 14th century to the mid 19th century which was a period of significant cooling though not everywhere as severe as previous times during neoglaciation
the holocene warming is an interglacial period and there is no reason to believe that it represents a permanent end to the current ice age
compared to glacial conditions habitable zones have expanded northwards reaching their northernmost point during the hypsithermal greater moisture in the polar regions has caused the disappearance of steppe-tundra
the temporal and spatial extent of holocene climate change is an area of considerable uncertainty with solar forcing recently proposed to be the origin of cycles identied in the north atlantic region climate cyclicity through the holocene (bond events) has been observed in or near marine settings and is strongly controlled by glacial input to the north atlantic periodicities of ~2500 ~1500 and ~1000 years are generally observed in the north atlantic at the same time spectral analyses of the continental record which is remote from oceanic influence reveal persistent periodicities of 1000 and 500 years that may correspond to solar activity variations during the holocene epoch a 1500-year cycle corresponding to the north atlantic oceanic circulation may have widespread global distribution in the late holocene
== ecological developments ==
animal and plant life have not evolved much during the relatively short holocene but there have been major shifts in the distributions of plants and animals a number of large animals including mammoths and mastodons saber-toothed cats like smilodon and homotherium and giant sloths disappeared in the late pleistocene and early holoceneespecially in north america where animals that survived elsewhere (including horses and camels) became extinct this extinction of american megafauna has been explained as caused by the arrival of the ancestors of amerindians though most scientists assert that climatic change also contributed in addition a controversial bolide impact over north america has been hypothesized to have triggered the younger dryas
throughout the world ecosystems in cooler climates that were previously regional have been isolated in higher altitude ecological islands
the 8.2 ka event an abrupt cold spell recorded as a negative excursion in the 18o record lasting 400 years is the most prominent climatic event occurring in the holocene epoch and may have marked a resurgence of ice cover it is thought that this event was caused by the final drainage of lake agassiz which had been confined by the glaciers disrupting the thermohaline circulation of the atlantic
== human developments ==
the beginning of the holocene corresponds with the beginning of the mesolithic age in most of europe but in regions such as the middle east and anatolia with a very early neolithisation epipaleolithic is preferred in place of mesolithic cultures in this period include hamburgian federmesser and the natufian culture during which the oldest inhabited places still existing on earth were first settled such as jericho in the middle east as well as evolving archeological evidence of proto-religion at locations such as gbekli tepe as long ago as the 9th millennium bce
both are followed by the aceramic neolithic (pre-pottery neolithic a and pre-pottery neolithic b) and the pottery neolithic the late holocene brought advancements such as the bow and arrow and saw new methods of warfare in north america spear throwers and their large points were replaced by the bow and arrow with its small narrow points beginning in oregon and washington villages built on defensive bluffs indicate increased warfare leading to food gathering in communal groups for protection rather than individual hunting
