renting also known as hiring or letting is an agreement where a payment is made for the temporary use of a good service or property owned by another a gross lease is when the tenant pays a flat rental amount and the landlord pays for all property charges regularly incurred by the ownership
== reasons for rentingedit ==
there are many possible reasons for renting instead of buying for example
in many jurisdictions (including india spain australia united kingdom and the united states) rent used in a trade or business is tax deductible whereas rent on a dwelling is not tax deductible in most jurisdictions
financial inadequacy such as renting a house when one is unable to buy it one may not wish to pay the full price that ownership would need allowing for smaller payments over a specified period of time
reducing financial risk due to depreciation and transaction costs especially for real estate which might be needed only for a short amount of time
when something is needed only temporarily as in the case of a special tool a truck or a skip
when something is needed that may or may not be already owned but is not in proximity for use such as renting an automobile or bicycle when away on a trip
needing a cheaper alternative to buying such as renting a movie a person is unwilling to pay the full price for a movie so they rent it for a lesser price but give up the chance to view it again later
the tenant may want to leave the burden of upkeep of the property (mowing the lawn shovelling snow etc.) to the owner or his agents
there is no need to worry about lifespan and maintenance
renting keeps off-balance-sheet the debt that would burden the balance sheet of a company in case the property would have been bought
renting is good for the environment if products are used more efficiently by maximizing utility rather than being disposed overproduced and under utilized

=== rental investmentedit ===
net income received or losses suffered by an investor from renting of one or two properties is subject to idiosyncratic risk due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants
== rental agreementsedit ==
there is typically an implied explicit or written rental agreement or contract involved to specify the terms of the rental which are regulated and managed under contract law
examples include letting out real estate (real property) for the purpose of housing tenure (where the tenant rents a residence to live in) parking space for a vehicle(s) storage space whole or portions of properties for business agricultural institutional or government use or other reasons
when renting real estate the person(s) or party who lives in or occupies the real estate is often called a tenant paying rent to the owner of the property often called a landlord (or landlady) the real estate rented may be all or part of almost any real estate such as an apartment house building business office(s) or suite land farm or merely an inside or outside space to park a vehicle or store things all under real estate law
the tenancy agreement for real estate is often called a lease and usually involves specific property rights in real property as opposed to chattels
in india the rental income on property is taxed under the head income from house property a deduction of 30% is allowed from total rent which is charged to tax
the time use of a chattel or other so called personal property is covered under general contract law but the term lease also nowadays extends to long term rental contracts of more expensive non-real properties such as automobiles boats planes office equipment and so forth the distinction in that case is long term versus short term rentals some non-real properties commonly available for rent or lease are
motion pictures on vhs or dvd of audio cds of computer programs on cd-rom
transport equipment such as an automobile or a bicycle
ships and boats in which case rental is known as chartering and the rent is known as hire or freight (depending on the type of charter)
aircraft in which case rental is known as chartering or leasing if the rental is longer term
specialized tools such as a chainsaw laptop it equipment or something more substantial such as a forklift
large equipment such as cranes oil rigs and submarines
a deckchair or beach chair and umbrella
furniture
designer handbags jewelry sunglasses and watches
electrical items such as washing machines
in various degrees renting can involve buying services for various amounts of time such as staying in a hotel using a computer in an internet cafe or riding in a taxicab (some forms of english use the term hiring for this activity)
as seen from the examples some rented goods are used on the spot but usually they are taken along to help guarantee that they are brought back one or more of the following applies
one shows an identity document
one signs a contract any damage already present when renting may be noted down to avoid that the renter is blamed for it when the good is returned
one pays a damage deposit (a refundable fee that may be used in part to pay for damage caused by the renter)
if the customer has a credit account with the rental company they may rent over several months (or years) and will receive a recurring or continuation invoice each rental period until they return the equipment in this case deposits are rarely required
in certain types of rental (sometimes known as operated or wet rental) the charge may be calculated by the rental charge + timesheets of operators or drivers supplied by the rental company to operate the equipment this is particularly relevant for crane rental companies
sometimes the risk that the good is kept is reduced by it being a special model or having signs on it that cannot easily be removed making it obvious that it is owned by the rental company this is especially effective for goods used in public places but even when used at home it may help due to social control
persons and businesses that regularly rent goods from a particular company generally have an account with that company which reduces the administrative procedure (transaction costs) on each occasion
signing out books from a library could be considered renting when there is a fee per book however the term lending is more common

== rent to ownedit ==
a rental agreement may provide for the renter or lessee to become the owner of the asset at the end of the rental period usually at the renter's option on payment of a nominal fee such arrangements may be known as
rent-to-own a term used in the united states for rental of furniture or appliances the term is also used in the us for real estate transactions where the tenant has an option to purchase the property at a fixed price at a specified future time such arrangements are also known as lease-option lease-to-own or lease to purchase option
