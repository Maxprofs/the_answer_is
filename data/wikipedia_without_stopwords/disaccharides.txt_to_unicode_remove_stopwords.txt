disaccharide biose carbohydrate formed two monosaccharides simple sugars undergo condensation reaction involves elimination small molecule water functional groups like monosaccharides disaccharides soluble water three common references sucrose lactose maltose
disaccharide one four chemical groupings carbohydrates monosaccharide disaccharide oligosaccharide polysaccharide
common types disaccharidessucrose lactose maltosehave twelve carbon atoms general formula cho differences disaccharides due atomic arrangements within molecule
classification
two different types disaccharides
reducing disaccharides one monosaccharide reducing sugar still free hemiacetal unit nonreducing disaccharides components bond acetal linkage anomeric centers neither monosaccharide free hemiacetal unit cellobiose maltose examples reducing disaccharides
sucrose trehalose examples nonreducing disaccharides
formation
disaccharides formed two monosaccharides joined together molecule water removed process known dehydration reaction example milk sugar lactose made glucose galactose whereas sugar sugar cane sugar beets sucrose made glucose fructose maltose another notable disaccharide made two glucose molecules two monosaccharides bonded via dehydration reaction also called condensation reaction dehydration synthesis leads loss molecule water formation glycosidic bond
properties
glycosidic bond formed hydroxyl group component monosaccharide even component sugars eg glucose different bond combinations regiochemistry stereochemistry alpha beta result disaccharides diastereoisomers different chemical physical properties
depending monosaccharide constituents disaccharides sometimes crystalline sometimes watersoluble sometimes sweettasting stickyfeeling
assimilation
