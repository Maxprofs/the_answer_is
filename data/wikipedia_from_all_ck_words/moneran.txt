monera (/mnr/ m-neer-) was a kingdom that contained unicellular organisms with a prokaryotic cell organization (having no nuclear membrane) such as bacteria the taxon monera was first proposed as a phylum by ernst haeckel in 1866 subsequently the phylum was elevated to the rank of kingdom in 1925 by douard chatton the last commonly accepted mega-classification with the taxon monera was the five-kingdom classification system established by robert whittaker in 1969
under the three-domain system of taxonomy introduced by carl woese in 1977 which reflects the evolutionary history of life the organisms found in kingdom monera have been divided into two domains archaea and bacteria (with eukarya as the third domain) furthermore the taxon monera is paraphyletic (does not include all descendants of their most recent common ancestor) as archaea and eukarya are currently believed to be more closely related than either is to bacteria the term moneran is the informal name of members of this group and is still sometimes used (as is the term prokaryote") to denote a member of either domain
most bacteria were classified under monera however cyanobacteria (often called the blue-green algae) were initially classified under plantae due to their ability to photosynthesize

=== haeckel's classificationedit ===
traditionally the natural world was classified as animal vegetable or mineral as in systema naturae after the development of the microscope attempts were made to fit microscopic organisms into either the plant or animal kingdoms in 1676 antonie van leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria and called them animalcules, assigning them to the class vermes of the animalia due to the limited tools the sole references for this group were shape behaviour and habitat the description of genera and their classification was extremely limited which was accentuated by the perceived lack of importance of the group
ten years after the origin of species by charles darwin in 1866 ernst haeckel a supporter of evolution proposed a three-kingdom system which added the protista as a new kingdom that contained most microscopic organisms one of his eight major divisions of protista was composed of the monerans (called moneres in ) and defines them as completely structureless and homogeneous organisms consisting only of a piece of plasma haeckel's monera included not only bacterial groups of early discovery but also several small eukaryotic organisms in fact the genus vibrio is the only bacterial genus explicitly assigned to the phylum while others are mentioned indirectly which led copeland to speculate that haeckel considered all bacteria to belong to the genus vibrio ignoring other bacterial genera one notable exception were the members of the modern phylum cyanobacteria such as nostoc which were placed in the phylum archephyta of algae (vide infra blue-green algae)
the neolatin noun monera and the german noun moneren/moneres are derived from the ancient greek noun moneres () which haeckel states to mean simple however it actually means single solitary haeckel also describes the protist genus monas in the two pages about monera in his 1866 book the informal name of a member of the monera was initially moneron but later moneran was used
due to its lack of features the phylum was not fully subdivided but the genera therein were divided into two groups
die gymnomoneren (no envelope [sic.]) gymnomonera
protogenes such as protogenes primordialis an unidentified amoeba (eukaryote) and not a bacterium
protamaeba an incorrectly described/fabricated species
vibrio a genus of comma-shaped bacteria first described in 1854
bacterium a genus of rod-shaped bacteria first described in 1828 haeckel does not explicitly assign this genus to the monera
bacillus a genus of spore-forming rod-shaped bacteria first described in 1835 haeckel does not explicitly assign this genus to the monera kingdom
spirochaeta thin spiral-shaped bacteria first described in 1835 haeckel does not explicitly assign this genus to the monera
spirillum spiral-shaped bacteria first described in 1832 haeckel does not explicitly assign this genus to the monera
etc. haeckel does provide a comprehensive list
die lepomoneren (with envelope) lepomonera
protomonas identified to a synonym of monas a flagellated protozoan and not a bacterium the name was reused in 1984 for an unrelated genus of bacteria
vampyrella now classed as a eukaryote and not a bacterium
=== subsequent classificationsedit ===
like protista the monera classification was not fully followed at first and several different ranks were used and located with animals plants protists or fungi furthermore hkel's classification lacked specificity and was not exhaustive it in fact covers only a few pages consequently a lot of confusion arose even to the point that the monera did not contain bacterial genera and others according to huxley they were first recognized as a kingdom by enderlein in 1925 (bakterien-cyclogenie de gruyter berlin)
the most popular scheme was created in 1859 by c von ngeli who classified non-phototrophic bacteria as the class schizomycetes
the class schizomycetes was then emended by walter migula (along with the coinage of the genus pseudomonas in 1894) and others this term was in dominant use even in 1916 as reported by robert earle buchanan as it had priority over other terms such as monera however starting with ferdinand cohn in 1872 the term bacteria (or in german bacterien) became prominently used to informally describe this group of species without a nucleus bacterium was in fact a genus created in 1828 by christian gottfried ehrenberg additionally cohn divided the bacteria according to shape namely
spherobacteria for the cocci
microbacteria for the short non-filamentous rods
desmobacteria for the longer filamentous rods and spirobacteria for the spiral forms
successively cohn created the schizophyta of plants which contained the non-photrophic bacteria in the family schizomycetes and the phototrophic bacteria (blue green algae/cyanobacteria) in the schizophyceae this union of blue green algae and bacteria was much later followed by haeckel who classified the two families in a revised phylum monera in the protista
stanier and van neil (1941 the main outlines of bacterial classification j bacteriol 42 437- 466) recognized the kingdom monera with 2 phyla myxophyta and schizomycetae the latter comprising classes eubacteriae (3 orders) myxobacteriae (1 order) and spirochetae (1 order) bisset (1962 bacteria 2nd ed. livingston london) distinguished 1 class and 4 orders eubacteriales actinomycetales streptomycetales and flexibacteriales orla-jensen (1909 die hauptlinien des naturalischen bakteriensystems nebst einer ubersicht der garungsphenomene zentr bakt parasitenk. ii 22 305-346) and bergey et al (1925 bergey's manual of determinative bacteriology baltimore  williams & wilkins co.) with many subsequent editions) also presented classifications
=== rise to prominenceedit ===
the term monera became well established in the 20s and 30s when to rightfully increase the importance of the difference between species with a nucleus and without in 1925 douard chatton divided all living organisms into two empires prokaryotes and eukaryotes the kingdom monera being the sole member of the prokaryotes empire
the anthropic importance of the crown group of animals plants and fungi was hard to depose consequently several other megaclassification schemes ignored on the empire rank but maintained the kingdom monera consisting of bacteria such copeland in 1938 and whittaker in 1969 the latter classification system was widely followed in which robert whittaker proposed a five kingdom system for classification of living organisms whittaker's system placed most single celled organisms into either the prokaryotic monera or the eukaryotic protista the other three kingdoms in his system were the eukaryotic fungi animalia and plantae whittaker however did not believe that all his kingdoms were monophyletic whittaker subdiveded the kingdom into two branches containing several phyla
myxomonera branch
cyanophyta now called cyanobacteria
myxobacteria
mastigomonera branch
eubacteriae
actinomycota
spirochaetae
alternative commonly followed subdivision systems were based on gram stains this culminated in the gibbons and murray classification of 1978
gracilicutes (gram negative)
photobacteria (photosynthetic) class oxyphotobacteriae (water as electron acceptor includes the order cyanobacteriales = blue green algae now phylum cyanobacteria) and class anoxyphotobacteriae (anaerobic phototrophs orders rhodospirillales and chlorobiales
scotobacteria (non-photosynthetic now the proteobacteria and other gram negative nonphotosynthetic phyla)
firmacutes [sic] (gram positive subsequently corrected to firmicutes)
several orders such as bacillales and actinomycetales (now in the phylum actinobacteria)
mollicutes (gram variable e.g mycoplasma)
mendocutes (uneven gram stain methanogenic bacteria now known as the archaea)
=== three-domain systemedit ===
in 1977 a pnas paper by carl woese and george fox demonstrated that the archaea (initially called archaebacteria) are not significantly closer in relationship to the bacteria than they are to eukaryotes the paper received front-page coverage in the new york times and great controversy initially the conclusions have since become accepted leading to replacement of the kingdom monera with the two kingdoms bacteria and archaea a minority of scientists including thomas cavalier-smith continue to reject the widely accepted division between these two groups cavalier-smith has published classifications in which the archaebacteria are part of a subkingdom of the kingdom bacteria
== blue-green algaeedit ==
although it was generally accepted that one could distinguish prokaryotes from eukaryotes on the basis of the presence of a nucleus mitosis versus binary fission as a way of reproducing size and other traits the monophyly of the kingdom monera (or for that matter whether classification should be according to phylogeny) was controversial for many decades although distinguishing between prokaryotes from eukaryotes as a fundamental distinction is often credited to a 1937 paper by douard chatton (little noted until 1962) he did not emphasize this distinction more than other biologists of his era roger stanier and c b van niel believed that the bacteria (a term which at the time did not include blue-green algae) and the blue-green algae had a single origin a conviction which culminated in stanier writing in a letter in 1970 i think it is now quite evident that the blue-green algae are not distinguishable from bacteria by any fundamental feature of their cellular organization other researchers such as e g pringsheim writing in 1949 suspected separate origins for bacteria and blue-green algae in 1974 the influential bergey's manual published a new edition coining the term cyanobacteria to refer to what had been called blue-green algae marking the acceptance of this group within the monera
