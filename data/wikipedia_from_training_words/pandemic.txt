a pandemic (from greek pan all and demos people") is an epidemic of infectious disease that has spread through human populations across a large region for instance multiple continents or even worldwide a widespread endemic disease that is stable in terms of how many people are getting sick from it is not a pandemic further flu pandemics generally exclude recurrences of seasonal flu throughout history there have been a number of pandemics such as smallpox and tuberculosis the black death was a devastating pandemic killing over 75 million people more recent pandemics include the hiv pandemic as well as the 1918 and 2009 h1n1 pandemics
== definition and stages ==
a pandemic is an epidemic occurring on a scale which crosses international boundaries usually affecting a large number of people
the world health organization (who) has a six-stage classification that describes the process by which a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic this starts with the virus mostly infecting animals with a few cases where animals infect people then moves through the stage where the virus begins to spread directly between people and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread worldwide and it will be out of control until we stop it
a disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people it must also be infectious for instance cancer is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because the disease is not infectious or contagious
in a virtual press conference in may 2009 on the influenza pandemic dr keiji fukuda assistant director-general ad interim for health security and environment who said an easy way to think about pandemic is to say a pandemic is a global outbreak then you might ask yourself what is a global outbreak global outbreak means that we see both spread of the agent and then we see disease activities in addition to the spread of the virus.
in planning for a possible influenza pandemic the who published a document on pandemic preparedness guidance in 1999 revised in 2005 and in february 2009 defining phases and appropriate actions for each phase in an aide memoir entitled who pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase the 2009 revision including definitions of a pandemic and the phases leading to its declaration were finalized in february 2009 the pandemic h1n1 2009 virus was neither on the horizon at that time nor mentioned in the document all versions of this document refer to influenza the phases are defined by the spread of the disease virulence and mortality are not mentioned in the current who definition although these factors have previously been included
== current pandemics ==
=== hiv and aids ===
hiv originated in africa and spread to the united states via haiti between 1966 and 1972 aids is currently a pandemic with infection rates as high as 25% in southern and eastern africa in 2006 the hiv prevalence rate among pregnant women in south africa was 29.1% effective education about safer sexual practices and bloodborne infection precautions training have helped to slow down infection rates in several african countries sponsoring national education programs infection rates are rising again in asia and the americas the aids death toll in africa may reach 90100 million by 2025
== pandemics and notable epidemics through history ==
there have been a number of significant pandemics recorded in human history generally zoonoses which came about with domestication of animals such as influenza and tuberculosis there have been a number of particularly significant epidemics that deserve mention above the mere destruction of cities
plague of athens 430 bc possibly typhoid fever killed a quarter of the athenian troops and a quarter of the population over four years this disease fatally weakened the dominance of athens but the sheer virulence of the disease prevented its wider spread i.e it killed off its hosts at a rate faster than they could spread it the exact cause of the plague was unknown for many years in january 2006 researchers from the university of athens analyzed teeth recovered from a mass grave underneath the city and confirmed the presence of bacteria responsible for typhoid
antonine plague 165180 ad possibly smallpox brought to the italian peninsula by soldiers returning from the near east it killed a quarter of those infected and up to five million in all at the height of a second outbreak the plague of cyprian (251266) which may have been the same disease 5,000 people a day were said to be dying in rome
plague of justinian from 541 to 750 was the first recorded outbreak of the bubonic plague it started in egypt and reached constantinople the following spring killing (according to the byzantine chronicler procopius) 10,000 a day at its height and perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants the plague went on to eliminate a quarter to a half of the human population that it struck throughout the known world it caused europe's population to drop by around 50% between 550 and 700
black death from 1347 to 1453 the total number of deaths worldwide is estimated at 75 million people eight hundred years after the last outbreak the plague returned to europe starting in asia the disease reached mediterranean and western europe in 1348 (possibly from italian merchants fleeing fighting in crimea) and killed an estimated 20 to 30 million europeans in six years a third of the total population and up to a half in the worst-affected urban areas it was the first of a cycle of european plague epidemics that continued until the 18th century there were more than 100 plague epidemics in europe in this period the disease recurred in england every two to five years from 1361 to 1480 by the 1370s england's population was reduced by 50% the great plague of london of 166566 was the last major outbreak of the plague in england the disease killed approximately 100,000 people 20% of london's population
the third plague pandemic started in china in 1855 and spread to india where 10 million people died during this pandemic the united states saw its first outbreak the san francisco plague of 19001904 today isolated cases of plague are still found in the western united states
encounters between european explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence disease killed part of the native population of the canary islands in the 16th century (guanches) half the native population of hispaniola in 1518 was killed by smallpox smallpox also ravaged mexico in the 1520s killing 150,000 in tenochtitln alone including the emperor and peru in the 1530s aiding the european conquerors measles killed a further two million mexican natives in the 17th century in 16181619 smallpox wiped out 90% of the massachusetts bay native americans during the 1770s smallpox killed at least 30% of the pacific northwest native americans smallpox epidemics in 17801782 and 18371838 brought devastation and drastic depopulation among the plains indians some believe that the death of up to 95% of the native american population of the new world was caused by old world diseases such as smallpox measles and influenza over the centuries the europeans had developed high degrees of immunity to these diseases while the indigenous peoples had no such immunity
smallpox devastated the native population of australia killing around 50% of indigenous australians in the early years of british colonisation it also killed many new zealand mori as late as 184849 as many as 40,000 out of 150,000 hawaiians are estimated to have died of measles whooping cough and influenza introduced diseases notably smallpox nearly wiped out the native population of easter island in 1875 measles killed over 40,000 fijians approximately one-third of the population the disease devastated the andamanese population ainu population decreased drastically in the 19th century due in large part to infectious diseases brought by japanese settlers pouring into hokkaido
researchers concluded that syphilis was carried from the new world to europe after columbus voyages the findings suggested europeans could have carried the nonvenereal tropical bacteria home where the organisms may have mutated into a more deadly form in the different conditions of europe the disease was more frequently fatal than it is today syphilis was a major killer in europe during the renaissance between 1602 and 1796 the dutch east india company sent almost a million europeans to work in asia ultimately only less than one-third made their way back to europe the majority died of diseases disease killed more british soldiers in india than war
as early as 1803 the spanish crown organized a mission (the balmis expedition) to transport the smallpox vaccine to the spanish colonies and establish mass vaccination programs there by 1832 the federal government of the united states established a smallpox vaccination program for native americans from the beginning of the 20th century onwards the elimination or control of disease in tropical countries became a driving force for all colonial powers the sleeping sickness epidemic in africa was arrested due to mobile teams systematically screening millions of people at risk in the 20th century the world saw the biggest increase in its population in human history due to lessening of the mortality rate in many countries due to medical advances the world population has grown from 1.6 billion in 1900 to an estimated 7 billion today
=== cholera ===
since it became widespread in the 19th century cholera has killed tens of millions of people
first cholera pandemic 18161826 previously restricted to the indian subcontinent the pandemic began in bengal then spread across india by 1820 10,000 british troops and countless indians died during this pandemic it extended as far as china indonesia (where more than 100,000 people succumbed on the island of java alone) and the caspian sea before receding deaths in india between 1817 and 1860 are estimated to have exceeded 15 million persons another 23 million died between 1865 and 1917 russian deaths during a similar period exceeded 2 million
second cholera pandemic 18291851 reached russia (see cholera riots) hungary (about 100,000 deaths) and germany in 1831 london in 1832 (more than 55,000 persons died in the united kingdom) france canada (ontario) and united states (new york) in the same year and the pacific coast of north america by 1834 a two-year outbreak began in england and wales in 1848 and claimed 52,000 lives it is believed that over 150,000 americans died of cholera between 1832 and 1849
third pandemic 18521860 mainly affected russia with over a million deaths throughout spain cholera caused more than 236,000 deaths in 185455 it claimed 200,000 lives in mexico
fourth pandemic 18631875 spread mostly in europe and africa at least 30,000 of the 90,000 mecca pilgrims fell victim to the disease cholera claimed 90,000 lives in russia in 1866
in 1866 there was an outbreak in north america it killed some 50,000 americans
fifth pandemic 18811896 the 18831887 epidemic cost 250,000 lives in europe and at least 50,000 in americas cholera claimed 267,890 lives in russia (1892) 120,000 in spain 90,000 in japan and 60,000 in persia
in 1892 cholera contaminated the water supply of hamburg and caused 8,606 deaths
sixth pandemic 18991923 had little effect in europe because of advances in public health but russia was badly affected again (more than 500,000 people dying of cholera during the first quarter of the 20th century) the sixth pandemic killed more than 800,000 in india the 19021904 cholera epidemic claimed over 200,000 lives in the philippines
seventh pandemic 196266 began in indonesia called el tor after the strain and reached bangladesh in 1963 india in 1964 and the ussr in 1966
=== influenza ===
the greek physician hippocrates the father of medicine first described influenza in 412 bc
the first influenza pandemic was recorded in 1580 and since then influenza pandemics occurred every 10 to 30 years
the 18891890 flu pandemic also known as russian flu was first reported in may 1889 in bukhara uzbekistan by october it had reached tomsk and the caucasus it rapidly spread west and hit north america in december 1889 south america in februaryapril 1890 india in februarymarch 1890 and australia in marchapril 1890 the h3n8 and h2n2 subtypes of the influenza a virus have each been identified as possible causes it had a very high attack and mortality rate causing around a million fatalities
the spanish flu 19181919 first identified early in march 1918 in us troops training at camp funston kansas by october 1918 it had spread to become a worldwide pandemic on all continents and eventually infected about one-third of the world's population (or 500 million persons) unusually deadly and virulent it ended nearly as quickly as it began vanishing completely within 18 months in six months some 50 million were dead some estimates put the total of those killed worldwide at over twice that number about 17 million died in india 675,000 in the united states and 200,000 in the uk the virus was recently reconstructed by scientists at the cdc studying remains preserved by the alaskan permafrost the h1n1 virus has a small but crucial structure that is similar to the spanish flu
the asian flu 195758 an h2n2 virus caused about 70,000 deaths in the united states first identified in china in late february 1957 the asian flu spread to the united states by june 1957 it caused about 2 million deaths globally
the hong kong flu 196869 an h3n2 caused about 34,000 deaths in the united states this virus was first detected in hong kong in early 1968 and spread to the united states later that year this pandemic of 1968 and 1969 killed approximately one million people worldwide influenza a (h3n2) viruses still circulate today
=== typhus ===
typhus is sometimes called camp fever because of its pattern of flaring up in times of strife (it is also known as gaol fever and ship fever for its habits of spreading wildly in cramped quarters such as jails and ships.) emerging during the crusades it had its first impact in europe in 1489 in spain during fighting between the christian spaniards and the muslims in granada the spanish lost 3,000 to war casualties and 20,000 to typhus in 1528 the french lost 18,000 troops in italy and lost supremacy in italy to the spanish in 1542 30,000 soldiers died of typhus while fighting the ottomans in the balkans
during the thirty years war (16181648) about 8 million germans were killed by bubonic plague and typhus the disease also played a major role in the destruction of napoleon's grande arme in russia in 1812 during the retreat from moscow more french military personnel died of typhus than were killed by the russians of the 450,000 soldiers who crossed the neman on 25 june 1812 fewer than 40,000 returned more military personnel were killed from 15001914 by typhus than from military action in early 1813 napoleon raised a new army of 500,000 to replace his russian losses in the campaign of that year over 219,000 of napoleon's soldiers died of typhus typhus played a major factor in the irish potato famine during world war i typhus epidemics killed over 150,000 in serbia there were about 25 million infections and 3 million deaths from epidemic typhus in russia from 1918 to 1922 typhus also killed numerous prisoners in the nazi concentration camps and soviet prisoner of war camps during world war ii more than 3.5 million soviet pows died out of the 5.7 million in nazi custody
=== smallpox ===
smallpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the variola virus the disease killed an estimated 400,000 europeans per year during the closing years of the 18th century during the 20th century it is estimated that smallpox was responsible for 300500 million deaths as recently as the early 1950s an estimated 50 million cases of smallpox occurred in the world each year after successful vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries the who certified the eradication of smallpox in december 1979 to this day smallpox is the only human infectious disease to have been completely eradicated and one of two infectious viruses ever to be eradicated
=== measles ===
historically measles was prevalent throughout the world as it is highly contagious according to the national immunization program 90% of people were infected with measles by age 15 before the vaccine was introduced in 1963 there were an estimated 34 million cases in the u.s each year measles killed around 200 million people worldwide over the last 150 years in 2000 alone measles killed some 777,000 worldwide out of 40 million cases globally
measles is an endemic disease meaning that it has been continually present in a community and many people develop resistance in populations that have not been exposed to measles exposure to a new disease can be devastating in 1529 a measles outbreak in cuba killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived smallpox the disease had ravaged mexico central america and the inca civilization
=== tuberculosis ===
one-third of the world's current population has been infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis and new infections occur at a rate of one per second about 510% of these latent infections will eventually progress to active disease which if left untreated kills more than half of its victims annually 8 million people become ill with tuberculosis and 2 million people die from the disease worldwide in the 19th century tuberculosis killed an estimated one-quarter of the adult population of europe by 1918 one in six deaths in france were still caused by tb during the 20th century tuberculosis killed approximately 100 million people tb is still one of the most important health problems in the developing world
=== leprosy ===
leprosy also known as wopats or hansen's disease is caused by a bacillus mycobacterium leprae it is a chronic disease with an incubation period of up to five years since 1985 15 million people worldwide have been cured of leprosy
historically leprosy has affected people since at least 600 bc leprosy outbreaks began to occur in western europe around 1000 ad numerous leprosaria or leper hospitals sprang up in the middle ages matthew paris estimated that in the early 13th century there were 19,000 across europe
=== malaria ===
malaria is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions including parts of the americas asia and africa each year there are approximately 350500 million cases of malaria drug resistance poses a growing problem in the treatment of malaria in the 21st century since resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs except for the artemisinins
malaria was once common in most of europe and north america where it is now for all purposes non-existent malaria may have contributed to the decline of the roman empire the disease became known as roman fever plasmodium falciparum became a real threat to colonists and indigenous people alike when it was introduced into the americas along with the slave trade malaria devastated the jamestown colony and regularly ravaged the south and midwest by 1830 it had reached the pacific northwest during the american civil war there were over 1.2 million cases of malaria among soldiers of both sides the southern u.s continued to be afflicted with millions of cases of malaria into the 1930s
=== yellow fever ===
yellow fever has been a source of several devastating epidemics cities as far north as new york philadelphia and boston were hit with epidemics in 1793 one of the largest yellow fever epidemics in u.s history killed as many as 5,000 people in philadelphiaroughly 10% of the population about half of the residents had fled the city including president george washington in colonial times west africa became known as the white man's grave because of malaria and yellow fever
== concern about possible future pandemics ==
=== viral hemorrhagic fevers ===
viral hemorrhagic fevers such as ebola virus disease lassa fever virus rift valley fever marburg virus and bolivian hemorrhagic fever are highly contagious and deadly diseases with the theoretical potential to become pandemics their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited however as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected vector and the vector only has a short time before death or serious illness furthermore the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly quarantine vectors and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere genetic mutations could occur which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited
=== antibiotic resistance ===
antibiotic-resistant microorganisms sometimes referred to as superbugs may contribute to the re-emergence of diseases which are currently well controlled for example cases of tuberculosis that are resistant to traditionally effective treatments remain a cause of great concern to health professionals every year nearly half a million new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (mdr-tb) are estimated to occur worldwide china and india have the highest rate of multidrug-resistant tb the world health organization (who) reports that approximately 50 million people worldwide are infected with mdr tb with 79 percent of those cases resistant to three or more antibiotics in 2005 124 cases of mdr tb were reported in the united states extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (xdr tb) was identified in africa in 2006 and subsequently discovered to exist in 49 countries including the united states there are about 40,000 new cases of xdr-tb per year the who estimates
in the past 20 years common bacteria including staphylococcus aureus serratia marcescens and enterococcus have developed resistance to various antibiotics such as vancomycin as well as whole classes of antibiotics such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins antibiotic-resistant organisms have become an important cause of healthcare-associated (nosocomial) infections (hai) in addition infections caused by community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in otherwise healthy individuals have become more frequent in recent years
=== sars ===
in 2003 the italian physician carlo urbani (1956-2003) was to the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) as a new and dangerously contagious disease although he became infected and died it is caused by a coronavirus dubbed sars-cov rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the world health organization helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic however the disease has not been eradicated it could re-emerge this warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia
=== influenza ===
wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of influenza a viruses occasionally viruses are transmitted from these species to other species and may then cause outbreaks in domestic poultry or rarely in humans
==== h5n1 (avian flu) ====
in february 2004 avian influenza virus was detected in birds in vietnam increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains it is feared that if the avian influenza virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human) the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal in humans such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic similar to the spanish flu or the lower mortality pandemics such as the asian flu and the hong kong flu
from october 2004 to february 2005 some 3,700 test kits of the 1957 asian flu virus were accidentally spread around the world from a lab in the us
in may 2005 scientists urgently called upon nations to prepare for a global influenza pandemic that could strike as much as 20% of the world's population
in october 2005 cases of the avian flu (the deadly strain h5n1) were identified in turkey eu health commissioner markos kyprianou said we have received now confirmation that the virus found in turkey is an avian flu h5n1 virus there is a direct relationship with viruses found in russia mongolia and china. cases of bird flu were also identified shortly thereafter in romania and then greece possible cases of the virus have also been found in croatia bulgaria and the united kingdom
by november 2007 numerous confirmed cases of the h5n1 strain had been identified across europe however by the end of october only 59 people had died as a result of h5n1 which was atypical of previous influenza pandemics
avian flu cannot yet be categorized as a pandemic because the virus cannot yet cause sustained and efficient human-to-human transmission cases so far are recognized to have been transmitted from bird to human but as of december 2006 there have been very few (if any) cases of proven human-to-human transmission regular influenza viruses establish infection by attaching to receptors in the throat and lungs but the avian influenza virus can only attach to receptors located deep in the lungs of humans requiring close prolonged contact with infected patients and thus limiting person-to-person transmission
=== ebola virus ===
see ebola virus epidemic in west africa
== biological warfare ==
in 1346 the bodies of mongol warriors who had died of plague were thrown over the walls of the besieged crimean city of kaffa (now theodosia) after a protracted siege during which the mongol army under jani beg was suffering the disease they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls to infect the inhabitants it has been speculated that this operation may have been responsible for the arrival of the black death in europe
the native american population was devastated after contact with the old world by introduction of many fatal diseases in a well documented case of germ warfare involving british commander jeffrey amherst and swiss-british officer colonel henry bouquet their correspondence included a proposal and agreement to give smallpox-infected blankets to indians in order to extirpate this execreble race during the siege of fort pitt late in the french and indian war as recorded in his journal by sundries trader and militia captain william trent on june 24 1763 dignitaries from the delaware tribe met with fort pitt officials warned them of great numbers of indians coming to attack the fort and pleaded with them to leave the fort while there was still time the commander of the fort refused to abandon the fort instead the british gave as gifts two blankets one silk handkerchief and one linen from the smallpox hospital to two delaware indian dignitaries a devastating smallpox epidemic plagued native american tribes in the ohio valley and great lakes area through 1763 and 1764 but the effectiveness of individual instances of biological warfare remains unknown after extensive review of surviving documentary evidence historian francis jennings concluded the attempt at biological warfare was unquestionably effective at fort pitt smallpox after pontiac's rebellion killed 400,000500,000 (possibly even up to 1.5 million) native americans
during the sino-japanese war (19371945) unit 731 of the imperial japanese army conducted human experimentation on thousands mostly chinese in military campaigns the japanese army used biological weapons on chinese soldiers and civilians plague fleas infected clothing and infected supplies encased in bombs were dropped on various targets the resulting cholera anthrax and plague were estimated to have killed around 400,000 chinese civilians
diseases considered for or known to be used as a weapon include anthrax ebola marburg virus plague cholera typhus rocky mountain spotted fever tularemia brucellosis q fever machupo coccidioides mycosis glanders melioidosis shigella psittacosis japanese b encephalitis rift valley fever yellow fever and smallpox
spores of weaponized anthrax were accidentally released from a military facility near the soviet closed city of sverdlovsk in 1979 the sverdlovsk anthrax leak is sometimes called biological chernobyl in january 2009 an al-qaeda training camp in algeria was reportedly wiped out by the plague killing approximately 40 islamic extremists some experts said that the group was developing biological weapons however a couple of days later the algerian health ministry flatly denied this rumour stating no case of plague of any type has been recorded in any region of algeria since 2003
