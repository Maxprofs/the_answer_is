definitions
atomic molecular masses usually obtained relative mass isotope c carbon definition equal example molecular weight methane whose molecular formula ch calculated follows
proper term would relative molecular mass however adjective relative omitted universally assumed atomic molecular masses relative mass c relative atomic molecular mass values dimensionless given unit dalton formerly atomic mass unit indicate number equal mass one molecule divided mass one atom c mass mol substance designated molar mass definition unit gram
example atomic weight carbon given naturally occurring carbon mixture isotopes c c c relative atomic masses respectively moreover proportion isotopes varies samples average value contrast less variation naturally occurring hydrogen average atomic weight known precisely precision molecular mass determined precision least precise atomic mass value case carbon highresolution mass spectrometry isotopomers ch ch observed distinct molecules molecular weights respectively intensity massspectrometry peaks proportional isotopic abundances molecular species c h h also observed molecular weight
determination molecular mass
mass spectrometry
mass spectrometry molecular mass small molecule usually reported monoisotopic mass mass molecule containing common isotope element note also differs subtly molecular mass choice isotopes defined thus single specific molecular mass many possible masses used compute monoisotopic molecular mass found table isotopic masses found typical periodic table average molecular mass often used larger molecules since molecules many atoms unlikely composed exclusively abundant isotope element theoretical average molecular mass calculated using relative atomic masses found typical periodic table since likely statistical distribution atoms representing isotopes throughout molecule however may differ true average molecular mass sample due natural artificial variations isotopic distributions
hydrodynamic methods
first approximation basis determination molecular weight according markhouwink relations fact intrinsic viscosity solutions suspensions macromolecules depends volumetric proportion dispersed particles particular solvent specifically hydrodynamic size related molecular weight depends conversion factor describing shape particular molecule allows apparent molecular weight described range techniques sensitive hydrodynamic effects including dls sec also known gpc viscometry apparent hydrodynamic size used approximate molecular weight using series macromoleculespecific standards requires calibration frequently described relative molecular weight determination method
static light scattering
also possible determine absolute molecular weight directly light scattering traditionally using zimm method accomplished either via classical static light scattering via multiangle light scattering detectors molecular weights determined method require calibration hence term absolute external measurement required refractive index increment describes change refractive index concentration
