though considering the game pretty darn tough, ign praised the game's variety and length it also praised the sound and graphics though the latter was a source of criticism incoming's got it all but it all comes at a high price getting this game to run on our pcs was one big pain in the butt. despite calling it an outstanding-looking and great playing game, ign only gave the game a decent 7.0/10 because of the system problems conversely gamespot's review noted none of these hardware issues praising the visuals as some of the finest of any action game the reviewer however described the game design as strong yet slightly flawed [it] definitely pulls you in but leaves a little to be desired as far as keeping you there, complaining that what [the developer] have presented gets tiresome quickly. rating the game 7.8/10 gamespot summarised the game as a fine game and a definite must-have for arcade fans what it lacks is a realization that computer games have moved beyond this simplistic style of gameplay
the dreamcast port of incoming received a mixed reaction from critics with a game rankings average score of 63% ign opened their review by saying that although the game is lacking in many areas there's more than enough here for the hardcore shooting fans out there to have their requisite blast of shooting action. though criticizing the graphics ability to get in the way at times, the very vague mission briefings and the odd flying model for the planes, the reviewer conceded that if you're a hardcore shooting fan and you're looking for a good challenge you'll probably want to look into incoming. the game was given as score of 7.0/10 gamespy's review was harsher describing the plot as the same recycled garbage used in tons of other games of this type, the multiplayer split screen mode as lame and the objectives as mundane. the reviewer also noted graphical issues clipping problems and poor controls though dismissing the graphics as a bit dated, the reviewer did acknowledge the nifty special effects. giving the game a score of 6/10 it was admitted that incoming may be worth a rental [it] is only slightly better than mediocre.
in a rare positive review for the dreamcast version gamevortex rated the game 9/10 the reviewer described the visuals as some of the most breathtaking visuals you'll find in any game. though describing the multiplayer as fun it considered by far the best [mode to be] campaign mode. the review concluded by describing the game as lots of fun and highly recommended.
