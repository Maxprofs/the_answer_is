clarke's three laws are three laws of prediction formulated by the british science fiction writer arthur c clarke they are
when a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible he is almost certainly right when he states that something is impossible he is very probably wrong
the only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible
any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
== origins ==
clarke's first law was proposed by clarke in the essay hazards of prophecy the failure of imagination in profiles of the future (1962)
the second law is offered as a simple observation in the same essay its status as clarke's second law was conferred by others in a 1973 revision of profiles of the future clarke acknowledged the second law and proposed the third as three laws were good enough for newton i have modestly decided to stop there
the third law is the best known and most widely cited and appears in clarke's 1973 revision of hazards of prophecy the failure of imagination it echoes a statement in a 1942 story by leigh brackett witchcraft to the ignorant  simple science to the learned an earlier example of this sentiment may be found in wild talents (1932) by the author charles fort where he makes the statement ...a performance that may some day be considered understandable but that in these primitive times so transcends what is said to be the known that it is what i mean by magic. even earlier rider haggard's novel she (1886) expresses the sentiment multiple times such as in chapter 17 fear not my holly i shall use no magic have i not told thee that there is no such thing as magic though there is such a thing as understanding and applying the forces which are in nature?
a fourth law has been added to the canon despite clarke's declared intention of not going one better than newton geoff holder quotes for every expert there is an equal and opposite expert in his book 101 things to do with a stone circle (the history press 2009) and offers as his source clarke's profiles of the future (new edition 1999)
== third law and variants ==
clarke's third law ("any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic") has inspired many snowclones and other variations
any sufficiently advanced act of benevolence is indistinguishable from malevolence (referring to artificial intelligence)
any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice (grey's law) (hanlon's razor)
any sufficiently advanced cluelessness is indistinguishable from malice (clark's law)
any sufficiently advanced troll is indistinguishable from a genuine kook (morgan's maxim)
any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from a rigged demo
one contrapositive of clarke's third law is
any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced (gehm's corollary)
clarke's third law has been
reversed for fictional universes involving magic any sufficiently analyzed magic is indistinguishable from science!
expanded for fictional universes focusing on science fiction any technology no matter how primitive is magic to those who don't understand it.
used to refer to unexplained archaeological finds and reconstructions of folk mysticism any sufficiently ancient recovered wisdom or artifact is also indistinguishable from magic.
