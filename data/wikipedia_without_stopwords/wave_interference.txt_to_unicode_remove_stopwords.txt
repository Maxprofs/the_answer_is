mechanism
principle superposition waves states two propagating waves type incident point total displacement point equal pointwise sum displacements individual waves crest wave meets crest another wave frequency point magnitude displacement sum individual magnitudes constructive interference crest one wave meets trough another wave magnitude displacements equal difference individual magnitudes known destructive interference
constructive interference occurs phase difference waves multiple whereas destructive interference occurs difference odd multiple difference phases intermediate two extremes magnitude displacement summed waves lies minimum maximum values
consider example happens two identical stones dropped still pool water different locations stone generates circular wave propagating outwards point stone dropped two waves overlap net displacement particular point sum displacements individual waves points phase produce maximum displacement places waves antiphase net displacement points thus parts surface stationarythese seen figure right stationary bluegreen lines radiating center
two plane waves
simple form interference pattern obtained two plane waves frequency intersect angle interference essentially energy redistribution process energy lost destructive interference regained constructive interference one wave travelling horizontally travelling downwards angle first wave assuming two waves phase point b relative phase changes along xaxis phase difference point given
seen two waves phase
half cycle phase
constructive interference occurs waves phase destructive interference half cycle phase thus interference fringe pattern produced separation maxima
df known fringe spacing fringe spacing increases increase wavelength decreasing angle
fringes observed wherever two waves overlap fringe spacing uniform throughout
two spherical waves
point source produces spherical wave light two point sources overlaps interference pattern maps way phase difference two waves varies space depends wavelength separation point sources figure right shows interference two spherical waves wavelength increases top bottom distance sources increases left right
plane observation far enough away fringe pattern series almost straight lines since waves almost planar
multiple beams
interference occurs several waves added together provided phase differences remain constant observation time
sometimes desirable several waves frequency amplitude sum zero interfere destructively cancel principle behind example phase power diffraction grating cases result achieved uniform spacing phases
easy see set waves cancel amplitude phases spaced equally angle using phasors wave represented waves
show
one merely assumes converse multiplies sides
fabryprot interferometer uses interference multiple reflections
diffraction grating considered multiplebeam interferometer since peaks produces generated interference light transmitted elements grating see interference vs diffraction discussion
optical interference
frequency light waves hz high detected currently available detectors possible observe intensity optical interference pattern intensity light given point proportional square average amplitude wave expressed mathematically follows displacement two waves point r
represents magnitude displacement represents phase represents angular frequency
displacement summed waves
intensity light r given
expressed terms intensities individual waves
thus interference pattern maps difference phase two waves maxima occurring phase difference multiple two beams equal intensity maxima four times bright individual beams minima zero intensity
two waves must polarization give rise interference fringes since possible waves different polarizations cancel one another add together instead waves different polarization added together give rise wave different polarization state
light source requirements
discussion assumes waves interfere one another monochromatic ie single frequencythis requires infinite time however either practical necessary two identical waves finite duration whose frequency fixed period give rise interference pattern overlap two identical waves consist narrow spectrum frequency waves finite duration give series fringe patterns slightly differing spacings provided spread spacings significantly less average fringe spacing fringe pattern observed time two waves overlap
conventional light sources emit waves differing frequencies different times different points source light split two waves recombined individual light wave may generate interference pattern half individual fringe patterns generated different phases spacings normally overall fringe pattern observable however singleelement light sources sodium mercuryvapor lamps emission lines quite narrow frequency spectra spatially colour filtered split two waves superimposed generate interference fringes interferometry prior invention laser done using sources wide range successful applications
laser beam generally approximates much closely monochromatic source much straightforward generate interference fringes using laser ease interference fringes observed laser beam sometimes cause problems stray reflections may give spurious interference fringes result errors
normally single laser beam used interferometry though interference observed using two independent lasers whose frequencies sufficiently matched satisfy phase requirements
also possible observe interference fringes using white light white light fringe pattern considered made spectrum fringe patterns slightly different spacing fringe patterns phase centre fringes increase size wavelength decreases summed intensity show three four fringes varying colour young describes elegantly discussion two slit interference fine examples white light fringes seen since white light fringes obtained two waves travelled equal distances light source useful interferometry allow zero path difference fringe identified
