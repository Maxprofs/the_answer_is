in linguistics definiteness is a semantic feature of noun phrases (nps) distinguishing between referents/entities that are identifiable in a given context (definite noun phrases) and entities which are not (indefinite noun phrases) in english for example definite noun phrases preclude asking which one?
there is considerable variation in the expression of definiteness across languages and some languages do not express it at all for example in english definiteness is usually marked by the selection of determiner certain determiners such as a/an many any either and some typically mark an np as indefinite others including the this every and both mark the np as definite in some other languages the marker is a clitic that attaches phonologically to the noun (and often to modifying adjectives) e.g the hebrew definite article ha- or the arabic definite article al- in yet other languages definiteness is indicated by affixes on the noun or on modifying adjectives much like the expression of grammatical number and grammatical case in these languages the inflections indicating definiteness may be quite complex in the germanic languages and balto-slavic languages for example (as still in modern german and lithuanian) there are two paradigms for adjectives one used in definite noun phrases and the other used in indefinite noun phrases in some languages e.g hungarian definiteness is marked on the verb
== use in different languages ==
examples are
phrasal clitic as in basque cf emakume ("woman") emakume-a (woman-art the woman") emakume ederr-a (woman beautiful-art the beautiful woman") romanian om ("man") om-ul (man-art the man") om-ul bun (man-art good the good man") or bun-ul om (good-art man the good man")
noun affix as in albanian djal ("boy") djal-i (man-art the boy") djal-i i madh (man-art elder the elder son") vajz ("girl") vajz-a (man-art the girl") vajz-a e bukur (man-art pretty the pretty girl")
prefix on both noun and adjective arabic (al-kitb al-kabr) with two instances of al- (def-book-def-big literally the book the big")
distinct verbal forms as in hungarian olvasok egy knyvet (read-1sg.pres.indef a book-acc.sg i read a book") versus olvasom a knyvet (read-1sg.pres.def the book-acc.sg i read the book")
germanic romance celtic semitic and auxiliary languages generally have a definite article sometimes used as a postposition many other languages do not some examples are chinese japanese finnish and modern slavic languages except bulgarian and macedonian when necessary languages of this kind may indicate definiteness by other means such as demonstratives
it is common for definiteness to interact with the marking of case in certain syntactic contexts in many languages direct objects (dos) receive distinctive marking only if they are definite for example in turkish the do in the sentence adamlar grdm (meaning i saw the men") is marked with the suffix - (indicating definiteness) the absence of the suffix means that the do is indefinite ("i saw men")
in serbo-croatian (and in the baltic languages latvian and lithuanian) and to a lesser extent in slovene definiteness can be expressed morphologically on prenominal adjectives the short form of the adjective is interpreted as indefinite while the long form is definite and/or specific
short (indefinite) serbo-croatian nov grad a new city lithuanian balta knyga a white book
long (definite) novi grad the new city a certain new city baltoji knyga the white book a certain white book
in japanese a language which indicates noun functions with postpositions the topic marker (wa) may include definiteness for example (uma wa) can mean the horse while (uma ga) can mean a horse
in some languages the definiteness of the object affects the transitivity of the verb in the absence of peculiar specificity marking it also tends to affect the telicity of mono-occasional predications
== grammatical state ==
the morphological category corresponding to definiteness in the semitic languages is known as grammatical state state is a property of the inflection of nouns much like number and case and adjectives must agree in state with their associated noun just like they agree in number gender and case the semitic languages have three values for grammatical state indefinite definite and construct indefinite and definite state function much as elsewhere the construct state is specifically used of a definite noun that is modified by another noun in a genitive construction typically no other element can intervene between construct-state noun and modifying genitival noun and the two often function as a phonological unit in arabic for example the feminine ending of nouns in the construct state has a special sandhi form -at-
