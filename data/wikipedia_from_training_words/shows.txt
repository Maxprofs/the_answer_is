the xeric foundation is a private nonprofit corporation based in northampton massachusetts which for twenty years awarded self-publishing grants to comic book creators as well as qualified charitable and nonprofit organizations the xeric foundation was established by peter laird co-creator of the teenage mutant ninja turtles
== mission and operation ==
laird founded the foundation after considerable thought as an appropriate way to give back something extra to the comics world, by providing grants for self-publishers laird stated that the xeric foundation is actually two foundations in one one half of it is for charitable organizations and the other half is for creators who want to self-publish their comics. that latter half being what the foundation is best known for
=== self-publishing grants ===
the xeric foundation supported work of an alternative or non-"mainstream nature reasoning that if a comic had strong commercial appeal it would be picked up by one of the major publishers the foundation was an extremely valuable supporter of art for art's sake comics and helped launch the careers of a number of literary cartoonists
the foundation assisted comic book creators with some of the costs in self-publishing their work it was not the foundation's intention to fully support an artist/writer through the entire process of self-publishing but rather to encourage creators to experience the learning process involved in working towards such a goal
the creative side of the foundation involved the usual application process but in addition the foundation began with an advisory committee made up of three  people working in the industry whose input is sought on how best to proceed with each application submissions were evaluated prior to laird's involvement and then he made the ultimate decisions based on their recommendations
== history ==
laird founded the xeric foundation in 1992 the name originat[ing] out of a scrabble game with [laird's] brother don, xeric simply being a word [he] like[d], ostensibly meaning dry and desertlike but which ultimately has absolutely no direct connection with the foundation.
the foundation's first grant cycle was in september 1992 with the first recipients being robert eaton michael kasper jeff nicholson and wayne wise & fred wheaton
in 1993 laird discussed the foundation's projected lifespan
he hoped that ultimately the figure can be raised from thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars, to support an increasing number of large and small projects
in july 2011 the foundation announced it would no longer award publishing grants instead focusing on charitable work including fostering environmentalism literacy and the arts citing the changing nature of the comics industry and specifically the ability of cartoonists to publish their work online founder laird announced the shift according to the organization's website one round of final grants will be awarded in 2012 giving applicants until may 2012 to complete their work (the foundation cancelled the scheduled november 2011 review.)
altogether the xeric foundation has awarded in excess of $2,500,000 since its first grant cycle
