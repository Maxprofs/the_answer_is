vertebrates vrtbrts comprise species animals within subphylum vertebrata chordates backbones vertebrates represent overwhelming majority phylum chordata currently species described vertebrates include jawless fish jawed vertebrates includes cartilaginous fish sharks rays bony fish bony fish clade known lobefinned fishes included tetrapods divided amphibians reptiles mammals birds extant vertebrates range size frog species paedophryne amauensis little mm blue whale m ft vertebrates make described animal species rest invertebrates lack vertebral columns
vertebrates traditionally include hagfish proper vertebrae though closest living relatives lampreys hagfish however possess cranium reason vertebrate subphylum sometimes referred craniata discussing morphology molecular analysis since suggested hagfish closely related lampreys also vertebrates monophyletic sense others consider sister group vertebrates common taxon craniata
etymology
word vertebrate derives latin word vertebratus pliny meaning joint spine closely related word vertebra refers bones segments spinal column
anatomy morphology
vertebrates built along basic chordate body plan stiff rod running length animal vertebral column notochord hollow tube nervous tissue spinal cord gastrointestinal tract vertebrates mouth found right anterior end animal anus opens exterior end body remaining part body continuing anus forms tail vertebrae spinal cord gut
vertebral column
defining characteristic vertebrate vertebral column notochord stiff rod uniform composition found chordates replaced segmented series stiffer elements vertebrae separated mobile joints intervertebral discs derived embryonically evolutionarily notochord however vertebrates secondarily lost anatomy retaining notochord adulthood sturgeon latimeria jawed vertebrates typified paired appendages fins legs may secondarily lost part definition vertebrates whole
gills
basal vertebrates breathe gills gills carried right behind head bordering posterior margins series openings esophagus exterior gill supported cartilagenous bony gill arch bony fish three pairs arches cartilaginous fish five seven pairs primitive jawless fish seven vertebrate ancestor doubt arches chordate relatives pairs gills
amphibians primitive bony fishes larvae bear external gills branching gill arches reduced adulthood function taken gills proper fishes lungs amphibians amphibians retain external larval gills adulthood complex internal gill system seen fish apparently irrevocably lost early evolution tetrapods
higher vertebrates gills gill arches form fetal development lay basis essential structures jaws thyroid gland larynx columella corresponding stapes mammals mammals malleus incus
central nervous system
central nervous system vertebrates based hollow nerve cord running along length animal particular importance unique vertebrates presence neural crest cells progenitors stem cells critical coordinating functions cellular components neural crest cells migrate body nerve cord development initiate formation neural ganglia structures jaws skull
vertebrates chordate group exhibit cephalisation concentration brain functions head slight swelling anterior end nerve cord found lancelet though lacks eyes complex sense organs comparable vertebrates chordates show trends towards cephalisation
peripheral nervous system branches nerve cord innervate various systems front end nerve tube expanded thickening walls expansion central canal spinal cord three primary brain vesicles prosencephalon forebrain mesencephalon midbrain rhombencephalon hindbrain differentiated various vertebrate groups two laterally placed eyes form around outgrowths midbrain except hagfish though may secondary loss forebrain well developed subdivided tetrapods midbrain dominate many fish salamanders vesicles forebrain usually paired giving rise hemispheres like cerebral hemispheres mammals
resulting anatomy central nervous system single hollow nerve cord topped series often paired vesicles unique vertebrates invertebrates welldeveloped brains insects spiders squids ventral rather dorsal system ganglions split brain stem running side mouth gut
evolutionary history
first vertebrates
vertebrates originated million years ago cambrian explosion saw rise organism diversity earliest known vertebrate believed myllokunmingia another early vertebrate haikouichthys ercaicunensis unlike fauna dominated cambrian groups basic vertebrate body plan notochord rudimentary vertebrae welldefined head tail early vertebrates lacked jaws common sense relied filter feeding close seabed vertebrate group uncertain phylogeny smalleellike conodonts known microfossils paired tooth segments late cambrian end triassic
fish amphibians
first jawed vertebrates appeared latest ordovician became common devonian often known age fishes two groups bony fishes actinopterygii sarcopterygii evolved became common devonian also saw demise virtually jawless fishes save lampreys hagfish well placodermi group armoured fish dominated entirety period since late silurian devonian also saw rise first labyrinthodonts transitional form fishes amphibians
mesozoic vertebrates
amniotes branched labyrinthodonts subsequent carboniferous period parareptilia synapsid amniotes common late paleozoic diapsids became dominant mesozoic sea bony fishes became dominant birds derived form dinosaurs evolved jurassic demise non avian dinosaurs end cretaceous allowed expansion mammals evolved therapsids group synapsid amniotes late triassic period
mesozoic
cenozoic world seen great diversification bony fishes frogs birds mammals

classification
several ways classifying animals evolutionary systematics relies anatomy physiology evolutionary history determined similarities anatomy possible genetics organisms phylogenetic classification based solely phylogeny evolutionary systematics gives overview phylogenetic systematics gives detail two systems thus complementary rather opposed
traditional classification
conventional classification living vertebrates grouped seven classes based traditional interpretations gross anatomical physiological traits classification one commonly encountered school textbooks overviews nonspecialist popular works extant vertebrates
subphylum vertebrata
class agnatha jawless fishes
class chondrichthyes cartilaginous fishes
class osteichthyes bony fishes
class amphibia amphibians
class reptilia reptiles
class aves birds
class mammalia mammals
addition comes two classes extinct armoured fishes placodermi acanthodii ways classifying vertebrates devised particularly emphasis phylogeny early amphibians reptiles example based janvier shu et al benton given
subphylum vertebrata
palaeospondylus
superclass agnatha cephalaspidomorphi lampreys jawless fishes
infraphylum gnathostomata vertebrates jaws
class placodermi extinct armoured fishes
class chondrichthyes cartilaginous fishes
class acanthodii extinct spiny sharks
superclass osteichthyes bony vertebrates
class actinopterygii rayfinned bony fishes
class sarcopterygii lobefinned fishes tetrapods inside class
class amphibia amphibians ancestral amniotes paraphyletic group
class synapsida mammals placed inside thought extinct taxon
class sauropsida reptiles birds inside group monophyletic way
traditional classification orderly groups paraphyletic ie contain descendants class common ancestor instance descendants first reptiles include modern reptiles well mammals birds classes listed complete therefore paraphyletic taxa meaning include descendants first representative group example agnathans given rise jawed vertebrates bony fishes given rise land vertebrates traditional amphibians given rise reptiles traditionally including synapsids mammallike reptiles turn given rise mammals birds scientists working vertebrates use classification based purely phylogeny organized known evolutionary history sometimes disregarding conventional interpretations anatomy physiology
phylogenetic relationships
phylogenetic taxonomy relationships animals typically divided ranks illustrated nested family tree known cladogram phylogenetic groups given definitions based relationship one another rather purely physical traits presence backbone nesting pattern often combined traditional taxonomy practice known evolutionary taxonomy
cladogram presented based studies compiled philippe janvier others tree life web project
number extant species
number described vertebrate species split evenly tetrapods fish following table lists number described extant species vertebrate class estimated iucn red list threatened species
iucn estimates extant invertebrate species described means less described animal species world vertebrates
