oil spill release liquid petroleum hydrocarbon environment especially marine areas due human activity form pollution term usually applied marine oil spills oil released ocean coastal waters spills may also occur land oil spills may due releases crude oil tankers offshore platforms drilling rigs wells well spills refined petroleum products gasoline diesel byproducts heavier fuels used large ships bunker fuel spill oily refuse waste oil
oil spills penetrate structure plumage birds fur mammals reducing insulating ability making vulnerable temperature fluctuations much less buoyant water cleanup recovery oil spill difficult depends upon many factors including type oil spilled temperature water affecting evaporation biodegradation types shorelines beaches involved spills may take weeks months even years clean

cleanup recoveryedit
cleanup recovery oil spill difficult depends upon many factors including type oil spilled temperature water affecting evaporation biodegradation types shorelines beaches involved
methods cleaning include
bioremediation use microorganisms biological agents break remove oil bacteria alcanivorax methylocella silvestris
bioremediation accelerator oleophilic hydrophobic chemical containing bacteria chemically physically bonds soluble insoluble hydrocarbons bioremediation accelerator acts herding agent water surface floating molecules surface water including solubles phenols btex forming gellike agglomerations undetectable levels hydrocarbons obtained produced water manageable water columns overspraying sheen bioremediation accelerator sheen eliminated within minutes whether applied land water nutrientrich emulsion creates bloom local indigenous preexisting hydrocarbonconsuming bacteria specific bacteria break hydrocarbons water carbon dioxide epa tests showing alkanes biodegraded days aromatics biodegraded times faster nature also sometimes use hydrofireboom clean oil taking away oil burning
controlled burning effectively reduce amount oil water done properly done low wind cause air pollution
dispersants used dissipate oil slicks dispersant either nonsurface active polymer surfaceactive substance added suspension usually colloid improve separation particles prevent settling clumping may rapidly disperse large amounts certain oil types sea surface transferring water column cause oil slick break form watersoluble micelles rapidly diluted oil effectively spread throughout larger volume water surface oil dispersed also delay formation persistent oilinwater emulsions however laboratory experiments showed dispersants increased toxic hydrocarbon levels fish factor may kill fish eggs dispersed oil droplets infiltrate deeper water lethally contaminate coral research indicates dispersants toxic corals study found corexit dispersant increased toxicity oil times

environmental sensitivity index esi mappingedit
environmental sensitivity index esi maps used identify sensitive shoreline resources prior oil spill event order set priorities protection plan cleanup strategies planning spill response ahead time impact environment minimized prevented environmental sensitivity index maps basically made information within following three categories shoreline type biological humanuse resources
shoreline typeedit
shoreline type classified rank depending easy garet would clean long oil would persist sensitive shoreline floating oil slicks put shoreline particular risk eventually come ashore covering substrate oil differing substrates shoreline types vary response oiling influence type cleanup required effectively decontaminate shoreline us national oceanic atmospheric administration extended esi maps lakes rivers estuary shoreline types exposure shoreline wave energy tides substrate type slope shoreline also taken accountin addition biological productivity sensitivity productivity shoreline habitat also taken account determining esi ranking mangroves marshes tend higher esi rankings due potentially longlasting damaging effects oil contamination cleanup actions impermeable exposed surfaces high wave action ranked lower due reflecting waves keeping oil coming onshore speed natural processes remove oil

humanuse resourcesedit
human use resources divided four major classifications archaeological importance cultural resource site highuse recreational areas shoreline access points important protected management areas resource origins examples include airports diving sites popular beach sites marinas natural reserves marine sanctuaries
