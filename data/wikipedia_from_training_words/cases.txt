sulfur or sulphur (see spelling differences) is a chemical element with symbol s and atomic number 16 it is an abundant multivalent non-metal under normal conditions sulfur atoms form cyclic octatomic molecules with chemical formula s8 elemental sulfur is a bright yellow crystalline solid at room temperature chemically sulfur reacts with all elements except for nitrogen and the noble gases
elemental sulfur occurs naturally as the element (native sulfur) but most commonly occurs in combined forms as sulfide and sulfate minerals being abundant in native form sulfur was known in ancient times being mentioned for its uses in ancient india ancient greece china and egypt sulfur is referred to in the bible as brimstone today almost all elemental sulfur is produced as a byproduct of removing sulfur-containing contaminants from natural gas and petroleum the element's largest commercial use (after mostly being converted to sulfuric acid) is to produce sulfate and phosphate fertilizers because of the relatively high requirement of plants for sulfur and phosphorus sulfuric acid is also a primary industrial chemical outside fertilizer manufacture other uses for the element are in matches insecticides and fungicides many sulfur compounds are odoriferous and the smell of odorized natural gas skunk scent grapefruit and garlic is due to organosulfur compounds hydrogen sulfide imparts the characteristic odor to rotting eggs and other biological processes
sulfur is an essential element for all life but almost always in the form of organosulfur compounds or metal sulfides three amino acids (cysteine cystine and methionine) and two vitamins (biotin and thiamine) are organosulfur compounds many cofactors also contain sulfur including glutathione and thioredoxin and iron-sulfur proteins disulfides s-s bonds confer mechanical strength and insolubility of the protein keratin found in outer skin hair and feathers elemental sulfur is not common in higher forms of life but is both a product and an oxidant for various bacteria
== spelling and etymology ==
sulfur is derived from the latin word sulpur which was hellenized to sulphur the spelling sulfur appears toward the end of the classical period (the true greek word for sulfur  is the source of the international chemical prefix thio-.) in 12th-century anglo-french it was sulfre in the 14th century the latin ph was restored for sulphre and by the 15th century the full latin spelling was restored for sulfur sulphur the parallel f~ph spellings continued in britain until the 19th century when the word was standardized as sulphur sulfur was the form chosen in the united states whereas canada uses both however the iupac adopted the spelling sulfur in 1990 as did the nomenclature committee of the royal society of chemistry in 1992 restoring the spelling sulfur to britain the oxford dictionaries note that in chemistry  the -f- spelling is now the standard form in all related words in the field in both british and us contexts.
the late latin form also continues in the romance languages french soufre italian zolfo (from solfo) spanish azufre (from aufre from earlier ufre) portuguese enxofre (from xofre) the spanish and portuguese forms are prefixed with the arabic article despite not being arabic words the root has been traced back to reconstructed proto-indo-european *swpl (genitive *sulpls) a nominal derivative of *swelp to burn a lineage also preserved in the germanic languages where it is found for example as modern german schwefel dutch zwavel and swedish svavel and as old english swefl
== characteristics ==
=== physical properties ===
sulfur forms polyatomic molecules with different chemical formulas with the best-known allotrope being octasulfur cyclo-s8 the point group of cyclo-s8 is d4d and its dipole moment is 0 d octasulfur is a soft bright-yellow solid with only a faint odor similar to that of matches it melts at 115.21 c (239.38 f) boils at 444.6 c (832.3 f) and sublimes easily at 95.2 c (203.4 f) below its melting temperature cyclo-octasulfur changes from -octasulfur to the -polymorph the structure of the s8 ring is virtually unchanged by this phase change which affects the intermolecular interactions between its melting and boiling temperatures octasulfur changes its allotrope again turning from -octasulfur to -sulfur again accompanied by a lower density but increased viscosity due to the formation of polymers at even higher temperatures however the viscosity decreases as depolymerization occurs molten sulfur assumes a dark red color above 200 c (392 f) the density of sulfur is about 2 gcm3 depending on the allotrope all of its stable allotropes are excellent electrical insulators
=== chemical properties ===
sulfur burns with a blue flame concomitant with formation of sulfur dioxide notable for its peculiar suffocating odor sulfur is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide and to a lesser extent in other nonpolar organic solvents such as benzene and toluene the first and the second ionization energies of sulfur are 999.6 and 2252 kjmol1 respectively despite such figures the +2 oxidation state is rare with +4 and +6 being more common the fourth and sixth ionization energies are 4556 and 8495.8 kjmol1 the magnitude of the figures caused by electron transfer between orbitals these states are only stable with strong oxidants as fluorine oxygen and chlorine
=== allotropes ===
sulfur forms over 30 solid allotropes more than any other element besides s8 several other rings are known removing one atom from the crown gives s7 which is more deeply yellow than s8 hplc analysis of elemental sulfur reveals an equilibrium mixture of mainly s8 but with s7 and small amounts of s6 larger rings have been prepared including s12 and s18
amorphous or plastic sulfur is produced by rapid cooling of molten sulfurfor example by pouring it into cold water x-ray crystallography studies show that the amorphous form may have a helical structure with eight atoms per turn the long coiled polymeric molecules make the brownish substance elastic and in bulk this form has the feel of crude rubber this form is metastable at room temperature and gradually reverts to crystalline molecular allotrope which is no longer elastic this process happens within a matter of hours to days but can be rapidly catalyzed
=== isotopes ===
sulfur has 25 known isotopes four of which are stable 32s (95.02%) 33s (0.75%) 34s (4.21%) and 36s (0.02%) other than 35s with a half-life of 87 days and formed in cosmic ray spallation of 40ar the radioactive isotopes of sulfur have half-lives less than 3 hours
when sulfide minerals are precipitated isotopic equilibration among solids and liquid may cause small differences in the s-34 values of co-genetic minerals the differences between minerals can be used to estimate the temperature of equilibration the c-13 and s-34 of coexisting carbonate minerals and sulfides can be used to determine the ph and oxygen fugacity of the ore-bearing fluid during ore formation
in most forest ecosystems sulfate is derived mostly from the atmosphere weathering of ore minerals and evaporites contribute some sulfur sulfur with a distinctive isotopic composition has been used to identify pollution sources and enriched sulfur has been added as a tracer in hydrologic studies differences in the natural abundances can be used in systems where there is sufficient variation in the 34s of ecosystem components rocky mountain lakes thought to be dominated by atmospheric sources of sulfate have been found to have different 34s values from lakes believed to be dominated by watershed sources of sulfate
=== natural occurrence ===
32s is created inside massive stars at a depth where the temperature exceeds 2.5109 k by the fusion of one nucleus of silicon plus one nucleus of helium as this is part of the alpha process that produces elements in abundance sulfur is the 10th most common element in the universe
sulfur usually as sulfide is present in many types of meteorites ordinary chondrites contain on average 2.1% sulfur and carbonaceous chondrites may contain as much as 6.6% it is normally present as troilite (fes) but there are exceptions with carbonaceous chondrites containing free sulfur sulfates and other sulfur compounds the distinctive colors of jupiter's volcanic moon io are attributed to various forms of molten solid and gaseous sulfur
on earth elemental sulfur can be found near hot springs and volcanic regions in many parts of the world especially along the pacific ring of fire such volcanic deposits are currently mined in indonesia chile and japan such deposits are polycrystalline with the largest documented single crystal measuring 221611 cm historically sicily was a large source of sulfur in the industrial revolution
native sulfur is synthesised by anaerobic bacteria acting on sulfate minerals such as gypsum in salt domes significant deposits in salt domes occur along the coast of the gulf of mexico and in evaporites in eastern europe and western asia native sulfur may be produced by geological processes alone fossil-based sulfur deposits from salt domes have until recently been the basis for commercial production in the united states russia turkmenistan and ukraine currently commercial production is still carried out in the osiek mine in poland such sources are now of secondary commercial importance and most are no longer worked
common naturally occurring sulfur compounds include the sulfide minerals such as pyrite (iron sulfide) cinnabar (mercury sulfide) galena (lead sulfide) sphalerite (zinc sulfide) and stibnite (antimony sulfide) and the sulfates such as gypsum (calcium sulfate) alunite (potassium aluminium sulfate) and barite (barium sulfate) on earth just as upon jupiter's moon io elemental sulfur occurs naturally in volcanic emissions including emissions from hydrothermal vents
== production ==
sulfur may be found by itself and historically was usually obtained in this form while pyrite has been a source of sulfur via sulfuric acid in volcanic regions in sicily in ancient times it was found on the surface of the earth and the sicilian process was used sulfur deposits were piled and stacked in brick kilns built on sloping hillsides with airspaces between them then some sulfur was pulverized spread over the stacked ore and ignited causing the free sulfur to melt down the hills eventually the surface-borne deposits played out and miners excavated veins that ultimately dotted the sicilian landscape with labyrinthine mines mining was unmechanized and labor-intensive with pickmen freeing the ore from the rock and mine-boys or carusi carrying baskets of ore to the surface often through a mile or more of tunnels once the ore was at the surface it was reduced and extracted in smelting ovens the conditions in sicilian sulfur mines were horrific prompting booker t washington to write i am not prepared just now to say to what extent i believe in a physical hell in the next world but a sulphur mine in sicily is about the nearest thing to hell that i expect to see in this life.
elemental sulfur was once extracted from salt domes where it sometimes occurs in nearly pure form but this method has been obsolete since the late 20th century today's sulfur production is as a side product of other industrial processes such as oil refining in these processes sulfur often occurs as undesired or detrimental compounds that are extracted and converted to elemental sulfur as a mineral native sulfur under salt domes is thought to be a fossil mineral resource produced by the action of ancient bacteria on sulfate deposits it was removed from such salt-dome mines mainly by the frasch process in this method superheated water was pumped into a native sulfur deposit to melt the sulfur and then compressed air returned the 99.5% pure melted product to the surface throughout the 20th century this procedure produced elemental sulfur that required no further purification however due to a limited number of such sulfur deposits and the high cost of working them this process for mining sulfur has not been employed in a major way anywhere in the world since 2002
today sulfur is produced from petroleum natural gas and related fossil resources from which it is obtained mainly as hydrogen sulfide organosulfur compounds undesirable impurities in petroleum may be upgraded by subjecting them to hydrodesulfurization which cleaves the cs bonds
r-s-r + 2 h2 2 rh + h2s
the resulting hydrogen sulfide from this process and also as it occurs in natural gas is converted into elemental sulfur by the claus process this process entails oxidation of some hydrogen sulfide to sulfur dioxide and then the comproportionation of the two
3 o2 + 2 h2s 2 so2 + 2 h2o
so2 + 2 h2s 3 s + 2 h2o
owing to the high sulfur content of the athabasca oil sands stockpiles of elemental sulfur from this process now exist throughout alberta canada another way of storing sulfur is as a binder for concrete the resulting product having many desirable properties (see sulfur concrete) sulfur is still mined from surface deposits in poorer nations with volcanos such as indonesia and worker conditions have not improved much since booker t washington's days
the world production of sulfur in 2011 amounted to 69 million tonnes (mt) with more than 15 countries contributing more than 1 mt each countries producing more than 5 mt are china (9.6) us (8.8) canada (7.1) and russia (7.1) while the production has been slowly increasing from 1900 to 2010 the price was much less stable especially in the 1980s and around 2010
== compounds ==
common oxidation states of sulfur range from 2 to +6 sulfur forms stable compounds with all elements except the noble gases
=== sulfur polycations ===
sulfur polycations s82+ s42+ and s192+ are produced when sulfur is reacted with mild oxidising agents in a strongly acidic solution the colored solutions produced by dissolving sulfur in oleum were first reported as early as 1804 by c.f bucholz but the cause of the color and the structure of the polycations involved was only determined in the late 1960s s82+ is deep blue s42+ is yellow and s192+ is red
=== sulfides ===
treatment of sulfur with hydrogen gives hydrogen sulfide when dissolved in water hydrogen sulfide is mildly acidic
h2s hs + h+
hydrogen sulfide gas and the hydrosulfide anion are extremely toxic to mammals due to their inhibition of the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin and certain cytochromes in a manner analogous to cyanide and azide (see below under precautions)
reduction of elemental sulfur gives polysulfides which consist of chains of sulfur atoms terminated with s centers
2 na + s8 na2s8
this reaction highlights arguably the single most distinctive property of sulfur its ability to catenate (bind to itself by formation of chains) protonation of these polysulfide anions gives the polysulfanes h2sx where x = 2 3 and 4 ultimately reduction of sulfur gives sulfide salts
16 na + s8 8 na2s
the interconversion of these species is exploited in the sodium-sulfur battery the radical anion s3 gives the blue color of the mineral lapis lazuli
=== oxides oxoacids and oxoanions ===
the principal sulfur oxides are obtained by burning sulfur
s + o2 so2
2 so2 + o2 2 so3
other oxides are known sulfur-rich oxides e.g sulfur monoxide and disulfur mono- and dioxides and higher oxides containing peroxo groups
sulfur forms a number of sulfur oxoacids some of which cannot be isolated and are only known through their salts sulfur dioxide and sulfites (so2
3) are related to the unstable sulfurous acid (h2so3) sulfur trioxide and sulfates (so2

=== halides and oxyhalides ===
the two main sulfur fluorides are sulfur hexafluoride a dense gas used as an insulator gas in high voltage transformers and a nonreactive and nontoxic propellant and sulfur tetrafluoride a rarely used organic reagent that is highly toxic sulfur dichloride and disulfur dichloride are important industrial chemicals sulfuryl chloride and chlorosulfuric acid are derivatives of sulfuric acid thionyl chloride (socl2) is a common reagent in organic synthesis
=== pnictides ===
an important sn compound is the cage tetrasulfur tetranitride (s4n4) heating this compound gives polymeric sulfur nitride ((sn)x) which has metallic properties even though it does not contain any metal atoms thiocyanates contain the scn group oxidation of thiocyanate gives thiocyanogen (scn)2 with the connectivity ncs-scn phosphorus sulfides are numerous the most important commercially being the cages p4s10 and p4s3
=== metal sulfides ===
the principal ores of copper zinc nickel cobalt molybdenum and other metals are sulfides these materials tend to be dark-colored semiconductors that are not readily attacked by water or even many acids they are formed both geochemically and in the laboratory by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with metal salts the mineral galena (pbs) was the first demonstrated semiconductor and found a use as a signal rectifier in the cat's whiskers of early crystal radios the iron sulfide called pyrite the so-called fool's gold, has the formula fes2 the upgrading of these ores usually by roasting is costly and environmentally hazardous sulfur corrodes many metals via the process called tarnishing
=== organic compounds ===
illustrative organosulfur compounds
some of the main classes of sulfur-containing organic compounds include the following
thiols or mercaptans (as they are mercury capturers as chelators) are the sulfur analogs of alcohols treatment of thiols with base gives thiolate ions
thioethers are the sulfur analogs of ethers
sulfonium ions have three groups attached to a cationic sulfur center dimethylsulfoniopropionate (dmsp) is one such compound important in the marine organic sulfur cycle
sulfoxides and sulfones are thioethers with one and two oxygen atoms attached to the sulfur atom respectively the simplest sulfoxide dimethyl sulfoxide is a common solvent a common sulfone is sulfolane
sulfonic acids are used in many detergents
compounds with carbonsulfur multiple bonds are uncommon with the notable exception of carbon disulfide a volatile colorless liquid that is structurally similar to carbon dioxide it is used as a reagent to make the polymer rayon and many organosulfur compounds unlike carbon monoxide carbon monosulfide is only stable as a dilute gas as in the interstellar medium
organosulfur compounds are responsible for some of the unpleasant odors of decaying organic matter they are used in the odoration of natural gas and cause the odor of garlic and skunk spray not all organic sulfur compounds smell unpleasant at all concentrations the sulfur-containing monoterpenoid grapefruit mercaptan in small concentrations is responsible for the characteristic scent of grapefruit but has a generic thiol odor at larger concentrations sulfur mustard a potent vesicant was used in world war i as a disabling agent
sulfur-sulfur bonds are a structural component to stiffen rubber in a way similar to the biological role of disulfide bridges to rigidify proteins (see biological below) in the most common type of industrial curing or hardening and strengthening of natural rubber elemental sulfur is heated with the rubber to the point that chemical reactions form disulfide bridges between isoprene units of the polymer this process patented in 1843 allowed rubber to become a major industrial product especially automobile tires because of the heat and sulfur the process was named vulcanization after the roman god of the forge and volcanism
== history ==
=== antiquity ===
being abundantly available in native form sulfur was known in ancient times and is referred to in the torah (genesis) english translations of the bible commonly referred to burning sulfur as brimstone giving rise to the term fire-and-brimstone sermons in which listeners are reminded of the fate of eternal damnation that await the unbelieving and unrepentant it is from this part of the bible that hell is implied to smell of sulfur (likely due to its association with volcanic activity) according to the ebers papyrus a sulfur ointment was used in ancient egypt to treat granular eyelids sulfur was used for fumigation in preclassical greece this is mentioned in the odyssey pliny the elder discusses sulfur in book 35 of his natural history saying that its best-known source is the island of melos he mentions its use for fumigation medicine and bleaching cloth
a natural form of sulfur known as shiliuhuang () was known in china since the 6th century bc and found in hanzhong by the 3rd century the chinese discovered that sulfur could be extracted from pyrite chinese daoists were interested in sulfur's flammability and its reactivity with certain metals yet its earliest practical uses were found in traditional chinese medicine a song dynasty military treatise of 1044 ad described different formulas for chinese black powder which is a mixture of potassium nitrate (kno
3) charcoal and sulfur it remains an ingredient of black gunpowder
indian alchemists practitioners of the science of mercury (sanskrit rasastra ) wrote extensively about the use of sulfur in alchemical operations with mercury from the eighth century ad onwards in the rasastra tradition sulfur is called the smelly (sanskrit gandhaka )
early european alchemists gave sulfur its own alchemical symbol a triangle at the top of a cross ( there also was in use.) in traditional skin treatment before the modern era of scientific medicine elemental sulfur was used mainly in creams to alleviate conditions such as scabies ringworm psoriasis eczema and acne the mechanism of action is unknownthough elemental sulfur does oxidize slowly to sulfurous acid which in turn (through the action of sulfite) acts as a mild reducing and antibacterial agent
=== modern times ===
in 1777 antoine lavoisier helped convince the scientific community that sulfur was an element not a compound (in fact it is both consisting of cyclic chains of s atoms)
sulfur deposits in sicily were the dominant supply source for over half a century approximately 2000 tons per year of sulfur were imported into marseilles france for the production of sulfuric acid via the leblanc process by the late 18th century in industrializing britain with the repeal of tariffs on salt in 1824 demand for sulfur from sicily surged upward the increasing british control and exploitation of the mining refining and transportation of the sulfur coupled with the failure of this lucrative export to transform sicily's backward and impoverished economy led to the sulfur crisis of 1840 when king ferdinand ii gave a monopoly of the sulfur industry to a french firm violating an earlier 1816 trade agreement with britain a peaceful negotiated solution was eventually mediated by france
in 1867 sulfur was discovered in underground deposits in louisiana and texas the highly successful frasch process was developed to extract this resource
in the late 18th century furniture makers used molten sulfur to produce decorative inlays in their craft because of the sulfur dioxide produced during the process of melting sulfur the craft of sulfur inlays was soon abandoned molten sulfur is sometimes still used for setting steel bolts into drilled concrete holes where high shock resistance is desired for floor-mounted equipment attachment points pure powdered sulfur was used as a medicinal tonic and laxative with the advent of the contact process the majority of sulfur today is used to make sulfuric acid for a wide range of uses particularly fertilizer
== applications ==
=== sulfuric acid ===
elemental sulfur is mainly used as a precursor to other chemicals approximately 85% (1989) is converted to sulfuric acid (h2so4)
2 s + 3 o2 + 2 h2o 2 h2so4
because of its importance sulfuric acid was considered an excellent indicator of a country's industrial well-being for example with 32.5 million tonnes in 2010 the united states produces more sulfuric acid every year than any other inorganic industrial chemical the principal use for the acid is the extraction of phosphate ores for the production of fertilizer manufacturing other applications of sulfuric acid include oil refining wastewater processing and mineral extraction
=== other large-scale sulfur chemicals ===
sulfur reacts directly with methane to give carbon disulfide which is used to manufacture cellophane and rayon one of the direct uses of sulfur is in vulcanization of rubber where polysulfide chains crosslink organic polymers sulfites are heavily used to bleach paper and as preservatives in dried fruit many surfactants and detergents e.g sodium lauryl sulfate are produced are sulfate derivatives calcium sulfate gypsum (caso42h2o) is mined on the scale of 100 million tons each year for use in portland cement and fertilizers
when silver-based photography was widespread sodium and ammonium thiosulfate were widely used as fixing agents. sulfur is a component of gunpowder
=== fertilizer ===
sulfur is increasingly used as a component of fertilizers the most important form of sulfur for fertilizer is the mineral calcium sulfate elemental sulfur is hydrophobic (that is it is not soluble in water) and therefore cannot be directly utilized by plants over time soil bacteria can convert it to soluble derivatives which can then be utilized by plants sulfur improves the use efficiency of other essential plant nutrients particularly nitrogen and phosphorus biologically produced sulfur particles are naturally hydrophilic due to a biopolymer coating this sulfur is therefore easier to disperse over the land (via spraying as a diluted slurry) and results in a faster release
plant requirements for sulfur are equal to or exceed those for phosphorus it is one of the major nutrients essential for plant growth root nodule formation of legumes and plants protection mechanisms sulfur deficiency has become widespread in many countries in europe because atmospheric inputs of sulfur continue to decrease the deficit in the sulfur input/output is likely to increase unless sulfur fertilizers are used
=== fine chemicals ===
organosulfur compounds are used in pharmaceuticals dyestuffs and agrochemicals many drugs contain sulfur early examples being antibacterial sulfonamides known as sulfa drugs sulfur is a part of many bacterial defense molecules most -lactam antibiotics including the penicillins cephalosporins and monolactams contain sulfur
magnesium sulfate known as epsom salts when in hydrated crystal form can be used as a laxative a bath additive an exfoliant magnesium supplement for plants or (when in dehydrated form) as a desiccant
=== fungicide and pesticide ===
elemental sulfur is one of the oldest fungicides and pesticides dusting sulfur, elemental sulfur in powdered form is a common fungicide for grapes strawberry many vegetables and several other crops it has a good efficacy against a wide range of powdery mildew diseases as well as black spot in organic production sulfur is the most important fungicide it is the only fungicide used in organically farmed apple production against the main disease apple scab under colder conditions biosulfur (biologically produced elemental sulfur with hydrophilic characteristics) can be used well for these applications
standard-formulation dusting sulfur is applied to crops with a sulfur duster or from a dusting plane wettable sulfur is the commercial name for dusting sulfur formulated with additional ingredients to make it water miscible it has similar applications and is used as a fungicide against mildew and other mold-related problems with plants and soil
elemental sulfur powder is used as an organic (i.e green") insecticide (actually an acaricide) against ticks and mites a common method of use is to dust clothing or limbs with sulfur powder
diluted solutions of lime sulfur (made by combining calcium hydroxide with elemental sulfur in water) are used as a dip for pets to destroy ringworm (fungus) mange and other dermatoses and parasites sulfur candles consist of almost pure sulfur in blocks or pellets that are burned to fumigate structures it is no longer used in the home due to the toxicity of the products of combustion
=== bactericide in winemaking and food preservation ===
small amounts of sulfur dioxide gas addition (or equivalent potassium metabisulfite addition) to fermented wine to produce traces of sulfurous acid (produced when so2 reacts with water) and its sulfite salts in the mixture has been called the most powerful tool in winemaking. after the yeast-fermentation stage in winemaking sulfites absorb oxygen and inhibit aerobic bacterial growth that otherwise would turn ethanol into acetic acid souring the wine without this preservative step indefinite refrigeration of the product before consumption is usually required similar methods go back into antiquity but modern historical mentions of the practice go to the fifteenth century the practice is used by large industrial wine producers and small organic wine producers alike
sulfur dioxide and various sulfites have been used for their antioxidant antibacterial preservative properties in many other parts of the food industry also the practice has declined since reports of an allergy-like reaction of some persons to sulfites in foods
=== pharmaceutical use ===
sulfur (specifically octasulfur s8) is used in pharmaceutical skin preparations for the treatment of acne and other conditions it acts as a keratolytic agent and also kills bacteria fungi scabies mites and other parasites precipitated sulfur and colloidal sulfur are used in form of lotions creams powders soaps and bath additives for the treatment of acne vulgaris acne rosacea and seborrhoeic dermatitis
common adverse effects include irritation of the skin at the application site such as dryness stinging itching and peeling
==== mechanism of action ====
sulfur is converted to hydrogen sulfide (h2s) through reduction partly by bacteria h2s kills bacteria (possibly including propionibacterium acnes which plays a role in acne) fungi and parasites such as scabies mites
== biological role ==
=== protein and organic cofactors ===
sulfur is an essential component of all living cells it is the seventh or eighth most abundant element in the human body by weight being about as common as potassium and a little more common than sodium or chlorine a 70 kg (150 lb) human body contains about 140 grams of sulfur
in plants and animals the amino acids cysteine and methionine contain most of the sulfur the element is thus present in all polypeptides proteins and enzymes that contain these amino acids in humans methionine is an essential amino acid that must be ingested however save for the vitamins biotin and thiamine cysteine and all sulfur-containing compounds in the human body can be synthesized from methionine the enzyme sulfite oxidase is needed for the metabolism of methionine and cysteine in humans and animals
disulfide bonds (s-s bonds) formed between cysteine residues in peptide chains are very important in protein assembly and structure these covalent bonds between peptide chains confer extra toughness and rigidity for example the high strength of feathers and hair is in part due to their high content of s-s bonds and their high content of cysteine and sulfur eggs are high in sulfur because large amounts of the element are necessary for feather formation and the characteristic odor of rotting eggs is due to hydrogen sulfide the high disulfide bond content of hair and feathers contributes to their indigestibility and to their characteristic disagreeable odor when burned
homocysteine and taurine are other sulfur-containing acids that are similar in structure but not coded by dna and are not part of the primary structure of proteins many important cellular enzymes use prosthetic groups ending with -sh moieties to handle reactions involving acyl-containing biochemicals two common examples from basic metabolism are coenzyme a and alpha-lipoic acid two of the 13 classical vitamins biotin and thiamine contain sulfur with the latter being named for its sulfur content sulfur plays an important part as a carrier of reducing hydrogen and its electrons for cellular repair of oxidation reduced glutathione a sulfur-containing tripeptide is a reducing agent through its sulfhydryl (-sh) moiety derived from cysteine the thioredoxins a class of small protein essential to all known life using neighboring pairs of reduced cysteines to act as general protein reducing agents to similar effect
methanogenesis the route to most of the world's methane is a multistep biochemical transformation of carbon dioxide this conversion requires several organosulfur cofactors these include coenzyme m ch3sch2ch2so3 the immediate precursor to methane
=== metalloproteins and inorganic cofactors ===
inorganic sulfur forms a part of iron-sulfur clusters as well as many copper nickel and iron proteins most pervasive are the ferrodoxins which serve as electron shuttles in cells in bacteria the important nitrogenase enzymes contains an fe-mo-s cluster is a catalyst that performs the important function of nitrogen fixation converting atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia that can be used by microorganisms and plants to make proteins dna rna alkaloids and the other organic nitrogen compounds necessary for life
=== sulfur metabolism and the sulfur cycle ===
the sulfur cycle was the first of the biogeochemical cycles to be discovered in the 1880s while studying beggiatoa (a bacterium living in a sulfur rich environment) sergei winogradsky found that it oxidized hydrogen sulfide (h2s) as an energy source forming intracellular sulfur droplets winogradsky referred to this form of metabolism as inorgoxidation (oxidation of inorganic compounds) he continued to study it together with selman waksman until the 1950s
sulfur oxidizers can use as energy sources reduced sulfur compounds including hydrogen sulfide elemental sulfur sulfite thiosulfate and various polythionates (e.g. tetrathionate) they depend on enzymes such as sulfur oxygenase and sulfite oxidase to oxidize sulfur to sulfate some lithotrophs can even use the energy contained in sulfur compounds to produce sugars a process known as chemosynthesis some bacteria and archaea use hydrogen sulfide in place of water as the electron donor in chemosynthesis a process similar to photosynthesis that produces sugars and utilizes oxygen as the electron acceptor the photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria and some lithotrophs use elemental oxygen to carry out such oxidization of hydrogen sulfide to produce elemental sulfur (s0) oxidation state = 0 primitive bacteria that live around deep ocean volcanic vents oxidize hydrogen sulfide in this way with oxygen see giant tube worm for an example of large organisms that use hydrogen sulfide (via bacteria) as food to be oxidized
the so-called sulfate-reducing bacteria by contrast breathe sulfate instead of oxygen they use organic compounds or molecular hydrogen as the energy source they use sulfur as the electron acceptor and reduce various oxidized sulfur compounds back into sulfide often into hydrogen sulfide they can grow on a number of other partially oxidized sulfur compounds (e.g thiosulfates thionates polysulfides sulfites) the hydrogen sulfide produced by these bacteria is responsible for some of the smell of intestinal gases (flatus) and decomposition products
sulfur is absorbed by plants via the roots from soil as the sulfate and transported as a phosphate ester sulfate is reduced to sulfide via sulfite before it is incorporated into cysteine and other organosulfur compounds
so42 so32 h2s cysteine methionine
== precautions ==
elemental sulfur is non-toxic as generally are the soluble sulfate salts such as epsom salts soluble sulfate salts are poorly absorbed and laxative however when injected parenterally they are freely filtered by the kidneys and eliminated with very little toxicity in multi-gram amounts
when sulfur burns in air it produces sulfur dioxide in water this gas produces sulfurous acid and sulfites which are antioxidants that inhibit growth of aerobic bacteria and allow its use as a food additive in small amounts however at high concentrations these acids harm the lungs eyes or other tissues in organisms without lungs such as insects or plants it otherwise prevents respiration in high concentrations sulfur trioxide (made by catalysis from sulfur dioxide) and sulfuric acid are similarly highly corrosive due to the strong acids that form on contact with water
the burning of coal and/or petroleum by industry and power plants generates sulfur dioxide (so2) which reacts with atmospheric water and oxygen to produce sulfuric acid (h2so4) and sulfurous acid (h2so3) these acids are components of acid rain which lower the ph of soil and freshwater bodies sometimes resulting in substantial damage to the environment and chemical weathering of statues and structures fuel standards increasingly require that fuel producers extract sulfur from fossil fuels to prevent acid rain formation this extracted and refined sulfur represents a large portion of sulfur production in coal-fired power plants flue gases are sometimes purified more modern power plants that use synthesis gas extract the sulfur before they burn the gas
hydrogen sulfide is as toxic as hydrogen cyanide and kills by the same mechanism (inhibition of the respiratory enzyme cytochrome oxidase) though hydrogen sulfide is less likely to cause surprise poisonings from small inhaled amounts because of its disagreeable warning odor however hydrogen sulfide quickly deadens the sense of smell-so a victim may breathe increasing quantities and be unaware of its presence until severe symptoms occur which can quickly lead to death dissolved sulfide and hydrosulfide salts are also toxic by the same mechanism
