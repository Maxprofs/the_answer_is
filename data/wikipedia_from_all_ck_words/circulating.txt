== lyrics ==
i am a queen of the circulating library
i have declared an amnesty
all books may be returned without a penalty
return the books to me
return the books
don't burn the books
you cut down the trees to make paper disease
it's in the trees it's coming
return the book of knowledge
return the marble index
file under paradox
the forest is a college each tree a university
i am a queen of the circulating library
i'm here to answer your enquiry
all knowledge resides within me
your membership has expired
you are way past expiry dates
words words words words
you may as well listen to the birds
