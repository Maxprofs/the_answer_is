eurasia is the combined continental landmass of europe and asia the term is a portmanteau of its two constituents located primarily in the northern and eastern hemispheres it is bordered by the atlantic ocean on the west the pacific ocean to the east the arctic ocean on the north and by africa the mediterranean sea the pacific ocean and the indian ocean to the south the division between europe and asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct with no clear physical separation between them thus in some parts of the world eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents
eurasia covers around 55,000,000 square kilometres (21,000,000 sq mi) or around 36.2% of the earth's total land area the landmass contains around 5.0 billion people equating to approximately 70% of the human population humans first settled in eurasia between 60,000 and 125,000 years ago some countries notably the united kingdom japan indonesia and others are included under the popular definition of eurasia in spite of being separate from the massive landmass
== overviewedit ==
physiographically eurasia is a single continent the concepts of europe and asia as distinct continents date back to antiquity and their borders are geologically arbitrary with the ural and caucasus ranges being the main delimiters between the two eurasia is connected to africa at the suez canal and eurasia is sometimes combined with africa as the supercontinent afro-eurasia due to the vast landmass and differences in latitude eurasia exhibits all types of climate under the kppen classification including the harshest types of hot and cold temperatures high and low precipitation and various types of nature
== historyedit ==
eurasia has been the host of many ancient civilizations including those based in mesopotamia the indus valley and china in the axial age (mid-first millennium bc) was formed a continuous belt of civilizations stretching through the eurasian subtropical zone from the atlantic to the pacific this belt became the mainstream of world history for two millennia historian max ostrovsky demonstrates that in the medieval time this belt shifted northward due to climatic changes and in the modern time it penetrated to the temperate new world to become the industrial north originally however the industrial north was the great civilizational belt formed in the axial-age eurasia
through this belt passed the famous silk road which symbolizes trade and cultural exchange linking eurasian cultures through history and has been an increasingly popular topic over recent decades the idea of a greater eurasian history has developed with the aim of investigating the genetic cultural and linguistic relationships between european and asian cultures of antiquity which had long been considered distinct
== geologyedit ==
eurasia formed 375 to 325 million years ago with the merging of siberia (once a separate continent) kazakhstania and baltica which was joined to laurentia now north america to form euramerica chinese cratons collided with siberia's southern coast
== geopoliticsedit ==
originally eurasia is a geographical notion in this sense it is simply the biggest continent the combined landmass of europe and asia however geopolitically the word has several different meanings reflecting the specific geopolitical interests of each nation eurasia is one of the most important geopolitical concepts as zbigniew brzezinski observed
ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for about three-fourths of the worlds known energy resources
in the widest possible sense the geopolitical definition of eurasia is consistent with its geographical area this is sometimes the way the word is understood in countries located at the fringes of or outside this area and it is generally what is meant by eurasia in political circles (see zbigniew brzezinski) in the usa japan and india
in western europe when political scientists talk about eurasia they generally mean russia (including ukraine) integrated into europe economically politically and even militarily since napoleon european strategists have understood the importance of allying with russia and the potential consequences of failing to do so at the moment one of the most prominent projects of european union is russia - eu four common spaces initiative a political and economic union of former soviet states named the eurasian union is scheduled for establishment in 2015 similar in concept to the european union as of 2014 neither encompasses all states within eurasia
the russian concept of eurasia is very different from the european one it is a view that has older roots than the european one - not surprisingly considering russia's geographic position russian politologists traditionally view russia itself being both european and asian as eurasian the geopolitical area of the russian concept of eurasia corresponded initially more or less to the land area of imperial russia in 1914 including parts of eastern europe there is undeniably an influence of panslavism in this definition originally the idea of eurasia was more romantically rooted in natural geography it was the idea that the people scattered across the land called eurasia shared common spiritual values due to its geographic traits such as a flat land with few coastlines but important rivers a particular climate (continental often harshly so) and a certain landscape (steppe taiga tundra) this idea was more or less realised but with difficulty during the last phases of the russian empire and was then realised again with the soviet union after 1945 though not stably enough for enduring success today though this russian geopolitical interest still exists the physical area of the russian eurasia is now more realistically assessed the russian view today is that eurasia consists of the land lying between europe and asia proper namely those made up of western and central russia belarus ukraine part of caucasus uzbekistan kazakhstan tajikistan and kyrgyzstan (see eurasian economic union) just as in the case of the european concept of eurasia the russian version of eurasia is a geopolitical interest that underpins foreign policy in that part of the world thus it is not surprising that today one of russia's main geopolitical interests lies in ever closer integration with those countries that it considers part of eurasia
every two years since 1996 a meeting of most asian and european countries is organised as the asia-europe meeting (asem)

=== history of the europe and asia divisionedit ===
in ancient times the greeks classified europe (derived from the mythological phoenician princess europa) and asia (derived from asia a woman in greek mythology) as separate lands where to draw the dividing line between the two regions is still a matter of discussion especially whether the kuma-manych depression or the caucasus mountains form the southeast boundary is disputed since mount elbrus would be part of europe in the latter case making it (and not mont blanc) europe's highest mountain most accepted is probably the boundary as defined by philip johan von strahlenberg in the 18th century he defined the dividing line along the aegean sea dardanelles sea of marmara bosporus black sea kumamanych depression caspian sea ural river and ural mountains
=== anthropology and geneticsedit ===
in modern usage the term eurasian is a demonym usually meaning of or relating to eurasia or a native or inhabitant of eurasia

west or western eurasia is a loose geographic definition used in some disciplines such as genetics or anthropology to refer to the region inhabited by the relatively homogeneous population of west asia and europe the people of this region are sometimes described collectively as west or western eurasians
=== geographyedit ===
located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres eurasia is considered a supercontinent part of the supercontinent of afro-eurasia or simply a continent in its own right in plate tectonics the eurasian plate includes europe and most of asia but not the indian subcontinent the arabian peninsula or the area of the russian far east east of the chersky range
=== post-soviet countriesedit ===
eurasia is also sometimes used in geopolitics to refer to organizations of or affairs concerning the post-soviet states in particular russia the central asian republics and the transcaucasian republics a prominent example of this usage is in the name of the eurasian economic community the organization including kazakhstan russia and some of their neighbors and headquartered in moscow russia and astana the capital of kazakhstan
the word eurasia is often used in kazakhstan to describe its location numerous kazakh institutions have the term in their names like the l n gumilev eurasian national university (kazakh    russian   ) (lev gumilev's eurasianism ideas having been popularized in kazakhstan by olzhas suleimenov) the eurasian media forum the eurasian cultural foundation (russian ) the eurasian development bank (russian ) and the eurasian bank in 2007 kazakhstan's president nursultan nazarbayev proposed building a eurasia canal to connect the caspian sea and the black sea via russia's kuma-manych depression in order to provide kazakhstan and other caspian-basin countries with a more efficient path to the ocean than the existing volga-don canal this usage is comparable to how americans use western hemisphere to describe concepts and organizations dealing with the americas (e.g. council on hemispheric affairs western hemisphere institute for security cooperation)
