the first walled city in beijing was ji a city-state from the 11th to 7th century bc within modern beijing ji was located south of the present beijing west railway station this settlement was later conquered by the state of yan and made its capital under the name yanjing
=== early imperial china ===
after the first emperor unified china beijing became a prefectural capital for the region during the three kingdoms period it was held by gongsun zan and yuan shao before falling to cao cao's wei kingdom the ad 3rd-century western jin demoted the town placing the prefectural seat in neighboring zhuozhou
during the sixteen kingdoms period when northern china was conquered and divided by the wu hu beijing as jicheng was briefly the capital of the xianbei former yan kingdom
after china was reunified during the sui dynasty beijing known as zhuojun became the northern terminus of the grand canal under the tang dynasty beijing as fanyang served as a military frontier command center during the an-shi rebellion and again amidst the turmoil of the late tang local military commanders founded their own short-lived yan dynasties and called the city yanjing or the yan capital. in 938 after the fall of the tang the later jin ceded the entire northern frontier to the khitan liao dynasty which renamed the city nanjing or the southern capital one of four secondary capitals to complement its supreme capital shangjing (modern baarin left banner in inner mongolia) some of the oldest surviving structures in beijing date to the liao period including the tianning pagoda

=== ming dynasty ===
in 1368 soon after declaring the new hongwu era of the ming dynasty the rebel leader zhu yuanzhang sent an army to khanbaliq and burnt it to the ground since the yuan continued to occupy shangdu and mongolia however a new town was established to supply the military garrisons in the area this was called beiping and under the hongwu emperor's feudal policies it was given to zhu di one of his sons who was created prince of yan
the early death of zhu yuanzhang's heir led to a succession struggle on his death one that ended with the victory of zhu di and the declaration of the new yongle era since his harsh treatment of the ming capital yingtian (nanjing) alienated many there he established his fief as a new co-capital the city of beiping became shuntian now beijing in 1403 the construction of the new imperial residence the forbidden city took from 1406 to 1420 this period was also responsible for several other of the modern city's major attractions such as the temple of heaven and tian'anmen (although the square facing it was not cleared until 1651) on 28 october 1420 beijing is officially designated the capital of the ming dynasty on the same year that the forbidden city is completed beijing became the empire's primary capital (jingshi) and yingtian now called nanjing lost much of its importance (a 1425 order by zhu di's son the hongxi emperor to return the capital to nanjing was never carried out he died probably of a heart attack the next month he was buried like almost every ming emperor to follow him in an elaborate necropolis to beijing's north.)
