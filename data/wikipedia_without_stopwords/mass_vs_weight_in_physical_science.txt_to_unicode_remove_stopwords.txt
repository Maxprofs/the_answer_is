f resultant force acting body acceleration bodys centre mass moment put aside question force acting body actually means
equation illustrates mass relates inertia body consider two objects different masses apply identical force object bigger mass experience smaller acceleration object smaller mass experience bigger acceleration might say larger mass exerts greater resistance changing state motion response force
however notion applying identical forces different objects brings us back fact really defined force sidestep difficulty help newtons third law states one object exerts force second object experience equal opposite force precise suppose two objects constant inertial masses m m isolate two objects physical influences forces present force exerted m m denote f force exerted m m denote f newtons second law states
accelerations m m respectively suppose accelerations nonzero forces two objects nonzero occurs example two objects process colliding one another newtons third law states
thus
