x e x energy
solid state physics electron affinity surface defined somewhat differently see
measurement use electron affinity
property measured atoms molecules gaseous state since solid liquid states energy levels would changed contact atoms molecules list electron affinities used robert mulliken develop electronegativity scale atoms equal average electron affinity ionization potential theoretical concepts use electron affinity include electronic chemical potential chemical hardness another example molecule atom positive value electron affinity another often called electron acceptor less positive electron donor together may undergo chargetransfer reactions
sign convention
use electron affinities properly essential keep track sign reaction releases energy change e total energy negative value reaction called exothermic process electron capture almost nonnoble gas atoms involves release energy thus exothermic positive values listed tables eea amounts magnitudes word released within definition energy released supplies negative sign e confusion arises mistaking eea change energy e case positive values listed tables would endo exothermic process relation two eea eattach
however value assigned eea negative negative sign implies reversal direction energy required attach electron case electron capture endothermic process relationship eea eattach still valid negative values typically arise capture second electron also nitrogen atom
usual expression calculating eea electron attached
eea einitial efinalattach eattach
expression follow convention x xfinal xinitial since e efinal einitial einitial efinal
equivalently electron affinity also defined amount energy required detach electron singly charged negative ion ie energy change process
x x e
table employed forward reverse reactions without switching signs care must taken apply correct definition corresponding direction attachment release detachment require since almost detachments require amount energy listed table detachment reactions endothermic edetach
electron affinities elements
although eea varies greatly across periodic table patterns emerge generally nonmetals positive eea metals atoms whose anions stable neutral atoms greater eea chlorine strongly attracts extra electrons mercury weakly attracts extra electron electron affinities noble gases conclusively measured may may slightly negative values
eea generally increases across period row periodic table caused filling valence shell atom group atom releases energy group atom gaining electron obtains filled valence shell therefore stable
trend decreasing eea going groups periodic table might expected additional electron entering orbital farther away nucleus since electron farther nucleus less attracted nucleus would release less energy added however clear counterexample trend found group inspecting entire periodic table turns proposed trend applies group atoms
thus electron affinity follows leftright trend electronegativity updown trend
following data quoted kjmol elements marked asterisk expected negative nearzero electron affinities quantum mechanical grounds
molecular electron affinities
electron affinity molecules complicated function electronic structure instance electron affinity benzene negative naphthalene anthracene phenanthrene pyrene positive silico experiments show electron affinity hexacyanobenzene surpasses fullerene
electron affinity defined solid state physics
field solid state physics electron affinity defined differently chemistry atomic physics applies different system also temperature dependent semiconductorvacuum interface surface semiconductor electron affinity typically denoted eea defined energy obtained moving electron vacuum outside semiconductor bottom conduction band inside semiconductor
intrinsic semiconductor absolute zero concept functionally analogous chemistry definition electron affinity since added electron spontaneously go bottom conduction band nonzero temperature materials metals semimetals heavily doped semiconductors analogy hold since added electron instead go fermi level average case value electron affinity solid substance different chemistry atomic physics electron affinity value atom substance gas phase example silicon crystal surface electron affinity ev whereas isolated silicon atom electron affinity ev
electron affinity contrasted work function work function thermodynamic work obtained reversibly isothermally moving electron vacuum material thermodynamic electron goes fermi level average conduction band edge work function semiconductor changed doping electron affinity ideally change doping closer material constant however electron affinity depend surface termination crystal face surface chemistry etc
certain circumstances electron affinity may become negative often negative electron affinity desired obtain efficient cathodes supply electrons vacuum little energy loss observed electron yield function various parameters bias voltage illumination conditions used describe structures band diagrams electron affinity one parameter one illustration apparent effect surface termination electron emission see figure marchywka effect
semiconductor physics primary use electron affinity actually analysis semiconductorvacuum junctions rather heuristic electron affinity rules estimating band bending occurs interface two materials
