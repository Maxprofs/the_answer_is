for other meanings see wash (disambiguation)
wash is an acronym standing for water sanitation and hygiene, a group of interrelated public health issues that are of particular interest to international development programs access to wash is a key public health issue especially in many countries in asia and sub-saharan africa several international development agencies have identified wash as an area with great potential to improve health life-expectancy student learning gender equality and many other key issues of development
== background ==
access to safe water adequate sanitation and proper hygiene education can reduce illness and death and also impact poverty reduction and socioeconomic development poor sanitation contributes to approximately 700,000 child deaths every year due to diarrhea and chronic diarrhea can have a negative effect on child development (both physical and cognitive) in addition lack of wash facilities can prevent students from attending school impose a burden on women and diminish productivity
the concept of wash groups together water sanitation and hygiene because the impact of deficiencies in each area overlap strongly and so need to be addressed together in order to achieve a strong positive impact on public health the uns millennium development goals include improvement of wash services in target 7.c halve by 2015 the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation however historically sanitation and hygiene have often received considerably less attention and funding than the issue of access to water in most wash programmes this has been slowly changing ever since the united nation's international year of sanitation in 2008 put the spotlight on the worldwide sanitation crisis the activities of new donors in the field of sanitation like the bill and melinda gates foundation with a strong focus on reuse of excreta have also helped to increase the focus on sanitation
== opportunities ==
=== possible approaches ===
researchers at the overseas development institute have promoted the value of political economy analysis to better understand the complexities of specific contexts when attempting to identify appropriate responses to wash challenges in developing countries they argue that best-practice models of wash service provision are unlikely to work when applied to real-world contexts according to the researchers political economy analysis can help to identify best fit solutions that take into account existing institutions policies and incentives and so stand a better chance of succeeding
=== neglected tropical diseases ===
water sanitation and hygiene interventions are essential in preventing many neglected tropical diseases (ntds) for example soil-transmitted helminthiasis a holistic and integrated approach to ntds and wash efforts will benefit both sectors along with the communities they are aiming to serve this is especially true in areas that are endemic with more than one ntd
a map has been created to help identify areas with high levels of infection with the wash-impacted ntds and low levels of rural improved water and sanitation coverage in addition wash practitioners can use the manual wash and the neglected tropical diseases a manual for wash implementers to target implement and monitor wash program impact on the ntds
in august 2015 the world health organization (who) unveiled a global strategy and action plan to integrate wash with other public health interventions in order to accelerate elimination of ntds the plan aims to intensify control or eliminate certain ntds in specific regions by 2020 it refers to the ntd roadmap milestones that included for example eradication of dracunculiasis by 2015 and of yaws by 2020 elimination of trachoma and lymphatic filariasis as public health problems by 2020 intensified control of dengue schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiases the plan consists of four strategic objectives improving awareness of benefits of joint wash and ntd actions monitoring wash and ntd actions to track progress strengthening evidence of how to deliver effective wash interventions and planning delivering and evaluating wash and ntd programmes with involvement of all stakeholders the aim is to use synergies between wash and ntd programmes
=== awareness raising ===
awareness raising for the importance of wash is regularly carried out by various organizations on some special days of the year as it is easier to obtain media coverage on those days these united nations international observance days include world water day (22 march) global handwashing day (15 october) world toilet day (26 november)
=== wash in schools (wins) ===
among its many benefits wash in schools (also referred to as wins) significantly reduces hygiene related disease increases student attendance and contributes to dignity and gender equality despite increasing awareness of the benefits of wins almost half of all schools in low-income countries still lack access to water and sanitation facilities wash in schools
provides healthy safe and secure school environments that can protect children from health hazards abuse and exclusion wins helps ensure quality education because children who are healthy and well nourished can fully participate in schooling quality education in turn leads to better health and nutrition outcomes especially for girls
encourages childrens pride in their schools and communities by providing dignity and privacy wins enables children to become agents of change for improving water sanitation and hygiene practices in their families and communities
invests in schoolchildren and the health of future generations wins helps children realize their full potential now and prepares them for healthy living as adults despite the significant benefits of wins more than half of all primary schools in the developing countries with available data do not have adequate water facilities and nearly two thirds lack adequate sanitation even where facilities exist they are often in poor condition
supervised daily group handwashing in schools can be an effective strategy for building hygiene habits with the potential to lead to positive health and education outcomes for children while the concept is relatively new there are already examples of group hand washing being incorporated into large scale programs
strong cultural taboos around menstruation which are present in many societies coupled with a lack of mhm services in schools results in many girls likely staying away from school during menstruation providing female students and staff with practical information and private and safe facilities for mhm contributes to dignity and gender equality and may decrease absenteeism
the possibility of wash in schools being included in the new set of global development goals represents a significant opportunity to raise the profile of wins
the strength of the current wash in schools evidence base upon which advocacy and programming are dependent is varied while the role of wins in improving health outcomes and boosting attendance among school children is now more recognized there remains a need to improve the evidence base around a range of areas including on the efficacy and effectiveness of wins programs
== monitoring ==
some national and local governments monitor water services regularly one example is the sistema de informacin de agua y saneamiento rural(rural water and sanitation information system)
for organizations that work on wash interventions monitoring means using indicators to measure effectiveness of a development program some organizations or research organizations do post-implementation monitoring which occurs after the wash intervention has been completed
the water point data exchange (wpdx) launched in 2015 is a global platform for sharing water point data collected by governments non-profit organizations researchers and others
== challenges ==
although access to sanitation has in general been improving over the past decades the world health organization estimates that even still 2.5 billion people more one third of the global population live without basic sanitation facilities in 2015 750 million people lack access to safe clean drinking water and approximately 2,300 people die every day from diarrhea part of the reason for slow progress in sanitation may be due to the urbanization of poverty as poverty is increasingly concentrated in urban areas migration to urban areas resulting in denser clusters of poverty poses a challenge for sanitation infrastructures that were not originally designed to serve so many households if they existed at all
as poverty becomes more concentrated in urban areas one increasingly common phenomenon is the expansion of urban slums often built illegally in response to a lack of more permanent housing slums have a specific set of problems associated with them for instance the lack of property rights and instability associated with a slum dwelling may mean that the resident would not be willing to invest in wash services for a building that may not survive a storm or from which she may be evicted in addition new urban areas may be very heterogeneousboth ethnically and in terms of wealth distribution they may face a constant influx of new migrants such heterogeneity may make it difficult to coordinate efforts to build and maintain a shared sanitation system for slum neighborhoods
a who report found that only one-third of the countries surveyed have national wash plans that are being fully implemented funded and regularly reviewed in most countries monitoring was inconsistent and there were critical gaps reliable data is essential to inform policy decision to monitoring and evaluate outcomes and to identify those who do not have access to wash many countries have wash monitoring frameworks in place but most of the data reported was inconsistent weakening evaluation and outcome data analysis
the main obstacle in the use and maintenance of improved water and sanitation systems is not the quality of technology but the failure in qualified human resources and in management and organization techniques including a failure to capture community interest
== failures of water supply systems ==
national government mapping and monitoring efforts as well as post-project monitoring by ngos or researchers have identified the failure of water supply systems (also known as water points wells boreholes or wells) and sanitation systems (one part of sanitation systems are the toilets) the following sections provide examples of those failures sorted by country

in a study commissioned by plan in 2013 nearly 5000 households in 116 villages were re-assessed according to the original open defecation free (odf) verification criteria of community-led total sanitation if all five criteria listed below are applied the overall slippage rate across the study was 92% in all countries each household was expected to have
a functioning latrine with a superstructure
a means of keeping flies from the pit
absence of excreta in the vicinity of the house
hand washing facilities with water and soap or soap-substitute such as ash
evidence that the latrine and hand washing facilities were being used
