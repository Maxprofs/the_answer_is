saliva is a watery substance located in the mouths of animals secreted by the salivary glands human saliva is 99.5% water while the other 0.5% consists of electrolytes mucus glycoproteins enzymes antibacterial and bacteria compounds such as secretory iga and lysozyme the enzymes found in saliva are essential in beginning the process of digestion of dietary starches and fats these enzymes also play a role in breaking down food particles entrapped within dental crevices protecting teeth from bacterial decay furthermore saliva serves a lubricative function wetting food and permitting the initiation of swallowing and protecting the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity from desiccation
various species have special uses for saliva that go beyond predigestion some swifts use their gummy saliva to build nests aerodramus nests are prized for use in bird's nest soup cobras vipers and certain other members of the venom clade hunt with venomous saliva injected by fangs some arthropods such as spiders and caterpillars create thread from salivary glands
== functionsedit ==
saliva contributes to the digestion of food and to the maintenance of oral hygiene without normal salivary function the frequency of dental caries gum disease (gingivitis) and other oral problems increases significantly
=== lubricantedit ===
saliva coats the oral mucosa mechanically protecting it from trauma during eating swallowing and speaking in people with little saliva (xerostomia) soreness of the mouth is very common and the food (especially dry food) sticks to the inside of the mouth
=== digestionedit ===
the digestive functions of saliva include moistening food and helping to create a food bolus this lubricative function of saliva allows the food bolus to be passed easily from the mouth into the esophagus saliva contains the enzyme amylase also called ptyalin which is capable of breaking down starch into simpler sugars such as maltose and dextrin that can be further broken down in the small intestine only about 30% starch digestion takes place in the mouth cavity salivary glands also secrete salivary lipase (a more potent form of lipase) to begin fat digestion salivary lipase plays a large role in fat digestion in newborn infants as their pancreatic lipase still needs some time to develop
=== ion reservoir buffer functionedit ===
saliva is supersaturated with various ions certain salivary proteins prevent precipitation which would form salts these ions act as a buffer keeping the acidity of the mouth within a certain range typically ph 6.27.4 this prevents minerals in the dental hard tissues from dissolving
=== hormonal functionedit ===
saliva secretes carbonic anhydrase (gustin) which is thought to play a role in the development of taste buds
=== role in tasteedit ===
saliva is very important in the sense of taste it is the liquid medium in which chemicals are carried to taste receptor cells (mostly associated with lingual papillae) persons with little saliva often complain of dysgeusia (i.e disordered taste e.g reduced ability to taste or having a bad metallic taste at all times)
=== wound lickingedit ===
a common belief is that saliva contained in the mouth has natural disinfectants which leads people to believe it is beneficial to lick their wounds researchers at the university of florida at gainesville have discovered a protein called nerve growth factor (ngf) in the saliva of mice wounds doused with ngf healed twice as fast as untreated and unlicked wounds therefore saliva can help to heal wounds in some species ngf has not been found in human saliva however researchers find human saliva contains such antibacterial agents as secretory iga lactoferrin lysozyme and peroxidase it has not been shown that human licking of wounds disinfects them but licking is likely to help clean the wound by removing larger contaminants such as dirt and may help to directly remove infective bodies by brushing them away therefore licking would be a way of wiping off pathogens useful if clean water is not available to the animal or person
the mouth of animals is the habitat of many bacteria some pathogenic some diseases such as herpes can be transmitted through the mouth animal and human bites are routinely treated with systemic antibiotics because of the risk of septicemia
=== glue to construct bird nestsedit ===
many birds in the swift family apodidae produce a viscous saliva during nesting season to glue together materials to construct a nest two species of swifts in the genus aerodramus build their nests using only their saliva the base for bird's nest soup
== stimulationedit ==
the production of saliva is stimulated both by the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic
the saliva stimulated by sympathetic innervation is thicker and saliva stimulated parasympathetically is more watery
sympathetic stimulation of saliva is to facilitate respiration whereas parasympathetic stimulation is to facilitate digestion
parasympathetic stimulation leads to acetylcholine (ach) release onto the salivary acinar cells ach binds to muscarinic receptors specifically m3 and causes an increased intracellular calcium ion concentration (through the ip3/dag second messenger system) increased calcium causes vesicles within the cells to fuse with the apical cell membrane leading to secretion ach also causes the salivary gland to release kallikrein an enzyme that converts kininogen to lysyl-bradykinin lysyl-bradykinin acts upon blood vessels and capillaries of the salivary gland to generate vasodilation and increased capillary permeability respectively the resulting increased blood flow to the acini allows production of more saliva in addition substance p can bind to tachykinin nk-1 receptors leading to increased intracellular calcium concentrations and subsequently increased saliva secretion lastly both parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous stimulation can lead to myoepitheilium contraction which causes the expulsion of secretions from the secretory acinus into the ducts and eventually to the oral cavity
sympathetic stimulation results in the release of norepinephrine norepinephrine binding to -adrenergic receptors will cause an increase in intracellular calcium levels leading to more fluid vs protein secretion if norepinephrine binds -adrenergic receptors it will result in more protein or enzyme secretion vs fluid secretion stimulation by norepinephrine initially decreases blood flow to the salivary glands due to constriction of blood vessels but this effect is overtaken by vasodilation caused by various local vasodilators
saliva production may also be pharmacologically stimulated by so-called sialagogues it can also be suppressed by so-called antisialagogues
== daily salivary outputedit ==
there is much debate about the amount of saliva that is produced in a healthy person per day estimates range from 0.75 to 1.5 litres per day while it is generally accepted that during sleep the amount drops to almost zero in humans the submandibular gland contributes around 7075% of secretion while the parotid gland secretes about 2025% and small amounts are secreted from the other salivary glands
== contentsedit ==
produced in salivary glands human saliva is 99.5% water but it contains many important substances including electrolytes mucus antibacterial compounds and various enzymes
it is a fluid containing
water
electrolytes
221 mmol/l sodium (lower than blood plasma)
1036 mmol/l potassium (higher than plasma)
1.22.8 mmol/l calcium (similar to plasma)
0.080.5 mmol/l magnesium
540 mmol/l chloride (lower than plasma)
25 mmol/l bicarbonate (higher than plasma)
1.439 mmol/l phosphate
iodine (mmol/l concentration is usually higher than plasma but dependent variable according to dietary iodine intake)
mucus (mucus in saliva mainly consists of mucopolysaccharides and glycoproteins)
antibacterial compounds (thiocyanate hydrogen peroxide and secretory immunoglobulin a)
epidermal growth factor (egf)
various enzymes there are three major enzymes found in saliva
-amylase (ec3.2.1.1) or ptyalin secreted by the acinar cells of the parotid and submandibular glands starts the digestion of starch before the food is even swallowed it has a ph optimum of 7.4
lingual lipase which is secreted by the acinar cells of the sublingual gland has a ph optimum around 4.0 so it is not activated until entering the acidic environment of the stomach
kallikrein an enzyme that proteolytically cleaves high-molecular-weight kininogen to produce bradykinin which is a vasodilator it is secreted by the acinar cells of all three major salivary glands
antimicrobial enzymes that kill bacteria
lysozyme
salivary lactoperoxidase
lactoferrin
immunoglobulin a
proline-rich proteins (function in enamel formation ca2+-binding microbe killing and lubrication)
minor enzymes include salivary acid phosphatases a+b n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase nad(p)h dehydrogenase (quinone) superoxide dismutase glutathione transferase class 3 aldehyde dehydrogenase glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and tissue kallikrein (function unknown)
cells possibly as many as 8 million human and 500 million bacterial cells per ml the presence of bacterial products (small organic acids amines and thiols) causes saliva to sometimes exhibit foul odor
opiorphin a pain-killing substance found in human saliva
haptocorrin a protein which binds to vitamin b12 to protect it against degradation in the stomach before it binds to intrinsic factor
== spittingedit ==
spitting is the act of forcibly ejecting saliva or other substances from the mouth it is often considered rude and a social taboo in many parts of the world including western countries where it is frequently forbidden by local laws (as it was thought to facilitate the spread of disease) these laws are generally not strictly enforced in singapore the fine for spitting may be as high as singapore dollar $2,000 for multiple offenses and one can even be arrested in some other parts of the world expectoration is more socially acceptable (even if officially disapproved of or illegal) and spittoons are still a common appearance in some cultures some animals in some cases humans as well will use spitting as an automatic defensive move camels are well known for doing this however most tamed camels are trained to not spit things when they are agitated scared etc
