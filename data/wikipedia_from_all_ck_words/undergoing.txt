catocala is a generally holarctic genus of moths in the erebidae family the moths are commonly known as underwing moths or simply underwings these terms are sometimes used for a few related moths but usually especially when used in plural not as part of a species name they are used to refer to catocala only
of the more than 250 known species slightly less than half are found in north america mostly in the united states while the rest occur in eurasia about one-fifth (almost 30) of these species are native to europe a few species occur in the northern neotropics and indomalaya
== description and ecology ==
most species of catocala have medium to large adults cryptically coloured except for the hindwings which are marked with stripes in orange red white or even blue in some the hindwings are mostly blackish unlike what the common name underwings seems to suggest the colour is brightest on the upperside however the bright hindwings are not visible at rest being hidden under the dull forewings hence the name due to their diversity and variety of colors and patterns underwing moths are popular with collectors of lepidoptera
it is believed that the bright colors arranged in usually roughly concentric markings at a casual glance resemble the eyes of a predatory animal such as a cat an underwing moth well camouflaged in its daytime resting spot on a tree trunk or branch will suddenly flash open the hindwings when disturbed a bird or other small predator that is not used to this display is likely to be frightened allowing the moth to escape however unlike some other bright-colored moths which are bad-tasting or even poisonous to predators underwing moths are well palatable at least to some birds (e.g the blue jay cyanocitta cristata) to assist in avoiding nocturnal predators such as bats these moths also possess (like many of their relatives) fairly well-developed hearing organs
the caterpillars of most species feed on the leaves of woody plants usually trees but sometimes shrubs typical foodplants are fagales of the families betulaceae fagaceae and juglandaceae mainly hickory (carya) oak (quercus) and walnut tree (juglans) species as well as others such as alder (alnus) beech (fagus) birch (betula) and chestnut (castanea) the caterpillars of numerous old world and some north american species feed on the salicaceae populus (poplars) and salix (willows) which belong to the malpighiales less common larval foodplants of catocala are for example elms (ulmus) and various rosaceae of the rosales tilia (linden and basswood) of the malvales or some fabaceae of the fabales as the preceding these all belong to the fabidae lineage of rosid eudicots more unusually underwing moth caterpillars have also been found to feed on such plants as maple (acer) which belongs to a distant lineage of rosids as well as on such plants as ash trees (fraxinus) and blueberries (vaccinium) which are asterids and quite unrelated to the other foodplants by eudicot standards
the adults are predominantly nocturnal flying from shortly after dusk right up to daybreak they are generally most active about two hours after nightfall however several if not all species of underwing moths have a second activity period exactly around noon during which they are also regularly found on the wing for about 12 hours each day
the genus name catocala roughly means beautiful hindwings it is a combination of two ancient greek words kato ( the rear one or the lower one") and kalos ( beautiful")
== classification ==
the species of catocala are here divided into a eurasian group and another one which is found in north america this does not imply actual relationships it is mainly done to more conveniently deal with the large number of species still it is not unlikely at all that the groups consist at least to some extent of closely related species
there are several cryptic species complexes in catocala e.g the group around the delilah underwing (c delilah) these and other hitherto unknown species are still being discovered and described in some numbers thus resolving the phylogeny and taxonomy of the underwing moths is an ongoing effort which has made (as of 2011) little progress in the scientific literature smaller subdivisions into putatively related species are sometimes applied but there is no consistent and widely accepted taxonomic treatment for the genus as a whole
=== synonyms ===
several distinct genera have formally been proposed for splitting from catocala but these are all treated here as junior synonyms these synonyms and other invalid names of catocala are

== other underwing moths ==
as noted in the introduction some species besides the catocala species are also commonly known as underwings typically however the name is used with a qualifier such as a color term in these cases non-catocala underwing moths are typically owlet moths namely subfamily catocalinae
beautiful yellow underwing (anarta myrtilli)
brown underwing (minucia lunaris)
locust underwing (euparthenos nubilis)
(european) white underwing (catephia alchymista) in north america white underwing typically refers to catocala relicta
subfamily amphipyrinae
copper underwing (amphipyra pyramidea)
svensson's copper underwing (amphipyra berbera)
subfamily erebinae
false underwing moth (allotria elonympha)
subfamily hadeninae
black underwing (mormo maura)
blossom underwing (orthosia miniosa)
broad-bordered white underwing (hadula melanopa)
guernsey underwing (polyphaenis sericata)
lunar underwing (omphaloscelis lunosa)
small dark yellow underwing (coranarta cordigera)
small yellow underwing (panemeria tenebrata)
straw underwing (thalpophila matura)
subfamily noctuinae
pearly underwing (peridroma saucia)
yellow underwings proper some 15 species in the genus noctua
however the orange underwings are two species of genus archiearis of the geometer moth family (geometridae)
orange underwing (archiearis parthenias)
light orange underwing (archiearis notha)
