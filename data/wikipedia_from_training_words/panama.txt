panama (/pnm/ pan--mah spanish panam [panama]) officially called the republic of panama (spanish repblica de panam) is a country in central america situated between north and south america it is bordered by costa rica to the west colombia to the southeast the caribbean to the north and the pacific ocean to the south the capital and largest city is panama city whose metro area is home to nearly half of the country's 4.1 million people
panama was inhabited by several indigenous tribes prior to settlement by the spanish in the 16th century panama broke away from spain in 1821 and joined a union of nueva granada ecuador and venezuela named the republic of gran colombia when gran colombia dissolved in 1831 panama and nueva granada remained joined eventually becoming the republic of colombia with the backing of the united states panama seceded from colombia in 1903 allowing the panama canal to be built by the u.s army corps of engineers between 1904 and 1914 in 1977 an agreement was signed for the total transfer of the canal from the united states to panama by the end of the 20th century which culminated on 31 december 1999
revenue from canal tolls continues to represent a significant portion of panama's gdp although commerce banking and tourism are major and growing sectors panama has the second largest economy in central america and is also the fastest growing economy and largest per capita consumer in central america in 2013 panama ranked 5th among latin american countries in terms of the human development index and 59th in the world since 2010 panama remains the second most competitive economy in latin america according to the world economic forum's global competitiveness index covering around 40 percent of its land area panama's jungles are home to an abundance of tropical plants and animals some of them to be found nowhere else on the planet
== etymologyedit ==
there are several theories about the origin of the name panama some believe that the country was named after a commonly found species of tree (sterculia apetala the panama tree) others believe that the first settlers arrived in panama in august when butterflies abound and that the name means many butterflies in an indigenous language
the best-known version is that a fishing village and its nearby beach bore the name panam which meant an abundance of fish captain antonio tello de guzmn while exploring the pacific side in 1515 stopped in the small indigenous fishing town this was communicated to the crown and in 1517 don gaspar de espinosa a spanish lieutenant decided to settle a post there in 1519 pedrarias dvila decided to establish the empire's pacific city in this site the new settlement replaced santa mara la antigua del darin which had lost its function within the crown's global plan after the beginning of the spanish exploitation of the riches in the pacific
blending all of the above together panamanians believe in general that the word panama means abundance of fish trees and butterflies this is the official definition given in social studies textbooks approved by the ministry of education in panama however others believe the word panama comes from the kuna word bannaba which means distant or far away
== historyedit ==
at the time of the arrival of the spanish in the 16th century the known inhabitants of panama included the cuevas and the cocl tribes these people have nearly disappeared as they had no immunity from european infectious diseases
=== pre-columbian periodedit ===
the isthmus of panama was formed about 3 million years ago when the land bridge between north and south america finally closed after which plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions the existence of the isthmus had an impact on the dispersal of people agriculture and technology throughout the american continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities
the earliest artifacts discovered of indigenous peoples in panama have included paleo-indians projectile points later central panama was home to some of the first pottery-making in the americas such as the monagrillo cultures dating to about 25001700 bc these evolved into significant populations that are best known through the spectacular burials (dating to c 500900 ad) at the monagrillo archaeological site and the beautiful polychrome pottery of the gran cocl style the monumental monolithic sculptures at the barriles (chiriqui) site are other important evidence of the ancient isthmian cultures
prior to the arrival of europeans panama was widely settled by chibchan chocoan and cueva peoples among whom the largest group were the cueva (whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented) there is no accurate knowledge of the size of the indigenous population of the isthmus at the time of the european conquest estimates range as high as two million people but more recent studies place that number closer to 200,000 archaeological finds as well as testimonials by early european explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people already conditioned by regular regional routes of commerce
when panama was colonized the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands scholars believe that among the various contributing factors infectious disease was the main cause of the population decline of the american natives the indigenous peoples had no acquired immunity to such diseases which had been chronic in eurasian populations for centuries
=== conquest to 1799edit ===
rodrigo de bastidas sailing westward from venezuela in 1501 in search of gold was the first european to explore the isthmus of panama a year later christopher columbus visited the isthmus and established a short-lived settlement in the darien vasco nez de balboa's tortuous trek from the atlantic to the pacific in 1513 demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas and panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of spain's empire in the new world gold and silver were brought by ship from south america hauled across the isthmus and loaded aboard ships for spain the route became known as the camino real or royal road although it was more commonly known as camino de cruces (road of the crosses) because of the abundance of gravesites along the way
panama under spanish rule for almost 300 years (15381821) became part of the viceroyalty of peru along with all other spanish possessions in south america from the outset panamanian identity was based on a sense of geographic destiny and panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus the colonial experience also spawned panamanian nationalism as well as a racially complex and highly stratified society the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism
in 1538 the real audiencia de panama was established initially with jurisdiction from nicaragua to cape horn before the conquest of peru a real audiencia (royal audiency) was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court each audiencia had oidores (spanish hearer a judge)
spanish authorities exercised little control over much of the territory of panama large sections managing to resist conquest until very late in the colonial era because of this indigenous people of the area were often referred to as indios de guerra (war indians) and resisted spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them however panama was enormously important to spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in peru to europe silver cargos were landed at panama and then taken overland to portobello or nombre de dios on the caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment
because of the incomplete spanish control the panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates (mostly dutch and english) and from new world africans called cimarrons who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or palenques around the camino real in panama's interior and on some of the islands off panama's pacific coast one such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under bayano which emerged in the 1552 to 1558 sir francis drake's famous raids on panama in 157273 were aided by panama cimarrons and spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in 1582
the prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries (15401740) while contributing to colonial growth the placing of extensive regional judicial authority (real audiencia) as part of its jurisdiction and the pivotal role it played at the height of the spanish empire the first modern global empire helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within panama well before the rest of the colonies
the end of the encomienda system in azuero however sparked the conquest of veraguas in that same year under the leadership of francisco vzquez the region of veraguas passed into castillan rule in 1558 in the newly conquered region the old system of encomienda was imposed on the other hand the panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolishment of the encomienda system in the azuero peninsula set forth by the spanish crown in 1558 because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population in its stead a system of medium and smaller-sized landownership was promoted thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and small sized proprietors
panama was the site of the ill-fated darien scheme which set up a scottish colony in the region in 1698 this failed for a number of reasons and the ensuing debt contributed to the union of england and scotland in 1707
in 1671 the privateer henry morgan licensed by the english government sacked and burned the city of panama the second most important city in the spanish new world at the time in 1717 the viceroyalty of new granada (northern south america) was created in response to other europeans trying to take spanish territory in the caribbean region the isthmus of panama was placed under its jurisdiction however the remoteness of new granada's capital santa fe de bogot (the modern capital of colombia) proved a greater obstacle than the spanish crown anticipated as the authority of new granada was contested by the seniority closer proximity and previous ties to the viceroyalty of lima and even by panama's own initiative this uneasy relationship between panama and bogot would persist for centuries
in 1744 bishop francisco javier de luna victoria decastro established the college of san ignacio de loyola and on june 3 1749 founded la real y pontificia universidad de san javier by this time however panama's importance and influence had become insignificant as spain's power dwindled in europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted to round cape horn in order to reach the pacific while the panama route was short it was also labor-intensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and laden-down trek required to get from the one coast to the other
during the last half of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century migrations to the countryside decreased panama city's population and the isthmus economy shifted from the tertiary to the primary sector
==== 1800sedit ====
as the spanish american wars of independence were heating up all across latin america panama city was preparing for independence however their plans were accelerated by the unilateral grito de la villa de los santos (cry from the town of saints) issued on november 10 1821 by the residents of azuero without backing from panama city to declare their separation from the spanish empire in both veraguas and the capital this act was met with disdain although on differing levels to veraguas it was the ultimate act of treason while to the capital it was seen as inefficient and irregular and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans
nevertheless the grito was an event that shook the isthmus to its very core it was a sign on the part of the residents of azuero of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital those in the capital region in turn regarded the azueran movement with contempt since the separatists in panama city believed that their counterparts in azuero were fighting not only for independence from spain but also for their right to self-rule apart from panama city once the spaniards were gone
it was an incredibly brave move on the part of azuero which lived in fear of colonel jos pedro antonio de fbrega y de las cuevas (17741841) and with good reason the colonel was a staunch loyalist and had the entirety of the isthmus military supplies in his hands they feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists
what they had counted on however was the influence of the separatists in the capital ever since october 1821 when the former governor general juan de la cruz murgen left the isthmus on a campaign in quito and left the veraguan colonel in charge the separatists had been slowly converting fbrega to the separatist side as such by november 10 fbrega was now a supporter of the independence movement soon after the separatist declaration of los santos fbrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the city's support for independence no military repercussions occurred because of the skillful bribing of royalist troops
=== post-colonial panamaedit ===
in the first eighty years following independence from spain panama was a department of colombia since voluntarily becoming part of it at the end of 1821 the people of the isthmus made several attempts to secede and came close to success in 1831 and again during the thousand days war of 18991902 when the senate of colombia rejected the hayherrn treaty the united states decided to support the panamanian independence movement
in november 1903 panama proclaimed its independence and concluded the haybunau-varilla treaty with the united states the treaty granted rights to the united states as if it were sovereign in a zone roughly 16 km (10 mi) wide and 80 km (50 mi) long in that zone the u.s would build a canal then administer fortify and defend it in perpetuity in 1914 the united states completed the existing 83 km (52 mi) canal the early 1960s saw the beginning of sustained pressure in panama for the renegotiation of this treaty
the united states of america's intentions to influence the area (especially the panama canal construction and control) led to the separation of panama from colombia in 1903 and the establishment of it as a nation (the united states intensively encouraged the panamanian separatist movement) from 1903 until 1968 panama was a constitutional democracy dominated by a commercially oriented oligarchy during the 1950s the panamanian military began to challenge the oligarchy's political hegemony
amid negotiations for the roblesjohnson treaty panama held elections in 1968 the candidates were dr arnulfo arias madrid antonio gonzlez revilla and engineer david samudio who had the government's support samudio was the candidate of alianza del pueblo ("people's alliance") arias madrid was the candidate of unin nacional ("national union") and gonzlez revilla was the candidate of democracia cristiana ("christian democrats") (see pizzurno gels and araz estudios sobre el panam republicano 508)
arias madrid was declared the winner of elections that were marked by violence and accusations of fraud against alianza del pueblo on october 1 1968 arias madrid took office as president of panama promising to lead a government of national union that would end the reigning corruption and pave the way for a new panama a week and a half later on october 11 1968 the national guard (guardia nacional) ousted arias and initiated the downward spiral that would culminate with the united states invasion in 1989 arias who had promised to respect the hierarchy of the national guard broke the pact and started a large restructuring of the guard to preserve the guard's interests lieutenant colonel omar torrijos herrera and major boris martnez commanded the first coup of a military force against a civilian government in panamanian republican history
the military justified itself by declaring that arias madrid was trying to install a dictatorship and promised a return to constitutional rule in the meantime the guard began a series of populist measures that would gain support for the coup among them were the freezing of prices on food medicine and other goods until january 31 1969 the freezing of renting prices and the legalization of the permanence of squatting families in boroughs surrounding the historic site of panama viejo parallel to this the military began a policy of repression against the opposition who were labeled communists the military appointed a provisional government junta that would arrange new elections however the national guard would prove to be very reluctant to abandon power and soon began calling itself el gobierno revolucionario ("the revolutionary government")
==== post-1970edit ====
during omar torrijos's control the military regime transformed the political and economic structure of the country by initiating massive coverage of social security services and expanding public education the constitution was changed in 1972 for the reform to the constitution the military created a new organization the assembly of corregimiento representatives which replaced the national assembly the new assembly also known as the poder popular ("power of the people") was composed of 505 members selected by the military without the participation of political parties which had been eliminated by the military the new constitution proclaimed omar torrijos the maximum leader of the panamanian revolution and conceded him unlimited power for six years although to keep a faade of constitutionality demetrio b lakas was appointed president for the same period (pizzurno gels and araz estudios sobre el panam republicano 541)
in 1981 torrijos died in a plane crash torrijos death altered the tone of panama's political evolution despite the 1983 constitutional amendments which proscribed a political role for the military the panama defense forces (pdf) as they were then known continued to dominate panamanian political life by this time general manuel noriega was firmly in control of both the pdf and the civilian government
in the 1984 elections the candidates were nicols ardito barletta vallarino supported by the military in a union called unade dr arnulfo arias madrid for the opposition union ado the ex-general rubn daro paredes who had been forced to an early retirement by noriega running for partido nacionalista popular pnp ("popular nationalist party") and carlos ivn ziga running for partido accin popular (papo) meaning popular action party nicols ardito barletta was declared the winner of elections that had been clearly won by arnulfo arias madrid ardito barletta inherited a country in economic ruin and hugely indebted to the imf and the world bank amid the economic crisis and barletta's efforts to calm the country's creditors street protests arose and so did military repression
meanwhile noriega's regime had fostered the development of a well-hidden criminal economy that operated as a parallel source of income for the military and their allies providing revenues from drugs and money laundering toward the end of the military dictatorship a new wave of chinese migrants arrived on the isthmus in the hope of migrating to the united states the smuggling of chinese became an enormous business with revenues of up to 200 million dollars for noriega's regime (see mon 167)
the military dictatorship at that time supported by the united states perpetrated the assassination and torture of more than one hundred panamanians and forced into exile at least another hundred dissidents (see zrate 15) noriega also began playing a double role in central america under the supervision of the cia while the contadora group conducted diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region noriega supplied the nicaraguan contras and other guerrillas in the region with weapons and ammunition
on june 6 1987 the recently retired colonel roberto daz herrera resentful for noriega's violation of the torrijos plan of succession that would turn him into the chief of the military after noriega decided to denounce the regime he revealed details of the electoral fraud accused noriega of planning torrijos's death declared that torrijos had received 12 million dollars from the shah of iran so that panama would give the exiled iranian leader asylum and blamed noriega for the assassination by decapitation of opposition leader dr hugo spadafora
on the night of june 9 1987 the cruzada civilista ("civic crusade") was created and began organizing actions of civil disobedience the crusade called for a general strike in response the military suspended constitutional rights and declared a state of emergency in the country on july 10 the civic crusade called for a massive demonstration that was violently repressed by the dobermans the military's special riot control unit that day later known as el viernes negro ("black friday") left six hundred people injured and another six hundred detained many of whom were later tortured and raped
united states president ronald reagan began a series of sanctions against the military regime the united states froze economic and military assistance to panama in the summer of 1987 in response to the domestic political crisis in panama and an attack on the u.s embassy yet these sanctions did little to overthrow noriega but instead severely damaged panama's economy the sanctions hit the panamanian population hard and caused the gross domestic product (gdp) to decline almost 25% between 19871989 (see acosta n.p.)
on february 5 1988 general manuel antonio noriega was accused of drug trafficking by federal juries in tampa and miami
in april 1988 the u.s president ronald reagan invoked the international emergency economic powers act freezing panamanian government assets in all u.s organizations in may 1989 panamanians voted overwhelmingly for the anti-noriega candidates the noriega regime promptly annulled the election and embarked on a new round of repression
==== u.s invasion (1989)edit ====
the united states government justified operation just cause which commenced on december 20 1989 as necessary to safeguard the lives of u.s citizens in panama defend democracy and human rights combat drug trafficking and secure the neutrality of the canal as required by the torrijoscarter treaties (new york times a transcript of president bush's address n.p.) human rights watch wrote in the 1989 report washington turned a blind eye to abuses in panama for many years until concern over drug trafficking prompted indictments of the general [noriega] by two grand juries in florida in february 1988 the u.s reported 23 servicemen killed and 324 wounded with estimated panamanian casualties around 450 although described as a surgical maneuver the action led to civilian deaths whose estimated numbers range from 400 to 4,000 during the two weeks of armed activities in the largest united states military operation to that date since the end of the vietnam war (cajar pez 22) the united nations put the panamanian civilian death toll at 500 others had larger numbers the number of u.s civilians (and their dependents) who had worked for the panama canal commission and the u.s military and were killed by the panamanian defense forces has never been fully disclosed
on december 29 the un general assembly approved a resolution calling the intervention in panama a flagrant violation of international law and of the independence sovereignty and territorial integrity of the states the resolution was vetoed by the united states united kingdom and france
the urban population with many living below the poverty level was greatly affected by the 1989 intervention as pointed out in 1995 by a un technical assistance mission to panama the bombardments during the invasion caused the displacement of 20,000 people the most heavily affected district was impoverished el chorrillo where several blocks of apartments were completely destroyed el chorrillo had been since canal construction days a series of wooden barracks these easily caught fire under the united states attack the economic damage caused by the intervention has been estimated to be between 1.5 and 2 billion dollars n.p many panamanians supported the intervention
=== post-intervention eraedit ===
panama's electoral tribunal moved quickly to restore the civilian constitutional government reinstated the results of the may 1989 election on december 27 1989 and confirmed the victory of president guillermo endara and vice presidents guillermo ford and ricardo arias calderon
during its five-year term the often-fractious government struggled to meet the public's high expectations its new police force was a major improvement over its predecessor but was not fully able to deter crime ernesto prez balladares was sworn in as president on september 1 1994 after an internationally monitored election campaign
perez balladares ran as the candidate for a three-party coalition dominated by the democratic revolutionary party (prd) the erstwhile political arm of military dictatorships perez balladares worked skillfully during the campaign to rehabilitate the prd's image emphasizing the party's populist torrijos roots rather than its association with noriega he won the election with only 33% of the vote when the major non-prd forces splintered into competing factions his administration carried out economic reforms and often worked closely with the u.s on implementation of the canal treaties
on september 1 1999 mireya moscoso the widow of former president arnulfo arias madrid took office after defeating prd candidate martin torrijos son of omar torrijos in a free and fair election during her administration moscoso attempted to strengthen social programs especially for child and youth development protection and general welfare moscoso's administration successfully handled the panama canal transfer and was effective in the administration of the canal
the prd's martin torrijos won the presidency and a legislative majority in the national assembly in 2004 torrijos ran his campaign on a platform of among other pledges a zero tolerance for corruption a problem endemic to the moscoso and perez balladares administrations after taking office torrijos passed a number of laws which made the government more transparent he formed a national anti-corruption council whose members represented the highest levels of government as well as civil society labor organizations and religious leadership in addition many of his closest cabinet ministers were non-political technocrats known for their support for the torrijos government's anti-corruption aims despite the torrijos administration's public stance on corruption many high-profile cases particularly involving political or business elites were never acted upon
conservative supermarket magnate ricardo martinelli was elected to succeed martin torrijos with a landslide victory at the may 2009 presidential election mr martinelli's business credentials drew voters worried by slowing growth due to the world financial crisis standing for the four-party opposition alliance for change mr martinelli gained 60% of the vote against 37% for the candidate of the governing left-wing democratic revolutionary party
on may 4 2014 juan carlos varela won the 2014 presidential election with over 39% of the votes against the party of his former political partner ricardo martinelli cambio democrtico and their candidate jos domingo arias he was sworn in on 1 july 2014
== geographyedit ==
panama is located in central america bordering both the caribbean sea and the pacific ocean between colombia and costa rica it mostly lies between latitudes 7 and 10n and longitudes 77 and 83w (a small area lies west of 83)
its location on the isthmus of panama is strategic by 2000 panama controlled the panama canal which connects the atlantic ocean and the caribbean sea to the north of the pacific ocean panama's total area is 75,515 km2
the dominant feature of panama's landform is the central spine of mountains and hills that forms the continental divide the divide does not form part of the great mountain chains of north america and only near the colombian border are there highlands related to the andean system of south america the spine that forms the divide is the highly eroded arch of an uplift from the sea bottom in which peaks were formed by volcanic intrusions
the mountain range of the divide is called the cordillera de talamanca near the costa rican border farther east it becomes the serrana de tabasar and the portion of it closer to the lower saddle of the isthmus where the panama canal is located is often called the sierra de veraguas as a whole the range between costa rica and the canal is generally referred to by geographers as the cordillera central
the highest point in the country is the volcn bar which rises to 3,475 metres (11,401 ft) a nearly impenetrable jungle forms the darin gap between panama and colombia where colombian guerrilla and drug dealers are operating with hostage-taking this and forest protection movements create a break in the pan-american highway which otherwise forms a complete road from alaska to patagonia
panama's wildlife holds the most diversity of all the countries in central america it is home to many south american species as well as north american wildlife
=== waterwaysedit ===
nearly 500 rivers lace panama's rugged landscape mostly unnavigable many originate as swift highland streams meander in valleys and form coastal deltas however the ro chagres (rio chagres) located in central panama is one of the few wide rivers and a source of enormous hydroelectric power the central part of the river is dammed by the gatun dam and forms gatun lake an artificial lake that constitutes part of the panama canal the lake was created between 1907 and 1913 by the building of the gatun dam across the chagres river when it was created gatun lake was the largest man-made lake in the world and the dam was the largest earth dam the river drains northwest into the caribbean the kampia and madden lakes (also filled from the ro chagres) provide hydroelectricity for the area of the former canal zone
the ro chepo another source of hydroelectric power is one of the more than 300 rivers emptying into the pacific these pacific-oriented rivers are longer and slower running than those of the caribbean side their basins are also more extensive one of the longest is the ro tuira which flows into the golfo de san miguel and is the nation's only river navigable by larger vessels
=== harborsedit ===
the caribbean coastline is marked by several good natural harbors however cristbal at the caribbean terminus of the canal had the only important port facilities in the late 1980s the numerous islands of the archipilago de bocas del toro near the beaches of costa rica provide an extensive natural roadstead and shield the banana port of almirante the over 350 san blas islands near colombia are strung out for more than 160 km along the sheltered caribbean coastline
currently the terminal ports located at each end of the panama canal namely the port of cristobal and the port of balboa are ranked second and third respectively in latin america in terms of numbers of containers units (teu) handled the port of balboa covers 182 hectares and contains four berths for containers and two multi-purpose berths in total the berths are over 2,400 meters long with alongside depth of 15 meters the port of balboa has 18 super post-panamax and panamax quay cranes and 44 gantry cranes the port of balboa also contains 2,100 square meters of warehouse space
the ports of cristobal (encompassing the container terminals of panama ports cristobal manzanillo international terminal and colon container terminal) handled 2,210,720 teu in 2009 second only to the port of santos brazil in latin america
excellent deep water ports capable of accommodating large vlcc (very large crude oil carriers) are located at charco azul chiriqu (pacific) and chiriqu grande bocas del toro (atlantic) near panama's western border with costa rica the trans-panama pipeline running across the isthmus with a length of 131 km has been operating between charco azul and chiriqu grande since 1979
=== climateedit ===
panama has a tropical climate temperatures are uniformly highas is the relative humidityand there is little seasonal variation diurnal ranges are low on a typical dry-season day in the capital city the early morning minimum may be 24 c (75.2 f) and the afternoon maximum 30 c (86.0 f) the temperature seldom exceeds 32 c (89.6 f) for more than a short time temperatures on the pacific side of the isthmus are somewhat lower than on the caribbean and breezes tend to rise after dusk in most parts of the country temperatures are markedly cooler in the higher parts of the mountain ranges and frosts occur in the cordillera de talamanca in western panama
climatic regions are determined less on the basis of temperature than on rainfall which varies regionally from less than 1,300 millimeters (51.2 in) to more than 3,000 millimeters (118.1 in) per year almost all of the rain falls during the rainy season which is usually from april to december but varies in length from seven to nine months in general rainfall is much heavier on the caribbean than on the pacific side of the continental divide the annual average in panama city is little more than half of that in coln although rainy-season thunderstorms are common the country is outside the hurricane belt
panama's tropical environment supports an abundance of plants forests dominate interrupted in places by grasslands scrub and crops although nearly 40% of panama is still wooded deforestation is a continuing threat to the rain-drenched woodlands tree cover has been reduced by more than 50% since the 1940s subsistence farming widely practiced from the northeastern jungles to the southwestern grasslands consists largely of corn bean and tuber plots mangrove swamps occur along parts of both coasts with banana plantations occupying deltas near costa rica in many places a multi-canopied rain forest abuts the swamp on one side of the country and extends to the lower reaches of slopes in the other
