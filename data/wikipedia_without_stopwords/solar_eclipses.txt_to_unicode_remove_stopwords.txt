typesedit
four types solar eclipses
total eclipse occurs dark silhouette moon completely obscures intensely bright light sun allowing much fainter solar corona visible one eclipse totality occurs best narrow track surface earth
annular eclipse occurs sun moon exactly line apparent size moon smaller sun hence sun appears bright ring annulus surrounding dark disk moon
hybrid eclipse also called annulartotal eclipse shifts total annular eclipse certain points surface earth appears total eclipse whereas points appears annular hybrid eclipses comparatively rare
partial eclipse occurs sun moon exactly line moon partially obscures sun phenomenon usually seen large part earth outside track annular total eclipse however eclipses seen partial eclipse umbra passes earths polar regions never intersects earths surface partial eclipses virtually unnoticeable takes well coverage notice darkening even would darker civil twilighthttpwwwheliodysseyorgeclipsefactshtml
suns distance earth times moons distance suns diameter times moons diameter ratios approximately sun moon seen earth appear approximately size degree arc angular measure
separate category solar eclipses sun occluded body earths moon observed points space away earths surface two examples crew apollo observed earth eclipse sun cassini probe observed saturn eclipsing sun
moons orbit around earth ellipse earths orbit around sun apparent sizes sun moon therefore vary magnitude eclipse ratio apparent size moon apparent size sun eclipse eclipse occurs moon near closest distance earth ie near perigee total eclipse moon appear large enough completely cover suns bright disk photosphere total eclipse magnitude greater conversely eclipse occurs moon near farthest distance earth ie near apogee annular eclipse moon appear slightly smaller sun magnitude annular eclipse less slightly solar eclipses annular total average moon lies far earth cover sun completely hybrid eclipse occurs magnitude eclipse changes event less greater one eclipse appears total locations earth annular locations
earths orbit around sun also elliptical earths distance sun similarly varies throughout year affects apparent size sun way much moons varying distance earth earth approaches farthest distance sun july total eclipse somewhat likely whereas conditions favour annular eclipse earth approaches closest distance sun january
terminology central eclipseedit
central eclipse often used generic term total annular hybrid eclipse however completely correct definition central eclipse eclipse central line umbra touches earths surface possible though extremely rare part umbra intersects earth thus creating annular total eclipse central line called noncentral total annular eclipse last noncentral solar eclipse april annular eclipse next noncentral total solar eclipse april
phases observed total eclipse called
first contactwhen moons limb edge exactly tangential suns limb
second contactstarting bailys beads caused light shining valleys moons surface diamond ring effect almost entire disk covered

geometryedit
diagrams right show alignment sun moon earth solar eclipse dark gray region moon earth umbra sun completely obscured moon small area umbra touches earths surface total eclipse seen larger light gray area penumbra partial eclipse seen observer antumbra area shadow beyond umbra see annular eclipse
moons orbit around earth inclined angle degrees plane earths orbit around sun ecliptic time new moon moon usually pass north south sun solar eclipse occur new moon occurs close one points known nodes moons orbit crosses ecliptic
noted moons orbit also elliptical moons distance earth vary average value therefore moons apparent size varies distance earth effect leads difference total annular eclipses distance earth sun also varies year smaller effect average moon appears slightly smaller sun seen earth majority central eclipses annular moon closer earth average near perigee total eclipse occurs
moon orbits earth approximately days relative fixed frame reference known sidereal month however one sidereal month earth revolved part way around sun making average time one new moon next longer sidereal month approximately days known synodic month corresponds commonly called lunar month
moon crosses south north ecliptic ascending node vice versa descending node however nodes moons orbit gradually moving retrograde motion due action suns gravity moons motion make complete circuit every years regression means time passage moon ascending node slightly shorter sidereal month period called nodical draconic month
finally moons perigee moving forwards precessing orbit makes complete circuit years time one perigee next slightly longer sidereal month known anomalistic month
moons orbit intersects ecliptic two nodes degrees apart therefore new moon occurs close nodes two periods year approximately six months days apart known eclipse seasons always least one solar eclipse periods sometimes new moon occurs close enough node two consecutive months eclipse sun occasions two partial eclipses means given year always least two solar eclipses many five
eclipses occur sun within degrees node degrees central eclipses referred eclipse limit time takes moon return node draconic month apparent position sun moved degrees relative nodes since eclipse limit creates window opportunity degrees degrees central eclipses possible partial eclipses rarely partial central eclipse occur consecutive months
pathedit
central eclipse moons umbra antumbra case annular eclipse moves rapidly west east across earth earth also rotating west east kmmin equator moon moving direction earths spin kmmin umbra almost always appears move roughly westeast direction across map earth speed moons orbital velocity minus earths rotational velocity
width track central eclipse varies according relative apparent diameters sun moon favourable circumstances total eclipse occurs close perigee track km mi wide duration totality may minutes outside central track partial eclipse seen much larger area earth typically umbra km wide penumbral diameter excess km
durationedit
following factors determine duration total solar eclipse order decreasing importance
moon almost exactly perigee making angular diameter large possible
earth near aphelion furthest away sun elliptical orbit making angular diameter nearly small possible
midpoint eclipse close earths equator orbital velocity greatest
vector eclipse path midpoint eclipse aligning vector earths rotation ie diagonal due east
midpoint eclipse near subsolar point part earth closest sun
longest eclipse calculated thus far eclipse july
occurrence cyclesedit
total solar eclipses rare events although occur somewhere earth every months average estimated recur given place every years average total eclipse lasts maximum minutes location moons umbra moves eastward kmh totality currently never last min value changes millennia currently decreasing th millennium longest theoretically possible total eclipse less min last time eclipse longer minutes occurred june min sec observers aboard concorde aircraft able stretch totality minutes flying along path moons umbra next total eclipse exceeding seven minutes duration occur june longest total solar eclipse year period bc least ad occur july totality last min comparison longest total eclipse th century min occurred june total solar eclipses min duration st century
date time solar eclipse known possible predict eclipses using eclipse cycles saros probably best known one accurate saros lasts days little years means period practically identical eclipse occur notable difference westward shift longitude due days little latitude northsouth oddnumbered cycles reverse evennumbered ones saros series always starts partial eclipse near one earths polar regions shifts globe series annular total eclipses ends partial eclipse opposite polar region saros series lasts years eclipses central
frequency per yearedit
two five solar eclipses occur every year least one per eclipse season since gregorian calendar instituted years five solar eclipses next occurrence average solar eclipses century
final totalityedit
total solar eclipses seen earth fortuitous combination circumstances even earth eclipses type familiar people today temporary geological time scale phenomenon hundreds millions years past moon close earth precisely occlude sun eclipses today billion years future far away
due tidal acceleration orbit moon around earth becomes cm distant year estimated slightly less billion years distance earth moon increased km period angular diameter moon decrease size meaning longer able completely cover suns disk seen earth true even moon perigee earth aphelion sun also increasing diameter per billion years therefore last total solar eclipse earth occur six hundred million years
