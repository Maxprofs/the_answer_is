chemic equat symbol represent chemic reaction form symbol formula wherein reactant entiti given lefthand side product entiti righthand side coeffici next symbol formula entiti absolut valu stoichiometr number first chemic equat diagram jean beguin
form
chemic equat consist chemic formula reactant start substanc chemic formula product substanc form chemic reaction two separ arrow symbol usual read yield individu substanc chemic formula separ other plus sign
exampl equat reaction hydrochlor acid sodium denot
hcl na nacl h
equat would read two hcl plus two na yield two nacl h two equat involv complex chemic rather read letter subscript chemic formula read use iupac nomenclatur use iupac nomenclatur equat would read hydrochlor acid plus sodium yield sodium chlorid hydrogen gas
equat indic sodium hcl react form nacl h also indic two sodium molecul requir everi two hydrochlor acid molecul reaction form two sodium chlorid molecul one diatom molecul hydrogen gas molecul everi two hydrochlor acid two sodium molecul react stoichiometr coeffici number front chemic formula result law conserv mass law conserv charg see balanc chemic equat section inform
