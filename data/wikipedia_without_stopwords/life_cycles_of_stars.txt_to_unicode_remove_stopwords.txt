stellar evolution process star changes lifetime depending mass star lifetime ranges million years massive trillions years least massive considerably longer age universe table shows lifetimes stars function masses stars born collapsing clouds gas dust often called nebulae molecular clouds course millions years protostars settle state equilibrium becoming known mainsequence star
nuclear fusion powers star life initially energy generated fusion hydrogen atoms core mainsequence star later preponderance atoms core becomes helium stars like sun begin fuse hydrogen along spherical shell surrounding core process causes star gradually grow size passing subgiant stage reaches red giant phase stars least half mass sun also begin generate energy fusion helium core whereas moremassive stars fuse heavier elements along series concentric shells star like sun exhausted nuclear fuel core collapses dense white dwarf outer layers expelled planetary nebula stars around ten times mass sun explode supernova inert iron cores collapse extremely dense neutron star black hole although universe old enough smallest red dwarfs reached end lives stellar models suggest slowly become brighter hotter running hydrogen fuel becoming lowmass white dwarfs

protostar
stellar evolution starts gravitational collapse giant molecular cloud typical giant molecular clouds roughly lightyears km across contain solar masses kg collapses giant molecular cloud breaks smaller smaller pieces fragments collapsing gas releases gravitational potential energy heat temperature pressure increase fragment condenses rotating sphere superhot gas known protostar
protostar continues grow accretion gas dust molecular cloud becoming premainsequence star reaches final mass development determined mass mass compared mass sun m kg means solar mass
protostars encompassed dust thus readily visible infrared wavelengths observations widefield infrared survey explorer wise especially important unveiling numerous galactic protostars parent star clusters
brown dwarfs substellar objects

mature stars
eventually core exhausts supply hydrogen star begins evolve main sequence without outward pressure generated fusion hydrogen counteract force gravity core contracts either electron degeneracy pressure becomes sufficient oppose gravity core becomes hot enough around mk helium fusion begin happens first depends upon stars mass
lowmass stars
happens lowmass star ceases produce energy fusion directly observed universe around billion years old less time several orders magnitude cases takes fusion cease stars
recent astrophysical models suggest red dwarfs m may stay main sequence six twelve trillion years gradually increasing temperature luminosity take several hundred billion collapse slowly white dwarf stars become red giants fully convective develop degenerate helium core shell burning hydrogen instead hydrogen fusion proceed almost whole star helium
slightly massive stars expand red giants helium cores massive enough reach temperatures required helium fusion never reach tip red giant branch hydrogen shell burning finishes stars move directly red giant branch like post agb star lower luminosity become white dwarf star m able reach temperatures high enough fuse helium midsized stars go stages evolution beyond red giant branch
midsized stars
stars roughly m become red giants large nonmainsequence stars stellar classification k m red giants lie along right edge hertzsprungrussell diagram due red color large luminosity examples include aldebaran constellation taurus arcturus constellation botes red giants inert cores hydrogenburning shells concentric layers atop core still fusing hydrogen helium

massive stars
massive stars core already large enough onset hydrogen burning shell helium ignition occur electron degeneracy pressure chance become prevalent thus stars expand cool brighten much lowermass stars however much brighter lowermass stars begin thus still brighter red giants formed lessmassive stars stars unlikely survive red supergiants instead destroy type ii supernovas
extremely massive stars approximately m luminous thus rapid stellar winds lose mass rapidly due radiation pressure tend strip envelopes expand become red supergiants thus retain extremely high surface temperatures bluewhite color mainsequence time onwards largest stars current generation m outer layers would expelled extreme radiation although lowermass stars normally burn outer layers rapidly likewise avoid becoming red giants red supergiants binary systems close enough companion star strips envelope expands rotate rapidly enough convection extends way core surface resulting absence separate core envelope due thorough mixing
core grows hotter denser gains material fusion hydrogen base envelope massive stars electron degeneracy pressure insufficient halt collapse major element consumed center progressively heavier elements ignite temporarily halting collapse core star massive less approximately m taking account mass loss occurred time may form white dwarf possibly surrounded planetary nebula described lessmassive stars difference white dwarf composed chiefly oxygen neon magnesium

stellar remnants
star burned fuel supply remnants take one three forms depending mass lifetime
white black dwarfs
star m resulting white dwarf m compressed approximately volume earth white dwarfs stable inward pull gravity balanced degeneracy pressure stars electrons consequence pauli exclusion principle electron degeneracy pressure provides rather soft limit compression therefore given chemical composition white dwarfs higher mass smaller volume fuel left burn star radiates remaining heat space billions years
white dwarf hot first forms k surface even hotter interior hot lot energy lost form neutrinos first million years existence lost energy billion years
chemical composition white dwarf depends upon mass star solar masses ignite carbon fusion form magnesium neon smaller amounts elements resulting white dwarf composed chiefly oxygen neon magnesium provided lose enough mass get chandrasekhar limit see provided ignition carbon violent blow star apart supernova star mass order magnitude sun unable ignite carbon fusion produce white dwarf composed chiefly carbon oxygen mass low collapse unless matter added later see star less half mass sun unable ignite helium fusion noted earlier produce white dwarf composed chiefly helium
end remains cold dark mass sometimes called black dwarf however universe old enough black dwarfs exist yet
white dwarfs mass increases chandrasekhar limit m white dwarf composed chiefly carbon oxygen neon andor magnesium electron degeneracy pressure fails due electron capture star collapses depending upon chemical composition precollapse temperature center lead either collapse neutron star runaway ignition carbon oxygen heavier elements favor continued core collapse require higher temperature ignite electron capture onto elements fusion products easier higher core temperatures favor runaway nuclear reaction halts core collapse leads type ia supernova supernovae may many times brighter type ii supernova marking death massive star even though latter greater total energy release inability collapse means white dwarf massive approximately m exist possible minor exception rapidly spinning white dwarfs whose centrifugal force due rotation partially counteracts weight matter mass transfer binary system may cause initially stable white dwarf surpass chandrasekhar limit
white dwarf forms close binary system another star hydrogen larger companion may accrete around onto white dwarf gets hot enough fuse runaway reaction surface although white dwarf remains chandrasekhar limit explosion termed nova
neutron stars
