trilobites (/tralbat/ /trlbat/ meaning three lobes") are a fossil group of extinct marine arthropods that form the class trilobita trilobites form one of the earliest known groups of arthropods the first appearance of trilobites in the fossil record defines the base of the atdabanian stage of the early cambrian period (521 million years ago) and they flourished throughout the lower paleozoic era before beginning a drawn-out decline to extinction when during the devonian all trilobite orders except proetida died out trilobites finally disappeared in the mass extinction at the end of the permian about 250 million years ago the trilobites were among the most successful of all early animals roaming the oceans for over 270 million years
by the time trilobites first appeared in the fossil record they were already highly diversified and geographically dispersed because trilobites had wide diversity and an easily fossilized exoskeleton an extensive fossil record was left behind with some 17,000 known species spanning paleozoic time the study of these fossils has facilitated important contributions to biostratigraphy paleontology evolutionary biology and plate tectonics trilobites are often placed within the arthropod subphylum schizoramia within the superclass arachnomorpha (equivalent to the arachnata) although several alternative taxonomies are found in the literature
trilobites had many life styles some moved over the sea-bed as predators scavengers or filter feeders and some swam feeding on plankton most life styles expected of modern marine arthropods are seen in trilobites with the possible exception of parasitism (where there are still scientific debates) some trilobites (particularly the family olenidae) are even thought to have evolved a symbiotic relationship with sulfur-eating bacteria from which they derived food
== fossil record ==
the earliest trilobites known from the fossil record are redlichiids and ptychopariid bigotinids dated to some 540 to 520 million years ago contenders for the earliest trilobites include profallotaspis jakutensis (siberia) fritzaspis spp (western usa) hupetina antiqua (morocco) and serrania gordaensis (spain) all trilobites are thought to have originated in present-day siberia with subsequent distribution and radiation from this location
all olenellina lack facial sutures (see below) and this is thought to represent the original state the earliest sutured trilobite found so far (lemdadella) occurs almost at the same time as the earliest olenellina however implying that trilobite origin lies before the start of the atdabanian but without leaving fossils other groups show secondary lost facial sutures such as all agnostina and some phacopina another common feature of the olenellina also suggests this suborder to be the ancestral trilobite stock early protaspid stages have not been found supposedly because these were not calcified and this also is supposed to represent the original state earlier trilobites may be found and could shed more light on the origin of trilobites
=== origins ===
early trilobites show all the features of the trilobite group as a whole there do not seem to be any transitional or ancestral forms showing or combining the features of trilobites with other groups (e.g early arthropods) morphological similarities between trilobites and early arthropod-like creatures such as spriggina parvancorina and other trilobitomorphs of the ediacaran period of the precambrian are ambiguous enough to make detailed analysis of their ancestry far from compelling morphological similarities between early trilobites and other cambrian arthropods (e.g the burgess shale fauna and the maotianshan shales fauna) make analysis of ancestral relationships difficult however it is still reasonable to assume that the trilobites share a common ancestor with other arthropods before the ediacaran-cambrian boundary evidence suggests that significant diversification had already occurred before trilobites were preserved in the fossil record easily allowing for the sudden appearance of diverse trilobite groups with complex derived characteristics (e.g eyes)
=== divergence and extinction ===
for such a long-lasting group of animals it is no surprise that trilobite evolutionary history is marked by a number of extinction events where some groups perished while surviving groups diversified to fill ecological niches with comparable or novel adaptations generally trilobites maintained high diversity levels throughout the cambrian and ordovician periods before entering a drawn-out decline in the devonian culminating in final extinction of the last few survivors at the end of the permian period
==== evolutionary trends ====
principal evolutionary trends from primitive morphologies such as exemplified by eoredlichia include the origin of new types of eyes improvement of enrollment and articulation mechanisms increased size of pygidium (micropygy to isopygy) and development of extreme spinosity in certain groups changes also included narrowing of the thorax and increasing or decreasing numbers of thoracic segments specific changes to the cephalon are also noted variable glabella size and shape position of eyes and facial sutures & hypostome specialization several morphologies appeared independently within different major taxa (e.g eye reduction or miniaturization)
effacement is also a common evolutionary trend it is the loss of surface detail in the cephalon pygidium or the thoracic furrows notable examples of this were the orders agnostida asaphida and the suborder illaenina of corynexochida it is believed that effacement is an indication of either a burrowing lifestyle or a pelagic one effacement poses a problem for taxonomists since the loss of details (particularly of the glabella) can make the determination of phylogenetic relationships difficult
==== pre-cambrian ====
phylogenetic biogeographic analysis of early cambrian olenellidae and redlichidae suggests that a uniform trilobite fauna existed over laurentia gondwana and siberia before the tectonic breakup of the super-continent pannotia between 600 million years ago and 550 million years ago tectonic breakup of pannotia then allowed for the diversification and radiation expressed later in the cambrian as the distinctive olenellid province (laurentia siberia and baltica) and the separate redlichid province (australia antarctica and china) breakup of pannotia significantly predates the first appearance of trilobites in the fossil record supporting a long and cryptic development of trilobites extending perhaps as far back as 700 million years ago or possibly further
==== cambrian ====
very shortly after trilobite fossils appeared in the lower cambrian they rapidly diversified into the major orders that typified the cambrianredlichiida ptychopariida agnostida and corynexochida the first major crisis in the trilobite fossil record occurred in the middle cambrian surviving orders developed isopygus or macropygius bodies and developed thicker cuticles allowing better defense against predators (see thorax below) the end cambrian mass extinction event marked a major change in trilobite fauna almost all redlichiida (including the olenelloidea) and most late cambrian stocks went extinct a continuing decrease in laurentian continental shelf area is recorded at the same time as the extinctions suggesting major environmental upheaval
major types of trilobites appearing in the cambrian include
abadiella (lower cambrian)
judomia (lower cambrian)
olenellus (lower cambrian)
ellipsocephalus (middle cambrian)
elrathia (middle cambrian)
paradoxides (middle cambrian)
peronopsis (middle cambrian)
olenus (late cambrian)
==== ordovician ====
the early ordovician is marked by vigorous radiations of articulate brachiopods bryozoans bivalves echinoderms and graptolites with many groups appearing in the fossil record for the first time although intra-species trilobite diversity seems to have peaked during the cambrian trilobites were still active participants in the ordovician radiation event with a new fauna taking over from the old cambrian one phacopida and trinucleioidea are characteristic forms highly differentiated and diverse most with uncertain ancestors the phacopida and other new clades almost certainly had cambrian forebears but the fact that they have avoided detection is a strong indication that novel morphologies were developing very rapidly changes within the trilobite fauna during the ordovician foreshadowed the mass extinction at the end of the ordovician allowing many families to continue into the silurian with little disturbance ordovician trilobites were successful at exploiting new environments notably reefs however the end ordovician mass extinction did not leave the trilobites unscathed some distinctive and previously successful forms such as the trinucleioidea and agnostida became extinct the ordovician marks the last great diversification period amongst the trilobites very few entirely new patterns of organisation arose post-ordovician later evolution in trilobites was largely a matter of variations upon the ordovician themes by the ordovician mass extinction vigorous trilobite radiation has stopped and gradual decline beckons
some of the genera of trilobites appearing in the ordovician include
cyclopyge (early to late ordovidician)
selenopeltis (early to late ordovician)
parabolina (early ordovician)
cheirurus (middle ordovician)
eodalmanitina (middle ordovician)
trinucleus (middle ordovician)
triarthus (late ordovician)
==== silurian and devonian ====
most early silurian families constitute a subgroup of the late ordovician fauna few if any of the dominant early ordovician fauna survived to the end of the ordovician yet 74% of the dominant late ordovician trilobite fauna survived the ordovician late ordovician survivors account for all post-ordovician trilobite groups except the harpetida
silurian and devonian trilobite assemblages are superficially similar to ordovician assemblages dominated by lichida and phacopida (including the well-known calymenina) however a number of characteristic forms do not extend far into the devonian and almost all the remainder were wiped out by a series of drastic middle and late devonian extinctions three orders and all but five families were exterminated by the combination of sea level changes and a break in the redox equilibrium (a meteorite impact has also been suggested as a cause) only a single order the proetida survived into the carboniferous
genera of trilobites during the silurian and devonian periods include
dalmanites (early to late silurian)
calymene (silurian)
encrinurus (silurian)
exallaspis (mid to late-silurian)
paralejurus (early devonian)
lioharpes (middle devonian)
phacops (middle to late devonian)
==== carboniferous and permian ====
the proetida survived for millions of years continued through the carboniferous period and lasted until the end of the permian (when the vast majority of species on earth were wiped out) it is unknown why order proetida alone survived the devonian the proetida maintained relatively diverse faunas in deep water and shallow water shelf environments throughout the carboniferous for many millions of years the proetida existed untroubled in their ecological niche an analogy would be today's crinoids which mostly exist as deep water species in the paleozoic era vast forests of crinoids lived in shallow near-shore environments
some of the genera of trilobites during the carboniferous and permian periods include
archegonus (early to middle carboniferous)
hesslerides (middle carboniferous)
ditomopyge (late carboniferous to late permian)
==== final extinction ====
exactly why the trilobites became extinct is not clear with repeated extinction events (often followed by apparent recovery) throughout the trilobite fossil record a combination of causes is likely after the extinction event at the end of the devonian period what trilobite diversity remained was bottlenecked into the order proetida decreasing diversity of genera limited to shallow-water shelf habitats coupled with a drastic lowering of sea level (regression) meant that the final decline of trilobites happened shortly before the end of the permian mass extinction event with so many marine species involved in the permian extinction the end of nearly 300 million successful years for the trilobite was not unexpected at the time
the closest extant relatives of trilobites may be the horseshoe crabs or the cephalocarids
== fossil distribution ==
trilobites appear to have been exclusively marine organisms since the fossilized remains of trilobites are always found in rocks containing fossils of other salt-water animals such as brachiopods crinoids and corals within the marine paleoenvironment trilobites were found in a broad range from extremely shallow water to very deep water trilobites like brachiopods crinoids and corals are found on all modern continents and occupied every ancient ocean from which paleozoic fossils have been collected the remnants of trilobites can range from the preserved body to pieces of the exoskeleton which it sheds in the process known as ecdysis in addition the tracks left behind by trilobites living on the sea floor are often preserved as trace fossils
there are three main forms of trace fossils associated with trilobites rusophycus cruziana & diplichnites such trace fossils represent the preserved life activity of trilobites active upon the sea floor rusophycus the resting trace are trilobite excavations involving little or no forward movement and ethological interpretations suggest resting protection and hunting cruziana the feeding trace are furrows through the sediment which are believed to represent the movement of trilobites while deposit feeding many of the diplichnites fossils are believed to be traces made by trilobites walking on the sediment surface however care must be taken as similar trace fossils are recorded in freshwater and post paleozoic deposits representing non-trilobite origins
trilobite fossils are found worldwide with many thousands of known species because they appeared quickly in geological time and moulted like other arthropods trilobites serve as excellent index fossils enabling geologists to date the age of the rocks in which they are found they were among the first fossils to attract widespread attention and new species are being discovered every year
a famous location for trilobite fossils in the united kingdom is wren's nest dudley in the west midlands where calymene blumenbachi is found in the silurian wenlock group this trilobite is featured on the town's coat of arms and was named the dudley bug or dudley locust by quarrymen who once worked the now abandoned limestone quarries llandrindod wells powys wales is another famous trilobite location the well-known elrathia kingi trilobite is found in abundance in the cambrian age wheeler shale of utah
spectacularly preserved trilobite fossils often showing soft body parts (legs gills antennae etc.) have been found in british columbia canada (the cambrian burgess shale and similar localities) new york u.s.a (ordovician walcott-rust quarry near russia and beecher's trilobite bed near rome) china (lower cambrian maotianshan shales near chengjiang) germany (the devonian hunsrck slates near bundenbach) and much more rarely in trilobite-bearing strata in utah (wheeler shale and other formations) ontario and manuels river newfoundland and labrador
the french palaeontologist joachim barrande (17991883) carried out his landmark study of trilobites in the cambrian ordovician and silurian of bohemia publishing the first volume of systme silurien du centre de la bohme in 1852
== importance ==
the study of paleozoic trilobites in the welsh-english borders by niles eldredge was fundamental in formulating and testing punctuated equilibrium as a mechanism of evolution
identification of the atlantic and pacific trilobite faunas in north america and europe implied the closure of the iapetus ocean (producing the iapetus suture) thus providing important supporting evidence for the theory of continental drift
trilobites have been important in estimating the rate of speciation during the period known as the cambrian explosion because they are the most diverse group of metazoans known from the fossil record of the early cambrian
trilobites are excellent stratigraphic markers of the cambrian period researchers who find trilobites with alimentary prosopon and a micropygium have found early cambrian strata most of the cambrian stratigraphy is based on the use of trilobite marker fossils
trilobites are the state fossils of ohio (isotelus) wisconsin (calymene celebra) and pennsylvania (phacops rana)
== taxonomy ==
the taxonomic rank of the many groupings of trilobites can be derived from the suffix to its name the following table lists the different ranks (from widest to closest relatives) with the corresponding suffix and an example
the 9 trilobite orders are agnostida redlichiida corynexochida lichida phacopida proetida asaphida harpetida and ptychopariida sometimes the nektaspida are included but these lack a calcified exoskeleton and eyes other scholars do not consider agnostina to be trilobites and hence not related to the eodiscina this latter suborder should than be elevated and be called eodiscida
despite their rich fossil record with thousands of described genera found throughout the world the taxonomy and phylogeny of trilobites have many uncertainties except possibly for the members of the orders phacopida and lichida (which first appear during the early ordovician) nine of the eleven trilobite orders appear prior to the end of the cambrian most scientists believe that order redlichiida more specifically its suborder redlichiina contains a common ancestor of all other orders with the possible exception of the agnostina while many potential phylogenies are found in the literature most have suborder redlichiina giving rise to orders corynexochida and ptychopariida during the lower cambrian and the lichida descending from either the redlichiida or corynexochida in the middle cambrian order ptychopariida is the most problematic order for trilobite classification in the 1959 treatise on invertebrate paleontology what are now members of orders ptychopariida asaphida proetida and harpetida were grouped together as order ptychopariida subclass librostoma was erected in 1990 to encompass all of these orders based on their shared ancestral character of a natant (unattached) hypostome the most recently recognized of the nine trilobite orders harpetida was erected in 2002 the progenitor of order phacopida is unclear
=== relationship to other taxa ===
once soft-part anatomy had been recovered the trilobites were originally allied to the crustacea however this suggestion has since fallen out of favour a relationship with the chelicerata in a clade termed arachnomorpha (arachnata) was in vogue for some time a position in the mandibulata (=myriapoda + crustacea + hexapoda) stem-group may be a more parsimonious alternative
== morphology ==
when trilobites are found only the exoskeleton is preserved (often in an incomplete state) in all but a handful of locations a few locations (lagersttten) preserve identifiable soft body parts (legs gills musculature & digestive tract) and enigmatic traces of other structures (e.g fine details of eye structure) as well as the exoskeleton
trilobites range in length from minute (less than 3 millimetres (0.12 in)) to very large (over 30 centimetres (12 in)) with an average size range of 310 cm (1.23.9 in) supposedly the smallest species is acanthopleurella stipulae with a maximum of 1.5 millimetres (0.059 in) the world's largest known trilobite specimen assigned to isotelus rex of 72 cm was found in 1998 by canadian scientists in ordovician rocks on the shores of hudson bay
the exoskeleton is composed of calcite and calcium phosphate minerals in a protein lattice of chitin that covers the upper surface (dorsal) of the trilobite and curled round the lower edge to produce a small fringe called the doublure three distinctive tagmata (sections) are present cephalon (head) thorax (body) and pygidium (tail)
=== terminology ===
as might be expected for a group of animals comprising c.5,000 genera the morphology and description of trilobites can be complex however despite morphological complexity and an unclear position within higher classifications there are a number of characteristics that distinguish the trilobites from other arthropods a generally sub-elliptical dorsal chitinous exoskeleton divided longitudinally into three distinct lobes (from which the group gets its name) having a distinct relatively large head shield (cephalon) articulating axially with a thorax comprising articulated transverse segments the hindmost of which are almost invariably fused to form a tail shield (pygidium) when describing differences between trilobite taxa the presence size and shape of the cephalic features are often mentioned
during moulting the exoskeleton generally split between the head and thorax which is why so many trilobite fossils are missing one or the other in most groups facial sutures on the cephalon helped facilitate moulting similar to lobsters and crabs trilobites would have physically grown between the moult stage and the hardening of the new exoskeleton
=== cephalon ===
a trilobite's cephalon or head section is highly variable with a lot of morphological complexity the glabella forms a dome underneath which sat the crop or stomach generally the exoskeleton has few distinguishing ventral features but the cephalon often preserves muscle attachment scars and occasionally the hypostome a small rigid plate comparable to the ventral plate in other arthropods a toothless mouth and stomach sat upon the hypostome with the mouth facing backwards at the rear edge of the hypostome
hypostome morphology is highly variable sometimes supported by an un-mineralised membrane (natant) sometimes fused onto the anterior doublure with an outline very similar to the glabella above (conterminant) or fused to the anterior doublure with an outline significantly different from the glabella (impendent) many variations in shape and placement of the hypostome have been described the size of the glabella and the lateral fringe of the cephalon together with hypostome variation have been linked to different lifestyles diets and specific ecological niches
the anterior and lateral fringe of the cephalon is greatly enlarged in the harpetida in other species a bulge in the pre-glabellar area is preserved that suggests a brood pouch highly complex compound eyes are another obvious feature of the cephalon
==== facial sutures ====
facial or cephalic sutures are the natural fracture lines in the cephalon of trilobites their function was to assist the trilobite in shedding its old exoskeleton during ecdysis (or molting)
all species assigned to the suborder olenellina that went extinct at the very end of the early cambrian (like fallotaspis nevadia judomia and olenellus) lacked facial sutures they are believed to have never developed facial sutures having pre-dated their evolution because of this (along with other primitive characteristics) they are thought to be the earliest ancestors of later trilobites
some other later trilobites also lost facial sutures secondarily the type of sutures found in different species are used extensively in the taxonomy and phylogeny of trilobites
===== dorsal sutures =====
the dorsal surface of the trilobite cephalon (the frontmost tagma or the head') can be divided into two regions - the cranidium and the librigena ("free cheeks") the cranidium can be further divided into the glabella (the central lobe in the cephalon) and the fixigena ("fixed cheeks") the facial sutures lie along the anterior edge at the division between the cranidium and the librigena
trilobite facial sutures on the dorsal side can be roughly divided into five main types according to where the sutures end relative to the genal angle (the edges where the side and rear margins of the cephalon converge)
absent - facial sutures are lacking in the olenellina this is considered a primitive state and is always combined with the presence of eyes
proparian - the facial suture ends in front of the genal angle along the lateral margin example genera showing this type of suture include dalmanites of phacopina (phacopida) and ekwipagetia of eodiscina (agnostida)
gonatoparian - the facial suture ends at the tip of the genal angle example genera showing this type of suture include calymene and trimerus of calymenina (phacopida)
opisthoparian - the facial suture ends at the posterior margin of the cephalon example genera showing this type of suture include peltura of olenina (ptychopariida) and bumastus of illaenina (corynexochida) this is the most common type of facial suture
hypoparian or marginal - in some trilobites dorsal sutures may be secondary lost several exemplary time series of species show the migration of the dorsal suture until it coincides with the margins of the cephalon as the visual surface of the eye is on the diminishing free cheek (or librigena) the number of lenses tends to go down and eventually the eye disappears the loss of dorsal sutures may arise from the proparian state such as in some eodiscina like weymouthia all agnostina and some phacopina such as ductina the marginal sutures exhibited by the harpetids and trinucleioids however are derived from opisthoparian sutures on the other hand blindness is not always accompanied by the loss of facial sutures
the primitive state of the dorsal sutures is proparian opisthoparian sutures have developed several times independently there are no examples of proparian sutures developing in taxa with opisthoparian ancestry trilobites that exhibit opisthoparian sutures as adults commonly have proparian sutures as instars (known exceptions being yunnanocephalus and duyunaspis) hypoparian sutures have also arisen independently in several groups of trilobites
the course of the facial sutures from the front of the visual surface varies at least as strong as it does in the rear branche but the lack of a clear reference point similar to the genal angle makes it difficult to categorize one of the more pronounced states is that the front of the facial sutures do not cut the lateral or frontal border on its own but coincide in front of the glabella and cut the frontal border at the midline this is inter alia the case in the asaphida even more pronounced is the situation that the frontal branches of the facial sutures end in each other resulting in yoked free cheeks this is known in triarthrus and in the phacopidae but in that family are the facial sutures not functional as can be concluded from the fact that free cheeks are not found separated from the cranidium
there are also two types of sutures in the dorsal surface connected to the compound eyes of trilobites they are
ocular sutures - are sutures surrounding the edges of the compound eye trilobites with these sutures lose the entire surface of the eyes when molting it is common among cambrian trilobites
palpebral sutures - are sutures which form part of the dorsal facial suture running along the top edges of the compound eye
===== ventral sutures =====
dorsal facial sutures continue downward to the ventral side of the cephalon where they become the connective sutures that divide the doublure the following are the types of ventral sutures
connective sutures - are the sutures that continue from the facial sutures past the front margin of the cephalon
rostral suture - is only present when the trilobite possesses a rostrum (or rostral plate) it connects the rostrum to the front part of the dorsal cranidium
hypostomal suture - separates the hypostome from the doublure when the hypostome is of the attached type it is absent when the hypostome is free-floating (i.e natant) it is also absent in some coterminant hypostomes where the hypostome is fused to the doublure
median suture - exhibited by asaphid trilobites they are formed when instead of becoming connective sutures the two dorsal sutures converge at a point in front of the cephalon then divide straight down the center of the doublure
==== rostrum ====
the rostrum (or the rostral plate) is a distinct part of the doublure located at the front of the cephalon it is separated from the rest of the doublure by the rostral suture
during molting in trilobites like paradoxides the rostrum is used to anchor the front part of the trilobite as the cranidium separates from the librigena the opening created by the arching of the body provides an exit for the molting trilobite
it is absent in some trilobites like lachnostoma
==== hypostome ====
the hypostome is the hard mouthpart of the trilobite found on the ventral side of the cephalon typically below the glabella the hypostome can be classified into three types based on whether they are permanently attached to the rostrum or not and whether they are aligned to the anterior dorsal tip of the glabella
natant - hypostome not attached to doublure aligned with front edge of glabella
conterminant - hypostome attached to rostral plate of doublure aligned with front edge of glabella
impendent - hypostome attached to rostral plate but not aligned to glabella
below is an illustration of the three types the doublure is shown in light gray the inside surface of the cephalon in dark gray and the hypostome in light blue the glabella is outlined in red broken lines
=== thorax ===
the thorax is a series of articulated segments that lie between the cephalon and pygidium the number of segments varies between 2 and 103 with most species in the 2 to 16 range
each segment consists of the central axial ring and the outer pleurae which protected the limbs and gills the pleurae are sometimes abbreviated or extended to form long spines apodemes are bulbous projections on the ventral surface of the exoskeleton to which most leg muscles attached although some leg muscles attached directly to the exoskeleton determining a junction between thorax and pygidium can be difficult and many segment counts suffer from this problem
trilobite fossils are often found enrolled (curled up) like modern pill bugs for protection evidence suggests enrollment helped protect against the inherent weakness of the arthropod cuticle that was exploited by anomalocarid predators
some trilobites achieved a fully closed capsule (e.g phacops) while others with long pleural spines (e.g selenopeltis) left a gap at the sides or those with a small pygidium (e.g paradoxides) left a gap between the cephalon and pygidium in phacops the pleurae overlap a smooth bevel (facet) allowing a close seal with the doublure the doublure carries a panderian notch or protuberance on each segment to prevent over rotation and achieve a good seal even in an agnostid with only 2 articulating thoracic segments the process of enrollment required a complex musculature to contract the exoskeleton and return to the flat condition
=== pygidium ===
the pygidium is formed from a number of segments and the telson fused together segments in the pygidium are similar to the thoracic segments (bearing biramous limbs) but are not articulated trilobites can be described based on the pygidium being micropygous (pygidium smaller than cephalon) subisopygous (pygidium sub equal to cephalon) isopygous (pygidium equal in size to cephalon) or macropygous (pygidium larger than cephalon)
=== prosopon (surface sculpture) ===
trilobite exoskeletons show a variety of small-scale structures collectively called prosopon prosopon does not include large scale extensions of the cuticle (e.g hollow pleural spines) but to finer scale features such as ribbing domes pustules pitting ridging and perforations the exact purpose of the prosopon is not resolved but suggestions include structural strengthening sensory pits or hairs preventing predator attacks and maintaining aeration while enrolled in one example alimentary ridge networks (easily visible in cambrian trilobites) might have been either digestive or respiratory tubes in the cephalon and other regions
=== spines ===
some trilobites such as those of the order lichida evolved elaborate spiny forms from the ordovician until the end of the devonian period examples of these specimens have been found in the hamar laghdad formation of alnif in morocco there is however a serious counterfeiting and fakery problem with much of the moroccan material that is offered commercially spectacular spined trilobites have also been found in western russia oklahoma usa and ontario canada
some trilobites had horns on their heads similar to those of modern beetles based on the size location and shape of the horns the most likely use of the horns was combat for mates making the asaphida family raphiophoridae the earliest exemplars of this behavior another use for these spines was protection from predators when enrolled trilobite spines offered additional protection this conclusion is likely to be applicable to other trilobites as well such as in the phacopid trilobite genus walliserops that developed spectacular tridents
== soft body parts ==
only 21 or so species are described from which soft body parts are preserved so some features (e.g the posterior antenniform cerci preserved only in olenoides serratus) remain difficult to assess in the wider picture
=== appendages ===
trilobites had a single pair of preoral antennae and otherwise undifferentiated biramous limbs (2 3 or 4 cephalic pairs followed by one pair per thoracic segment and some pygidium pairs) each endopodite (walking leg) had 6 or 7 segments homologous to other early arthropods endopodites are attached to the coxa which also bore a feather-like exopodite or gill branch which was used for respiration and in some species swimming the inside of the coxa (or gnathobase) carries spines probably to process prey items the last exopodite segment usually had claws or spines many examples of hairs on the legs suggest adaptations for feeding (as for the gnathobases) or sensory organs to help with walking
=== digestive tract ===
the toothless mouth of trilobites was situated on the rear edge of the hypostome (facing backwards) in front of the legs attached to the cephalon the mouth is linked by a small esophagus to the stomach that lay forward of the mouth below the glabella the intestine led backwards from there to the pygidium the feeding limbs attached to the cephalon are thought to have fed food into the mouth possibly slicing the food on the hypostome and/or gnathobases first alternative lifestyles are suggested with the cephalic legs used to disturb the sediment to make food available a large glabella (implying a large stomach) coupled with an impendent hypostome has been used as evidence of more complex food sources i.e possibly a carnivorous lifestyle
=== internal organs ===
while there is direct and implied evidence for the presence and location of the mouth stomach and digestive tract (see above) the presence of heart brain and liver are only implied (although present in many reconstructions) with little direct geological evidence
=== musculature ===
although rarely preserved long lateral muscles extended from the cephalon to mid way down the pygidium attaching to the axial rings allowing enrollment while separate muscles on the legs tucked them out of the way
== sensory organs ==
many trilobites had complex eyes they also had a pair of antennae some trilobites were blind probably living too deep in the sea for light to reach them as such they became secondarily blind in this branch of trilobite evolution other trilobites (e.g phacops rana and erbenochile erbeni) had large eyes that were for use in more well lit predator-filled waters
=== antennae ===
the pair of antennae suspected in most trilobites (and preserved in a few examples) were highly flexible to allow them to be retracted when the trilobite was enrolled also one species (olenoides serratus) preserves antennae-like cerci that project from the rear of the trilobite
=== eyes ===
even the earliest trilobites had complex compound eyes with lenses made of calcite (a characteristic of all trilobite eyes) confirming that the eyes of arthropods and probably other animals could have developed before the cambrian improving eyesight of both predator and prey in marine environments has been suggested as one of the evolutionary pressures furthering an apparent rapid development of new life forms during what is known as the cambrian explosion
trilobite eyes were typically compound with each lens being an elongated prism the number of lenses in such an eye varied some trilobites had only one while some had thousands of lenses in a single eye in compound eyes the lenses were typically arranged hexagonally the fossil record of trilobite eyes is complete enough that their evolution can be studied through time which compensates to some extent the lack of preservation of soft internal parts
lenses of trilobites eyes were made of calcite (calcium carbonate caco3) pure forms of calcite are transparent and some trilobites used crystallographically oriented clear calcite crystals to form each lens of each of their eyes rigid calcite lenses would have been unable to accommodate to a change of focus like the soft lens in a human eye would however in some trilobites the calcite formed an internal doublet structure giving superb depth of field and minimal spherical aberration according to optical principles discovered by french scientist ren descartes and dutch physicist christiaan huygens in the 17th century a living species with similar lenses is the brittle star ophiocoma wendtii
in other trilobites with a huygens interface apparently missing a gradient index lens is invoked with the refractive index of the lens changing towards the center
holochroal eyes had a great number (sometimes over 15,000) of small (30100 m rarely larger) lenses lenses were hexagonally close packed touching each other with a single corneal membrane covering all lenses holochroal eyes had no sclera the white layer covering the eyes of most modern arthropods holochroal eyes are the ancestral eye of trilobites and are by far the most common found in all orders except the agnostida and through the entirety of the trilobites existence little is known of the early history of holochroal eyes lower and middle cambrian trilobites rarely preserve the visual surface the spatial resolving power of grated eyes (such as holochroal eyes) is dependent on light intensity circular motion receptor density registered light angle and the extent to which the signal of individual rhabdoms are neurally combined this implies that lenses need to be larger under low light conditions (such as for pricyclopyge when comparing it to carolinites) and for fast moving predators and prey as the circular velocity caused by the forward speed of an animal itself is much higher for the ommatidia directed perpendicular to the movement fast-moving trilobites (such as carolinites) have eyes flattened from the side and more curved were ommatia are directed to the front or back thus eye morphology can be used to make assumptions about the ecosystem of trilobites
schizochroal eyes typically had fewer (around 700) larger lenses than holochroal eyes and are found only in phacopina lenses were separate with each lens having an individual cornea that extended into a rather large sclera schizochroal eyes appear quite suddenly in the early ordovician and were presumably derived from a holochroal ancestor field of view (all around vision) eye placement and coincidental development of more efficient enrollment mechanisms point to the eye as a more defensive early warning system than directly aiding in the hunt for food modern eyes that are functionally equivalent to the schizochroal eye were not thought to exist but are found in the modern insect species xenos peckii
abathochroal eyes are found only in cambrian eodiscina and have around 70 small separate lenses that had individual cornea the sclera was separate from the cornea and did not run as deep as the sclera in schizochroal eyes although well preserved examples are sparse in the early fossil record abathochroal eyes have been recorded in the lower cambrian making them among the oldest known environmental conditions seem to have resulted in the later loss of visual organs in many eodiscina
secondary blindness is not uncommon particularly in long lived groups such as the agnostida and trinucleioidea in proetida and phacopina from western europe and particularly tropidocoryphinae from france (where there is good stratigraphic control) there are well studied trends showing progressive eye reduction between closely related species that eventually leads to blindness
several other structures on trilobites have been explained as photo-receptors of particular interest are macula the small areas of thinned cuticle on the underside of the hypostome in some trilobites macula are suggested to function as simple ventral eyes that could have detected night and day or allowed a trilobite to navigate while swimming (or turned) upside down
=== sensory pits ===
there are several types of prosopon that have been suggested as sensory apparatus collecting chemical or vibrational signals the connection between large pitted fringes on the cephalon of harpetida and trinucleoidea with corresponding small or absent eyes makes for an interesting possibility of the fringe as a compound ear
== development ==
trilobites grew through successive moult stages called instars in which existing segments increased in size and new trunk segments appeared at a sub-terminal generative zone during the anamorphic phase of development this was followed by the epimorphic developmental phase in which the animal continued to grow and moult but no new trunk segments were expressed in the exoskeleton the combination of anamorphic and epimorphic growth constitutes the hemianamorphic developmental mode that is common among many living arthropods
trilobite development was unusual in the way in which articulations developed between segments and changes in the development of articulation gave rise to the conventionally recognized developmental phases of the trilobite life cycle (divided into 3 stages) which are not readily compared with those of other arthropods actual growth and change in external form of the trilobite would have occurred when the trilobite was soft shelled following moulting and before the next exoskeleton hardened
trilobite larvae are known from the cambrian to the carboniferous and from all sub-orders as instars from closely related taxa are more similar than instars from distantly related taxa trilobite larvae provide morphological information important in evaluating high-level phylogenetic relationships among trilobites
despite the absence of supporting fossil evidence their similarity to living arthropods has led to the belief that trilobites multiplied sexually and produced eggs some species may have kept eggs or larvae in a brood pouch forward of the glabella particularly when the ecological niche was challenging to larvae size and morphology of the first calcified stage are highly variable between (but not within) trilobite taxa suggesting some trilobites passed through more growth within the egg than others early developmental stages prior to calcification of the exoskeleton are a possibility (suggested for fallotaspids) but so is calcification and hatching coinciding
the earliest post-embryonic trilobite growth stage known with certainty are the protaspid stages (anamorphic phase) starting with an indistinguishable proto-cephalon and proto-pygidium (anaprotaspid) a number of changes occur ending with a transverse furrow separating the proto-cephalon and proto-pygidium (metaprotaspid) that can continue to add segments segments are added at the posterior part of the pygidium but all segments remain fused together
the meraspid stages (anamorphic phase) are marked by the appearance of an articulation between the head and the fused trunk prior to the onset of the first meraspid stage the animal had a two-part structure the head and the plate of fused trunk segments the pygidium during the meraspid stages new segments appeared near the rear of the pygidium as well as additional articulations developing at the front of the pygidium releasing freely articulating segments into the thorax segments are generally added one per moult (although two per moult and one every alternate moult are also recorded) with number of stages equal to the number of thoracic segments a substantial amount of growth from less than 25% up to 30%40% probably took place in the meraspid stages
the holaspid stages (epimorphic phase) commence when a stable mature number of segments has been released into the thorax moulting continued during the holaspid stages with no changes in thoracic segment number some trilobites are suggested to have continued moulting and growing throughout the life of the individual albeit at a slower rate on reaching maturity
some trilobites showed a marked transition in morphology at one particular instar which has been called trilobite metamorphosis radical change in morphology is linked to the loss or gain of distinctive features that mark a change in mode of life a change in lifestyle during development has significance in terms of evolutionary pressure as the trilobite could pass through several ecological niches on the way to adult development and changes would strongly affect survivorship and dispersal of trilobite taxa it is worth noting that trilobites with all protaspid stages solely planktonic and later meraspid stages benthic (e.g asaphids) failed to last through the ordovician extinctions while trilobites that were planktonic for only the first protaspid stage before metamorphosing into benthic forms survived (e.g lichids phacopids) pelagic larval life-style proved ill-adapted to the rapid onset of global climatic cooling and loss of tropical shelf habitats during the ordovician
== history of usage and research ==
rev edward lhwyd published in 1698 in the philosophical transactions of the royal society the oldest scientific journal in the english language part of his letter concerning several regularly figured stones lately found by him that was accompanied by a page of etchings of fossils one of his etchings figured a trilobite he found near llandeilo probably on the grounds of lord dynefor's castle he described as the skeleton of some flat fish 
the discovery of calymene blumenbachi (the dudley locust) in 1749 by charles lyttleton could be identified as the beginning of trilobite research lyttleton submitted a letter to the royal society of london in 1750 concerning a petrified insect he found in the limestone pits at dudley in 1754 manuel mendez da costa proclaimed that the dudley locust was not an insect but instead belonged to the crustaceous tribe of animals he proposed to call the dudley specimens pediculus marinus major trilobos (large trilobed marine louse) a name which lasted well into the 1800s german naturalist johann walch who executed the first inclusive study of this group proposed the use of the name trilobite he considered it appropriate to derive the name from the unique three-lobed character of the central axis and a pleural zone to each side
written descriptions of trilobites date possibly from the third century bc and definitely from the fourth century ad the spanish geologists eladio lin and rodolfo gozalo argue that some of the fossils described in greek and latin lapidaries as scorpion stone beetle stone and ant stone refer to trilobite fossils less ambiguous references to trilobite fossils can be found in chinese sources fossils from the kushan formation of northeastern china were prized as inkstones and decorative pieces
in the new world american fossil hunters found plentiful deposits of elrathia kingi in western utah in the 1860s until the early 1900s the ute native americans of utah wore these trilobites which they called pachavee (little water bug) as amulets a hole was bored in the head and the fossil was worn on a string according to the ute themselves trilobite necklaces protect against disease and bullets in 1931 frank beckwith uncovered evidence of the ute use of trilobites travelling through the badlands he photographed two petroglyphs that most likely represent trilobites on the same trip he examined a burial of unknown age with a drilled trilobite fossil lying in the chest cavity of the interred since then trilobite amulets have been found all over the great basin as well as in british columbia and australia in the 1880s archaeologists discovered a much handled trilobite fossil that had been drilled as if to be worn as a pendant in the grotte du trilobite near yonne france the occupation stratum in which the trilobite was found has been dated as fifteen thousand years old because the pendant was handled so much the species of trilobite cannot be determined this type of trilobite is not found around yonne so it may have been highly prized and traded from elsewhere
