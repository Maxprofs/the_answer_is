intrusive ultramafic rocksedit
intrusive ultramafic rocks often found large layered ultramafic intrusions differentiated rock types often occur layers cumulate rock types represent chemistry magma crystallized ultramafic intrusives include dunites peridotites pyroxenites rare varieties include troctolite greater percentage calcic plagioclase grade anorthosites gabbro norite often occur upper portions layered ultramafic sequences hornblendite rarely phlogopite also found
volcanic ultramafic rocksedit
volcanic ultramafic rocks rare outside archaean essentially restricted neoproterozoic earlier although boninite lavas currently erupted within backarc basins manus trough new guinea verge ultramafic subvolcanic ultramafic rocks dykes persist longer also rare many lavas produced io may ultramafic evidenced temperatures higher terrestrial mafic eruptions mercury also appears ultramafic volcanic rock
examples include komatiite picritic basalt komatiites host ore deposits nickel
ultrapotassic ultramafic rocksedit
technically ultrapotassic rocks melilitic rocks considered separate group based melting model criteria ultrapotassic highly silicaundersaturated rocks mgo considered ultramafic
ultrapotassic ultramafic igneous rocks lamprophyre lamproite kimberlite known reached surface earth although modern eruptions observed analogues preserved
rocks occur dikes diatremes lopoliths laccoliths rarely intrusions kimberlite lampproite occurrences occur volcanic subvolcanic diatremes maars lavas virtually unknown
vents proterozoic lamproite argyle diamond mine cenozoic lamproite gaussberg antarctica known vents devonian lamprophyre scotland kimberlite pipes canada russia south africa incompletely preserved tephra agglomerate facies
generally diatreme events lava flows although tephra ash deposits partially preserved represent lowvolume volatile melts attain ultramafic chemistry via different process typical ultramafic rocks
metamorphic ultramafic rocksedit
metamorphism ultramafic rocks presence water andor carbon dioxide results two main classes metamorphic ultramafic rock talc carbonate serpentinite
talc carbonation reactions occur ultramafic rocks lower greenschist granulite facies metamorphism rock question subjected metamorphism metamorphic fluid molar proportion co carbon dioxide
metamorphic fluids less molar proportion co reactions favor serpentinisation resulting chloriteserpentineamphibole type assemblages
distribution space timeedit
majority ultramafic rocks exposed orogenic belts predominate archaean proterozoic terranes ultramafic magmas phanerozoic rarer recognised true ultramafic lavas phanerozoic
many surface exposures ultramafic rocks occur ophiolite complexes deep mantlederived rocks obducted onto continental crust along subduction zones
soil regolith developed ultramafic rockedit
serpentine soil magnesium rich calcium potassium phosphorus poor soil develops regolith derived ultramafic rocks ultramafic rocks also contain elevated amounts chromium nickel may toxic plants result distinctive type vegetation develops soils examples ultramafic woodlands barrens appalachian mountains piedmont wet maquis new caledonia rain forests ultramafic forests mount kinabalu peaks sabah malaysia vegetation typically stunted sometimes home endemic species adapted soils

weathered ultramafic rocks may form lateritic nickel ore deposits
