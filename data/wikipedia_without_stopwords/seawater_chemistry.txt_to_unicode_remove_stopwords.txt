early life education
born durban natal south africa january attended university natal durban originally pursue undergraduate degree chemistry inspired study geology attending lectures eminent south african geologist lester charles king addition new found passion geology soccer big part lawrences life time student selected member south african universities star team four times earned bsc degree geology chemistry bsc hons degree geology hired dr king instructor began teaching beginning classes geology time started work masters thesis origin table mountain sandstone earned msc geology guidance drs peter matthews joseph frankel
awarded fellowship south african council scientific industrial research spend academic year us went johns hopkins university began working sedimentologist dr francis j pettijohn geochemist dr hans eugster newly built geochemistry laboratory conducted experimental work evaporite minerals near end second semester offered fulltime graduate fellowship earn phd briefly returned south africa marry glenys kathleen smith durban
upon graduating phd offered position assistant professor hopkins lawrence glenys became us citizens two children deborah russell lawrence shared love natural world science children deborah obtained degree mathematics jhu russell studied engineering nearby loyola university maryland son russell currently professor department electrical computer engineering university dayton credits father inspiration pursuing career academia
scientific career
completing doctoral work joined faculty jhu assistant professor department earth planetary sciences worked way academic ranks full professor also served department chair retired status professor emeritus many important scientific achievements academic career also inspired mentored numerous students
words former student colleague dr linda hinnov lawrie hardie made invaluable contributions educational mission johns hopkins taking students classroom field allowing witness geologic processes firsthand farflung locations ran jhu field camp camp singewald western maryland many summers also led regular field trips florida keys assateague island led many trips locations bahamas baja california mexico work also took frequently dolomites italy stranger long hikes climbs field work required use special modes transportation including zodiac inflatable boats minibikes wheeled terrain vehicles see photo
according jhu university news january hardie beloved johns hopkins devotion students levels mentor phd students many since gone leadership positions academia industry government many students became enduring friends colleagues continued collaborations long graduation addition work graduate students dr hardie also taught popular undergraduate introductory geology course hardie enjoyed sharing passion geology wide audience included one time another children
personal life death
enjoyed jazz attended concerts famous ballroom baltimore moving city baltimore pasadena maryland hardie took sailing small boats tartan aptly named trekker magothy river chesapeake bay taught children many students sail later took snow skiing avid golfer along sailing enjoyed sharing activities family students colleagues married glenys hardie years two children five grandchildren
