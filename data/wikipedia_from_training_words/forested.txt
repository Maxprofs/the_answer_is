a forest is a large area of land covered with trees or other woody vegetation hundreds of more precise definitions of forest are used throughout the world incorporating factors such as tree density tree height land use legal standing and ecological function according to the widely-used united nations food and agriculture organization definition forests covered an area of four billion hectares (15 million square miles) or approximately 30 percent of the world's land area in 2006
forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystem of earth and are distributed across the globe forests account for 75% of the gross primary productivity of the earth's biosphere and contain 80% of the earth's plant biomass
forests at different latitudes form distinctly different ecozones boreal forests near the poles tend to consist of evergreens while tropical forests near the equator tend to be distinct from the temperate forests at mid-latitude the amount of precipitation and the elevation of the forest also affects forest composition
human society and forests influence each other in both positive and negative ways forests provide ecosystem services to humans and serve as tourist attractions forests can also impose costs affect people's health and interfere with tourist enjoyment human activities including harvesting forest resources can negatively affect forest ecosystems
== definition ==
although forest is a term of common parlance there is no universally recognised precise definition with more than 800 definitions of forest used around the world although a forest is usually defined by the presence of trees under many definitions an area completely lacking trees may still be considered a forest if it grew trees in the past will grow trees in the future or was legally designated as a forest regardless of vegetation type
there are three broad categories of forest definitions in use administrative land use and land cover administrative definitions are based primarily upon the legal designations of land and commonly bear no relationship to the vegetation growing on the land land that is legally designated as a forest is defined as a forest even if no trees are growing on it land use definitions are based upon the primary purpose that the land serves for example a forest may defined as any land that is used primarily for production of timber under such a land use definition cleared roads or infrastructure within an area used for forestry or areas within the region that have been cleared by harvesting disease or fire are still considered forests even if they contain no trees land cover definitions define forests based upon the type and density of vegetation growing on the land such definitions typically define a forest as an area growing trees above some threshold these thresholds are typically the number of trees per area (density) the area of ground under the tree canopy (canopy cover) or the section of land that is occupied by the cross-section of tree trunks (basal area) under such land cover definitions and area of land only be defined as forest if it is growing trees areas that fail to meet the land cover definition may be still included under while immature trees are establishing if they are expected to meet the definition at maturity
under land use definitions there is considerable variation on where the cutoff points are between a forest woodland and savanna under some definitions forests require very high levels of tree canopy cover from 60% to 100% excluding savannas and woodlands in which trees have a lower canopy cover other definitions consider savannas to be a type of forest and include all areas with tree canopies over 10%
== etymology ==
the word forest comes from middle english from old french forest (also fors) forest vast expanse covered by trees first introduced in english as the word for wild land set aside for hunting without the necessity in definition for the existence of trees possibly a borrowing (probably via frankish or old high german) of the medieval latin word foresta open wood foresta was first used by carolingian scribes in the capitularies of charlemagne to refer specifically to the king's royal hunting grounds the term was not endemic to romance languages (e.g native words for forest in the romance languages evolved out of the latin word silva forest wood (english sylvan) cf italian spanish portuguese selva romanian silv old french selve) and cognates in romance languages such as italian foresta spanish and portuguese floresta etc are all ultimately borrowings of the french word
the exact origin of medieval latin foresta is obscure some authorities claim the word derives from the late latin phrase forestam silvam meaning the outer wood others claim the term is a latinisation of the frankish word *forhist forest wooded country assimilated to forestam silvam (a common practice among frankish scribes) frankish *forhist is attested by old high german forst forest middle low german vorst forest old english fyrh forest woodland game preserve hunting ground (english frith) and old norse fri coniferous forest all of which derive from proto-germanic *furhsa- *furhija- a fir-wood coniferous forest from proto-indo-european *perkwu- a coniferous or mountain forest wooded height
uses of the word forest in english to denote any uninhabited area of non-enclosure are now considered archaic the word was introduced by the norman rulers of england as a legal term (appearing in latin texts like the magna carta) denoting an uncultivated area legally set aside for hunting by feudal nobility (see royal forest)
these hunting forests were not necessarily wooded much if at all however as hunting forests did often include considerable areas of woodland the word forest eventually came to mean wooded land more generally by the start of the 14th century the word appeared in english texts indicating all three senses the most common one the legal term and the archaic usage
other terms used to mean an area with a high density of trees are wood woodland wold weald holt frith and firth unlike forest these are all derived from old english and were not borrowed from another language some classifications now reserve the term woodland for an area with more open space between trees and distinguish among woodlands open forests and closed forests based on crown cover
== forest ecology ==
forests account for 75% of the gross primary productivity of the earth's biosphere and contain 80% of the earth's plant biomass forest ecosystems can be found in all regions capable of sustaining tree growth at altitudes up to the tree line except where natural fire frequency or other disturbance is too high or where the environment has been altered by human activity
the latitudes 10 north and south of the equator are mostly covered in tropical rainforest and the latitudes between 53n and 67n have boreal forest as a general rule forests dominated by angiosperms (broadleaf forests) are more species-rich than those dominated by gymnosperms (conifer montane or needleleaf forests) although exceptions exist
forests sometimes contain many tree species only within a small area (as in tropical rain and temperate deciduous forests) or relatively few species over large areas (e.g. taiga and arid montane coniferous forests) forests are often home to many animal and plant species and biomass per unit area is high compared to other vegetation communities much of this biomass occurs below ground in the root systems and as partially decomposed plant detritus the woody component of a forest contains lignin which is relatively slow to decompose compared with other organic materials such as cellulose or carbohydrate
forests can be classified in different ways and to different degrees of specificity one such way is in terms of the biome in which they exist combined with leaf longevity of the dominant species (whether they are evergreen or deciduous) another distinction is whether the forests are composed predominantly of broadleaf trees coniferous (needle-leaved) trees or mixed
boreal forests occupy the subarctic zone and are generally evergreen and coniferous
temperate zones support both broadleaf deciduous forests (e.g. temperate deciduous forest) and evergreen coniferous forests (e.g. temperate coniferous forests and temperate rainforests) warm temperate zones support broadleaf evergreen forests including laurel forests
tropical and subtropical forests include tropical and subtropical moist forests tropical and subtropical dry forests and tropical and subtropical coniferous forests
physiognomy classifies forests based on their overall physical structure or developmental stage (e.g old growth vs second growth)
forests can also be classified more specifically based on the climate and the dominant tree species present resulting in numerous different forest types (e.g. ponderosa pine/douglas-fir forest)
the number of trees in the world according to a 2015 estimate is 3 trillion of which 1.4 trillion are in the tropics or sub-tropics 0.6 trillion in the temperate zones and 0.7 trillion in the coniferous boreal forests the estimate is about eight times higher than previous estimates and is based on tree densities measured on over 400,000 plots it remains subject to a wide margin of error not least because the samples are mainly from europe and north america
forests can also be classified according to the amount of human alteration old-growth forest contains mainly natural patterns of biodiversity in established seral patterns and they contain mainly species native to the region and habitat in contrast secondary forest often contains significant elements of species which were originally from other regions or habitats
different global forest classification systems have been proposed but none has gained universal acceptance unep-wcmc's forest category classification system is a simplification of other more complex systems (e.g unesco's forest and woodland subformations') this system divides the world's forests into 26 major types which reflect climatic zones as well as the principal types of trees these 26 major types can be reclassified into 6 broader categories temperate needleleaf temperate broadleaf and mixed tropical moist tropical dry sparse trees and parkland and forest plantations each category is described as a separate section below
=== temperate needleleaf ===
temperate needleleaf forests mostly occupy the higher latitude regions of the northern hemisphere as well as high altitude zones and some warm temperate areas especially on nutrient-poor or otherwise unfavourable soils these forests are composed entirely or nearly so of coniferous species (coniferophyta) in the northern hemisphere pines pinus spruces picea larches larix firs abies douglas firs pseudotsuga and hemlocks tsuga make up the canopy but other taxa are also important in the southern hemisphere most coniferous trees (members of the araucariaceae and podocarpaceae) occur in mixtures with broadleaf species and are classed as broadleaf and mixed forests
=== temperate broadleaf and mixed ===
temperate broadleaf and mixed forests include a substantial component of trees in the anthophyta they are generally characteristic of the warmer temperate latitudes but extend to cool temperate ones particularly in the southern hemisphere they include such forest types as the mixed deciduous forests of the united states and their counterparts in china and japan the broadleaf evergreen rainforests of japan chile and tasmania the sclerophyllous forests of australia central chile the mediterranean and california and the southern beech nothofagus forests of chile and new zealand
=== tropical moist ===
there are many different types of tropical moist forests with lowland evergreen broad leaf tropical rainforests for example vrzea and igap forests and the terra firma forests of the amazon basin the peat swamp forests dipterocarp forests of southeast asia and the high forests of the congo basin seasonal tropical forests perhaps the best description for the colloquial term jungle typically range from the rainforest zone 10 degrees north or south of the equator to the tropic of cancer and tropic of capricorn forests located on mountains are also included in this category divided largely into upper and lower montane formations on the basis of the variation of physiognomy corresponding to changes in altitude
=== tropical dry ===
tropical dry forests are characteristic of areas in the tropics affected by seasonal drought the seasonality of rainfall is usually reflected in the deciduousness of the forest canopy with most trees being leafless for several months of the year however under some conditions e.g less fertile soils or less predictable drought regimes the proportion of evergreen species increases and the forests are characterised as sclerophyllous thorn forest a dense forest of low stature with a high frequency of thorny or spiny species is found where drought is prolonged and especially where grazing animals are plentiful on very poor soils and especially where fire is a recurrent phenomenon woody savannas develop (see sparse trees and parkland')
=== sparse trees and parkland ===
sparse trees and parkland are forests with open canopies of 1030% crown cover they occur principally in areas of transition from forested to non-forested landscapes the two major zones in which these ecosystems occur are in the boreal region and in the seasonally dry tropics at high latitudes north of the main zone of boreal forest or taiga growing conditions are not adequate to maintain a continuous closed forest cover so tree cover is both sparse and discontinuous this vegetation is variously called open taiga open lichen woodland and forest tundra it is species-poor has high bryophyte cover and is frequently affected by fire
=== forest plantations ===
forest plantations generally intended for the production of timber and pulpwood increase the total area of forest worldwide commonly mono-specific and/or composed of introduced tree species these ecosystems are not generally important as habitat for native biodiversity however they can be managed in ways that enhance their biodiversity protection functions and they are important providers of ecosystem services such as maintaining nutrient capital protecting watersheds and soil structure as well as storing carbon they may also play an important role in alleviating pressure on natural forests for timber and fuelwood production
== relationship to human society ==
forests may provide a diversity of ecosystem services including recycling carbon dioxide into oxygen acting as a carbon sink aiding in regulating climate purify water mitigating natural hazards such as floods and serving as a genetic reserve forests also serve as a source of lumber and as recreational areas
it is often forgotten that forests do not only provide benefits but can also incur large and significant costs to humans forests may impose a considerable economic burden diminish the enjoyment of natural areas cause a dramatic decline in the food producing capacity of grazing land and cultivated land reduce biodiversity remove available water for humans and wildlife harbour dangerous and destructive wildlife and act as reservoirs of human and livestock disease
the management of forests is often referred to as forestry forest management has changed considerably over the last few centuries with rapid changes from the 1980s onwards culminating in a practice now referred to as sustainable forest management forest ecologists concentrate on forest patterns and processes usually with the aim of elucidating cause-and-effect relationships foresters who practice sustainable forest management focus on the integration of ecological social and economic values often in consultation with local communities and other stakeholders
humans have generally decreased the amount of forest worldwide anthropogenic factors that can affect forests include logging urban sprawl human-caused forest fires acid rain invasive species and the slash and burn practices of swidden agriculture or shifting cultivation the loss and re-growth of forest leads to a distinction between two broad types of forest primary or old-growth forest and secondary forest there are also many natural factors that can cause changes in forests over time including forest fires insects diseases weather competition between species etc in 1997 the world resources institute recorded that only 20% of the world's original forests remained in large intact tracts of undisturbed forest more than 75% of these intact forests lie in three countriesthe boreal forests of russia and canada and the rainforest of brazil
in 2010 the food and agriculture organization of the united nations reported that world deforestation mainly the conversion of tropical forests to agricultural land had decreased over the past ten years but still continues at a high rate in many countries globally around 13 million hectares of forests were converted to other uses or lost through natural causes each year between 2000 and 2010 as compared to around 16 million hectares per year during the 1990s the study covered 233 countries and areas brazil and indonesia which had the highest loss of forests in the 1990s have significantly reduced their deforestation rates china instituted a ban on logging beginning in 1998 due to the erosion and flooding that it caused in addition ambitious tree planting programmes in countries such as china india the united states and vietnam - combined with natural expansion of forests in some regions - have added more than seven million hectares of new forests annually as a result the net loss of forest area was reduced to 5.2 million hectares per year between 2000 and 2010 down from 8.3 million hectares annually in the 1990s in 2015 a study for nature climate change showed that the trend has recently been reversed leading to an overall gain in global biomass and forests this gain is due especially to reforestation in china and russia on september 7 2015 the food and agriculture organization of the united nations released a new study stating that over the last 25 years the global deforestation rate has decreased by 50% due to improved management of forests and greater government protection
smaller areas of woodland in cities may be managed as urban forestry sometimes within public parks these are often created for human benefits attention restoration theory argues that spending time in nature reduces stress and improves health while forest schools and kindergartens help young people to develop social as well as scientific skills in forests these typically need to be close to where the children live for practical logistics
=== canada ===
canada has about 4,020,000 square kilometres (1,550,000 sq mi) of forest land more than 90% of forest land is publicly owned and about 50% of the total forest area is allocated for harvesting these allocated areas are managed using the principles of sustainable forest management which includes extensive consultation with local stakeholders about eight percent of canadas forest is legally protected from resource development much more forest landabout 40 percent of the total forest land baseis subject to varying degrees of protection through processes such as integrated land use planning or defined management areas such as certified forests
by december 2006 over 1,237,000 square kilometers of forest land in canada (about half the global total) had been certified as being sustainably managed clearcutting first used in the latter half of the 20th century is less expensive but devastating to the environment and companies are required by law to ensure that harvested areas are adequately regenerated most canadian provinces have regulations limiting the size of clearcuts although some older clearcuts can range upwards of 110 square kilometres (27,000 acres) in size which were cut over several years
=== united states ===
in the united states most forests have historically been affected by humans to some degree though in recent years improved forestry practices has helped regulate or moderate large scale or severe impacts however the united states forest service estimates a net loss of about 2 million hectares (4,942,000 acres) between 1997 and 2020 this estimate includes conversion of forest land to other uses including urban and suburban development as well as afforestation and natural reversion of abandoned crop and pasture land to forest however in many areas of the united states the area of forest is stable or increasing particularly in many northern states the opposite problem from flooding has plagued national forests with loggers complaining that a lack of thinning and proper forest management has resulted in large forest fires
