childhood is the age span ranging from birth to adolescence according to piaget's theory of cognitive development childhood consists of two stages preoperational stage and concrete operational stage in developmental psychology childhood is divided up into the developmental stages of toddlerhood (learning to walk) early childhood (play age) middle childhood (school age) and adolescence (puberty through post-puberty) various childhood factors could affect a person's attitude formation
the concept of childhood emerged during the 17th and 18th centuries particularly through the educational theories of the philosopher john locke and the growth of books for and about children previous to this point children were often seen as incomplete versions of adults
== age ranges of childhoodedit ==
the term childhood is non-specific and can imply a varying range of years in human development developmentally and biologically it refers to the period between infancy and adulthood in common terms childhood is considered to start from birth some consider childhood as a concept of play and innocence which ends at adolescence in the legal systems of many countries there is an age of majority when childhood officially ends and a person legally becomes an adult the age ranges anywhere from 15 to 21 with 18 being the most common
== developmental stages of childhoodedit ==
=== early childhoodedit ===
early childhood follows the infancy stage and begins with toddlerhood when the child begins speaking or taking steps independently while toddlerhood ends around age three when the child becomes less dependent on parental assistance for basic needs early childhood continues approximately through years seven or eight according to the national association for the education of young children early childhood spans the human life from birth to age eight at this stage children are learning through observing experimenting and communicating with others adults supervise and support the development process of the child which then will lead to the child's autonomy also during this stage a strong emotional bond is created between the child and the care providers the children also start to begin kindergarten at this age to start their social lives
=== middle childhoodedit ===
middle childhood begins at around age seven or eight approximating primary school age it ends around puberty which typically marks the beginning of adolescence in this period children are attending school thus developing socially and mentally they are at a stage where they make new friends and gain new skills which will enable them to become more independent and enhance their individuality
=== adolescenceedit ===
adolescence is usually determined by the onset of puberty however puberty may also begin in preadolescence the onset of adolescence brings about various physical psychological and behavioural changes the end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood varies by country and by function and even within a single nation-state or culture there may be different ages at which an individual is considered to be (chronologically and the legally) mature enough to be entrusted by society with certain tasks
== historyedit ==
it has been argued that childhood is not a natural phenomenon but a creation of society philippe aris an important french medievalist and historian suggested this in his book centuries of childhood this theme was then taken up by cunningham in his book the invention of childhood (2006) which looks at the historical aspects of childhood from the middle ages to what he refers to as the post war period of the 1950s 1960s and 1970s
aris published a study in 1961 of paintings gravestones furniture and school records he found that before the 17th-century children were represented as mini-adults since then historians have increasingly researched childhood in past times before aris george boas had published the cult of childhood during the renaissance artistic depictions of children increased dramatically in europe this did not impact the social attitude to children much however (see child labour)
during the 1600s the concept of childhood began to emerge in europe adults saw children as separate beings innocent and in need of protection and training by the adults around them the english philosopher john locke was particularly influential in defining this new attitude towards children especially with regard to his theory of the tabula rasa which considered the mind at birth to be a blank slate a corollary of this doctrine was that the mind of the child was born blank and that it was the duty of the parents to imbue the child with correct notions during the early period of capitalism the rise of a large commercial middle class mainly in the protestant countries of the dutch republic and england brought about a new family ideology centred around the upbringing of children puritanism stressed the importance of individual salvation and concern for the spiritual welfare of children
the modern notion of childhood with its own autonomy and goals began to emerge during the enlightenment and the romantic period that followed it jean jacques rousseau formulated the romantic attitude towards children in his famous 1762 novel emile or on education building on the ideas of john locke and other 17th-century thinkers rousseau described childhood as a brief period of sanctuary before people encounter the perils and hardships of adulthood sir joshua reynolds extensive children portraiture clearly demonstrate the new enlightened attitudes toward young children his 1788 painting the age of innocence emphasizes the innocence and natural grace of the posing child and soon became a public favourite
with the onset of industrialisation in england a growing divergence between high-minded romantic ideals of childhood and the reality of the growing magnitude of child exploitation in the workplace became increasingly apparent by the late 18th century however children were specially employed at the factories and mines and as chimney sweeps often working long hours in dangerous jobs for low pay as the century wore on the contradiction between the conditions on the ground for children of the poor and the middle-class notion of childhood as a time of innocence led to the first campaigns for the imposition of legal protection for children reformers attacked child labor from the 1830s onward bolstered by the horrific descriptions of london street life by charles dickens the campaign eventually led to the factory acts which mitigated the exploitation of children at the workplace
the modern attitude to children emerged by the late 19th century the victorian middle and upper classes emphasized the role of the family and the sanctity of the child an attitude that has remained dominant in western societies ever since the genre of children's literature took off with a proliferation of humorous child-oriented books attuned to the child's imagination lewis carroll's fantasy alice's adventures in wonderland published in 1865 in england was a landmark in the genre regarded as the first english masterpiece written for children its publication opened the first golden age of children's literature
the latter half of the century also saw the introduction of compulsory state schooling of children across europe which decisively removed children from the workplace into schools the market economy of the 19th century enabled the concept of childhood as a time of fun of happiness factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted the girls and organized sports and activities were played by the boys the boy scouts was founded by sir robert baden-powell in 1908 which provided young boys with outdoor activities aiming at developing character citizenship and personal fitness qualities
== geographies of childhoodedit ==
the geographies of childhood involves how (adult) society perceives the very idea of childhood and the many ways the attitudes and behaviors of adults affects children's lives this includes ideas about the surrounding environment of children and its related implications this is similar in some respects to children's geographies which examines the places and spaces in which children live
=== modern concepts of childhoodedit ===
the concept of childhood appears to evolve and change shape as lifestyles change and adult expectations alter some believe that children should not have any worries and should not have to work life should be happy and trouble-free childhood is usually a mixture of happiness wonder angst and resilience it is generally a time of playing learning socializing exploring and worrying in a world without much adult interference aside from parents it is a time of learning about responsibilities without having to deal with adult responsibilities
childhood is often retrospectively viewed as a time of innocence which is generally viewed as a positive term connoting an optimistic view of the world in particular one where the lack of knowledge stems from a lack of wrongdoing whereas greater knowledge comes from doing wrong a loss of innocence is a common concept and is often seen as an integral part of coming of age it is usually thought of as an experience or period in a child's life that widens their awareness of evil pain or the world around them this theme is demonstrated in the novels to kill a mockingbird and lord of the flies the fictional character peter pan was the embodiment of a childhood that never ends
=== nature deficit disorderedit ===
nature deficit disorder a term coined by richard louv in his 2005 book last child in the woods refers to the trend in the united states and canada for less time for outdoor play resulting in a wide range of behavioral problems with the heavy use of cellphones computers video games and television children have more reasons to stay inside rather than outdoors exploring the average american child spends 44 hours a week with electronic media recent research has drawn a further correlation between the declining number of national park visits in the u.s and increasing consumption of electronic media by children the media has accelerated the trend by deemphasizing views of nature as in disney films
== healthy childhoodsedit ==
=== role of parentsedit ===
=== children's healthedit ===
children's health includes the physical mental and social well-being of children maintaining children's health implies offering them healthy foods insuring they get enough sleep and exercise and protecting their safety children in certain parts of the world often suffer from malnutrition which is often associated with other conditions such diarrhea pneumonia and malaria
=== child protectionedit ===

=== playedit ===
play is essential to the cognitive physical social and emotional well-being of children it offers children opportunities for physical (running jumping climbing etc.) intellectual (social skills community norms ethics and general knowledge) and emotional development (empathy compassion and friendships) unstructured play encourages creativity and imagination playing and interacting with other children as well as some adults provides opportunities for friendships social interactions conflicts and resolutions
it is through play that children at a very early age engage and interact in the world around them play allows children to create and explore a world they can master conquering their fears while practicing adult roles sometimes in conjunction with other children or adult caregivers undirected play allows children to learn how to work in groups to share to negotiate to resolve conflicts and to learn self-advocacy skills however when play is controlled by adults children acquiesce to adult rules and concerns and lose some of the benefits play offers them this is especially true in developing creativity leadership and group skills
play is considered to be so important to optimal child development that it has been recognized by the united nations high commission for human rights as a right of every child children who are being raised in a hurried and pressured style may limit the protective benefits they would gain from child-driven play
the initiation of play in a classroom setting allows teachers and students to interact through playfulness associated with a learning experience therefore playfulness aids the interactions between adults and children in a learning environment playful structure means to combine informal learning with formal learning to produce an effective learning experience for children at a young age
even though play is considered to be the most important to optimal child development,the environment affects their play and therefore their development poor children confront widespread environmental inequities as they experience less social support and their parents are less responsive and more authoritarian children from low income families are most likely to have less access to books and computers which effects their development as they do not have access to resources that would enhance their development
=== street cultureedit ===
children's street culture refers to the cumulative culture created by young children and is sometimes referred to as their secret world it is most common in children between the ages of seven and twelve it is strongest in urban working class industrial districts where children are traditionally free to play out in the streets for long periods without supervision it is invented and largely sustained by children themselves with little adult interference
young children's street culture usually takes place on quiet backstreets and pavements and along routes that venture out into local parks playgrounds scrub and wasteland and to local shops it often imposes imaginative status on certain sections of the urban realm (local buildings kerbs street objects etc.) children designate specific areas that serve as informal meeting and relaxation places (see sobel 2001) an urban area that looks faceless or neglected to an adult may have deep spirit of place meanings in to children since the advent of indoor distractions such as video games and television concerns have been expressed about the vitality or even the survival of children's street culture
== children's rightsedit ==
children's rights are the human rights of children with particular attention to the rights of special protection and care afforded to minors and provision of basic necessities children's rights are not respected in all countries globally millions of children are subjected to exploitation including deprivation of education child labor forced military service or imprisonment in institutions or detention centers where they endure poor conditions and violence
