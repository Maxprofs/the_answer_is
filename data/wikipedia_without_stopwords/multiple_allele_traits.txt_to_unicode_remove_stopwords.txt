allele uk lil us lil allel one number alternative forms gene genetic locus sometimes different alleles result different observable phenotypic traits different pigmentation however genetic variations result little observable variation
multicellular organisms two sets chromosomes diploid chromosomes referred homologous chromosomes diploid organisms one copy gene therefore one allele chromosome alleles organism homozygous respect gene alleles different organism heterozygous respect gene
word allele short form allelomorph form used early days genetics describe variant forms gene detected different phenotypes derives greek prefix allel meaning reciprocal related greek adjective allos cognate latin alius meaning
dominant recessive allelesedit
many cases genotypic interactions two alleles locus described dominant recessive according two homozygous phenotypes heterozygote resembles heterozygote indistinguishable one homozygotes allele involved said dominant said recessive former degree pattern dominance varies among loci type interaction first formally described gregor mendel however many traits defy simple categorization phenotypes modeled codominance polygenic inheritance
term wild type allele sometimes used describe allele thought contribute typical phenotypic character seen wild populations organisms fruit flies drosophila melanogaster wild type allele historically regarded dominant common normal contrast mutant alleles regarded recessive rare frequently deleterious formerly thought individuals homozygous wild type allele gene loci alternative mutant allele found homozygous form small minority affected individuals often genetic diseases frequently heterozygous form carriers mutant allele appreciated gene loci highly polymorphic multiple alleles whose frequencies vary population population great deal genetic variation hidden form alleles produce obvious phenotypic differences
multiple allelesedit
population species organisms typically includes multiple alleles locus among various individuals allelic variation locus measurable number alleles polymorphism present proportion heterozygotes population null allele gene variant lacks genes normal function either expressed expressed protein inactive
example gene locus abo blood type carbohydrate antigens humans classical genetics recognizes three alleles ia ib determine compatibility blood transfusions individual one six possible genotypes iaia iai ibib ibi iaib ii produce one four possible phenotypes type produced iaia homozygous iai heterozygous genotypes type b produced ibib homozygous ibi heterozygous genotypes type ab produced iaib heterozygous genotype type o produced ii homozygous genotype known b o alleles actually class multiple alleles different dna sequences produce proteins identical properties alleles known abo locus individual type blood may ao heterozygote aa homozygote aa heterozygote two different alleles
allele genotype frequenciesedit
frequency alleles diploid population used predict frequencies corresponding genotypes see hardyweinberg principle simple model two alleles
p frequency one allele q frequency alternative allele necessarily sum unity p fraction population homozygous first allele pq fraction heterozygotes q fraction homozygous alternative allele first allele dominant second fraction population show dominant phenotype p pq fraction recessive phenotype q
three alleles
case multiple alleles diploid locus number possible genotypes g number alleles given expression
allelic dominance genetic disordersedit
number genetic disorders caused individual inherits two recessive alleles singlegene trait recessive genetic disorders include albinism cystic fibrosis galactosemia phenylketonuria pku taysachs disease disorders also due recessive alleles gene locus located x chromosome males one copy hemizygous frequent males females examples include redgreen color blindness fragile x syndrome
disorders huntington disease occur individual inherits one dominant allele
