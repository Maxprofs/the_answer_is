engineering statistics combines engineering and statistics
design of experiments (doe) is a methodology for formulating scientific and engineering problems using statistical models the protocol specifies a randomization procedure for the experiment and specifies the primary data-analysis particularly in hypothesis testing in a secondary analysis the statistical analyst further examines the data to suggest other questions and to help plan future experiments in engineering applications the goal is often to optimize a process or product rather than to subject a scientific hypothesis to test of its predictive adequacy the use of optimal (or near optimal) designs reduces the cost of experimentation
quality control and process control use statistics as a tool to manage conformance to specifications of manufacturing processes and their products
time and methods engineering use statistics to study repetitive operations in manufacturing in order to set standards and find optimum (in some sense) manufacturing procedures
reliability engineering which measures the ability of a system to perform for its intended function (and time) and has tools for improving performance
probabilistic design involving the use of probability in product and system design
system identification uses statistical methods to build mathematical models of dynamical systems from measured data system identification also includes the optimal design of experiments for efficiently generating informative data for fitting such models
