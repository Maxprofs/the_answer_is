following derives mathematically orbit newton would done start newtonian law gravitational acceleration towards central body related inverse square distance
standard gravitational parameter case assume central body heavy enough considered stationary ignore subtle effects general relativity
pendulum object attached spring swings ellipse inward accelerationforce proportionate distance due way vectors add component force directions also proportionate respective components distances hence entire analysis done separately dimensions results harmonic parabolic equations ellipse decreasing relationship dimensions cannot separated
reason sun focal point orbits ellipse centre object moving really fast moves gravitational pull decreases allowing object almost escape quite escape orbit cycles around first parabola quite far away slowly circles back picks speed falls boomerang back space

use denote standard derivatives distance angle change time also take derivative vector see changes time subtracting location time time dividing result also vector basis vector moves object orbits start differentiating time vector keeps beginning origin rotates angle moves head distance perpendicular direction giving derivative
find velocity acceleration orbiting object
coefficients radial transverse components acceleration said newton gives first due gravity second zero
equation rearranged using integration parts
divide zero unless orbiting object crashes derivative zero gives function constant
actually theoretical proof keplers second law line joining planet sun sweeps equal areas equal intervals time constant integration h angular momentum per unit mass
order get equation orbit equation need eliminate time see also binet equation polar coordinates would express distance orbiting object center function angle however easier introduced auxiliary variable express function derivatives respect time may rewritten derivatives respect angle
