cell theoryedit
cell theory states cell fundamental unit life living things composed one cells secreted products cells eg shells hairs nails etc cells arise cells cell division multicellular organisms every cell organisms body derives ultimately single cell fertilized egg cell also considered basic unit many pathological processes addition phenomenon energy flow occurs cells processes part function known metabolism finally cells contain hereditary information dna passed cell cell cell division
evolutionedit
central organizing concept biology life changes develops evolution lifeforms known common origin theory evolution postulates organisms earth living extinct descended common ancestor ancestral gene pool last universal common ancestor organisms believed appeared billion years ago biologists generally regard universality ubiquity genetic code definitive evidence favor theory universal common descent bacteria archaea eukaryotes see origin life
introduced scientific lexicon jeanbaptiste de lamarck evolution established charles darwin fifty years later viable scientific model articulated driving force natural selection alfred russel wallace recognized codiscoverer concept helped research experiment concept evolution evolution used explain great variations life found earth
darwin theorized species breeds developed processes natural selection artificial selection selective breeding genetic drift embraced additional mechanism evolutionary development modern synthesis theory

geneticsedit
genes primary units inheritance organisms gene unit heredity corresponds region dna influences form function organism specific ways organisms bacteria animals share basic machinery copies translates dna proteins cells transcribe dna gene rna version gene ribosome translates rna protein sequence amino acids translation code rna codon amino acid organisms slightly different example sequence dna codes insulin humans also codes insulin inserted organisms plants
dna usually occurs linear chromosomes eukaryotes circular chromosomes prokaryotes chromosome organized structure consisting dna histones set chromosomes cell hereditary information found mitochondria chloroplasts locations collectively known genome eukaryotes genomic dna located cell nucleus along small amounts mitochondria chloroplasts prokaryotes dna held within irregularly shaped body cytoplasm called nucleoid genetic information genome held within genes complete assemblage information organism called genotype
homeostasisedit
homeostasis ability open system regulate internal environment maintain stable conditions means multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustments controlled interrelated regulation mechanisms living organisms whether unicellular multicellular exhibit homeostasis
maintain dynamic equilibrium effectively carry certain functions system must detect respond perturbations detection perturbation biological system normally responds negative feedback means stabilizing conditions either reducing increasing activity organ system one example release glucagon sugar levels low
energyedit
survival living organism depends continuous input energy chemical reactions responsible structure function tuned extract energy substances act food transform help form new cells sustain process molecules chemical substances constitute food play two roles first contain energy transformed biological chemical reactions second develop new molecular structures made biomolecules
organisms responsible introduction energy ecosystem known producers autotrophs nearly organisms originally draw energy sun plants phototrophs use solar energy via process known photosynthesis convert raw materials organic molecules atp whose bonds broken release energy ecosystems however depend entirely energy extracted chemotrophs methane sulfides nonluminal energy sources
captured energy used produce biomass sustain life provide energy growth development majority rest energy lost heat waste molecules important processes converting energy trapped chemical substances energy useful sustain life metabolism cellular respiration
