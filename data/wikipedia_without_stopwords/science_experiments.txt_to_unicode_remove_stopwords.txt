overview
scientific method experiment empirical procedure arbitrates competing models hypotheses researchers also use experimentation test existing theories new hypotheses support disprove
experiment usually tests hypothesis expectation particular process phenomenon works however experiment may also aim answer whatif question without specific expectation experiment reveals confirm prior results experiment carefully conducted results usually either support disprove hypothesis according philosophies science experiment never prove hypothesis add support similarly experiment provides counterexample disprove theory hypothesis experiment must also control possible confounding factorsany factors would mar accuracy repeatability experiment ability interpret results confounding commonly eliminated scientific controls andor randomized experiments random assignment
engineering physical sciences experiments primary component scientific method used test theories hypotheses physical processes work particular conditions eg whether particular engineering process produce desired chemical compound typically experiments fields focus replication identical procedures hopes producing identical results replication random assignment uncommon
medicine social sciences prevalence experimental research varies widely across disciplines used however experiments typically follow form clinical trial experimental units usually individual human beings randomly assigned treatment control condition one outcomes assessed contrast norms physical sciences focus typically average treatment effect difference outcomes treatment control groups another test statistic produced experiment single study typically involve replications experiment separate studies may aggregated systematic review metaanalysis
course differences experimental practice branches science exceptions example agricultural research frequently uses randomized experiments eg test comparative effectiveness different fertilizers similarly experimental economics often involves experimental tests theorized human behaviors without relying random assignment individuals treatment control conditions
history
francis bacon english philosopher scientist active th century became early influential supporter experimental science disagreed method answering scientific questions deduction described follows first determined question according man resorts experience bending conformity placets leads like captive procession bacon wanted method relied repeatable observations experiments notably first ordered scientific method understand today
centuries followed people applied scientific method different areas made important advances discoveries example galileo galilei accurately measured time experimented make accurate measurements conclusions speed falling body antoine lavoisier french chemist used experiment describe new areas combustion biochemistry develop theory conservation mass matter louis pasteur used scientific method disprove prevailing theory spontaneous generation develop germ theory disease importance controlling potentially confounding variables use welldesigned laboratory experiments preferred possible
considerable amount progress design analysis experiments occurred early th century contributions statisticians ronald fisher jerzy neyman oscar kempthorne gertrude mary cox william gemmell cochran among others early work largely synthesized label rubin causal model formalizes earlier statistical approaches analysis experiments
types experiment
experiments might categorized according number dimensions depending upon professional norms standards different fields study disciplines eg psychology political science true experiment method social research two kinds variables independent variable manipulated experimenter dependent variable measured signifying characteristic true experiment randomly allocates subjects neutralize experimenter bias ensures large number iterations experiment controls confounding factors
controlled experiments
controlled experiment often compares results obtained experimental samples control samples practically identical experimental sample except one aspect whose effect tested independent variable good example would drug trial sample group receiving drug would experimental group treatment group one receiving placebo regular treatment would control one many laboratory experiments good practice several replicate samples test performed positive control negative control results replicate samples often averaged one replicates obviously inconsistent results samples discarded result experimental error step test procedure may mistakenly omitted sample often tests done duplicate triplicate positive control procedure similar actual experimental test known previous experience give positive result negative control known give negative result positive control confirms basic conditions experiment able produce positive result even none actual experimental samples produce positive result negative control demonstrates baseline result obtained test produce measurable positive result often value negative control treated background value subtract test sample results sometimes positive control takes quadrant standard curve
example often used teaching laboratories controlled protein assay students might given fluid sample containing unknown student amount protein job correctly perform controlled experiment determine concentration protein fluid sample usually called unknown sample teaching lab would equipped protein standard solution known protein concentration students could make several positive control samples containing various dilutions protein standard negative control samples would contain reagents protein assay protein example samples performed duplicate assay colorimetric assay spectrophotometer measure amount protein samples detecting colored complex formed interaction protein molecules molecules added dye illustration results diluted test samples compared results standard curve blue line illustration estimate amount protein unknown sample
controlled experiments performed difficult exactly control conditions experiment case experiment begins creating two sample groups probabilistically equivalent means measurements traits similar among groups groups respond manner given treatment equivalency determined statistical methods take account amount variation individuals number individuals group fields microbiology chemistry little variation individuals group size easily millions statistical methods often bypassed simply splitting solution equal parts assumed produce identical sample groups
equivalent groups formed experimenter tries treat identically except one variable wishes isolate human experimentation requires special safeguards outside variables placebo effect experiments generally double blind meaning neither volunteer researcher knows individuals control group experimental group data collected ensures effects volunteer due treatment response knowledge treated
human experiments researchers may give subject person stimulus subject responds goal experiment measure response stimulus test method
design experiments two treatments applied estimate difference mean responses treatments example experiment baking bread could estimate difference responses associated quantitative variables ratio water flour qualitative variables strains yeast experimentation step scientific method helps people decide two competing explanations hypotheses hypotheses suggest reasons explain phenomenon predict results action example might hypothesis release ball fall floor suggestion tested carrying experiment letting go ball observing results formally hypothesis compared opposite null hypothesis release ball fall floor null hypothesis explanation predictive power phenomenon reasoning investigated hypotheses defined experiment carried results analysed confirm refute define accuracy hypotheses
natural experiments
term experiment usually implies controlled experiment sometimes controlled experiments prohibitively difficult impossible case researchers resort natural experiments quasiexperiments natural experiments rely solely observations variables system study rather manipulation one variables occurs controlled experiments degree possible attempt collect data system way contribution variables determined effects variation certain variables remain approximately constant effects variables discerned degree possible depends observed correlation explanatory variables observed data variables well correlated natural experiments approach power controlled experiments usually however correlation variables reduces reliability natural experiments relative could concluded controlled experiment performed also natural experiments usually take place uncontrolled environments variables undetected sources neither measured held constant may produce illusory correlations variables study
much research several important science disciplines including economics political science geology paleontology ecology meteorology astronomy relies quasiexperiments example astronomy clearly impossible testing hypothesis suns collapsed clouds hydrogen start giant cloud hydrogen perform experiment waiting billion years form sun however observing various clouds hydrogen various states collapse implications hypothesis example presence various spectral emissions light stars collect data require support hypothesis early example type experiment first verification th century light travel place place instantaneously instead measurable speed observation appearance moons jupiter slightly delayed jupiter farther earth opposed jupiter closer earth phenomenon used demonstrate difference time appearance moons consistent measurable speed
field experiments
field experiments named distinguish laboratory experiments enforce scientific control testing hypothesis artificial highly controlled setting laboratory often used social sciences especially economic analyses education health interventions field experiments advantage outcomes observed natural setting rather contrived laboratory environment reason field experiments sometimes seen higher external validity laboratory experiments however like natural experiments field experiments suffer possibility contamination experimental conditions controlled precision certainty lab yet phenomena eg voter turnout election cannot easily studied laboratory
contrast observational study
observational study used impractical unethical costprohibitive otherwise inefficient fit physical social system laboratory setting completely control confounding factors apply random assignment also used confounding factors either limited known well enough analyze data light though may rare social phenomena examination observational science valid experimenter must know account confounding factors situations observational studies value often suggest hypotheses tested randomized experiments collecting fresh data
fundamentally however observational studies experiments definition observational studies lack manipulation required baconian experiments addition observational studies eg biological social systems often involve variables difficult quantify control observational studies limited lack statistical properties randomized experiments randomized experiment method randomization specified experimental protocol guides statistical analysis usually specified also experimental protocol without statistical model reflects objective randomization statistical analysis relies subjective model inferences subjective models unreliable theory practice fact several cases carefully conducted observational studies consistently give wrong results results observational studies inconsistent also differ results experiments example epidemiological studies colon cancer consistently show beneficial correlations broccoli consumption experiments find benefit
particular problem observational studies involving human subjects great difficulty attaining fair comparisons treatments exposures studies prone selection bias groups receiving different treatments exposures may differ greatly according covariates age height weight medications exercise nutritional status ethnicity family medical history etc contrast randomization implies covariate mean group expected randomized trial variation mean expected course randomization ensures experimental groups mean values close due central limit theorem markovs inequality inadequate randomization low sample size systematic variation covariates treatment groups exposure groups makes difficult separate effect treatment exposure effects covariates measured mathematical models used analyze data must consider differing covariate measured results meaningful covariate neither randomized included model
avoid conditions render experiment far less useful physicians conducting medical trialssay us food drug administration approvalquantify randomize covariates identified researchers attempt reduce biases observational studies complicated statistical methods propensity score matching methods require large populations subjects extensive information covariates outcomes also quantified possible bone density amount cell substance blood physical strength endurance etc based subjects professional observers opinion way design observational study render results objective therefore convincing
ethics
placing distribution independent variables control researcher experiment particularly involves human subjects introduces potential ethical considerations balancing benefit harm fairly distributing interventions eg treatments disease informed consent example psychology health care unethical provide substandard treatment patients therefore ethical review boards supposed stop clinical trials experiments unless new treatment believed offer benefits good current best practice also generally unethical often illegal conduct randomized experiments effects substandard harmful treatments effects ingesting arsenic human health understand effects exposures scientists sometimes use observational studies understand effects factors
even experimental research directly involve human subjects may still present ethical concerns example nuclear bomb experiments conducted manhattan project implied use nuclear reactions harm human beings even though experiments directly involve human subjects
