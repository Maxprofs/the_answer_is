molar solubility number moles substance solute dissolved per liter solution solution becomes saturated calculated substances solubility product constant ksp stoichiometry units moll sometimes written m
derivation
given excess simple salt axby aqueous solution common ions b already present solution amount enters solution calculated follows
chemical equation salt would
b ions x y coefficients
relationship changes amount mole unit represented n species given stoichiometry follows
rearranged b yields
deltas initialsi finalsf relate simply since case molar solubility defined assuming common ions already present solution difference law
condense identities
variables v volume molar solubility would written
solubility product expression defined
four sets equations enough solve algebraically
hence
simple calculation
solubility product constant ksp dissociation product ions known molar solubility computed without aforementioned equation
example
ionic substance ab dissociates b one mole ion two moles ion b soluble ion dissociation equation thus written
corresponding solubility product equation
initial concentration x b must x inserting initial concentrations solubility product equation gives
ksp known x computed molar solubility
