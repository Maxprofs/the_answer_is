translation is the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text whereas interpreting undoubtedly antedates writing translation began only after the appearance of written literature there exist partial translations of the sumerian epic of gilgamesh (ca 2000 bce) into southwest asian languages of the second millennium bce
translators always risk inappropriate spill-over of source-language idiom and usage into the target-language translation on the other hand spill-overs have imported useful source-language calques and loanwords that have enriched the target languages indeed translators have helped substantially to shape the languages into which they have translated
due to the demands of business documentation consequent to the industrial revolution that began in the mid-18th century some translation specialties have become formalized with dedicated schools and professional associations
because of the laboriousness of translation since the 1940s engineers have sought to automate translation (machine translation) or to mechanically aid the human translator (computer-assisted translation) the rise of the internet has fostered a world-wide market for translation services and has facilitated language localization
translation studies systematically study the theory and practice of translation
== etymology ==
the english word translation derives from the latin translatio (which itself comes from trans- and from fero the supine form of which is latumtogether meaning a carrying across or a bringing across") the modern romance languages use equivalents of the english term translation that are derived from that same latin source or from the alternative latin traduco ("to lead across or to bring across") the slavic and germanic languages (except in the case of the dutch equivalent vertaling"a re-language-ing") likewise use calques of these latin sources
the ancient greek term for translation (metaphrasis a speaking across") has supplied english with metaphrase (a literal, or word-for-word, translation) as contrasted with paraphrase ("a saying in other words from  paraphrasis) metaphrase corresponds in one of the more recent terminologies to formal equivalence and paraphrase to dynamic equivalence.
strictly speaking the concept of metaphrase of word-for-word translation is an imperfect concept because a given word in a given language often carries more than one meaning and because a similar given meaning may often be represented in a given language by more than one word nevertheless metaphrase and paraphrase may be useful as ideal concepts that mark the extremes in the spectrum of possible approaches to translation
a secular icon for the art of translation is the rosetta stone this trilingual (hieroglyphic-egyptian demotic-egyptian ancient-greek) stele became the translator's key to decryption of egyptian hieroglyphs by thomas young jean-franois champollion and others
in the united states of america the rosetta stone is incorporated into the crest of the defense language institute
== theories ==
=== western theory ===
discussions of the theory and practice of translation reach back into antiquity and show remarkable continuities the ancient greeks distinguished between metaphrase (literal translation) and paraphrase this distinction was adopted by english poet and translator john dryden (16311700) who described translation as the judicious blending of these two modes of phrasing when selecting in the target language counterparts, or equivalents for the expressions used in the source language
when [words] appear literally graceful it were an injury to the author that they should be changed but since what is beautiful in one [language] is often barbarous nay sometimes nonsense in another it would be unreasonable to limit a translator to the narrow compass of his author's words tis enough if he choose out some expression which does not vitiate the sense
dryden cautioned however against the license of imitation i.e. of adapted translation when a painter copies from the life he has no privilege to alter features and lineaments...
this general formulation of the central concept of translation equivalence is as adequate as any that has been proposed since cicero and horace who in 1st-century-bce rome famously and literally cautioned against translating word for word (verbum pro verbo)
despite occasional theoretical diversity the actual practice of translation has hardly changed since antiquity except for some extreme metaphrasers in the early christian period and the middle ages and adapters in various periods (especially pre-classical rome and the 18th century) translators have generally shown prudent flexibility in seeking equivalents literal where possible paraphrastic where necessary for the original meaning and other crucial values (e.g. style verse form concordance with musical accompaniment or in films with speech articulatory movements) as determined from context
in general translators have sought to preserve the context itself by reproducing the original order of sememes and hence word order when necessary reinterpreting the actual grammatical structure for example by shifting from active to passive voice or vice versa the grammatical differences between fixed-word-order languages (e.g english french german) and free-word-order languages (e.g. greek latin polish russian) have been no impediment in this regard the particular syntax (sentence-structure) characteristics of a text's source language are adjusted to the syntactic requirements of the target language
when a target language has lacked terms that are found in a source language translators have borrowed those terms thereby enriching the target language thanks in great measure to the exchange of calques and loanwords between languages and to their importation from other languages there are few concepts that are untranslatable among the modern european languages
generally the greater the contact and exchange that have existed between two languages or between those languages and a third one the greater is the ratio of metaphrase to paraphrase that may be used in translating among them however due to shifts in ecological niches of words a common etymology is sometimes misleading as a guide to current meaning in one or the other language for example the english actual should not be confused with the cognate french actuel ("present current") the polish aktualny ("present current, topical, timely, feasible") the swedish aktuell ("topical presently of importance") the russian ("urgent topical") or the dutch actueel
the translator's role as a bridge for carrying across values between cultures has been discussed at least since terence the 2nd-century-bce roman adapter of greek comedies the translator's role is however by no means a passive mechanical one and so has also been compared to that of an artist the main ground seems to be the concept of parallel creation found in critics such as cicero dryden observed that translation is a type of drawing after life... comparison of the translator with a musician or actor goes back at least to samuel johnsons remark about alexander pope playing homer on a flageolet while homer himself used a bassoon
if translation be an art it is no easy one in the 13th century roger bacon wrote that if a translation is to be true the translator must know both languages as well as the science that he is to translate and finding that few translators did he wanted to do away with translation and translators altogether
the translator of the bible into german martin luther is credited with being the first european to posit that one translates satisfactorily only toward his own language l.g kelly states that since johann gottfried herder in the 18th century it has been axiomatic that one translates only toward his own language
compounding the demands on the translator is the fact that no dictionary or thesaurus can ever be a fully adequate guide in translating the british historian alexander tytler in his essay on the principles of translation (1790) emphasized that assiduous reading is a more comprehensive guide to a language than are dictionaries the same point but also including listening to the spoken language had earlier in 1783 been made by the polish poet and grammarian onufry andrzej kopczyski
the translators special role in society is described in a posthumous 1803 essay by poland's la fontaine the roman catholic primate of poland poet encyclopedist author of the first polish novel and translator from french and greek ignacy krasicki
=== other traditions ===
due to western colonialism and cultural dominance in recent centuries western translation traditions have largely replaced other traditions the western traditions draw on both ancient and medieval traditions and on more recent european innovations
though earlier approaches to translation are less commonly used today they retain importance when dealing with their products as when historians view ancient or medieval records to piece together events which took place in non-western or pre-western environments also though heavily influenced by western traditions and practiced by translators taught in western-style educational systems chinese and related translation traditions retain some theories and philosophies unique to the chinese tradition
==== near east ====
the traditions of translating material among egyptian mesopotamian syriac anatolian and hebrew go back several millennia an early example of a bilingual document is the 1274 bce treaty of kadesh
==== asia ====
there is a separate tradition of translation in south southeast and east asia (primarily of texts from the indian and chinese civilizations) especially connected with the rendering of religious particularly buddhist texts and with the governance of the chinese empire classical indian translation is characterized by loose adaptation rather than the closer translation more commonly found in europe and chinese translation theory identifies various criteria and limitations in translation
in the east asian sphere of chinese cultural influence more important than translation per se has been the use and reading of chinese texts which also had substantial influence on the japanese korean and vietnamese languages with substantial borrowings of vocabulary and writing system notable is the japanese kanbun a system for glossing chinese texts for japanese speakers
though indianized states in southeast asia often translated sanskrit material into the local languages the literate elites and scribes more commonly used sanskrit as their primary language of culture and government
==== islamic world ====
translation of material into arabic expanded after the creation of arabic script in the 5th century and gained great importance with the rise of islam and islamic empires arab translation initially focused primarily on politics rendering persian greek even chinese and indic diplomatic materials into arabic it later focused on translating classical greek and persian works as well as some chinese and indian texts into arabic for scholarly study at major islamic learning centers such as the al-karaouine (fes morocco) al-azhar (cairo egypt) and the al-nizamiyya of baghdad in terms of theory arabic translation drew heavily on earlier near eastern traditions as well as more contemporary greek and persian traditions
arabic translation efforts and techniques are important to western translation traditions due to centuries of close contacts and exchanges especially after the renaissance europeans began more intensive study of arabic and persian translations of classical works as well as scientific and philosophical works of arab and oriental origins arabic and to a lesser degree persian became important sources of material and perhaps of techniques for revitalized western traditions which in time would overtake the islamic and oriental traditions
in the 19th century after the middle east's islamic clerics and copyists
had conceded defeat in their centuries-old battle to contain the corrupting effects of the printing press [an] explosion in publishing ensued along with expanding secular education printing transformed an overwhelmingly illiterate society into a partly literate one
in the past the sheikhs and the government had exercised a monopoly over knowledge now an expanding elite benefitted from a stream of information on virtually anything that interested them between 1880 and 1908 more than six hundred newspapers and periodicals were founded in egypt alone
the most prominent among them was al-muqtataf [it] was the popular expression of a translation movement that had begun earlier in the century with military and medical manuals and highlights from the enlightenment canon (montesquieu's considerations on the romans and fnelon's telemachus had been favorites.)
the movement to translate english and european texts transformed the arabic and ottoman turkish languages and new words simplified syntax and directness came to be valued over the previous convolutions educated arabs and turks in the new professions and the modernized civil service expressed skepticism writes christopher de bellaigue with a freedom that is rarely witnessed today no longer was legitimate knowledge defined by texts in the religious schools interpreted for the most part with stultifying literalness it had come to include virtually any intellectual production anywhere in the world. one of the neologismss that in a way came to characterize the infusion of new ideas via translation was darwiniya or darwinism
one of the most influential liberal islamic thinkers of the time was muhammad abduh (18491905) egypt's senior judicial authorityits chief muftiat the turn of the 20th century and an admirer of darwin who in 1903 visited darwin's exponent herbert spencer at his home in brighton spencer's view of society as an organism with its own laws of evolution paralleled abduh's ideas
after world war i when britain and france divided up the middle east's countries apart from turkey between them pursuant to the sykes-picot agreementin violation of solemn wartime promises of postwar arab autonomythere came an immediate reaction the muslim brotherhood emerged in egypt the house of saud took over the hijaz and regimes led by army officers came to power in iran and turkey [b]oth illiberal currents of the modern middle east, writes de bellaigne islamism and militarism received a major impetus from western empire-builders. as often happens in countries undergoing social crisis the aspirations of the muslim world's translators and modernizers such as muhammad abduh largely had to yield to retrograde currents
== fidelity vs transparency ==
fidelity (or faithfulness) and transparency dual ideals in translation are often at odds a 17th-century french critic coined the phrase les belles infidles to suggest that translations like women can be either faithful or beautiful but not both
faithfulness is the extent to which a translation accurately renders the meaning of the source text without distortion
transparency is the extent to which a translation appears to a native speaker of the target language to have originally been written in that language and conforms to its grammar syntax and idiom
a translation that meets the first criterion is said to be faithful a translation that meets the second idiomatic the two qualities are not necessarily mutually exclusive
the criteria for judging the fidelity of a translation vary according to the subject type and use of the text its literary qualities its social or historical context etc
the criteria for judging the transparency of a translation appear more straightforward an unidiomatic translation sounds wrong and in the extreme case of word-for-word translations generated by many machine-translation systems often results in patent nonsense
nevertheless in certain contexts a translator may consciously seek to produce a literal translation translators of literary religious or historic texts often adhere as closely as possible to the source text stretching the limits of the target language to produce an unidiomatic text a translator may adopt expressions from the source language in order to provide local color
in recent decades prominent advocates of such non-transparent translation have included the french scholar antoine berman who identified twelve deforming tendencies inherent in most prose translations and the american theorist lawrence venuti who has called on translators to apply foreignizing rather than domesticating translation strategies berman further insists on the need for a translation project to perform translation criticism afterwards
many non-transparent-translation theories draw on concepts from german romanticism the most obvious influence being the german theologian and philosopher friedrich schleiermacher in his seminal lecture on the different methods of translation (1813) he distinguished between translation methods that move the writer toward [the reader] i.e. transparency and those that move the reader toward [the author] i.e. an extreme fidelity to the foreignness of the source text schleiermacher favored the latter approach he was motivated however not so much by a desire to embrace the foreign as by a nationalist desire to oppose france's cultural domination and to promote german literature
current western translation practice is dominated by the dual concepts of fidelity and transparency this has not always been the case however there have been periods especially in pre-classical rome and in the 18th century when many translators stepped beyond the bounds of translation proper into the realm of adaptation
adapted translation retains currency in some non-western traditions the indian epic the ramayana appears in many versions in the various indian languages and the stories are different in each similar examples are to be found in medieval christian literature which adjusted the text to local customs and mores
=== equivalence ===
the question of fidelity vs transparency has also been formulated in terms of respectively formal equivalence and dynamic [or functional] equivalence the latter expressions are associated with the translator eugene nida and were originally coined to describe ways of translating the bible but the two approaches are applicable to any translation
formal equivalence corresponds to metaphrase and dynamic equivalence to paraphrase
dynamic equivalence (or functional equivalence") conveys the essential thoughts expressed in a source text if necessary at the expense of literality original sememe and word order the source text's active vs passive voice etc
by contrast formal equivalence (sought via literal translation) attempts to render the text literally or word for word (the latter expression being itself a word-for-word rendering of the classical latin verbum pro verbo) if necessary at the expense of features natural to the target language
there is however no sharp boundary between functional and formal equivalence on the contrary they represent a spectrum of translation approaches each is used at various times and in various contexts by the same translator and at various points within the same text sometimes simultaneously competent translation entails the judicious blending of functional and formal equivalents
common pitfalls in translation especially when practiced by inexperienced translators involve false equivalents such as false friends and false cognates
=== back-translation ===
a back-translation is a translation of a translated text back into the language of the original text made without reference to the original text
comparison of a back-translation with the original text is sometimes used as a check on the accuracy of the original translation much as the accuracy of a mathematical operation is sometimes checked by reversing the operation but the results of such reverse-translation operations while useful as approximate checks are not always precisely reliable back-translation must in general be less accurate than back-calculation because linguistic symbols (words) are often ambiguous whereas mathematical symbols are intentionally unequivocal
in the context of machine translation a back-translation is also called a round-trip translation.
when translations are produced of material used in medical clinical trials such as informed-consent forms a back-translation is often required by the ethics committee or institutional review board
mark twain provided humorously telling evidence for the frequent unreliability of back-translation when he issued his own back-translation of a french translation of his short story the celebrated jumping frog of calaveras county he published his back-translation in a 1903 volume together with his english-language original the french translation and a private history of the jumping frog story the latter included a synopsized adaptation of his story that twain stated had appeared unattributed to twain in a professor sidgwicks greek prose composition (p 116) under the title the athenian and the frog the adaptation had for a time been taken for an independent ancient greek precursor to twain's jumping frog story
when a historic document survives only in translation the original having been lost researchers sometimes undertake back-translation in an effort to reconstruct the original text an example involves the novel the saragossa manuscript by the polish aristocrat jan potocki (17611815) who wrote the novel in french and anonymously published fragments in 1804 and 181314 portions of the original french-language manuscript were subsequently lost however the missing fragments survived in a polish translation that was made by edmund chojecki in 1847 from a complete french copy now lost french-language versions of the complete saragossa manuscript have since been produced based on extant french-language fragments and on french-language versions that have been back-translated from chojeckis polish version
similarly when historians suspect that a document is actually a translation from another language back-translation into that hypothetical original language can provide supporting evidence by showing that such characteristics as idioms puns peculiar grammatical structures etc. are in fact derived from the original language
for example the known text of the till eulenspiegel folk tales is in high german but contains puns that work only when back-translated to low german this seems clear evidence that these tales (or at least large portions of them) were originally written in low german and translated into high german by an over-metaphrastic translator
similarly supporters of aramaic primacyof the view that the christian new testament or its sources were originally written in the aramaic languageseek to prove their case by showing that difficult passages in the existing greek text of the new testament make much better sense when back-translated to aramaic that for example some incomprehensible references are in fact aramaic puns that do not work in greek
due to similar indications it is believed that the 2nd century gnostic gospel of judas which survives only in coptic was originally written in greek
== translators ==
competent translators show the following attributes
a very good knowledge of the language written and spoken from which they are translating (the source language)
an excellent command of the language into which they are translating (the target language)
familiarity with the subject matter of the text being translated
a profound understanding of the etymological and idiomatic correlates between the two languages and
a finely tuned sense of when to metaphrase ("translate literally") and when to paraphrase so as to assure true rather than spurious equivalents between the source- and target-language texts
a competent translator is not only bilingual but bicultural a language is not merely a collection of words and of rules of grammar and syntax for generating sentences but also a vast interconnecting system of connotations and cultural references whose mastery writes linguist mario pei comes close to being a lifetime job.
the complexity of the translator's task cannot be overstated one author suggests that becoming an accomplished translatorafter having already acquired a good basic knowledge of both languages and culturesmay require a minimum of ten years experience viewed in this light it is a serious misconception to assume that a person who has fair fluency in two languages will by virtue of that fact alone be consistently competent to translate between them
the translator's role in relation to a text has been compared to that of an artist e.g. a musician or actor who interprets a work of art translation like other arts inescapably involves choice and choice implies interpretation the english-language novelist joseph conrad whose writings zdzisaw najder has described as verging on auto-translation from conrad's polish and french linguistic personae advised his niece and polish translator aniela zagrska
[d]on't trouble to be too scrupulous i may tell you (in french) that in my opinion il vaut mieux interprter que traduire ["it is better to interpret than to translate"] il s'agit donc de trouver les quivalents et l ma chre je vous prie laissez vous guider plutt par votre temprament que par une conscience svre [it is then a question of finding the equivalent expressions and there my dear i beg you to let yourself be guided more by your temperament than by a strict conscience....]
conrad thought c.k scott moncrieff's english translation of marcel proust's la recherche du temps perdu (in search of lost timeor in scott moncrieff's rendering remembrance of things past) to be preferable to the french original
a translator may render only parts of the original text provided he indicates that this is what he is doing but a translator should not assume the role of censor and surreptitiously delete or bowdlerize passages merely to please a political or moral interest
translation has served as a school of writing for many authors translators including monks who spread buddhist texts in east asia and the early modern european translators of the bible in the course of their work have shaped the very languages into which they have translated they have acted as bridges for conveying knowledge between cultures and along with ideas they have imported from the source languages into their own languages loanwords and calques of grammatical structures idioms and vocabulary
=== interpreting ===
interpreting or interpretation, is the facilitation of oral or sign-language communication either simultaneously or consecutively between two or among three or more speakers who are not speaking or signing the same language
the term interpreting, rather than interpretation, is preferentially used for this activity by anglophone translators to avoid confusion with other meanings of the word interpretation.
unlike english many languages do not employ two separate words to denote the activities of written and live-communication (oral or sign-language) translators even english does not always make the distinction frequently using translation as a synonym for interpreting.
interpreters have sometimes played crucial roles in history a prime example is la malinche also known as malintzin malinalli and doa marina an early-16th-century nahua woman from the mexican gulf coast as a child she had been sold or given to maya slave-traders from xicalango and thus had become bilingual subsequently given along with other women to the invading spaniards she became instrumental in the spanish conquest of mexico acting as interpreter adviser intermediary and lover to hernn corts
nearly three centuries later in the united states a comparable role as interpreter was played for the lewis and clark expedition of 18046 by sacagawea as a child the lemhi shoshone woman had been kidnapped by hidatsa indians and thus had become bilingual sacagawea facilitated the expedition's traverse of the north american continent to the pacific ocean four decades later in 1846 the pacific would become the western border of the united states
=== sworn translation ===
sworn translation also called certified translation, aims at legal equivalence between two documents written in different languages it is performed by someone authorized to do so by local regulations some countries recognize declared competence others require the translator to be an official state appointee
=== telephone ===
many commercial services exist that will interpret spoken language via telephone there is also at least one custom-built mobile device that does the same thing the device connects users to human interpreters who can translate between english and 180 other languages
=== internet ===
web-based human translation is generally favored by companies and individuals that wish to secure more accurate translations in view of the frequent inaccuracy of machine translations human translation remains the most reliable most accurate form of translation available with the recent emergence of translation crowdsourcing translation-memory techniques and internet applications translation agencies have been able to provide on-demand human-translation services to businesses individuals and enterprises
while not instantaneous like its machine counterparts such as google translate and yahoo babel fish web-based human translation has been gaining popularity by providing relatively fast accurate translation for business communications legal documents medical records and software localization web-based human translation also appeals to private website users and bloggers
=== computer assist ===
computer-assisted translation (cat) also called computer-aided translation, machine-aided human translation (maht) and interactive translation, is a form of translation wherein a human translator creates a target text with the assistance of a computer program the machine supports a human translator
computer-assisted translation can include standard dictionary and grammar software the term however normally refers to a range of specialized programs available to the translator including translation-memory terminology-management concordance and alignment programs
these tools speed up and facilitate human translation but they do not provide translation that is a function of tools known broadly as machine translation
== machine translation ==
machine translation (mt) is a process whereby a computer program analyzes a source text and in principle produces a target text without human intervention in reality however machine translation typically does involve human intervention in the form of pre-editing and post-editing
with proper terminology work with preparation of the source text for machine translation (pre-editing) and with reworking of the machine translation by a human translator (post-editing) commercial machine-translation tools can produce useful results especially if the machine-translation system is integrated with a translation-memory or globalization-management system
unedited machine translation is publicly available through tools on the internet such as google translate babel fish babylon and stardict these produce rough translations that under favorable circumstances give the gist of the source text
with the internet translation software can help non-native-speaking individuals understand web pages published in other languages whole-page-translation tools are of limited utility however since they offer only a limited potential understanding of the original author's intent and context translated pages tend to be more humorous and confusing than enlightening
interactive translations with pop-up windows are becoming more popular these tools show one or more possible equivalents for each word or phrase human operators merely need to select the likeliest equivalent as the mouse glides over the foreign-language text possible equivalents can be grouped by pronunciation
also companies such as ectaco produce pocket devices that provide machine translations
relying exclusively on unedited machine translation however ignores the fact that communication in human language is context-embedded and that it takes a person to comprehend the context of the original text with a reasonable degree of probability it is certainly true that even purely human-generated translations are prone to error therefore to ensure that a machine-generated translation will be useful to a human being and that publishable-quality translation is achieved such translations must be reviewed and edited by a human
claude piron writes that machine translation at its best automates the easier part of a translator's job the harder and more time-consuming part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve ambiguities in the source text which the grammatical and lexical exigencies of the target language require to be resolved such research is a necessary prelude to the pre-editing necessary in order to provide input for machine-translation software such that the output will not be meaningless
== literary translation ==
translation of literary works (novels short stories plays poems etc.) is considered a literary pursuit in its own right for example notable in canadian literature specifically as translators are figures such as sheila fischman robert dickson and linda gaboriau and the governor general's awards annually present prizes for the best english-to-french and french-to-english literary translations
other writers among many who have made a name for themselves as literary translators include vasily zhukovsky tadeusz boy-eleski vladimir nabokov jorge luis borges robert stiller and haruki murakami
=== history ===
the first important translation in the west was that of the septuagint a collection of jewish scriptures translated into early koine greek in alexandria between the 3rd and 1st centuries bce the dispersed jews had forgotten their ancestral language and needed greek versions (translations) of their scriptures
throughout the middle ages latin was the lingua franca of the western learned world the 9th-century alfred the great king of wessex in england was far ahead of his time in commissioning vernacular anglo-saxon translations of bede's ecclesiastical history and boethius consolation of philosophy meanwhile the christian church frowned on even partial adaptations of st jerome's vulgate of ca 384 ce the standard latin bible
in asia the spread of buddhism led to large-scale ongoing translation efforts spanning well over a thousand years the tangut empire was especially efficient in such efforts exploiting the then newly invented block printing and with the full support of the government (contemporary sources describe the emperor and his mother personally contributing to the translation effort alongside sages of various nationalities) the tanguts took mere decades to translate volumes that had taken the chinese centuries to render
the arabs undertook large-scale efforts at translation having conquered the greek world they made arabic versions of its philosophical and scientific works during the middle ages translations of some of these arabic versions were made into latin chiefly at crdoba in spain king alfonso x el sabio (alphonse the wise) of castille in the 13th century promoted this effort by founding a schola traductorum (school of translation) in toledo there arabic texts hebrew texts and latin texts were translated into the other tongues by muslim jewish and christian scholars who also argued the merits of their respective religions latin translations of greek and original arab works of scholarship and science helped advance european scholasticism and thus european science and culture
the broad historic trends in western translation practice may be illustrated on the example of translation into the english language
the first fine translations into english were made in the 14th century by geoffrey chaucer who adapted from the italian of giovanni boccaccio in his own knight's tale and troilus and criseyde began a translation of the french-language roman de la rose and completed a translation of boethius from the latin chaucer founded an english poetic tradition on adaptations and translations from those earlier-established literary languages
the first great english translation was the wycliffe bible (ca 1382) which showed the weaknesses of an underdeveloped english prose only at the end of the 15th century did the great age of english prose translation begin with thomas malory's le morte darthuran adaptation of arthurian romances so free that it can in fact hardly be called a true translation the first great tudor translations are accordingly the tyndale new testament (1525) which influenced the authorized version (1611) and lord berners version of jean froissart's chronicles (152325)
meanwhile in renaissance italy a new period in the history of translation had opened in florence with the arrival at the court of cosimo de medici of the byzantine scholar georgius gemistus pletho shortly before the fall of constantinople to the turks (1453) a latin translation of plato's works was undertaken by marsilio ficino this and erasmus latin edition of the new testament led to a new attitude to translation for the first time readers demanded rigor of rendering as philosophical and religious beliefs depended on the exact words of plato aristotle and jesus
non-scholarly literature however continued to rely on adaptation france's pliade england's tudor poets and the elizabethan translators adapted themes by horace ovid petrarch and modern latin writers forming a new poetic style on those models the english poets and translators sought to supply a new public created by the rise of a middle class and the development of printing with works such as the original authors would have written had they been writing in england in that day
the elizabethan period of translation saw considerable progress beyond mere paraphrase toward an ideal of stylistic equivalence but even to the end of this period which actually reached to the middle of the 17th century there was no concern for verbal accuracy
in the second half of the 17th century the poet john dryden sought to make virgil speak in words such as he would probably have written if he were living and an englishman dryden however discerned no need to emulate the roman poet's subtlety and concision similarly homer suffered from alexander pope's endeavor to reduce the greek poet's wild paradise to order
throughout the 18th century the watchword of translators was ease of reading whatever they did not understand in a text or thought might bore readers they omitted they cheerfully assumed that their own style of expression was the best and that texts should be made to conform to it in translation for scholarship they cared no more than had their predecessors and they did not shrink from making translations from translations in third languages or from languages that they hardly knew oras in the case of james macpherson's translations of ossianfrom texts that were actually of the translator's own composition
the 19th century brought new standards of accuracy and style in regard to accuracy observes j.m cohen the policy became the text the whole text and nothing but the text except for any bawdy passages and the addition of copious explanatory footnotes in regard to style the victorians aim achieved through far-reaching metaphrase (literality) or pseudo-metaphrase was to constantly remind readers that they were reading a foreign classic an exception was the outstanding translation in this period edward fitzgerald's rubaiyat of omar khayyam (1859) which achieved its oriental flavor largely by using persian names and discreet biblical echoes and actually drew little of its material from the persian original
in advance of the 20th century a new pattern was set in 1871 by benjamin jowett who translated plato into simple straightforward language jowett's example was not followed however until well into the new century when accuracy rather than style became the principal criterion
=== modern translation ===
as a languages evolves texts in an earlier version of the languageoriginal texts or old translationsmay become difficult for modern readers to understand such a text may therefore be translated into more modern language producing a modern translation (e.g. a modern english translation or modernized translation")
such modern rendering is applied either to literature from classical languages such as latin or greek notably to the bible (see modern english bible translations") or to literature from an earlier stage of the same language as with the works of william shakespeare (which are largely understandable by a modern audience though with some difficulty) or with geoffrey chaucer's canterbury tales (which is not generally understandable by modern readers)
modern translation is applicable to any language with a long literary history for example in japanese the 11th-century tale of genji is generally read in modern translation (see genji modern readership")
modern translation often involves literary scholarship and textual revision as there is frequently not one single canonical text this is particularly noteworthy in the case of the bible and shakespeare where modern scholarship can result in substantive textual changes
modern translation meets with opposition from some traditionalists in english some readers prefer the authorized king james version of the bible to modern translations and shakespeare in the original of ca 1600 to modern translations
an opposite process involves translating modern literature into classical languages for the purpose of extensive reading (for examples see list of latin translations of modern literature")
=== poetry ===
poetry presents special challenges to translators given the importance of a text's formal aspects in addition to its content in his influential 1959 paper on linguistic aspects of translation the russian-born linguist and semiotician roman jakobson went so far as to declare that poetry by definition [is] untranslatable robert frost was equally pessimistic poetry is that which is lost in translations.
in 1974 the american poet james merrill wrote a poem lost in translation which in part explores this idea the question was also discussed in douglas hofstadter's 1997 book le ton beau de marot he argues that a good translation of a poem must convey as much as possible of not only its literal meaning but also its form and structure (meter rhyme or alliteration scheme etc.)
=== sung texts ===
translation of a text that is sung in vocal music for the purpose of singing in another languagesometimes called singing translation"is closely linked to translation of poetry because most vocal music at least in the western tradition is set to verse especially verse in regular patterns with rhyme (since the late 19th century musical setting of prose and free verse has also been practiced in some art music though popular music tends to remain conservative in its retention of stanzaic forms with or without refrains.) a rudimentary example of translating poetry for singing is church hymns such as the german chorales translated into english by catherine winkworth
translation of sung texts is generally much more restrictive than translation of poetry because in the former there is little or no freedom to choose between a versified translation and a translation that dispenses with verse structure one might modify or omit rhyme in a singing translation but the assignment of syllables to specific notes in the original musical setting places great challenges on the translator there is the option in prose sung texts less so in verse of adding or deleting a syllable here and there by subdividing or combining notes respectively but even with prose the process is almost like strict verse translation because of the need to stick as closely as possible to the original prosody of the sung melodic line
other considerations in writing a singing translation include repetition of words and phrases the placement of rests and/or punctuation the quality of vowels sung on high notes and rhythmic features of the vocal line that may be more natural to the original language than to the target language a sung translation may be considerably or completely different from the original thus resulting in a contrafactum
translations of sung textswhether of the above type meant to be sung or of a more or less literal type meant to be readare also used as aids to audiences singers and conductors when a work is being sung in a language not known to them the most familiar types are translations presented as subtitles or surtitles projected during opera performances those inserted into concert programs and those that accompany commercial audio cds of vocal music in addition professional and amateur singers often sing works in languages they do not know (or do not know well) and translations are then used to enable them to understand the meaning of the words they are singing
=== religious texts ===
an important role in history has been played by translation of religious texts such translations may be influenced by tension between the text and the religious values the translators wish to convey for example buddhist monks who translated the indian sutras into chinese occasionally adjusted their translations to better reflect china's distinct culture emphasizing notions such as filial piety
one of the first recorded instances of translation in the west was the rendering of the old testament into greek in the 3rd century bce the translation is known as the septuagint a name that refers to the seventy translators (seventy-two in some versions) who were commissioned to translate the bible at alexandria egypt each translator worked in solitary confinement in his own cell and according to legend all seventy versions proved identical the septuagint became the source text for later translations into many languages including latin coptic armenian and georgian
still considered one of the greatest translators in history for having rendered the bible into latin is jerome of stridon the patron saint of translation for centuries the roman catholic church used his translation (known as the vulgate) though even this translation at first stirred controversy
the period preceding and contemporary with the protestant reformation saw the translation of the bible into local european languagesa development that contributed to western christianity's split into roman catholicism and protestantism due to disparities between catholic and protestant versions of crucial words and passages (although the protestant movement was largely based on other things such as a perceived need for reformation of the roman catholic church to eliminate corruption) lasting effects on the religions cultures and languages of their respective countries have been exerted by such bible translations as martin luther's into german jakub wujek's into polish and the king james bible's translators into english debate and religious schism over different translations of religious texts remain to this day as demonstrated by for example the king james only movement
a famous mistranslation of the bible is the rendering of the hebrew word (keren) which has several meanings as horn in a context where it also means beam of light as a result for centuries artists have depicted moses the lawgiver with horns growing out of his forehead an example is michelangelo's famous sculpture
