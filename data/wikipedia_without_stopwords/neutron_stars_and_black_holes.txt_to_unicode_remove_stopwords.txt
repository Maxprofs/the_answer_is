scientific workedit
oppenheimer important research theoretical astronomy especially related general relativity nuclear theory nuclear physics spectroscopy quantum field theory including extension quantum electrodynamics formal mathematics relativistic quantum mechanics also attracted attention although doubted validity work predicted many later finds include neutron meson neutron star
