given material substance standard state reference state materials thermodynamic state properties enthalpy entropy gibbs free energy many material standards standard enthalpy change formation element standard state zero convention allows wide range thermodynamic quantities calculated tabulated standard state substance exist nature example possible calculate values steam k pa although steam exist gas conditions advantage practice tables thermodynamic properties prepared way selfconsistent
conventional standard states
many standard states nonphysical states often referred hypothetical states nevertheless thermodynamic properties welldefined usually extrapolation limiting condition zero pressure zero concentration specified condition usually unit concentration pressure using ideal extrapolating function ideal solution ideal gas behavior empirical measurements
gases
standard state gas hypothetical state would pure substance obeying ideal gas equation standard pressure pa bar real gas perfectly ideal behaviour definition standard state allows corrections nonideality made consistently different gases
liquids solids
standard state liquids solids simply state pure substance subjected total pressure pa elements reference point hfo defined stable allotrope element graphite case carbon phase white tin case tin exception white phosphorus common allotrope phosphorus defined standard state despite fact metastable
solutes
substance solution solute standard state hypothetical state would standard state molality amount concentration exhibiting infinitedilution behavior reason unusual definition behavior solute limit infinite dilution described equations similar equations ideal gases hence taking infinitedilution behavior standard state allows corrections nonideality made consistently different solutes standard state molality molkg standard state amount concentration moldm
