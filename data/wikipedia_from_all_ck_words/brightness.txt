brightness is an attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to be radiating or reflecting light in other words brightness is the perception elicited by the luminance of a visual target this is a subjective attribute/property of an object being observed and one of the color appearance parameters of color appearance models brightness refers to an absolute term and should not be confused with lightness
== terminology ==
the adjective bright derives from an old english beorht with the same meaning via metathesis giving middle english briht the word is from a common germanic *berhtaz ultimately from a pie root with a closely related meaning *bhereg- white bright brightness was formerly used as a synonym for the photometric term luminance and (incorrectly) for the radiometric term radiance as defined by the us federal glossary of telecommunication terms (fs-1037c) brightness should now be used only for non-quantitative references to physiological sensations and perceptions of light
a given target luminance can elicit different perceptions of brightness in different contexts see for example white's illusion
in the rgb color space brightness can be thought of as the arithmetic mean of the red green and blue color coordinates (although some of the three components make the light seem brighter than others which again may be compensated by some display systems automatically)
brightness is also a color coordinate in the hsb or hsv color space (hue saturation and brightness or value)
with regard to stars brightness is quantified as apparent magnitude and absolute magnitude
brightness is at least in some respects the antonym of darkness
== brightness of sounds ==
the term brightness is also used in discussions of sound timbres in a rough analogy with visual brightness timbre researchers consider brightness to be one of the perceptually strongest distinctions between sounds and formalize it acoustically as an indication of the amount of high-frequency content in a sound using a measure such as the spectral centroid
