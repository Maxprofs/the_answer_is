exergonic process one positive flow energy system surroundings contrast endergonic process constant pressure constant temperature reactions exergonic gibbs free energy change negative g exergonic prefix exo derived greek word ex outside suffix ergonic derived greek word ergon work means releasing energy form work thermodynamics work defined energy moving system internal region surroundings external region given process
physical chemical systems universe follow second law thermodynamics proceed downhill ie exergonic direction thus left physical chemical system proceed according second law thermodynamics direction tends lower free energy system thus expend energy form work reactions occur spontaneously
chemical reaction also exergonic spontaneous thus type reactions gibbs free energy decreases entropy included change gibbs free energy differs exothermic reaction endothermic reaction entropy included gibbs free energy calculated gibbshelmholtz equation
