a prototype is an early sample model or release of a product built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from it is a term used in a variety of contexts including semantics design electronics and software programming a prototype is designed to test and try a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real working system rather than a theoretical one in some workflow models creating a prototype (a process sometimes called materialization) is the step between the formalization and the evaluation of an idea
the word prototype derives from the greek prototypon primitive form neutral of prototypos original primitive from protos first and typos impression
== basic prototype categories ==
prototypes explore different aspects of an intended design
a proof-of-principle prototype explores some functional but not all aspects of the intended design
a form study prototype explores the size and appearance but not the functionality of the intended design
a user experience prototype captures enough aspects of the intended design that it can support user research
a visual prototype captures the size and appearance but not the functionality of the intended design
a functional prototype captures both function and appearance of the intended design it may be created in with a different method and scale from final design
== differences between a prototype and a production design ==
in general prototypes will differ from the final production variant in three fundamental ways
materials - production materials may require manufacturing processes involving higher capital costs than what is practical for prototyping instead engineers or prototyping specialists will attempt to substitute materials with properties that simulate the intended final material
processes - often expensive and time consuming unique tooling is required to fabricate a custom design prototypes will often compromise by using more variable processes repeatable or controlled methods substandard inefficient or substandard technology sources or insufficient testing for technology maturity
lower fidelity - final production designs often require extensive effort to capture high volume manufacturing detail such detail is generally unwarranted for prototypes as some refinement to the design is to be expected often prototypes are built using very limited engineering detail as compared to final production intent which often uses statistical process controls and rigorous testing an example of a lower fidelity or lo-fi prototyping technique is a paper prototype these can be used as a tool for discussion they are commonly used for early testing of a software design and can be part of a software walkthrough to confirm design decisions before more costly levels of effort are expended
== characteristics and limitations of prototypes ==
engineers and prototyping specialists seek to understand the limitations of prototypes to exactly simulate the characteristics of their intended design
it is important to realize that by their very definition prototypes will represent some compromise from the final production design due to differences in materials processes and design fidelity it is possible that a prototype may fail to perform acceptably whereas the production design may have been sound a counter-intuitive idea is that prototypes may actually perform acceptably whereas the production design may be flawed since prototyping materials and processes may occasionally outperform their production counterparts
in general it can be expected that individual prototype costs will be substantially greater than the final production costs due to inefficiencies in materials and processes prototypes are also used to revise the design for the purposes of reducing costs through optimization and refinement
it is possible to use prototype testing to reduce the risk that a design may not perform as intended however prototypes generally cannot eliminate all risk there are pragmatic and practical limitations to the ability of a prototype to match the intended final performance of the product and some allowances and engineering judgement are often required before moving forward with a production design
building the full design is often expensive and can be time-consuming especially when repeated several timesbuilding the full design figuring out what the problems are and how to solve them then building another full design as an alternative rapid prototyping or rapid application development techniques are used for the initial prototypes which implement part but not all of the complete design this allows designers and manufacturers to rapidly and inexpensively test the parts of the design that are most likely to have problems solve those problems and then build the full design
this counter-intuitive idea that the quickest way to build something is first to build something else is shared by scaffolding and the telescope rule
== engineering sciences ==
in technology research a technology demonstrator is a prototype serving as proof-of-concept and demonstration model for a new technology or future product proving its viability and illustrating conceivable applications
in large development projects a testbed is a platform and prototype development environment for rigorous experimentation and testing of new technologies components scientific theories and computational tools
with recent advances in computer modeling it is becoming practical to eliminate the creation of a physical prototype (except possibly at greatly reduced scales for promotional purposes) instead modeling all aspects of the final product as a computer model an example of such a development can be seen in boeing 787 dreamliner in which the first full sized physical realization is made on the series production line computer modeling is now being extensively used in automotive design both for form (in the styling and aerodynamics of the vehicle) and in function especially for improving vehicle crashworthiness and in weight reduction to improve mileage
=== mechanical and electrical engineering ===
the most common use of the word prototype is a functional although experimental version of a non-military machine (e.g. automobiles domestic appliances consumer electronics) whose designers would like to have built by mass production means as opposed to a mockup which is an inert representation of a machine's appearance often made of some non-durable substance
an electronics designer often builds the first prototype from breadboard or stripboard or perfboard typically using dip packages
however more and more often the first functional prototype is built on a prototype pcb almost identical to the production pcb as pcb manufacturing prices fall and as many components are not available in dip packages but only available in smt packages optimized for placing on a pcb
builders of military machines and aviation prefer the terms experimental and service test
=== electronics prototyping ===
in electronics prototyping means building an actual circuit to a theoretical design to verify that it works and to provide a physical platform for debugging it if it does not the prototype is often constructed using techniques such as wire wrapping or using veroboard or breadboard with the result being a circuit that is electrically identical to the design but not physically identical to the final product
open-source tools like fritzing exist to document electronic prototypes (especially the breadboard-based ones) and move toward physical production prototyping platforms such as arduino also simplify the task of programming and interacting with a microcontroller the developer can choose to deploy their invention as-is using the prototyping platform or replace it with only the microcontroller chip and the circuitry that is relevant to their product
a technician can quickly build a prototype (and make additions and modifications) using these techniques but for volume production it is much faster and usually cheaper to mass-produce custom printed circuit boards than to produce these other kinds of prototype boards the proliferation of quick-turn pcb fabrication and assembly companies has enabled the concepts of rapid prototyping to be applied to electronic circuit design it is now possible even with the smallest passive components and largest fine-pitch packages to have boards fabricated assembled and even tested in a matter of days
== computer programming/computer science ==
in many programming languages a function prototype is the declaration of a subroutine or function (and should not be confused with software prototyping) this term is rather c/c++-specific other terms for this notion are signature type and interface in prototype-based programming (a form of object-oriented programming) new objects are produced by cloning existing objects which are called prototypes
the term may also refer to the prototype javascript framework
additionally the term may refer to the prototype design pattern
prototype software is often referred to as alpha grade meaning it is the first version to run often only a few functions are implemented the primary focus of the alpha is to have a functional base code on to which features may be added once alpha grade software has most of the required features integrated into it it becomes beta software for testing of the entire software and to adjust the program to respond correctly during situations unforeseen during development
often the end users may not be able to provide a complete set of application objectives detailed input processing or output requirements in the initial stage after the user evaluation another prototype will be built based on feedback from users and again the cycle returns to customer evaluation the cycle starts by listening to the user followed by building or revising a mock-up and letting the user test the mock-up then back there is now a new generation of tools called application simulation software which help quickly simulate application before their development
extreme programming uses iterative design to gradually add one feature at a time to the initial prototype
continuous learning approaches within organizations or businesses may also use the concept of business or process prototypes through software models
=== data prototyping ===
a data prototype is a form of functional or working prototype the justification for its creation is usually a data migration data integration or application implementation project and the raw materials used as input are an instance of all the relevant data which exists at the start of the project
the objectives of data prototyping are to produce
a set of data cleansing and transformation rules which have been seen to produce data which is all fit for purpose
a dataset which is the result of those rules being applied to an instance of the relevant raw (source) data
to achieve this a data architect uses a graphical interface to interactively develop and execute transformation and cleansing rules using raw data the resultant data is then evaluated and the rules refined beyond the obvious visual checking of the data on-screen by the data architect the usual evaluation and validation approaches are to use data profiling software and then to insert the resultant data into a test version of the target application and trial its use
== scale modeling ==
in the field of scale modeling (which includes model railroading vehicle modeling airplane modeling military modeling etc.) a prototype is the real-world basis or source for a scale modelsuch as the real emd gp38-2 locomotivewhich is the prototype of athearn's (among other manufacturers) locomotive model technically any non-living object can serve as a prototype for a model including structures equipment and appliances and so on but generally prototypes have come to mean full-size real-world vehicles including automobiles (the prototype 1957 chevy has spawned many models) military equipment (such as m4 shermans a favorite among us military modelers) railroad equipment motor trucks motorcycles and space-ships (real-world such as apollo/saturn vs or the iss) as of 2014 basic rapid prototype machines (such as 3d printers) cost about $2,000 but larger and more precise machines can cost as much as $500,000
== metrology ==
in the science and practice of metrology a prototype is a human-made object that is used as the standard of measurement of some physical quantity to base all measurement of that physical quantity against sometimes this standard object is called an artifact in the international system of units (si) the only prototype remaining in current use is the international prototype kilogram a solid platinum-iridium cylinder kept at the bureau international des poids et mesures (international bureau of weights and measures) in svres france (a suburb of paris) that by definition is the mass of exactly one kilogram copies of this prototype are fashioned and issued to many nations to represent the national standard of the kilogram and are periodically compared to the paris prototype
until 1960 the meter was defined by a platinum-iridium prototype bar with two scratch marks on it (that were by definition spaced apart by one meter) the international prototype metre and in 1983 the meter was redefined to be the distance in free space covered by light in 1/299,792,458 of a second (thus defining the speed of light to be 299,792,458 meters per second)
it is widely believed that the kilogram prototype standard will be replaced there are two likely replacements one is a definition of the kilogram that will define another physical constant (likely either planck's constant or the elementary charge) to a defined numerical value thus obviating the need for the prototype and removing the possibility of the prototype (and thus the standard and definition of the kilogram) changing very slightly over the years because of loss or gain of atoms the other definition is using a system that finds the amount of force needed to counteract the pull of earth's gravity on a one kilogram artifact
== natural sciences ==
in many sciences from pathology to taxonomy prototype refers to a disease species etc which sets a good example for the whole category in biology prototype is the ancestral or primitive form of a species or other group an archetype for example the senegal bichir is regarded as the prototypes of its genus polypterus
