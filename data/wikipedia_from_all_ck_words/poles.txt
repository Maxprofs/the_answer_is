== origins ==
the slavic people have been in the territory of modern poland for over 1500 years they organized into tribal units of which the larger ones were later known as the polish tribes the names of many tribes are found on the list compiled by the anonymous bavarian geographer in the 9th century in the 9th and 10th centuries the tribes gave rise to developed regions along the upper vistula (the vistulans within the great moravian empire sphere) the baltic sea coast and in greater poland the last tribal undertaking resulted in the 10th century in a lasting political structure and state poland one of the west slavic nations
the concept which has become known as the piast idea the chief propopent of which was jan ludwik popawski is based on the statement that the piast homeland was inhabited by so-called native aboriginal slavs and slavonic poles since time immemorial and only later was infiltrated by alien celts germans and others after 1945 the so-called autochthonous or aboriginal school of polish prehistory received official backing in poland and a considerable degree of popular support according to this view the lusatian culture which archaeologists have identified between the oder and the vistula in the early iron age is said to be slavonic all non-slavonic tribes and peoples recorded in the area at various points in ancient times are dismissed as migrants and visitors in contrast the critics of this theory such as marija gimbutas regard it as an unproved hypotheses and for them the date and origin of the westward migration of the slavs is largely uncharted the slavonic connections of the lusatian culture are entirely imaginary and the presence of an ethnically mixed and constantly changing collection of peoples on the north european plain is taken for granted

== culture ==
the culture of poland has a history of 1000 years poland located in central europe developed a character that was influenced by its geography at the confluence of fellow central european cultures (german western ukrainian czech and austrian) western european cultures (french and dutch) southern european cultures (italian and greek) northern european cultures (lithuanian swedish and danish) and eastern european cultures (east ukrainian and russian) influences were conveyed by immigrants (jewish german and dutch) political alliances (with lithuania hungary saxony france and sweden) conquests of the polish state (ukraine belarus and latvia) and conquerors of the polish lands (the russian empire kingdom of prussia and the habsburg monarchy later to be known as the austrian empire or austria-hungary)
over time polish culture has been greatly influenced by its ties with the germanic latinate and other ethnic groups and minorities living in poland the people of poland have traditionally been seen as hospitable to artists from abroad (especially italy) and open to cultural and artistic trends popular in other european countries owing to this central location the poles came very early into contact with both civilizations eastern and western and as a result developed economically culturally and politically a german general helmut carl von moltke in his poland a historical sketch (1885) stated that poland of the fifteenth century was one of the most civilised states of europe.
in the 19th and 20th centuries the polish focus on cultural advancement often took precedence over political and economic activity experiencing severe crisis especially during world war ii and in the following years these factors have contributed to the versatile nature of polish art with all its complex nuances
=== language ===
the polish language (polish jzyk polski) is a west slavic language and the official language of poland its written form uses the polish alphabet which is the latin alphabet with the addition of a few diacritic marks
poland is the most linguistically homogeneous european country nearly 97% of poland's citizens declare polish as their mother tongue elsewhere ethnic poles constitute large minorities in lithuania belarus and ukraine polish is the most widely used minority language in lithuania's vilnius county (26% of the population according to the 2001 census results) and is found elsewhere in southeastern lithuania in ukraine it is most common in the western lviv and volyn oblast (provinces) while in western belarus it is used by the significant polish minority especially in the brest and grodno regions and in areas along the lithuanian border
the geographical distribution of the polish language was greatly affected by the border changes and population transfers that followed world war ii poles settled in the recovered territories in the west and north which had previously been mostly german-speaking some poles remained in the previously polish-ruled territories in the east that were annexed by the ussr resulting in the present-day polish-speaking minorities in lithuania belarus and ukraine although many poles were expelled or emigrated from those areas to areas within poland's new borders meanwhile the flight and expulsion of germans as well as the expulsion of ukrainians and resettlement of ukrainians within poland contributed to the country's linguistic homogeneity
polish-speakers use the language in a uniform manner throughout most of poland though numerous languages and dialects coexist alongside the standard polish language the most common dialects in poland are silesian spoken in upper silesia and kashubian widely spoken in the north

=== music ===
the origin of polish music can be traced as far back as the 13th century from which manuscripts have been found in stary scz containing polyphonic compositions related to the parisian notre dame school other early compositions such as the melody of bogurodzica may also date back to this period the first known notable composer however mikoaj z radomia lived in the 15th century
during the 16th century mostly two musical groupsboth based in krakw and belonging to the king and archbishop of wawelled the rapid innovation of polish music composers writing during this period include wacaw z szamotu mikoaj zieleski and mikoaj gomka diomedes cato a native-born italian who lived in krakw from about the age of five became one of the most famous lutenists at the court of sigismund iii and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern europe but blended them with native folk music
==== 17th and 18th centuries ====
in the last years of the 16th century and the first part of the 17th century a number of italian musicians were guests at the royal courts of king sigismund iii vasa and his son wadysaw iv these included luca marenzio giovanni francesco anerio and marco scacchi polish composers from this period focused on baroque religious music concertos for voices instruments and basso continuo a tradition that continued into the 18th century the best-remembered composer of this period is adam jarzbski known for his instrumental works such as chromatica tamburetta sentinella bentrovata and nova casa other composers include grzegorz gerwazy gorczycki franciszek lilius bartomiej pkiel stanisaw sylwester szarzyski and marcin mielczewski
in addition a tradition of operatic production began in warsaw in 1628 with a performance of galatea (composer uncertain) the first italian opera produced outside italy shortly after this performance the court produced francesca caccini's opera la liberazione di ruggiero dall'isola dalcina which she had written for prince wadysaw three years earlier when he was in italy another first this is the earliest surviving opera written by a woman when wadysaw became king (as wadysaw iv) he oversaw the production of at least ten operas during the late 1630s and 1640s making warsaw a center of the art the composers of these operas are not known they may have been poles working under marco scacchi in the royal chapel or they may have been among the italians imported by wadysaw
the late 17th and 18th century saw a decline of poland which also hindered the development of music some composers attempted to create a polish opera (such as jan stefani and maciej kamieski) others imitated foreign composers such as haydn and mozart
the most important development in this time however was the polonaise perhaps the first distinctively polish art music polonaises for piano were and remain popular such as those by micha kleofas ogiski karol kurpiski juliusz zarbski henryk wieniawski mieczysaw karowicz jzef elsner and most famously fryderyk chopin chopin remains very well known and is regarded for composing a wide variety of works including mazurkas nocturnes waltzes and concertos and using traditional polish elements in his pieces the same period saw stanisaw moniuszko the leading individual in the successful development of polish opera still renowned for operas like halka and the haunted manor
==== traditional music ====
polish folk music was collected in the 19th century by oskar kolberg as part of a wave of polish national revival with the coming of the world wars and then the communist state folk traditions were oppressed or subsumed into state-approved folk ensembles the most famous of the state ensembles are mazowsze and lsk both of which still perform though these bands had a regional touch to their output the overall sound was a homogenized mixture of polish styles there were more authentic state-supported groups such as sowianki but the communist sanitized image of folk music made the whole field seem unhip to young audiences and many traditions dwindled rapidly
polish dance music especially the mazurka and polonaise were popularized by frdric chopin and they soon spread across europe and elsewhere these are triple time dances while five-beat forms are more common in the northeast and duple-time dances like the krakowiak come from the south the polonaise comes from the french word for polish to identify its origin among the polish aristocracy and nobility who had adapted the dance from a slower walking dance called chodzony the polonaise then re-entered the lower-class musical life and became an integral part of polish music
=== literature ===
polish literature is the literary tradition of poland most polish literature has been written in the polish language though other languages used in poland over the centuries have also contributed to polish literary traditions including latin yiddish lithuanian ukrainian belarusian german and esperanto
==== middle ages ====
almost nothing remains of polish literature prior to the country's christianization in 966 poland's pagan inhabitants certainly possessed an oral literature extending to slavic songs legends and beliefs but early christian writers did not deem it worthy of mention in the obligatory latin and so it has perished
the first recorded sentence in the polish language reads day ut ia pobrusa a ti poziwai ("let me grind and you take a rest") a paraphrase of the latin sine ut ego etiam molam. the work in which this phrase appeared reflects the culture of early poland the sentence was written within the latin language chronicle liber fundationis from between 1269 and 1273 a history of the cistercian monastery in henrykw silesia it was recorded by an abbot known simply as piotr (peter) referring to an event almost a hundred years earlier the sentence was supposedly uttered by a bohemian settler bogwal ("bogwalus boemus") a subject of bolesaw the tall expressing compassion for his own wife who very often stood grinding by the quern-stone. most notable early medieval polish works in latin and the old polish language include the oldest extant manuscript of fine prose in the polish language entitled the holy cross sermons as well as the earliest polish-language bible of queen zofia and the chronicle of janko of czarnkw from the 14th century not to mention the puawy psalter
in the early 1470s one of the first printing houses in poland was set up by kasper straube in krakw (see spread of the printing press) in 1475 kasper elyan of glogau (gogw) set up a printing shop in breslau (wrocaw) silesia twenty years later the first cyrillic printing house was founded at krakw by schweipolt fiol for eastern orthodox church hierarchs the most notable texts produced in that period include saint florian's breviary printed partially in polish in the late 14th century statua synodalia wratislaviensia (1475) a printed collection of polish and latin prayers as well as jan dugosz's chronicle from the 15th century and his catalogus archiepiscoporum gnesnensium
==== renaissance ====
with the advent of the renaissance the polish language was finally accepted on an equal footing with latin polish culture and art flourished under jagiellonian rule and many foreign poets and writers settled in poland bringing with them new literary trends such writers included kallimach (filippo buonaccorsi) and conrad celtis many polish writers studied abroad and at the krakw academy which became a melting pot for new ideas and currents in 1488 the world's first writers club called sodalitas litterarum vistulana was founded in krakw notable members included conrad celtes albert brudzewski filip callimachus and laurentius corvinus
==== baroque ====
the literature in the period of polish baroque (between 1620 and 1764) was significantly influenced by the great popularization of jesuit high schools which offered education based on latin classics as part of a preparation for a political career the studies of poetry required the practical knowledge of writing both latin and polish poems which radically increased the number of poets and versifiers countrywide on the soil of humanistic education some exceptional writers grew as well piotr kochanowski (15661620) gave his translation of torquato tasso's jerusalem delivered maciej kazimierz sarbiewski a poet laureate became known among european nations as horatius christianus (christian horace) for his latin writings jan andrzej morsztyn (16211693) an epicurean courtier and diplomat extolled in his sophisticated poems the value of earthly delights and wacaw potocki (16211696) the most productive writer of the polish baroque unified the typical opinions of polish szlachta with some deeper reflections and existential experiences notable polish writers and poets active in this period include
==== enlightenment ====
the period of polish enlightenment began in the 1730s40s and peaked in the second half of the 18th century during the reign of poland's last king stanisaw august poniatowski it went into sharp decline with the third and final partition of poland (1795) followed by political cultural and economic destruction of the country and leading to the great emigration of polish elites the enlightenment ended around 1822 and was replaced by polish romanticism at home and abroad
one of the leading polish enlightenment poets was ignacy krasicki (17351801) known locally as the prince of poets and poland's la fontaine author of the first polish novel called the adventures of mr nicholas wisdom (mikoaja dowiadczyskiego przypadki) he was also a playwright journalist encyclopedist and translator from french and greek another prominent writer of the period was jan potocki (17611815) a polish nobleman egyptologist linguist and adventurer whose travel memoirs made him legendary in his homeland outside poland he is known chiefly for his novel the manuscript found in saragossa which has drawn comparisons to such celebrated works as the decameron and the arabian nights
==== romanticism ====
due to partitions carried out by the neighboring empires which ended the existence of the sovereign polish state in 1795 polish romanticism unlike romanticism elsewhere in europe was largely a movement for independence against the foreign occupation and expressed the ideals and the traditional way of life of the polish people the period of romanticism in poland ended with the tsarist suppression of the january 1863 uprising marked by public executions by the russians and deportations to siberia
the literature of polish romanticism falls into two distinct periods both defined by insurgencies the first around 18201830 ending with the november uprising of 1830 and the second between 18301864 giving birth to polish positivism in the first period polish romantics were heavily influenced by other european romantics - their art featured emotionalism and imagination folklore country life as well as the propagation of the ideals of independence the most famous writers of the period were adam mickiewicz seweryn goszczyski tomasz zan and maurycy mochnacki in the second period (after the january uprising) many polish romantics worked abroad often banished from the polish soil by the occupying power their work became dominated by the ideals of freedom and the struggle for regaining their country's lost sovereignty elements of mysticism became more prominent also in that period the idea of the poeta-wieszcz (nation's bard) developed the wieszcz functioned as spiritual leader to the suppressed people the most notable poet among the leading bards of romanticism so recognized in both periods was adam mickiewicz other two national poets were juliusz sowacki and zygmunt krasiski polish writers and poets of the romantic period include
==== positivism ====
in the aftermath of the failed january uprising against the russian occupation the new period of polish positivism began to advocate skepticism and the exercise of reason questions addressed by the positivist writers revolved around the so-called organic work, which included the establishment of equal rights for all members of society the assimilation of poland's jewish minority and the defense of the polish population in the german-ruled part of poland against kulturkampf and their violent displacement the writers were poised to educate the public about constructive patriotism which would enable polish society to function as a fully integrated social organism regardless of external circumstances the period lasted until the turn of the 20th century and the advent of the young poland movement
==== young poland (1890-1918) ====
the modernist period known as the young poland movement in visual arts literature and music came into being around 1890 and concluded with the poland's return to independence (1918) the period was based on two concepts its early stage was characterized by a strong aesthetic opposition to the ideals of its own predecessor (promoting organic work in the face of foreign occupation) artists following this early philosophy of young poland believed in decadence symbolism conflict between human values and civilization and the existence of art for art's sake prominent authors who followed this trend included kazimierz przerwa-tetmajer stanisaw przybyszewski and jan kasprowicz
==== interbellum and the return to independence (1918-1939) ====
literature of the second polish republic (1918-1939) encompasses a short though exceptionally dynamic period in polish literary consciousness the socio-political reality has changed radically with poland's return to independence in large part derivative of these changes was the collective and unobstructed development of programs for artists and writers new avant-garde trends had emerged the period spanning just twenty years was full of notable individualities who saw themselves as exponents of changing european civilization including tuwim witkacy gombrowicz miosz dbrowska and nakowska (pal)
==== 1945 to 1956 ====
much of polish literature written during the occupation of poland appeared in print only after the conclusion of world war ii including books by nakowska rudnicki borowski and others the soviet takeover of the country did not discourage migrs and exiles from returning especially before the advent of stalinism indeed many writers attempted to recreate the polish literary scene often with a touch of nostalgia for the prewar reality including jerzy andrzejewski author of ashes and diamonds describing the political and moral dilemmas associated with the anti-communist resistance in poland his novel was adapted into film a decade later by wajda the new emerging prose writers such as stanisaw dygat and stefan kisielewski approached the catastrophe of war from their own perspective kazimierz wyka coined a term borderline novel for documentary fiction
