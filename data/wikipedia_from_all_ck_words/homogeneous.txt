homogeneity and heterogeneity are concepts often used in the sciences and statistics relating to the uniformity in a substance or organism a material or image that is homogeneous is uniform in composition or character (i.e color shape size weight height distribution texture language income disease temperature radioactivity architectural design etc.) one that is heterogeneous is distinctly nonuniform in one of these qualities
the words homogeneous and heterogeneous come from medieval latin homogeneus and heterogeneus from ancient greek (homogens) and (heterogens) from (homos same) and (heteros other another different) respectively followed by (genos kind) -ous is an adjectival suffix
the concepts are the same to every level of complexity from atoms to populations of animals or people and galaxies hence an element may be homogeneous on a larger scale compared to being heterogeneous on a smaller scale this is known as an effective medium approach or effective medium approximations
== heterogeneity ==
heterogeneity is the state of being heterogeneous it is the nature of opposition or contrariety of qualities it is diverse in kind or nature composed of diverse parts or resulting from differing causes in general a heterogeneous entity is composed of dissimilar parts hence the constituents are of a different kind that can be distinguished from one another the parts (or constituents) are connected and of a conglomerate mass and viewed in respect to the parts of which it is made up
various disciplines understand heterogeneity or being heterogeneous in different ways for example
in physics it is understood as having physical properties that vary within the medium for more information please refer to article homogeneity (physics)
in chemistry a heterogeneous material consists of either or both of a) multiple states of matter or b) hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances in one mixture an example of the latter would be a mixture of water octane and silicone grease heterogeneous solids liquids and gases may be made homogeneous by melting stirring or by allowing time to pass for diffusion to distribute the molecules evenly for example adding dye to water will create a heterogeneous solution at first but will become homogeneous over time entropy allows for heterogeneous substances to become homogeneous over time
with information technology (see heterogeneous computing) it means a network comprising different types of computers potentially with vastly differing memory sizes processing power and even basic underlying architecture alternatively a data resource with multiple types of formats
in sociology it may refer to a society or group that includes individuals of differing ethnicities cultural backgrounds sexes or ages
earth is a heterogeneous substance in many aspects e.g rocks (geology) are inherently heterogeneous usually occurring at the micro-scale and mini-scale subsequently in studying ore bodies and mineral deposits hydrocarbon accumulation and reservoir characterization geoscientists always face heterogeneous and uncertain situation also in structural geology and many other earth-science fields experts have to cope with heterogeneity in their investigations
in medicine and genetics a genetic or allelic heterogeneous condition is one where the same disease or condition can be caused or contributed to by several factors in the case of genetics varying different genes or alleles
in cancer research cancer cell heterogeneity is thought to be one of the underlying reasons that make treatment of cancer difficult
in statistical meta-analysis study heterogeneity is when multiple studies on an effect are actually measuring somewhat different effects due to differences in subject population intervention choice of analysis experimental design etc. this can cause problems in attempts to summarize the meaning of the studies
== homogeneity ==
homogeneity is the state of being homogeneous pertaining to the sciences it is a substance where all the constituents are of the same nature consisting of similar parts or of elements of the like nature for example homogeneous particles homogeneous elements homogeneous principles or homogeneous bodies or (algebra) possessing the same number of factors of a given kind as with a homogeneous polynomial
== chemistry ==
a heterogeneous mixture is a mixture of two or more compounds examples are mixtures of sand and water or sand and iron filings a conglomerate rock water and oil a salad trail mix and concrete (not cement) during the sampling of heterogeneous mixtures of particles the variance of the sampling error is generally non-zero gy's sampling theory quantitatively defines the heterogeneity of a particle as
 the heterogeneity of the th particle of the population
 the mass concentration of the property of interest in the th particle of the population
the mass concentration of the property of interest in the population
 the mass of the th particle in the population
 the average mass of a particle in the population
homogenization is the process of causing a heterogeneous mixture to become homogeneous as is done with the making of homogenized milk
=== homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions ===
homogeneous reactions are chemical reactions in which the reactants and products are in the same phase while heterogeneous reactions have reactants in two or more phases reactions that take place on the surface of a catalyst of a different phase are also heterogeneous a reaction between two gases or two miscible liquids is homogeneous a reaction between a gas and a liquid a gas and a solid or a liquid and a solid is heterogeneous
a mixture can be determined to be homogeneous when everything is settled and equal and the liquid gas object is one color or the same form various models have been proposed to model the concentrations in different phases the phenomena to be considered are mass rates and reaction 
== spelling ==
the alternate spellings homogenous and heterogenous are commonly but incorrectly used to refer to the above the word homogenous strictly speaking is a biological term which has largely been replaced by homologous though its use to mean homogeneous has seen a rise since 2000 which makes it an established variant heterogenous meanwhile is a term primarily confined to pathology which refers to the property of an object in the body having its origin outside the body
