according theory covalent bond formed two atoms overlap half filled valence atomic orbitals atom containing one unpaired electron valence bond structure similar lewis structure single lewis structure cannot written several valence bond structures used vb structures represents specific lewis structure combination valence bond structures main point resonance theory valence bond theory considers overlapping atomic orbitals participating atoms form chemical bond overlapping probable electrons bond region valence bond theory views bonds weakly coupled orbitals small overlap valence bond theory typically easier employ ground state molecules innershell orbitals electrons remain essentially unchanged formation bonds
overlapping atomic orbitals differ two types overlapping orbitals sigma pi sigma bonds occur orbitals two shared electrons overlap headtohead pi bonds occur two orbitals overlap parallel example bond two sorbital electrons sigma bond two spheres always coaxial terms bond order single bonds one sigma bond double bonds consist one sigma bond one pi bond triple bonds contain one sigma bond two pi bonds however atomic orbitals bonding may hybrids often bonding atomic orbitals character several possible types orbitals methods get atomic orbital proper character bonding called hybridization

applications valence bond theoryedit
important aspect vb theory condition maximum overlap leads formation strongest possible bonds theory used explain covalent bond formation many molecules
example case f molecule ff bond formed overlap pz orbitals two f atoms containing unpaired electron since nature overlapping orbitals different h f molecules bond strength bond lengths differ h f molecules
hf molecule covalent bond formed overlap orbital h pz orbital f containing unpaired electron mutual sharing electrons h f results covalent bond hf
