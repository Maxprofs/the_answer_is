placenta also known afterbirth organ connects developing fetus uterine wall allow nutrient uptake waste elimination gas exchange via mothers blood supply fight internal infection produce hormones support pregnancy placenta provides oxygen nutrients growing babies removes waste products babys blood placenta attaches wall uterus babys umbilical cord develops placenta umbilical cord connects mother baby placentas defining characteristic placental mammals also found nonmammals varying levels development homology structures various viviparous organisms debatable invertebrates arthropoda analogous best
word placenta comes latin word cake greek plakentaplakonta accusative plakeisplakos flat slablike reference round flat appearance humans classical plural placentae form placentas common modern english probably wider currency present
prototherial egglaying metatherial marsupial mammals produce choriovitelline placenta connected uterine wall provides nutrients mainly derived egg sac
placenta functions fetomaternal organ two components fetal placenta chorion frondosum develops blastocyst forms fetus maternal placenta decidua basalis develops maternal uterine tissue
structure
humans placenta averages cm inch length cm inch thickness center thickest edges thinnest typically weighs approximately grams lb dark reddishblue crimson color connects fetus umbilical cord approximately cm inch length contains two umbilical arteries one umbilical vein umbilical cord inserts chorionic plate eccentric attachment vessels branch surface placenta divide form network covered thin layer cells results formation villous tree structures maternal side villous tree structures grouped lobules called cotyledons humans placenta usually disc shape size varies vastly different mammalian species
physiology
development
placenta begins develop upon implantation blastocyst maternal endometrium outer layer blastocyst becomes trophoblast forms outer layer placenta outer layer divided two layers underlying cytotrophoblast layer overlying syncytiotrophoblast layer syncytiotrophoblast multinucleated continuous cell layer covers surface placenta forms result differentiation fusion underlying cytotrophoblast cells process continues throughout placental development syncytiotrophoblast otherwise known syncytium thereby contributes barrier function placenta
placenta grows throughout pregnancy development maternal blood supply placenta complete end first trimester pregnancy approximately weeks
placental circulation
maternal placental circulation
preparation implantation blastocyst uterine endometrium undergoes decidualisation spiral arteries decidua remodeled become less convoluted diameter increased increased diameter straighter flow path act increase maternal blood flow placenta relatively high pressure maternal blood fills intervillous space spiral arteries bathes fetal villi blood allowing exchange gases take place humans hemochorial placentals maternal blood comes direct contact fetal chorion though fluid exchanged pressure decreases pulses deoxygenated blood flows back endometrial veins
maternal blood flow approximately mlmin term
fetoplacental circulation
deoxygenated fetal blood passes umbilical arteries placenta junction umbilical cord placenta umbilical arteries branch radially form chorionic arteries chorionic arteries turn branch cotyledon arteries villi vessels eventually branch form extensive arteriocapillaryvenous system bringing fetal blood extremely close maternal blood intermingling fetal maternal blood occurs placental barrier
endothelin prostanoids cause vasoconstriction placental arteries nitric oxide causes vasodilation hand neural vascular regulation catecholamines little effect
fetoplacental circulation vulnerable persistent hypoxia intermittent hypoxia reoxygenation lead generation excessive free radicals may contribute preeclampsia pregnancy complications proposed melatonin plays role antioxidant placenta
birth
placental expulsion begins physiological separation wall uterus period child born placenta expelled called third stage labor placenta usually expelled within minutes birth
placental expulsion managed actively example giving oxytocin via intramuscular injection followed cord traction assist delivering placenta alternatively managed expectantly allowing placenta expelled without medical assistance cochrane database study suggests blood loss risk postpartum bleeding reduced women offered active management third stage labour needs updating
habit cut cord immediately birth allegedly medical reason contrary theorized cutting cord helps baby adaptation extrauterine life especially preterm infants
functions
nutrition
perfusion intervillous spaces placenta maternal blood allows transfer nutrients oxygen mother fetus transfer waste products carbon dioxide back fetus maternal blood supply nutrient transfer fetus occurs via active passive transport active transport systems allow significantly different plasma concentrations various large molecules maintained maternal fetal sides placental barrier adverse pregnancy situations involving maternal diabetes obesity increase decrease levels nutrient transporters placenta resulting overgrowth restricted growth fetus
excretion
waste products excreted fetus urea uric acid creatinine transferred maternal blood diffusion across placenta
immunity
igg antibodies pass human placenta thereby providing protection fetus utero transfer antibodies begins early th week gestational age certainly th week passive immunity lingers several months birth thus providing newborn carbon copy mothers longterm humoral immunity see infant crucial first months extrauterine life igm however cannot cross placenta infections acquired pregnancy hazardous fetus
furthermore placenta functions selective maternalfetal barrier transmission microbes however insufficiency function may still cause mothertochild transmission infectious diseases
endocrine function
pregnancy womans hormones go many significant changes hormones important role human body especially pregnancy hormones help body function change causing communication organs tissues throughout body hormones regulate body physiologically ways including digestion metabolism respiration tissue function sensory perception sleep excretion lactation stress growth development movement reproduction mood excretion hormones effected hormones mental activity environmental changes concentrations ions nutrients throughout bloodstream hormones aid metabolism regulation immune system changes cravings reproductive changes etc
placenta among many functions also secretes hormones essential fetal life
first hormone released placenta called human chorionic gonadotropin hcg hormone responsible stopping process end menses corpus luteum quits working atrophies hcg interrupt process would lead spontaneous abortion fetus corpus luteum also produces releases progesterone estrogen hcg stimulates increase amount releases hcg also indicator pregnancy hormone pregnancy tests look tests work menses occurred implantation happened days seven ten hcg may also antiantibody effect protecting rejected mothers body hcg also assists male fetus stimulating testes produce testosterone hormone needed allow sex organs male grow
progesterone helps embryo implant assisting passage fallopian tubes also affects fallopian tubes uterus stimulating increase secretions necessary fetal nutrition progesterone like hcg necessary prevent spontaneous abortion prevents contractions uterus necessary implantation
estrogen crucial hormone process proliferation involves enlargement breasts uterus allowing growth fetus production milk estrogen also responsible increased blood supply towards end pregnancy vasodilation levels estrogen pregnancy increase thirty times nonpregnant woman midcycles estrogen level would
human placental lactogen hpl hormone used pregnancy develop fetal metabolism general growth development human placental lactogen works human growth hormone hgh stimulate insulinlike growth factor igf production regulating intermediary metabolism th fetus hpl acts lactogenic receptors modulate embryonic development metabolism stimulate production igf insulin surfactant adrenocortical hormones hpl values increase multiple pregnancies intact molar pregnancy diabetes rh incompatibilities decreased toxemia choriocarcinoma placental insufficiency placental insufficiency
cloaking immune system mother
placenta fetus may regarded foreign allograft inside mother thus must evade attack mothers immune system
purpose placenta uses several mechanisms
secretes neurokinin bcontaining phosphocholine molecules mechanism used parasitic nematodes avoid detection immune system host
presence small lymphocytic suppressor cells fetus inhibit maternal cytotoxic cells inhibiting response interleukin
however placental barrier sole means evade immune system foreign fetal cells also persist maternal circulation side placental barrier
functions
placenta also provides reservoir blood fetus delivering blood case hypotension vice versa comparable capacitor
clinical significance
numerous pathologies affect placenta
placenta accreta placenta implants deeply way actual muscle uterine wall without penetrating
placenta praevia placement placenta close blocks cervix
placental abruptionabruptio placentae
infections involving placenta
placentitis torch infections
chorioamnionitis
society culture
placenta often plays important role various cultures many societies conducting rituals regarding disposal western world placenta often incinerated
cultures bury placenta various reasons mori new zealand traditionally bury placenta newborn child emphasize relationship humans earth likewise navajo bury placenta umbilical cord specially chosen site particularly baby dies birth cambodia costa rica burial placenta believed protect ensure health baby mother mother dies childbirth aymara bolivia bury placenta secret place mothers spirit return claim babys life
placenta believed communities power lives baby parents kwakiutl british columbia bury girls placentas give girl skill digging clams expose boys placentas ravens encourage future prophetic visions turkey proper disposal placenta umbilical cord believed promote devoutness child later life ukraine transylvania japan interaction disposed placenta thought influence parents future fertility
several cultures believe placenta alive often relative baby nepalese think placenta friend baby malaysian orang asli regard babys older sibling igbo nigeria consider placenta deceased twin baby conduct full funeral rites native hawaiians believe placenta part baby traditionally plant tree grow alongside child various cultures indonesia javanese believe placenta spirit needs buried outside family house
cultures placenta eaten practice known placentophagy eastern cultures china dried placenta ziheche lit purple river cart thought healthful restorative sometimes used preparations traditional chinese medicine various health products practice human placentophagy become recent trend western cultures without controversy practice considered cannibalism debated
cultures alternative uses placenta include manufacturing cosmetics pharmaceuticals food
