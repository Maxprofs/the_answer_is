history
principles hydrostatics known empirical intuitive sense since antiquity builders boats cisterns aqueducts fountains archimedes credited discovery mathematical law bears name relates buoyancy force volume density displaced fluid roman engineer vitruvius warned readers lead pipes bursting hydrostatic pressure
concept pressure way transmitted fluids formulated french mathematician philosopher blaise pascal
pressure fluids rest
due fundamental nature fluids fluid cannot remain rest presence shear stress however fluids exert pressure normal contacting surface point fluid thought infinitesimally small cube follows principles equilibrium pressure every side unit fluid must equal case fluid would move direction resulting force thus pressure fluid rest isotropic ie acts equal magnitude directions characteristic allows fluids transmit force length pipes tubes ie force applied fluid pipe transmitted via fluid end pipe principle first formulated slightly extended form blaise pascal called pascals law
hydrostatic pressure
fluid rest frictional stresses vanish state stress system called hydrostatic condition v applied navierstokes equation gradient pressure becomes function body forces barotropic fluid conservative force field like gravitational force field pressure exerted fluid equilibrium becomes function force exerted gravity

buoyancy
body arbitrary shape immersed partly fully fluid experience action net force opposite direction local pressure gradient pressure gradient arises gravity net force vertical direction opposite gravitational force vertical force termed buoyancy buoyant force equal magnitude opposite direction weight displaced fluid mathematically
