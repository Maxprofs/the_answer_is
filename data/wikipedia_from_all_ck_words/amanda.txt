== history ==
the idea of taking a walk in the countryside for pleasure developed in the 18th-century and arose because of changing attitudes to the landscape and nature associated with the romantic movement in earlier times walking generally indicated poverty and was also associated with vagrancy
=== united kingdom ===
thomas west an english clergyman popularized the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the lake district of 1778 in the introduction he wrote that he aimed
to encourage the taste of visiting the lakes by furnishing the traveller with a guide and for that purpose the writer has here collected and laid before him all the select stations and points of view noticed by those authors who have last made the tour of the lakes verified by his own repeated observations
to this end he included various stations or viewpoints around the lakes from which tourists would be encouraged to enjoy the views in terms of their aesthetic qualities published in 1778 the book was a major success
another famous early exponent of walking for pleasure was the english poet william wordsworth in 1790 he embarked on an extended tour of france switzerland and germany a journey subsequently recorded in his long autobiographical poem the prelude (1850) his famous poem tintern abbey was inspired by a visit to the wye valley made during a walking tour of wales in 1798 with his sister dorothy wordsworth wordsworth's friend coleridge was another keen walker and in the autumn of 1799 he and wordsworth undertook a three weeks tour of the lake district john keats who belonged to the next generation of romantic poets began in june 1818 a walking tour of scotland ireland and the lake district with his friend charles armitage brown
more and more people undertook walking tours through the 19th-century of which the most famous is probably robert louis stevenson's journey through the cvennes in france with a donkey recorded in his travels with a donkey (1879) stevenson also published in 1876 his famous essay walking tours the subgenre of travel writing produced many classics in the subsequent 20th-century an early american example of a book that describes an extended walking tour is naturalist john muir's a thousand mile walk to the gulf (1916) a posthumous published account of a long botanizing walk undertaken in 1867
due to industrialisation in england people began to migrate to the cities where living standards were often cramped and unsanitary they would escape the confines of the city by rambling about in the countryside however the land in england particularly around the urban areas of manchester and sheffield was privately owned and trespass was illegal rambling clubs soon sprang up in the north and began politically campaigning for the legal right to roam one of the first such clubs was sunday tramps founded by leslie white in 1879 the first national grouping the federation of rambling clubs was formed in london in 1905 and was heavily patronized by the peerage
access to mountains bills that would have legislated the public's right to roam across some private land were periodically presented to parliament from 1884 to 1932 without success finally in 1932 the ramblers right movement organized a mass trespass on kinder scout in derbyshire despite attempts on the part of the police to prevent the trespass from going ahead it was successfully achieved due to massive publicity however the mountain access bill that was passed in 1939 was opposed by many walkers including the organization the ramblers who felt that it did not sufficiently protect their rights and it was eventually repealed
the effort to improve access led after world war ii to the national parks and access to the countryside act 1949 and in 1951 to the creation of the first national park in the uk the peak district national park the establishment of this and similar national parks helped to improve access for all outdoors enthusiasts the countryside and rights of way act 2000 considerably extended the right to roam in england and wales
=== united states ===
an early example of an interest in hiking in the united states is abel crawford and his son ethan's clearing of a trail to the summit of mount washington new hampshire in 1819 this 8.5 mile path is the oldest continually used hiking trail in the united states the influence of british and european romanticism reached north america through the transcendentalist movement and both ralph waldo emerson (180382) and henry david thoreau (1817-62) were important influences on the outdoors movement in north america thoreau's writing on nature and on walking include the posthumously published walking (1862) while an earlier essay a walk to wachusett (1842) describes a four-day walking tour he took with a companion from concord massachusetts to the summit of mount wachusett princeton massachusetts and back in 1876 the appalachian mountain club americas earliest recreation organization was founded to protect the trails and mountains in the northeastern united states
the scottish-born american naturalist john muir (1838 1914) was another important early advocate of the preservation of wilderness in the united states he petitioned the u.s congress for the national park bill that was passed in 1890 establishing yosemite and sequoia national parks the sierra club which he founded is now one of the most important conservation organizations in the united states the spiritual quality and enthusiasm toward nature expressed in his writings inspired others including presidents and congressmen to take action to help preserve large areas of undeveloped countryside he is today referred to as the father of the national parks in 1916 the national park service was created to protect national parks and monuments
in 1921 benton mackaye a forester conceived the idea of the america's first national trail the appalachian trail and this was completed in august 1937 running from sugarloaf mountain in maine to georgia the pacific crest trail ("pct") was first explored in the 1930s by the ymca hiking groups and was eventually registered as a complete border to border trail from mexico to canada
=== long distance hiking ===
frequently nowadays long distance hikes (walking tours) are undertaken along long distance paths including the national trails in england and wales the national trail system in the usa and the grande randonne (france) grote routepaden or lange-afstand-wandelpaden (holland) grande rota (portugal) gran recorrido (spain) is a network of long-distance footpaths in europe mostly in france belgium the netherlands and spain there are extensive networks in other european countries of long distance trails as well as in canada australia new zealand nepal and to a lesser extent other asiatic countries like turkey israel and jordan in the alps of austria slovenia switzerland germany france and italy walking tours are often made from hut-to-hut using an extensive system of mountain huts
in the late 20th-century there has been a proliferation of official and unofficial long distance routes which mean that hikers now are more likely to refer to using a long distance way (britain) trail (usa) the grande randonne (france) etc. than setting out on a walking tour early examples of long distance paths include the appalachian trail in the usa and the pennine way in britain pilgrimage routes are now treated by some walkers as long distance routes and the route taken by the british national trail the north downs way closely follows that of the pilgrims way to canterbury
hiking times can be estimated by naismith's rule or tobler's hiking function
== equipment ==
the equipment required for hiking depends on the length of the hike but day hikers generally carry at least water food a map and rain-proof gear hikers usually wear sturdy hiking boots for mountain walking and backpacking as protection from the rough terrain as well as providing increased stability the mountaineers club recommends a list of ten essentials equipment for hiking including a compass sunglasses sunscreen a flashlight a first aid kit a fire starter and a knife other groups recommend items such as hat gloves insect repellent and an emergency blanket a gps navigation device can also be helpful and route cards may be used as a guide
proponents of ultralight backpacking argue that long lists of required items for multi-day hikes increases pack weight and hence fatigue and the chance of injury instead they recommend reducing pack weight in order to make hiking long distances easier even the use of hiking boots on long-distances hikes is controversial among ultralight hikers because of their weight
== environmental impact ==
natural environments are often fragile and may be accidentally damaged especially when a large number of hikers are involved for example years of gathering wood can strip an alpine area of valuable nutrients and can cause deforestation and some species such as martens or bighorn sheep are very sensitive to the presence of humans especially around mating season generally protected areas such as parks have regulations in place to protect the environment so as to minimize such impact such regulations include banning wood fires restricting camping to established camp sites disposing or packing out faecal matter and imposing a quota on the number of hikers many hikers espouse the philosophy of leave no trace following strict practices on dealing with food waste food packaging and other impact on the environment
human waste is often a major source of environmental impact from hiking and can contaminate the watershed and make other hikers ill catholes dug 10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) deep depending on local soil composition and covered after use at least 60 m (200 feet) away from water sources and trails are recommended to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination
fire is a particular source of danger and an individual hiker can have a large impact on an ecosystem for example in 2005 a czech backpacker burned 7% of torres del paine national park in chile by knocking over a portable stove
== etiquette ==
sometimes the action of hikers may come into conflict with other users of the land hiking etiquette has developed to minimize such interference common hiking etiquette includes
when two groups of hikers meet on a steep trail a custom has developed in some areas whereby the group moving uphill has the right-of-way
being forced to hike much faster than one's natural pace can be annoying difficult to maintain consistently and increases fatigue it may also cause injury but if a group splits between fast and slow hikers the slow hikers may be left behind or become lost therefore a common custom is to encourage the slowest hiker to lead and have everyone match that speed another custom is to have experienced hiker(s) sweep up the rear on a rota to ensure that everyone in the group is safe
hikers generally avoid making loud sounds such as shouting or loud conversation or the use of mobile phones or music however in bear country hikers make noise as a safety precaution through the use of whistles or bells
hikers tend to avoid impacting on the land through which they travel hikers can avoid impact by staying on established trails not picking plants or disturbing wildlife and carrying garbage out the leave no trace movement offers a set of guidelines for low-impact hiking leave nothing but footprints take nothing but photos kill nothing but time keep nothing but memories
the feeding of wild animals is dangerous and can cause harm to both the animals and to other people
== hazards ==
as discussed in hazards of outdoor recreation hiking may produce threats to personal safety from such causes as hazardous terrain inclement weather becoming lost or exacerbation of pre-existing medical conditions these dangerous circumstances and/or specific accidents or ailments that hikers face may include for example diarrhea for example one of the most common illnesses afflicting long-distance hikers in the united states (see wilderness acquired diarrhea.)
additional potential hazards involving physical ailments may include dehydration frostbite hypothermia sunburn or sunstroke or such injuries as ankle sprains or broken bones
other threats may be posed attacks by animals (such as mammals (e.g. bears) reptiles (e.g. snakes) or insects) or contact with noxious plants that can cause rashes (e.g. poison ivy poison oak poison sumac or stinging nettles) attacks by humans are also a reality in some places and lightning is also a threat especially on high ground
the crossing of glaciers is potentially hazardous because of the potential for crevasses these giant cracks in the ice are not always visible as snow can be blown and freeze over the top to make a snowbridge to cross a glacier the use of a rope crampons and ice axes are usually required deep fast flowing rivers pose another danger that can be mitigated with ropes
in various countries borders may be poorly marked in 2009 iran imprisoned three americans for hiking across the iran-iraq border it is illegal to cross into the usa on the pacific crest trail from canada going south to north it is more straightforward and a crossing can be made if advanced arrangements are made with canadian border services within the schengen area which includes most of the e.u. and associated nations like switzerland and norway there are no impediments to crossing by path and borders are not always obvious
