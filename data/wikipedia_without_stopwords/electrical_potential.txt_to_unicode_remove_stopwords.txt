gausss law potential satisfies poissons equation
total charge density including bound charge denotes divergence
concept electric potential closely linked potential energy test charge q electric potential energy ue given
potential energy hence also electric potential defined additive constant one must arbitrarily choose position potential energy electric potential zero
equations cannot used curl e ie case nonconservative electric field caused changing magnetic field see maxwells equations generalization electric potential case described
electric potential due point charge
electric potential created point charge q distance r charge relative potential infinity shown
electric constant permittivity vacuum known coulomb potential
electric potential due system point charges equal sum point charges individual potentials fact simplifies calculations significantly since addition potential scalar fields much easier addition electric vector fields
