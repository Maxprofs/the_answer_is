in classical mechanics the gravitational potential at a location is equal to the work (energy transferred) per unit mass that would be done by the force of gravity if an object were moved from its location in space to a fixed reference location it is analogous to the electric potential with mass playing the role of charge the reference location where the potential is zero is by convention infinitely far away from any mass resulting in a negative potential at any finite distance
in mathematics the gravitational potential is also known as the newtonian potential and is fundamental in the study of potential theory
== potential energyedit ==
the gravitational potential (v) is the gravitational potential energy (u) per unit mass
where m is the mass of the object potential energy is equal (in magnitude but negative) to the work done by the gravitational field moving a body to its given position in space from infinity if the body has a mass of 1 unit then the potential energy to be assigned to that body is equal to the gravitational potential so the potential can be interpreted as the negative of the work done by the gravitational field moving a unit mass in from infinity
in some situations the equations can be simplified by assuming a field that is nearly independent of position for instance in daily life in the region close to the surface of the earth the gravitational acceleration can be considered constant in that case the difference in potential energy from one height to another is to a good approximation linearly related to the difference in height
== mathematical formedit ==
the potential v of a unit mass m at a distance x from a point mass of mass m can be defined as the work w done by the gravitational field f bringing the unit mass in from infinity to that point
where g is the gravitational constant the potential has units of energy per unit mass e.g. j/kg in the mks system by convention it is always negative where it is defined and as x tends to infinity it approaches zero
the gravitational field and thus the acceleration of a small body in the space around the massive object is the negative gradient of the gravitational potential thus the negative of a negative gradient yields positive acceleration toward a massive object because the potential has no angular components its gradient is
where x is a vector of length x pointing from the point mass toward the small body and is a unit vector pointing from the point mass toward the small body the magnitude of the acceleration therefore follows an inverse square law
the potential associated with a mass distribution is the superposition of the potentials of point masses if the mass distribution is a finite collection of point masses and if the point masses are located at the points x1  xn and have masses m1  mn then the potential of the distribution at the point x is
if the mass distribution is given as a mass measure dm on three-dimensional euclidean space r3 then the potential is the convolution of g/|r| with dm in good cases this equals the integral
where |x r| is the distance between the points x and r if there is a function (r) representing the density of the distribution at r so that dm(r)= (r)dv(r) where dv(r) is the euclidean volume element then the gravitational potential is the volume integral
if v is a potential function coming from a continuous mass distribution (r) then can be recovered using the laplace operator 
this holds pointwise whenever is continuous and is zero outside of a bounded set in general the mass measure dm can be recovered in the same way if the laplace operator is taken in the sense of distributions as a consequence the gravitational potential satisfies poisson's equation see also green's function for the three-variable laplace equation and newtonian potential
== spherical symmetryedit ==
a spherically symmetric mass distribution behaves to an observer completely outside the distribution as though all of the mass were concentrated at the center and thus effectively as a point mass by the shell theorem on the surface of the earth the acceleration is given by so-called standard gravity g approximately 9.8 m/s2 although this value varies slightly with latitude and altitude the magnitude of the acceleration is a little larger at the poles than at the equator because earth is an oblate spheroid
within a spherically symmetric mass distribution it is possible to solve poisson's equation in spherical coordinates within a uniform spherical body of radius r and density the gravitational force g inside the sphere varies linearly with distance r from the center giving the gravitational potential inside the sphere which is
which differentiably connects to the potential function for the outside of the sphere (see the figure at the top)
== general relativityedit ==
in general relativity the gravitational potential is replaced by the metric tensor when the gravitational field is weak and the sources are moving very slowly compared to light-speed general relativity reduces to newtonian gravity and the metric tensor can be expanded in terms of the gravitational potential
== multipole expansionedit ==
the potential at a point x is given by
the potential can be expanded in a series of legendre polynomials represent the points x and r as position vectors relative to the center of mass the denominator in the integral is expressed as the square root of the square to give
where in the last integral r = |r| and is the angle between x and r
the integrand can be expanded as a taylor series in z = r/|x| by explicit calculation of the coefficients a less laborious way of achieving the same result is by using the generalized binomial theorem the resulting series is the generating function for the legendre polynomials
valid for |x| 1 and |z| < 1 the coefficients pn are the legendre polynomials of degree n therefore the taylor coefficients of the integrand are given by the legendre polynomials in x = cos so the potential can be expanded in a series that is convergent for positions x such that r < |x| for all mass elements of the system (i.e. outside a sphere centered at the center of mass that encloses the system)
the integral is the component of the center of mass in the x direction this vanishes because the vector x emanates from the center of mass so bringing the integral under the sign of the summation gives
this shows that elongation of the body causes a lower potential in the direction of elongation and a higher potential in perpendicular directions compared to the potential due to a spherical mass if we compare cases with the same distance to the center of mass (if we compare cases with the same distance to the surface the opposite is true.)
== numerical valuesedit ==
the absolute value of gravitational potential at a number of locations with regards to the gravitation from the earth the sun and the milky way is given in the following table i.e an object at earth's surface would need 60 mj/kg to leave earth's gravity field another 900 mj/kg to also leave the sun's gravity field and more than 130 gj/kg to leave the gravity field of the milky way the potential is half the square of the escape velocity
compare the gravity at these locations
