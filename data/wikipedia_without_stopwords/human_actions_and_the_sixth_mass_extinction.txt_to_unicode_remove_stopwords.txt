holocene extinction sometimes called sixth extinction name proposed describe ongoing extinction event species present holocene epoch since around bce mainly due human activity large number extinctions span numerous families plants animals including mammals birds amphibians reptiles arthropods although extinctions occurring documented international union conservation nature natural resources vast majority undocumented according speciesarea theory based upperbound estimating present rate extinction may species per year
holocene extinction includes disappearance large mammals known megafauna starting years ago end last ice age may due extinction mammoths whose habits maintained grasslands became birch forests without new forest resulting forest fires may induced climate change disappearances might result proliferation modern humans extinctions occurring near pleistoceneholocene boundary sometimes referred quaternary extinction event holocene extinction continues st century
general agreement whether consider part quaternary extinction event distinct event resulting humancaused changes recent parts extinction plants also suffered large losses overall holocene extinction characterized human impact environment

americas area study generally covered younger dryas impact hypothesis
debate extent disappearance megafauna end last glacial period attributed human activities hunting even slaughter prey populations discoveries monte verde south america meadowcroft rock shelter pennsylvania caused controversy regarding clovis culture likely human settlements prior clovis culture history humans americas may extend back many thousands years clovis culture strong correlation human arrival megafauna extinction example wrangel island siberia extinction dwarf woolly mammoths approximately bce coincide arrival humans
comparisons sometimes made recent extinctions approximately since industrial revolution pleistocene extinction near end last glacial period latter exemplified extinction large herbivores woolly mammoth carnivores preyed know humans era actively hunted mammoth mastodon known hunting cause subsequent massive ecological changes widespread extinctions climate changes
ecosystems encountered first americans exposed human interaction may far less resilient human made changes ecosystems encountered industrial era humans
therefore actions clovis people despite seeming insignificant todays standards could indeed profound effect ecosystems wild life entirely unused human influence
