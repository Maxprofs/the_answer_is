the himalayas or himalaya (/hmle./ or /hmlj/ sanskrit  urdu  from sanskrit hima (snow) + laya (dwelling) literally meaning abode of snow") is a mountain range in the indian subcontinent which separates the indo-gangetic plain from the tibetan plateau this range is home to nine of the ten highest peaks on earth including the highest above sea level mount everest the himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of south asia many himalayan peaks are sacred in both buddhism and hinduism
the himalayas are bordered on the north by the tibetan plateau on the south by the indo-gangetic plain on the northwest by the karakoram and hindu kush ranges and on the east by the indian states of assam and arunachal pradesh the hindu kush karakoram and himalayas form together the hindu kush himalayan region (hkh) the western anchor of the himalayasnanga parbatlies just south of the northernmost bend of the indus river while the eastern anchornamcha barwais situated just west of the great bend of the yarlung tsangpo river the himalayas span five countries india nepal bhutan china (tibet) and pakistan with the first three countries having sovereignty over most of the range
lifted by the collision of the indian tectonic plate with the eurasian plate the himalayan range runs northwest to southeast in a 2,400 kilometres (1,500 mi) long arc the range varies in width from 400 kilometres (250 mi) in the west to 150 kilometres (93 mi) in the east besides the greater himalayas there are several parallel lower ranges the southernmost of these located along the northern edge of the indian plains and reaching about a thousand meters in altitude are called the sivalik hills further north is a higher range reaching two to three thousand meters known as the lower himalayan range
three of the world's major riversthe indus the ganges and the brahmaputraarise in the himalayas while the indus and the brahmaputra rise near mount kailash in tibet the ganges rises in the indian state of uttarakhand their combined drainage basin is home to some 600 million people
== ecology ==
the flora and fauna of the himalayas vary with climate rainfall altitude and soils the climate ranges from tropical at the base of the mountains to permanent ice and snow at the highest elevations the amount of yearly rainfall increases from west to east along the southern front of the range this diversity of altitude rainfall and soil conditions combined with the very high snow line supports a variety of distinct plant and animal communities the extremes of high altitude (low atmospheric pressure) combined with extreme cold favor extremophile organisms
the unique floral and faunal wealth of the himalayas is undergoing structural and compositional changes due to climate change the increase in temperature is shifting various species to higher elevations the oak forest is being invaded by pine forests in the garhwal himalayan region there are reports of early flowering and fruiting in some tree species especially rhododendron apple and box myrtle the highest known tree species in the himalayas is juniperus tibetica located at 4,900 metres (16,080 ft) in southeastern tibet
== geology ==
the himalayan range is one of the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consists mostly of uplifted sedimentary and metamorphic rock according to the modern theory of plate tectonics its formation is a result of a continental collision or orogeny along the convergent boundary between the indo-australian plate and the eurasian plate the arakan yoma highlands in myanmar and the andaman and nicobar islands in the bay of bengal were also formed as a result of this collision
during the upper cretaceous about 70 million years ago the north-moving indo-australian plate (which has subsequently broken into the indian plate and the australian plate) was moving at about 15 cm per year about 50 million years ago this fast moving indo-australian plate had completely closed the tethys ocean the existence of which has been determined by sedimentary rocks settled on the ocean floor and the volcanoes that fringed its edges since both plates were composed of low density continental crust they were thrust faulted and folded into mountain ranges rather than subducting into the mantle along an oceanic trench an often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of mount everest is made of marine limestone from this ancient ocean
today the indian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the tibetan plateau which forces the plateau to continue to move upwards the indian plate is still moving at 67 mm per year and over the next 10 million years it will travel about 1,500 km into asia about 20 mm per year of the india-asia convergence is absorbed by thrusting along the himalaya southern front this leads to the himalayas rising by about 5 mm per year making them geologically active the movement of the indian plate into the asian plate also makes this region seismically active leading to earthquakes from time to time
during the last ice age there was a connected ice stream of glaciers between kangchenjunga in the east and nanga parbat in the west in the west the glaciers joined with the ice stream network in the karakoram and in the north joined with the former tibetan inland ice to the south outflow glaciers came to an end below an elevation of 1,0002,000 metres (3,3006,600 ft) while the current valley glaciers of the himalaya reach at most 20 to 32 kilometres (12 to 20 mi) in length several of the main valley glaciers were 60 to 112 kilometres (37 to 70 mi) long during the ice age the glacier snowline (the altitude where accumulation and ablation of a glacier are balanced) was about 1,4001,660 metres (4,5905,450 ft) lower than it is today thus the climate was at least 7.0 to 8.3 c (12.6 to 14.9 f) colder than it is today
== hydrology ==
the himalayas have the third largest deposit of ice and snow in the world after antarctica and the arctic the himalayan range encompasses about 15,000 glaciers which store about 12,000 km3 (3,000 cubic miles) of fresh water its glaciers include the gangotri and yamunotri (uttarakhand) and khumbu glaciers (mount everest region) langtang glacier (langtang region) and zemu (sikkim)
owing to the mountains latitude near the tropic of cancer the permanent snow line is among the highest in the world at typically around 5,500 metres (18,000 ft) in contrast equatorial mountains in new guinea the rwenzoris and colombia have a snow line some 900 metres (2,950 ft) lower the higher regions of the himalayas are snowbound throughout the year in spite of their proximity to the tropics and they form the sources of several large perennial rivers most of which combine into two large river systems
the western rivers of which the indus is the largest combine into the indus basin the indus begins in tibet at the confluence of sengge and gar rivers and flows southwest through india and then through pakistan to the arabian sea it is fed by the jhelum the chenab the ravi the beas and the sutlej rivers among others
most of the other himalayan rivers drain the ganges-brahmaputra basin its main rivers are the ganges the brahmaputra and the yamuna as well as other tributaries the brahmaputra originates as the yarlung tsangpo river in western tibet and flows east through tibet and west through the plains of assam the ganges and the brahmaputra meet in bangladesh and drain into the bay of bengal through the world's largest river delta,the sunderbans
the easternmost himalayan rivers feed the ayeyarwady river which originates in eastern tibet and flows south through myanmar to drain into the andaman sea
the salween mekong yangtze and huang he (yellow river) all originate from parts of the tibetan plateau that are geologically distinct from the himalaya mountains and are therefore not considered true himalayan rivers some geologists refer to all the rivers collectively as the circum-himalayan rivers in recent years scientists have monitored a notable increase in the rate of glacier retreat across the region as a result of global climate change for example glacial lakes have been forming rapidly on the surface of debris-covered glaciers in the bhutan himalaya during the last few decades although the effect of this will not be known for many years it potentially could mean disaster for the hundreds of millions of people who rely on the glaciers to feed the rivers during the dry seasons
=== lakes ===
the himalayan region is dotted with hundreds of lakes most lakes are found at altitudes of less than 5,000 m with the size of the lakes diminishing with altitude tilicho lake in nepal in the annapurna massif is one of the highest lakes in the world pangong tso which is spread across the border between india and china and yamdrok tso located in central tibet are amongst the largest with surface areas of 700 km and 638 km respectively other notable lakes include she-phoksundo lake in the shey phoksundo national park of nepal gurudongmar lake in north sikkim gokyo lakes in solukhumbu district of nepal and lake tsongmo near the indo-china border in sikkim
some of the lakes present a danger of a glacial lake outburst flood the tsho rolpa glacier lake in the rowaling valley in the dolakha district of nepal is rated as the most dangerous the lake which is located at an altitude of 4,580 metres (15,030 ft) has grown considerably over the last 50 years due to glacial melting
the mountain lakes are known to geographers as tarns if they are caused by glacial activity tarns are found mostly in the upper reaches of the himalaya above 5,500 metres
== impact on climate ==
the himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the indian subcontinent and the tibetan plateau they prevent frigid dry winds from blowing south into the subcontinent which keeps south asia much warmer than corresponding temperate regions in the other continents it also forms a barrier for the monsoon winds keeping them from traveling northwards and causing heavy rainfall in the terai region the himalayas are also believed to play an important part in the formation of central asian deserts such as the taklamakan and gobi
== religions of the region ==
in hinduism the himalayas have been personified as the god himavat father of ganga and parvati
several places in the himalayas are of religious significance in buddhism hinduism jainism and sikhism a notable example of a religious site is paro taktsang where padmasambhava is said to have founded buddhism in bhutan
a number of tibetan buddhist sites are situated in the himalayas including the residence of the dalai lama there were over 6,000 monasteries in tibet the tibetan muslims had their own mosques in lhasa and shigatse
