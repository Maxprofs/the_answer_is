innate immune system
microorganisms toxins successfully enter organism encounter cells mechanisms innate immune system innate response usually triggered microbes identified pattern recognition receptors recognize components conserved among broad groups microorganisms damaged injured stressed cells send alarm signals many recognized receptors recognize pathogens innate immune defenses nonspecific meaning systems respond pathogens generic way system confer longlasting immunity pathogen innate immune system dominant system host defense organisms
surface barriers
several barriers protect organisms infection including mechanical chemical biological barriers waxy cuticle many leaves exoskeleton insects shells membranes externally deposited eggs skin examples mechanical barriers first line defense infection however organisms cannot completely sealed environments systems act protect body openings lungs intestines genitourinary tract lungs coughing sneezing mechanically eject pathogens irritants respiratory tract flushing action tears urine also mechanically expels pathogens mucus secreted respiratory gastrointestinal tract serves trap entangle microorganisms
chemical barriers also protect infection skin respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides defensins enzymes lysozyme phospholipase saliva tears breast milk also antibacterials vaginal secretions serve chemical barrier following menarche become slightly acidic semen contains defensins zinc kill pathogens stomach gastric acid proteases serve powerful chemical defenses ingested pathogens
within genitourinary gastrointestinal tracts commensal flora serve biological barriers competing pathogenic bacteria food space cases changing conditions environment ph available iron reduces probability pathogens reach sufficient numbers cause illness however since antibiotics nonspecifically target bacteria affect fungi oral antibiotics lead overgrowth fungi cause conditions vaginal candidiasis yeast infection good evidence reintroduction probiotic flora pure cultures lactobacilli normally found unpasteurized yogurt helps restore healthy balance microbial populations intestinal infections children encouraging preliminary data studies bacterial gastroenteritis inflammatory bowel diseases urinary tract infection postsurgical infections
inflammation
inflammation one first responses immune system infection symptoms inflammation redness swelling heat pain caused increased blood flow tissue inflammation produced eicosanoids cytokines released injured infected cells eicosanoids include prostaglandins produce fever dilation blood vessels associated inflammation leukotrienes attract certain white blood cells leukocytes common cytokines include interleukins responsible communication white blood cells chemokines promote chemotaxis interferons antiviral effects shutting protein synthesis host cell growth factors cytotoxic factors may also released cytokines chemicals recruit immune cells site infection promote healing damaged tissue following removal pathogens
complement system
complement system biochemical cascade attacks surfaces foreign cells contains different proteins named ability complement killing pathogens antibodies complement major humoral component innate immune response many species complement systems including nonmammals like plants fish invertebrates
humans response activated complement binding antibodies attached microbes binding complement proteins carbohydrates surfaces microbes recognition signal triggers rapid killing response speed response result signal amplification occurs following sequential proteolytic activation complement molecules also proteases complement proteins initially bind microbe activate protease activity turn activates complement proteases produces catalytic cascade amplifies initial signal controlled positive feedback cascade results production peptides attract immune cells increase vascular permeability opsonize coat surface pathogen marking destruction deposition complement also kill cells directly disrupting plasma membrane
cellular barriers
leukocytes white blood cells act like independent singlecelled organisms second arm innate immune system innate leukocytes include phagocytes macrophages neutrophils dendritic cells mast cells eosinophils basophils natural killer cells cells identify eliminate pathogens either attacking larger pathogens contact engulfing killing microorganisms innate cells also important mediators activation adaptive immune system
phagocytosis important feature cellular innate immunity performed cells called phagocytes engulf eat pathogens particles phagocytes generally patrol body searching pathogens called specific locations cytokines pathogen engulfed phagocyte becomes trapped intracellular vesicle called phagosome subsequently fuses another vesicle called lysosome form phagolysosome pathogen killed activity digestive enzymes following respiratory burst releases free radicals phagolysosome phagocytosis evolved means acquiring nutrients role extended phagocytes include engulfment pathogens defense mechanism phagocytosis probably represents oldest form host defense phagocytes identified vertebrate invertebrate animals
neutrophils macrophages phagocytes travel throughout body pursuit invading pathogens neutrophils normally found bloodstream abundant type phagocyte normally representing total circulating leukocytes acute phase inflammation particularly result bacterial infection neutrophils migrate toward site inflammation process called chemotaxis usually first cells arrive scene infection macrophages versatile cells reside within tissues produce wide array chemicals including enzymes complement proteins regulatory factors interleukin macrophages also act scavengers ridding body wornout cells debris antigenpresenting cells activate adaptive immune system

natural killer cells
natural killer cells nk cells component innate immune system directly attack invading microbes rather nk cells destroy compromised host cells tumor cells virusinfected cells recognizing cells condition known missing self term describes cells low levels cellsurface marker called mhc major histocompatibility complex situation arise viral infections host cells named natural killer initial notion require activation order kill cells missing self many years unclear nk cells recognize tumor cells infected cells known mhc makeup surface cells altered nk cells become activated recognition missing self normal body cells recognized attacked nk cells express intact self mhc antigens mhc antigens recognized killer cell immunoglobulin receptors kir essentially put brakes nk cells
adaptive immune system
adaptive immune system evolved early vertebrates allows stronger immune response well immunological memory pathogen remembered signature antigen adaptive immune response antigenspecific requires recognition specific nonself antigens process called antigen presentation antigen specificity allows generation responses tailored specific pathogens pathogeninfected cells ability mount tailored responses maintained body memory cells pathogen infect body specific memory cells used quickly eliminate
lymphocytes
cells adaptive immune system special types leukocytes called lymphocytes b cells cells major types lymphocytes derived hematopoietic stem cells bone marrow b cells involved humoral immune response whereas cells involved cellmediated immune response
b cells cells carry receptor molecules recognize specific targets cells recognize nonself target pathogen antigens small fragments pathogen processed presented combination self receptor called major histocompatibility complex mhc molecule two major subtypes cells killer cell helper cell addition suppressor cells role modulating immune response killer cells recognize antigens coupled class mhc molecules helper cells recognize antigens coupled class ii mhc molecules two mechanisms antigen presentation reflect different roles two types cell third minor subtype cells recognize intact antigens bound mhc receptors
contrast b cell antigenspecific receptor antibody molecule b cell surface recognizes whole pathogens without need antigen processing lineage b cell expresses different antibody complete set b cell antigen receptors represent antibodies body manufacture
killer cells
killer cells subgroup cells kill cells infected viruses pathogens otherwise damaged dysfunctional b cells type cell recognizes different antigen killer cells activated cell receptor tcr binds specific antigen complex mhc class receptor another cell recognition mhcantigen complex aided coreceptor cell called cd cell travels throughout body search cells mhc receptors bear antigen activated cell contacts cells releases cytotoxins perforin form pores target cells plasma membrane allowing ions water toxins enter entry another toxin called granulysin protease induces target cell undergo apoptosis cell killing host cells particularly important preventing replication viruses cell activation tightly controlled generally requires strong mhcantigen activation signal additional activation signals provided helper cells see
helper cells
helper cells regulate innate adaptive immune responses help determine immune responses body makes particular pathogen cells cytotoxic activity kill infected cells clear pathogens directly instead control immune response directing cells perform tasks
helper cells express cell receptors tcr recognize antigen bound class ii mhc molecules mhcantigen complex also recognized helper cells cd coreceptor recruits molecules inside cell eg lck responsible cells activation helper cells weaker association mhcantigen complex observed killer cells meaning many receptors around helper cell must bound mhcantigen order activate helper cell killer cells activated engagement single mhcantigen molecule helper cell activation also requires longer duration engagement antigenpresenting cell activation resting helper cell causes release cytokines influence activity many cell types cytokine signals produced helper cells enhance microbicidal function macrophages activity killer cells addition helper cell activation causes upregulation molecules expressed cells surface cd ligand also called cd provide extra stimulatory signals typically required activate antibodyproducing b cells

gamma delta cells cells possess alternative cell receptor tcr opposed cd cd cells share characteristics helper cells cytotoxic cells nk cells conditions produce responses cells fully understood like unconventional cell subsets bearing invariant tcrs cddrestricted natural killer cells cells straddle border innate adaptive immunity one hand cells component adaptive immunity rearrange tcr genes produce receptor diversity also develop memory phenotype hand various subsets also part innate immune system restricted tcr nk receptors may used pattern recognition receptors example large numbers human vv cells respond within hours common molecules produced microbes highly restricted v cells epithelia respond stressed epithelial cells
b lymphocytes antibodies
b cell identifies pathogens antibodies surface bind specific foreign antigen antigenantibody complex taken b cell processed proteolysis peptides b cell displays antigenic peptides surface mhc class ii molecules combination mhc antigen attracts matching helper cell releases lymphokines activates b cell activated b cell begins divide offspring plasma cells secrete millions copies antibody recognizes antigen antibodies circulate blood plasma lymph bind pathogens expressing antigen mark destruction complement activation uptake destruction phagocytes antibodies also neutralize challenges directly binding bacterial toxins interfering receptors viruses bacteria use infect cells
alternative adaptive immune system
evolution adaptive immune system occurred ancestor jawed vertebrates many classical molecules adaptive immune system eg immunoglobulins cell receptors exist jawed vertebrates however distinct lymphocytederived molecule discovered primitive jawless vertebrates lamprey hagfish animals possess large array molecules called variable lymphocyte receptors vlrs like antigen receptors jawed vertebrates produced small number one two genes molecules believed bind pathogenic antigens similar way antibodies degree specificity
immunological memory
b cells cells activated begin replicate offspring become longlived memory cells throughout lifetime animal memory cells remember specific pathogen encountered mount strong response pathogen detected adaptive occurs lifetime individual adaptation infection pathogen prepares immune system future challenges immunological memory form either passive shortterm memory active longterm memory
passive memory
newborn infants prior exposure microbes particularly vulnerable infection several layers passive protection provided mother pregnancy particular type antibody called igg transported mother baby directly across placenta human babies high levels antibodies even birth range antigen specificities mother breast milk colostrum also contains antibodies transferred gut infant protect bacterial infections newborn synthesize antibodies passive immunity fetus actually make memory cells antibodiesit borrows passive immunity usually shortterm lasting days several months medicine protective passive immunity also transferred artificially one individual another via antibodyrich serum
active memory immunization
longterm active memory acquired following infection activation b cells active immunity also generated artificially vaccination principle behind vaccination also called immunization introduce antigen pathogen order stimulate immune system develop specific immunity particular pathogen without causing disease associated organism deliberate induction immune response successful exploits natural specificity immune system well inducibility infectious disease remaining one leading causes death human population vaccination represents effective manipulation immune system mankind developed
viral vaccines based live attenuated viruses many bacterial vaccines based acellular components microorganisms including harmless toxin components since many antigens derived acellular vaccines strongly induce adaptive response bacterial vaccines provided additional adjuvants activate antigenpresenting cells innate immune system maximize immunogenicity
disorders human immunity
immune system remarkably effective structure incorporates specificity inducibility adaptation failures host defense occur however fall three broad categories immunodeficiencies autoimmunity hypersensitivities
immunodeficiencies
immunodeficiencies occur one components immune system inactive ability immune system respond pathogens diminished young elderly immune responses beginning decline around years age due immunosenescence developed countries obesity alcoholism drug use common causes poor immune function however malnutrition common cause immunodeficiency developing countries diets lacking sufficient protein associated impaired cellmediated immunity complement activity phagocyte function iga antibody concentrations cytokine production additionally loss thymus early age genetic mutation surgical removal results severe immunodeficiency high susceptibility infection
immunodeficiencies also inherited acquired chronic granulomatous disease phagocytes reduced ability destroy pathogens example inherited congenital immunodeficiency aids types cancer cause acquired immunodeficiency
autoimmunity
overactive immune responses comprise end immune dysfunction particularly autoimmune disorders immune system fails properly distinguish self nonself attacks part body normal circumstances many cells antibodies react self peptides one functions specialized cells located thymus bone marrow present young lymphocytes self antigens produced throughout body eliminate cells recognize selfantigens preventing autoimmunity
hypersensitivity
hypersensitivity immune response damages bodys tissues divided four classes type iv based mechanisms involved time course hypersensitive reaction type hypersensitivity immediate anaphylactic reaction often associated allergy symptoms range mild discomfort death type hypersensitivity mediated ige triggers degranulation mast cells basophils crosslinked antigen type ii hypersensitivity occurs antibodies bind antigens patients cells marking destruction also called antibodydependent cytotoxic hypersensitivity mediated igg igm antibodies immune complexes aggregations antigens complement proteins igg igm antibodies deposited various tissues trigger type iii hypersensitivity reactions type iv hypersensitivity also known cellmediated delayed type hypersensitivity usually takes two three days develop type iv reactions involved many autoimmune infectious diseases may also involve contact dermatitis poison ivy reactions mediated cells monocytes macrophages
mechanisms evolution
likely multicomponent adaptive immune system arose first vertebrates invertebrates generate lymphocytes antibodybased humoral response many species however utilize mechanisms appear precursors aspects vertebrate immunity immune systems appear even structurally simple forms life bacteria using unique defense mechanism called restriction modification system protect viral pathogens called bacteriophages prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity system uses crispr sequences retain fragments genomes phage come contact past allows block virus replication form rna interference offensive elements immune systems also present unicellular eukaryotes studies roles defense
pattern recognition receptors proteins used nearly organisms identify molecules associated pathogens antimicrobial peptides called defensins evolutionarily conserved component innate immune response found animals plants represent main form invertebrate systemic immunity complement system phagocytic cells also used forms invertebrate life ribonucleases rna interference pathway conserved across eukaryotes thought play role immune response viruses
unlike animals plants lack phagocytic cells many plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals sent plant individual plant cells respond molecules associated pathogens known pathogenassociated molecular patterns pamps part plant becomes infected plant produces localized hypersensitive response whereby cells site infection undergo rapid apoptosis prevent spread disease parts plant systemic acquired resistance sar type defensive response used plants renders entire plant resistant particular infectious agent rna silencing mechanisms particularly important systemic response block virus replication
tumor immunology
another important role immune system identify eliminate tumors called immune surveillance transformed cells tumors express antigens found normal cells immune system antigens appear foreign presence causes immune cells attack transformed tumor cells antigens expressed tumors several sources derived oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus causes cervical cancer others organisms proteins occur low levels normal cells reach high levels tumor cells one example enzyme called tyrosinase expressed high levels transforms certain skin cells eg melanocytes tumors called melanomas third possible source tumor antigens proteins normally important regulating cell growth survival commonly mutate cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes
main response immune system tumors destroy abnormal cells using killer cells sometimes assistance helper cells tumor antigens presented mhc class molecules similar way viral antigens allows killer cells recognize tumor cell abnormal nk cells also kill tumorous cells similar way especially tumor cells fewer mhc class molecules surface normal common phenomenon tumors sometimes antibodies generated tumor cells allowing destruction complement system
clearly tumors evade immune system go become cancers tumor cells often reduced number mhc class molecules surface thus avoiding detection killer cells tumor cells also release products inhibit immune response example secreting cytokine tgf suppresses activity macrophages lymphocytes addition immunological tolerance may develop tumor antigens immune system longer attacks tumor cells
paradoxically macrophages promote tumor growth tumor cells send cytokines attract macrophages generate cytokines growth factors nurture tumor development addition combination hypoxia tumor cytokine produced macrophages induces tumor cells decrease production protein blocks metastasis thereby assists spread cancer cells
physiological regulation
hormones act immunomodulators altering sensitivity immune system example female sex hormones known immunostimulators adaptive innate immune responses autoimmune diseases lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially onset often coincides puberty contrast male sex hormones testosterone seem immunosuppressive hormones appear regulate immune system well notably prolactin growth hormone vitamin d
tcell encounters foreign pathogen extends vitamin d receptor essentially signaling device allows tcell bind active form vitamin d steroid hormone calcitriol tcells symbiotic relationship vitamin d tcell extend vitamin d receptor essence asking bind steroid hormone version vitamin d calcitriol tcell expresses gene cypb gene responsible converting prehormone version vitamin d calcidiol steroid hormone version calcitriol binding calcitriol tcells perform intended function immune system cells known express cypb thus activate vitamin d calcidiol dendritic cells keratinocytes macrophages
conjectured progressive decline hormone levels age partially responsible weakened immune responses aging individuals conversely hormones regulated immune system notably thyroid hormone activity agerelated decline immune function also related decreasing vitamin d levels elderly people age two things happen negatively affect vitamin d levels first stay indoors due decreased activity levels means get less sun therefore produce less cholecalciferol via uvb radiation second person ages skin becomes less adept producing vitamin d
sleep rest
immune system affected sleep rest sleep deprivation detrimental immune function complex feedback loops involving cytokines interleukin tumor necrosis factor produced response infection appear also play role regulation nonrapid eye movement rem sleep thus immune response infection may result changes sleep cycle including increase slowwave sleep relative rem sleep
suffering sleep deprivation active immunizations may diminished effect may result lower antibody production lower immune response would noted wellrested individual additionally proteins nfil shown closely intertwined tcell differentiation circadian rhythms affected disturbance natural light dark cycles instances sleep deprivation shift work etc result disruptions lead increase chronic conditions heart disease chronic pain asthma
addition negative consequences sleep deprivation sleep intertwined circadian system shown strong regulatory effects immunological functions affecting innate adaptive immunity first early slowwavesleep stage sudden drop blood levels cortisol epinephrine norepinephrine induce increased blood levels hormones leptin pituitary growth hormone prolactin signals induce proinflammatory state production proinflammatory cytokines interleukin interleukin tnfalpha ifngamma cytokines stimulate immune functions immune cells activation proliferation differentiation time undifferentiated less differentiated like nave central memory cells peak ie time slowly evolving adaptive immune response addition effects milieu hormones produced time leptin pituitary growth hormone prolactin support interactions apcs tcells shift thth cytokine balance towards one supports th increase overall th cell proliferation nave cell migration lymph nodes milieu also thought support formation longlasting immune memory initiation th immune responses
contrast wake periods differentiated effector cells cytotoxic natural killer cells ctls cytotoxic lymphocytes peak order elicit effective response intruding pathogens well awake active times antiinflammatory molecules cortisol catecholamines peak two theories proinflammatory state reserved sleep time first inflammation would cause serious cognitive physical impairments occur wake times second inflammation may occur sleep times due presence melatonin inflammation causes great deal oxidative stress presence melatonin sleep times could actively counteract free radical production time
nutrition diet
overnutrition associated diseases diabetes obesity known affect immune function moderate malnutrition well certain specific trace mineral nutrient deficiencies also compromise immune response
foods rich certain fatty acids may foster healthy immune system likewise fetal undernourishment cause lifelong impairment immune system
manipulation medicine
immune response manipulated suppress unwanted responses resulting autoimmunity allergy transplant rejection stimulate protective responses pathogens largely elude immune system see immunization cancer
immunosuppression
immunosuppressive drugs used control autoimmune disorders inflammation excessive tissue damage occurs prevent transplant rejection organ transplant
antiinflammatory drugs often used control effects inflammation glucocorticoids powerful drugs however drugs many undesirable side effects central obesity hyperglycemia osteoporosis use must tightly controlled lower doses antiinflammatory drugs often used conjunction cytotoxic immunosuppressive drugs methotrexate azathioprine cytotoxic drugs inhibit immune response killing dividing cells activated cells however killing indiscriminate constantly dividing cells organs affected causes toxic side effects immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin prevent cells responding signals correctly inhibiting signal transduction pathways

predicting immunogenicity
larger drugs da provoke neutralizing immune response particularly drugs administered repeatedly larger doses limits effectiveness drugs based larger peptides proteins typically larger da cases drug immunogenic may coadministered immunogenic compound sometimes case taxol computational methods developed predict immunogenicity peptides proteins particularly useful designing therapeutic antibodies assessing likely virulence mutations viral coat particles validation proposed peptidebased drug treatments early techniques relied mainly observation hydrophilic amino acids overrepresented epitope regions hydrophobic amino acids however recent developments rely machine learning techniques using databases existing known epitopes usually wellstudied virus proteins training set publicly accessible database established cataloguing epitopes pathogens known recognizable b cells emerging field bioinformaticsbased studies immunogenicity referred immunoinformatics immunoproteomics study large sets proteins proteomics involved immune response
manipulation pathogens
success pathogen depends ability elude host immune responses therefore pathogens evolved several methods allow successfully infect host evading detection destruction immune system bacteria often overcome physical barriers secreting enzymes digest barrier example using type ii secretion system alternatively using type iii secretion system may insert hollow tube host cell providing direct route proteins move pathogen host proteins often used shut host defenses
evasion strategy used several pathogens avoid innate immune system hide within cells host also called intracellular pathogenesis pathogen spends lifecycle inside host cells shielded direct contact immune cells antibodies complement examples intracellular pathogens include viruses food poisoning bacterium salmonella eukaryotic parasites cause malaria plasmodium falciparum leishmaniasis leishmania spp bacteria mycobacterium tuberculosis live inside protective capsule prevents lysis complement many pathogens secrete compounds diminish misdirect hosts immune response bacteria form biofilms protect cells proteins immune system biofilms present many successful infections eg chronic pseudomonas aeruginosa burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic cystic fibrosis bacteria generate surface proteins bind antibodies rendering ineffective examples include streptococcus protein g staphylococcus aureus protein peptostreptococcus magnus protein l
mechanisms used evade adaptive immune system complicated simplest approach rapidly change nonessential epitopes amino acids andor sugars surface pathogen keeping essential epitopes concealed called antigenic variation example hiv mutates rapidly proteins viral envelope essential entry host target cell constantly changing frequent changes antigens may explain failures vaccines directed virus parasite trypanosoma brucei uses similar strategy constantly switching one type surface protein another allowing stay one step ahead antibody response masking antigens host molecules another common strategy avoiding detection immune system hiv envelope covers virion formed outermost membrane host cell selfcloaked viruses make difficult immune system identify nonself structures
