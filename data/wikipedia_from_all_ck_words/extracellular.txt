in cell biology molecular biology and related fields the word extracellular (or sometimes extracellular space) means outside the cell this space is usually taken to be outside the plasma membranes and occupied by fluid the term is used in contrast to intracellular (inside the cell)
according to the gene ontology database the extracellular space is a cellular component defined as that part of a multicellular organism outside the cells proper usually taken to be outside the plasma membranes and occupied by fluid for multicellular organisms the extracellular space refers to everything outside a cell but still within the organism (excluding the extracellular matrix) gene products from a multi-cellular organism that are secreted from a cell into the interstitial fluid or blood can therefore be annotated to this term
the composition of the extracellular space includes metabolites ions various proteins and non-protein substances (i.e dna rna lipids microbial products etc.) that might affect cellular function for example hormones growth factors cytokines and chemokines act by travelling the extracellular space towards biochemical receptors on cells other proteins that are active outside the cell are various enzymes including digestive enzymes (trypsin pepsin) extracellular proteinases (matrix metalloproteinases adamtss cathepsins) and antioxidant enzymes (extracellular superoxide dismutase) often proteins present in the extracellular space are stored outside the cells by attaching to various extracellular matrix components (collagens proteoglycans etc.) in addition extracellular matrix proteolytic products are also present in the extracellular space especially in tissues undergoing remodelling [2]
