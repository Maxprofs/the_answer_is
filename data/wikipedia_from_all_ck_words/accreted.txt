when his father insists on meeting the dean bartleby hires sherman's peculiar uncle ben lewis (lewis black) a former harmon college professor to play that role and he leases an abandoned psychiatric hospital adjacent to harmon college and renovates it to look like a college campus their plan backfires when the website which automatically accepts any applicant enrolls hundreds of other rejected students bartleby realizes that these people have nowhere else to go so he lets them believe that the school is real a place where they will finally feel accepted despite objections from his friends after a visit to harmon disenchants him with traditional college life he has the students create their own curricula students write down what they want to learn on a giant whiteboard ranging from the culinary arts sculpting meditations to unusual courses such as psychokinesis a subject one eccentric kid (jeremy howard) wishes to study
bartleby creates a school newspaper (the s.h.i.t rag) invents a mascot (the s.h.i.t sandwiches) and throws themed parties meanwhile the dean of harmon college richard van horne (anthony heald) makes plans to construct the van horne gateway a park-like verdant buffer zone adjacent to the college that the dean hopes will keep knowledge in and ignorance out he dispatches hoyt ambrose (travis van winkle) to free up the nearby properties but when bartleby refuses to relinquish the lease for the south harmon property hoyt sets to work trying to reveal the college as a fake the dispute turns personal since bartleby has been vying for the affections of hoyt's ex-girlfriend monica moreland (blake lively) hoyt exposes south harmon as a fake institution through sherman who is attempting to join hoyt's fraternity as a legacy but is constantly humiliated and abused by them after debasing sherman once more the fraternity violently forces him to hand over all the files he has created for south harmon
hoyt contacts all the students parents and with van horne he reveals the school as a sham soon after the school is forced to close but sherman who has had enough with harmon college's corruption files for accreditation on behalf of south harmon giving bartleby a chance to make his college legitimate at the subsequent state of ohio educational accreditation hearing bartleby makes an impassioned speech about the failures of conventional education and the importance of following one's own passions convincing the board to grant his school a one-year probationary accreditation to test his new system thus foiling van horne's plans the college reopens with more students enrolling including sherman and monica in addition bartleby finally earns the approval of his father who is proud that his son now owns a college as the film closes van horne walks to his car in the parking lot only to watch it suddenly explode bartleby watches in astonishment as the eccentric student from earlier makes his interest in psychokinetic explosion a reality
