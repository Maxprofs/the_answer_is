== musical style ==
lil b and music critics refer to his rapping style as based a word that lil b also uses to describe a positive tolerant lifestyle based is a reclaimed word as described by lil b in complex
based means being yourself not being scared of what people think about you not being afraid to do what you wanna do being positive when i was younger based was a negative term that meant like dopehead or basehead people used to make fun of me they was like youre based theyd use it as a negative and what i did was turn that negative into a positive i started embracing it like yeah im based i made it mine i embedded it in my head based is positive
=== rapping technique ===
slate columnist jonah weiner labeled him as one of a growing number of weird-o emcees calling him a brilliantly warped post-lil wayne deconstructionist from the bay area
pitchfork contributor mike powell notes that
the issue isn't whether or not lil b fans are indentured to the idea of ironic fulfillment, but whether or not lil b haters are indentured to outmoded ideas of artistic credibility he's not making art designed to last the test of time so holding him to the standards of timeless art is pointless ultimately my take with lil b is that he keeps the price of entry to his world so low that complaining about him is a waste of energy he offers himself to his audience for nothinggiving him nothing shouldn't be hard furthermore i don't even know what ironic means in the context of lil b if he really didn't think that the world was a beautiful and endlessly amusing place where does he find the energy to keep rapping about it for free
musical critic willy staley described lil b's work as variegated because it ranges from critical parodies of the hip-hop genre to half new age half spoken word he further notes that lil b draws from a large variety of genres especially those not commonly used by other rappers in an interview with staley lil b agrees with this analysis saying i can do swag od but then my favorite musical artist right now could be antony and the johnsons that's the difference between me and these other rappers and other musical artists in general.
