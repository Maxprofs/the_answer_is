a fell (from old norse fell fjall mountain") is a high and barren landscape feature such as a mountain range or moor-covered hills the term is most often employed in fennoscandia the isle of man parts of northern england and scotland
== etymology ==
the english word fell comes from old norse fell fjall (both forms existed) it is cognate with icelandic fjall/fell faroese fjall danish fjeld swedish fjll and norwegian fjell all referring to mountains rising above the alpine tree line
== british isles ==
in northern england especially in the lake district and in the pennine dales the word fell originally referred to an area of uncultivated high ground used as common grazing this meaning is found in the names of various breeds of livestock bred for life on the uplands such as rough fell sheep and fell ponies it is also found in many place names across the north of england often attached to the name of a community thus seathwaite fell for example would be the common grazing land used by the farmers of seathwaite the fellgate marks the road from a settlement onto the fell (see photograph for example)
fell can refer to any one of the mountains and hills of the lake district and the pennine dales this meaning tends to overlap with the previous one especially where place names are concerned in particular names that originally referred to grazing areas tend to be applied to hilltops as is the case with the aforementioned seathwaite fell in other cases the reverse is true for instance the name of wetherlam in the coniston fells though understood to refer to the mountain as a whole strictly speaking refers to the summit the slopes have names such as tilberthwaite high fell low fell and above beck fells
in northern england there is a lord of the fells this ancient aristocratic title being associated with the lords of bowland
groups of cairns are a common feature on many fells often marking the summit there are fine examples on wild boar fell in mallerstang dale cumbria and on nine standards rigg just outside kirkby stephen cumbria
as the most mountainous region of england the lake district is the area most closely associated with the sport of fell running which takes its name from the fells of the district fellwalking is also the term used locally for the activity known in the rest of great britain as hillwalking
the word fell also enjoys limited use in scotland with for example the campsie fells in central scotland to the north east of glasgow one of the most famous examples of the use of the word fell in scotland is goat fell the highest point on the isle of arran criffel and the nearby long fell in galloway may be seen from the northern lake district of england peel fell in the kielder forest is situated on the border between the scottish borders to the north and the english county of northumberland to the south
== fennoscandia ==
in norway fjell in common usage is generally interpreted as simply a summit of greater altitude than a hill which leads to a great deal of local variation in what is defined as a fjell professor of geography at the university of bergen anders lundeberg has summed up the problem by stating that there simply is no fixed and unambiguous definition of fjell'. ivar aasen defined fjell as a tall berg primarily referring to a berg that reaches an altitude where trees don't grow lower berg are referred to as berg s (hill ridge) or hei (moor heathland) the fixed expression til fjells refers to mountains (or uplands) as a collective rather than a specific location or specific summit according to ivar aasen berg refers to cliffs bedrock and notable elevations of the surface underpinned by bedrock berg also refers to the substance of bedrock for all practical purposes fjell can be translated as mountain and the norwegian language has no other commonly used word for mountain
in sweden fjll refers to any mountain or upland high enough that forest will not naturally survive at the top in effect a mountain tundra fjll is primarily used to describe mountains in the nordic countries but also more generally to describe mountains shaped by massive ice sheets primarily in arctic and subarctic regions
in finnish the mountains characteristic of the region of lapland are called tunturi (plural tunturit) in finnish the geographical term vuori is used for mountains recently uplifted and with jagged terrain featuring permanent glaciers while tunturi refers to the old highly eroded gently shaped terrain without glaciers as found in finland (also tunturi is used to refer to treeless plains at high altitudes in far north regions as well.) they are round inselbergs rising from the otherwise flat surroundings the mountains in finnish lapland reach heights of up to 400 and 800 metres where the upper reaches are above the tree line those that do not reach the tree line on the other hand are mostly referred to as vaara the mountains in finnish lapland form vestiges of the karelides mountains formed two billion years ago the term tunturi is a loan from sami compare kildin sami tndr which means uplands treeless mountain tract from this expression the word tundra is borrowed as well
=== frfjll ===
the term frfjll (literally fore-fell") is used in sweden to denote mountainous zones lower and less dissected than the fell proper on the other hand its more pronounced relief its often higher amount of plateaux and its coherent valley systems distinguishes the frfjll also from the undulating hilly terrain (bergkullsterrng) and the plains with residual hills (bergkullsltt) generally the frfjll do not surpass 1000 m.a.s.l as a geomorphic unit the frfjll extends across sweden as a 650 km long and 40 to 80 km broad belt from dalarna in the south to norrbotten in the north
