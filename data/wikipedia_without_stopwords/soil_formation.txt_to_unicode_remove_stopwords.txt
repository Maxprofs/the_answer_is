pedogenesis greek pedo pedon meaning soil earth genesis meaning origin birth science study processes lead formation soil soil evolution first explored russian geologist vasily dokuchaev socalled grandfather soil science determined soil formed time consequence climatic mineral biological processes demonstrated using soil forming equation
soil fc pm o time
c climate pm parent material o biological processes
swiss scientist hans jenny expanded vasily dokuchaev equation adding topographic relief factor separating biological processes fauna flora coming equation
soil fc pm r o v time
c climate pm parent material r relieftopology o fauna v flora
pedogenesis branch pedology whose aspects include soil morphology classification taxonomy soils distribution nature present past soil geography paleopedology
climate
climate regulates soil formation soils developed areas higher rainfall warmth rate chemical weathering increases times temperature increases degrees celsius climate also affects organisms present affecting soil chemically physically movement roots
organisms
organisms living soil form distinct soil types coniferous forests acidic leaf litter form soils classed inceptisols mixed deciduous forests leave larger layer humus changing elements either leeched accumulated soil thereby forming soils classed alfisols prairies high humus accumulation creating dark thick horizon characteristic mollisols
example three species land snails genus euchondrus negev desert noted eating lichens growing surface limestone rocks slabs endolithic lichens disrupt eat limestone grazing results weathering stones subsequent formation soil significant effect region total population snails estimated process metric ton per hectare per year limestone negev desert
parent material
rock soil formed called parent material main types aeolian sediments glacial till glacial outwash alluvium lacustrine sediments residual parent material coral bedrock
pedologists see soil formation soil properties function regional climate biota topography parent material time variables
examples
variety mechanisms contribute soil formation including siltation erosion overpressure lakebed succession specific example evolution soils prehistoric lake beds makgadikgadi pans kalahari desert change ancient river course led millennia salinity buildup formation calcretes silcretes
