on the origin of the influencing machine in schizophrenia is a highly influential article written by psychoanalyst viktor tausk it was first published in 1919 in the journal internationale zeitschrift fr psychoanalyse and then after translation into english by dorian feigenbaum in the psychoanalytic quarterly in 1933
the paper describes tausk's observations and psychoanalytic interpretation of a type of paranoid delusion that occurs in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia the delusion often involves their being influenced by a diabolical machine just outside the technical understanding of the victim that influences them from afar it was typically believed to be operated by a group of people who were persecuting the individual whom tausk suggested were to the best of my knowledge almost exclusively of the male sex and the persecutors predominantly physicians by whom the patient has been treated
these delusions are known in contemporary psychiatry as passivity delusions or passivity phenomena and are listed among kurt schneider's first rank symptoms which are thought to be particularly diagnostic of schizophrenia and still form some of the core diagnostic criteria
== extract from the articleedit ==
the schizophrenic influencing machine is a machine of mystical nature the patients are able to give only vague hints of its construction it consists of boxes cranks levers wheels buttons wires batteries and the like patients endeavor to discover the construction of the apparatus by means of their technical knowledge and it appears that with the progressive popularization of the sciences all the forces known to technology are utilized to explain the functioning of the apparatus all the discoveries of mankind however are regarded as inadequate to explain the marvelous powers of this machine by which the patients feel themselves persecuted
the main effects of the influencing machine are the following
1 it makes the patient see pictures when this is the case the machine is generally a magic lantern or cinematograph the pictures are seen on a single plane on walls or windowpanes and unlike typical visual hallucinations are not three-dimensional
2 it produces as well as removes thoughts and feelings by means of waves or rays or mysterious forces which the patient's knowledge of physics is inadequate to explain in such cases the machine is often called a suggestion-apparatus. its construction cannot be explained but its function consists in the transmission or draining off of thoughts and feelings by one or several persecutors
3 it produces motor phenomena in the body erections and seminal emissions that are intended to deprive the patient of his male potency and weaken him this is accomplished either by means of suggestion or by air-currents electricity magnetism or x-rays
4 it creates sensations that in part cannot be described because they are strange to the patient himself and that in part are sensed as electrical magnetic or due to air-currents
5 it is also responsible for other occurrences in the patient's body such as cutaneous eruptions abscesses or other pathological processes
== the influencing machine in literature and filmedit ==
tausk's paper has been highly influential within both his own field of psychoanalysis and outside it has in more recent years been used in literary theory to explain characters de-centeredness from their surroundings and their psychical collapse into psychosis furthermore the idea of a great alien machine taking over the human race has become a stock element of certain types of popular fiction

the most well-known example of the influencing machine delusion is that of james tilly matthews who believed he was being controlled body and mind by a device called the air loom. matthews was a tea merchant and political activist before he was admitted to the bethlem royal hospital (bedlam) after shouting treason in the british house of commons in 1797 he was a prolific writer and artist and described the air loom in great detail his descriptions were published as a book entitled illustrations of madness exhibiting a singular case of insanity and a no less remarkable difference in medical opinions developing the nature of an assailment and the manner of working events with a description of tortures experienced by bomb-bursting lobster-cracking and lengthening the brain embellished with a curious plate
in the novel one flew over the cuckoo's nest the narrator chief bromden believes that the psychiatric ward in which he is committed (including the staff) is a machine in the service of a broader combine, his name for technological society this portrayal has been described as one of the best-known fictional examples of an influencing machine patient
four arguments for the elimination of television by jerry mander (1978) activist jerry mander's book argues for the complete removal of television from our lives because of its ill effects mander gives the example of tausk's influencing machine as being a parallel for television doubtless you have noticed that this influencing machine sounds an awful lot like television  in any event there is no question that television does what the schizophrenic fantasy says it does it places in our minds images of reality which are outside our experience the pictures come in the form of rays from a box they cause changes in feeling and  utter confusion as to what is real and what is not.
