the galpagos islands (official name archipilago de coln other spanish name islas galpagos spanish pronunciation [islas galapaos]) are an archipelago of volcanic islands distributed on either side of the equator in the pacific ocean 906 km (563 mi) west of continental ecuador of which they are a part
the galpagos islands and their surrounding waters form the galpagos province of ecuador the galpagos national park and the galpagos marine reserve the principal language on the islands is spanish the islands have a population of slightly over 25,000
the islands are famed for their vast number of endemic species and were studied by charles darwin during the voyage of the beagle his observations and collections contributed to the inception of darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection
the first recorded visit to the islands happened by chance in 1535 when the bishop of panam fray toms de berlanga went to peru to arbitrate in a dispute between francisco pizarro and diego de almagro de berlanga was blown off course though he eventually returned to the spanish empire and described the conditions of the islands and the animals that inhabited them the group of islands was shown and named in abraham ortelius's atlas published in 1570 the first crude map of the islands was made in 1684 by the buccaneer ambrose cowley who named the individual islands after some of his fellow pirates or after british royalty and noblemen these names were used in the authoritative navigation charts of the islands prepared during the beagle survey under captain robert fitzroy and in darwin's popular book the voyage of the beagle the new republic of ecuador took the islands from spanish ownership in 1832 and subsequently gave them official spanish names the older names remained in use in english language publications including herman melville's the encantadas of 1854
== physical geography ==
the islands are located in the eastern pacific ocean 973 km (605 mi) off the west coast of south america the closest land mass is that of mainland ecuador the country to which they belong 926 km/500 nmi to the east
the islands are found at the coordinates 140'n136's 8916'9201'w straddling the equator islands in the chain are located in both the northern and southern hemispheres with volcn wolf and volcn ecuador on isla isabela being directly on the equator espaola island the southernmost islet of the archipelago and darwin island the northernmost one are spread out over a distance of 220 km (137 mi) the international hydrographic organization (iho) considers them wholly within the south pacific ocean however the galpagos archipelago consists of 7,880 km2 (3,040 sq mi) of land spread over 45,000 km2 (17,000 sq mi) of ocean the largest of the islands isabela measures 2,250 sq mi/5,827 km2 and makes up close to three-quarters of the total land area of the galpagos volcn wolf on isabela is the highest point with an elevation of 1,707 m (5,600 ft) above sea level
the group consists of 18 main islands 3 smaller islands and 107 rocks and islets the islands are located at the galapagos triple junction the archipelago is located on the nazca plate (a tectonic plate) which is moving east/southeast diving under the south american plate at a rate of about 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) per year it is also atop the galapagos hotspot a place where the earth's crust is being melted from below by a mantle plume creating volcanoes the first islands formed here at least 8 million and possibly up to 90 million years ago
while the older islands have disappeared below the sea as they moved away from the mantle plume the youngest islands isabela and fernandina are still being formed with the most recent volcanic eruption in april 2009 where lava from the volcanic island fernandina started flowing both towards the island's shoreline and into the center caldera

nameless island a small islet used mostly for scuba diving
roca redonda (galpagos) an islet approximately 25 km (16 mi) northwest of isabela herman melville devotes the third and fourth sketches of the encantadas to describing this islet (which he calls rock rodondo") and the view from it
== climate ==
although located on the equator the humboldt current brings cold water to the islands causing frequent drizzles during most of the year the weather is periodically influenced by the el nio events which occur about every 37 years and are characterized by warm sea surface temperatures a rise in sea level greater wave action and a depletion of nutrients in the water
during the season known as the garua (june to november) the temperature by the sea is 22 c (72 f) a steady and cold wind blows from south and southeast frequent drizzles (garuas) last most of the day and dense fog conceals the islands during the warm season (december to may) the average sea and air temperature rises to 25 c (77 f) there is no wind at all there are sporadic though strong rains and the sun shines
weather changes as altitude increases in the large islands temperature decreases gradually with altitude while precipitation increases due to the condensation of moisture in clouds on the slopes there is a large range in precipitation from one place to another not only with altitude but also depending on the location of the islands and also with the seasons
the following table corresponding to the wet 1969 shows the variation of precipitation in different places of santa cruz island
the precipitation also depends on the geographical location during march 1969 the precipitation over charles darwin station on the southern coast of santa cruz was 249.0 mm (9.80 in) while on baltra island the precipitation during the same month was only 137.6 mm (5.42 in) this is because baltra is located behind santa cruz with respect to the prevailing southerly winds so most of the moisture gets precipitated in the santa cruz highlands
there are significant changes in precipitation from one year to another too at charles darwin station the precipitation during march 1969 was 249.0 mm (9.80 in) but during march 1970 it was only 1.2 mm (0.05 in)
on the larger islands the pattern of generally wet highlands and drier lowlands impacts the flora the vegetation in the highlands tends to be green and lush with tropical woodland in places the lowland areas tend to have arid and semi-arid vegetation with many thorny shrubs and cacti and almost bare volcanic rock elsewhere
== history ==
european discovery of the galpagos islands occurred when spaniard fray toms de berlanga the fourth bishop of panama sailed to peru to settle a dispute between francisco pizarro and his lieutenants de berlanga's vessel drifted off course when the winds diminished and his party reached the islands on 10 march 1535 according to a 1952 study by thor heyerdahl and arne skjlsvold remains of potsherds and other artifacts from several sites on the islands suggest visitation by south american peoples prior to the arrival of the spanish however no remains of graves ceremonial vessels and constructions have ever been found suggesting no permanent settlement occurred at the time
the galpagos islands first appeared on the maps of gerardus mercator and abraham ortelius in about 1570 the islands were named insulae de los galopegos (islands of the tortoises) in reference to the giant tortoises found there
the first english captain to visit the galpagos islands was richard hawkins in 1593 until the early 19th century the archipelago was often used as a hideout by mostly english pirates who pilfered spanish galleons carrying gold and silver from south america to spain
in 1793 james colnett described the flora and fauna of galpagos and suggested the islands could be used as base for the whalers operating in the pacific ocean he drew the first accurate navigation charts of the islands whalers and maritime fur traders killed and captured thousands of the galpagos tortoises to extract their fat the tortoises could be kept on board ship as a means of providing of fresh protein as these animals could survive for several months on board without any food or water the hunting of the tortoises was responsible for greatly diminishing and in some cases eliminating certain species along with whalers came the fur-seal hunters who brought the population of this animal close to extinction
the first known permanent human resident on galapagos was patrick watkins an irish sailor who was marooned on the island floreana from 1807 to 1809 according to later accounts watkins managed to survive by hunting growing vegetables and trading with visiting whalers before finally stealing an open boat and navigating to guayaquil
in 1818 the nantucket whaleship globe under captain george washington gardner discovered a mother lode of sperm whales some thousand miles west of the south american coast approximately at the equator he returned to nantucket in 1820 with more than 2000 barrels of sperm whale oil and the news of his discovery this led to an influx of whaleships to exploit the new whaling ground and the galapagos islands became a frequent stop for the whalers both before and after visiting what came to be known as the offshore grounds this led to the establishment in the galapagos islands of a kind of unofficial post office where whaleships stopped to pick up and drop off letters as well as for purposes of provisioning and repairs
in october 1820 the whaleship essex out of nantucket stopped at the galapagos for these purposes on its way to the offshore grounds on what was then known as charles island while most of the crew were hunting tortoises one crewmember english boatsteerer thomas chappel for reasons still unclear lit a fire which quickly burned out of control some of the tortoise hunters had a narrow escape and had to run a gauntlet of fire to get back to the ship soon almost the entire island was in flames crewmembers reported that after a day of sailing away they could still see the flames against the horizon one crewmember who returned to the galapagos several years afterward described the entire island as still a blackened wasteland
ecuador annexed the galpagos islands on 12 february 1832 naming them the archipelago of ecuador this new name added to several names that had been and are still used to refer to the archipelago the first governor of galpagos general jos de villamil brought a group of convicts to populate the island of floreana and in october 1832 some artisans and farmers joined them
the voyage of the beagle brought the survey ship hms beagle under captain robert fitzroy to the galpagos on 15 september 1835 to survey approaches to harbours the captain and others on board including his companion the young naturalist charles darwin made observations on the geology and biology on chatham charles albemarle and james islands before they left on 20 october to continue on their round-the-world expedition primarily a geologist at the time darwin was impressed by the quantity of volcanic craters they saw later referring to the archipelago as that land of craters. his study of several volcanic formations over the 5 weeks he stayed in the islands led to several important geological discoveries including the first correct explanation for how volcanic tuff is formed darwin noticed the mockingbirds differed between islands though he thought the birds now known as darwin's finches were unrelated to each other and did not bother labelling them by island nicholas lawson acting governor of galpagos for the republic of the equator met them on charles island and as they walked to the prison colony told darwin the tortoises differed from island to island towards the end of the voyage darwin speculated that the distribution of the mockingbirds and the tortoises might undermine the stability of species when specimens of birds were analysed on his return to england it was found that many apparently different kinds of birds were species of finches which were unique to islands these facts were crucial in darwin's development of his theory of natural selection explaining evolution which was presented in the origin of species
jos valdizn and manuel julin cobos tried a new colonization beginning the exploitation of a type of lichen found in the islands (roccella portentosa) used as a coloring agent after the assassination of valdizn by some of his workers cobos brought from the continent a group of more than a hundred workers to san cristbal island and tried his luck at planting sugar cane he ruled his plantation with an iron hand which led to his assassination in 1904 in 1897 antonio gil began another plantation on isabela island over the course of a whole year from september 1904 an expedition of the academy of sciences of california led by rollo beck stayed in the galpagos collecting scientific material on geology entomology ornithology botany zoology and herpetology another expedition from that academy was done in 1932 (templeton crocker expedition) to collect insects fish shells fossils birds and plants
for a long time during the early 1900s and at least through 1929 a cash strapped ecuador had reached out for potential buyers of the islands to alleviate financial troubles at home the us had repeatedly expressed its interest in buying the islands for military use as they were positioned strategically guarding the panama canal
in 1920s and 1930s a small wave of european settlers arrived in the islands there occurred a series of unsolved disappearances on the island of floreana in the 1930s among the largely european expatriate residents at the time the galapagos affair satan came to eden is a 2013 feature-length documentary film about the same ecuadorian laws provided all colonists with the possibility of receiving twenty hectares each of free land the right to maintain their citizenship freedom from taxation for the first ten years in galapagos and the right to hunt and fish freely on all uninhabited islands where they might settle the first european colonists to arrive were norwegians who settled briefly on floreana before moving on to san cristobal and santa cruz a few years later other colonists from europe america and ecuador started arriving on the islands seeking a simpler life descendants of the norwegian kastdalen family and the german angermeyer still live on the islands
during world war ii ecuador authorized the united states to establish a naval base in baltra island and radar stations in other strategic locations baltra was established as a united states army air force base baltra was given the name of beta base and along with alpha base in nicaragua and gamma base in salinas (continental ecuador) the crews stationed at baltra and the aforementioned establish a geographic triangle of protection in charge of patrolling the pacific for enemy submarines as well as provided protection for the panama canal after the war the facilities were given to the government of ecuador today the island continues as an official ecuadorian military base the foundations and other remains of the us base can still be seen as one crosses the island in 1946 a penal colony was established in isabela island but it was suspended in 1959
the galpagos became a national park in 1959 and tourism started in the 1960s imposing several restrictions upon the human population already living on the island however opportunities in the tourism fishing and farming industries attracted a mass of poor fishermen and farmers from mainland ecuador in the 1990s and 2000s violent confrontations between parts of the local population and the galapagos national park service occurred including capturing and killing giant tortoises and holding staff of the galapagos national park service hostage to obtain higher annual sea cucumber quotas
== politics ==
the islands are administered by a provincial government it was made a province by presidential decree by president guillermo rodrguez lara on 18 february 1973 the province is divided into cantons each covering certain islands the capital is puerto baquerizo moreno
== demographics ==
the galpagos islands is one of the few places in the world without an indigenous population the largest ethnic group is composed of ecuadorian mestizos the mixed descendants of spanish colonists and indigenous native americans who arrived mainly in the last century from the continental part of ecuador there is also a large number of whites mostly of spanish descent some descendants of the early european and american colonists on the islands also still remain on the islands
in 1959 approximately 1,000 to 2,000 people called the islands their home in 1972 a census in the archipelago recorded a population of 3,488 by the 1980s this number had risen to more than 15,000 people and 2006 estimates place the population around 25,000 people in 2010 there were 25,124 people in the galapagos
five of the islands are inhabited baltra floreana isabela san cristobal and santa cruz
== travel ==
options for flying into the galapagos are limited to two islands san cristobal and baltra private aircraft must use baltra as it is the airport equipped with overnight plane accommodations seymour airport on baltra was recently renovated (20122013) to accommodate larger planes
until 1969 the only way to visit was on a private or chartered vessel there was no regular air service until forrest nelson's hotel galapagos began the first organized tours in april 1969 soon other travel companies brought in tour ships and yachts and local fishermen began converting their wooden boats for rudimentary cruising with guests these vessels were the main source of overnight accommodations in the galapagos today there are about 85 yachts and ships equipped for overnight guests in 2006 the baltra military governed island was opened up to limited overnight camping baltra also requires permits by the military government for overnight stays on the beach other inhabited islands also allow camping on the beaches designated as recreational use to the locals all of these camping permits are limited to number of people and nights with most nights not to exceed three
land based hotels are opening on the inhabited islands of san cristobal santa cruz floreana and isabela by 2012 more than half the visitors to galapagos made their tours using day boats and these small hotels restaurants easy access and economy make this an attractive travel option the cruise tours are still the best way to see all the complex environment and wildlife of the islands
there are only 116 visitor sites in the galapagos 54 land sites and 62 scuba-diving or snorkeling sites small groups are allowed to visit in 24 hour shifts only to limit impact on the area all groups are accompanied by licensed guides
== environmental protection policy ==
though the first protective legislation for the galpagos was enacted in 1930 and supplemented in 1936 it was not until the late 1950s that positive action was taken to control what was happening to the native flora and fauna in 1955 the international union for the conservation of nature organized a fact-finding mission to the galpagos two years later in 1957 unesco in cooperation with the government of ecuador sent another expedition to study the conservation situation and choose a site for a research station
in 1959 the centenary year of charles darwin's publication of the origin of species the ecuadorian government declared 97.5% of the archipelago's land area a national park excepting areas already colonised the charles darwin foundation (cdf) was founded the same year the core responsibility of cdf an international nongovernmental organization (ngo) constituted in belgium is to conduct research and provide the research findings to the government for effective management of galpagos cdf's research efforts began with the establishment of the charles darwin research station on santa cruz island in 1964 during the early years conservation programs such as eradication of introduced species and protection of native species were carried out by research station personnel now much of that work is accomplished by the galapagos national park service using the research findings and methodologies developed by cdf
in 1986 the 70,000 square kilometers (27,000 sq mi.) of ocean surrounding the islands was declared a marine reserve second in size only to australia's great barrier reef in 1990 the archipelago became a whale sanctuary unesco recognised the islands in 1978 as a world heritage site and in 1985 as a biosphere reserve this was later extended in december 2001 to include the marine reserve in july 2010 the world heritage committee agreed to remove the galapagos islands from its list of precious sites endangered by environmental threats or overuse
noteworthy species include
galpagos land iguanas conolophus spp
marine iguana amblyrhynchus cristatus the only iguana feeding in the sea
galpagos tortoise (galpagos giant tortoise) chelonoidis nigra known as galpago in spanish it gave the name to the islands
galpagos green turtle chelonia mydas agassisi a subspecies of the green turtle
sea cucumbers the cause of environmental battles with fishermen over quotas of this expensive asian delicacy
flightless cormorant phalacrocorax harrisi
great frigatebird and magnificent frigatebird
blue-footed booby sula nebouxii popular among visitors for their large blue feet which they show off in courtship
galpagos penguin spheniscus mendiculus the only living tropical penguin
waved albatross phoebastria irrorata the only living tropical albatross
galpagos hawk buteo galapagoensis the islands main scavenger and environmental police
four endemic species of galpagos mockingbirds the first species darwin noticed to vary from island to island
thirteen endemic species of tanagers popularly called darwin's finches among them is the sharp-beaked ground finch geospiza difficilis septentrionalis which is sometimes called the vampire finch for its blood-sucking habits and the tool-using woodpecker finch camarhynchus pallidus
galpagos sea lions zalophus wollebaeki closely related to the california sea lion but smaller
=== environmental threats ===
introduced plants and animals such as feral goats cats and cattle brought accidentally or willingly to the islands by humans represent the main threat to galpagos quick to reproduce and with no natural predators these alien species decimated the habitats of native species the native animals lacking natural predators on the islands are defenseless to introduced predators
some of the most harmful introduced plants are the guayaba or guava (psidium guajava) avocado (persea americana) cascarilla (cinchona pubescens) balsa (ochroma pyramidale) hill raspberry (rubus niveus) various citrus (orange grapefruit lemon) floripondio higuerilla (ricinus communis) trees and the elephant grass pennisetum purpureum these plants have invaded large areas and eliminated endemic species in the humid zones of san cristobal floreana isabela and santa cruz also these harmful plants are just a few of introduced species on the galpagos islands there are over 700 introduced plant species today there are only 500 native and endemic species this difference is creating a major problem for the islands and the natural species that inhabit them
many species were introduced to the galpagos by pirates thor heyerdahl quoted documents that mention the viceroy of peru knowing that british pirates ate the goats that they themselves had released in the islands ordered dogs to be freed there to eliminate the goats also when colonization of floreana by jos de villamil failed he ordered the goats donkeys cattle and other animals from the farms in floreana be transferred to other islands for the purpose of later colonization
non-native goats pigs dogs rats cats mice sheep horses donkeys cows poultry ants cockroaches and some parasites inhabit the islands today dogs and cats attack the tame birds and destroy the nests of birds land tortoises and marine turtles they sometimes kill small galpagos tortoises and iguanas pigs are even more harmful covering larger areas and destroying the nests of tortoises turtles and iguanas as well as eating the animals native food pigs also knock down vegetation in their search for roots and insects this problem abounds in cerro azul volcano and isabela and in santiago pigs may be the cause of the disappearance of the land iguanas that were so abundant when darwin visited the black rat (rattus rattus) attacks small galpagos tortoises when they leave the nest so in pinzn they stopped the reproduction for a period of more than 50 years only adults were found on that island also where the black rat is found the endemic rat has disappeared cattle and donkeys eat all the available vegetation and compete with native species for the scarce water in 1959 fishermen introduced one male and two female goats to pinta island by 1973 the national park service estimated the population of goats to be over 30,000 individuals goats were also introduced to marchena in 1967 and to rabida in 1971 a recent goat eradication program however has cleared most of the goat population from isabela
the fast-growing poultry industry on the inhabited islands has been cause for concern from local conservationists who fear domestic birds could introduce disease into the endemic wild bird populations
the galpagos marine sanctuary is under threat from a host of illegal fishing activities in addition to other problems of development the most pressing threat to the marine reserve comes from local mainland and foreign fishing targeting marine life illegally within the reserve such as sharks (hammerheads and other species) for their fins and the harvest of sea cucumbers out of season development threatens both land and sea species the growth of both the tourism industry and local populations fuelled by high birth rates and illegal immigration threaten the wildlife of the archipelago the grounding of the oil tanker jessica in 2001 and the subsequent oil spill brought this threat to world attention
currently the rapidly growing problems including tourism and a human population explosion are further destroying habitats travel companies conservation organizations and other groups have formed igtoa (international galapagos tour operators association) that is dedicated to preserve and protect the galapagos islands for future generations of travellers membership is only open to organizations but welcomes the involvement of individuals
in 2007 unesco put the galpagos islands on their list of world heritage in danger because of threats posed by invasive species unbridled tourism and overfishing on 29 july 2010 the world heritage committee decided to remove the galapagos islands from the list because the committee found significant progress had been made by ecuador in addressing these problems
on 28 january 2008 galapagos national park official victor carrion announced 53 sea lions (13 pups 25 youngsters 9 males and 6 females) were killed at the galapagos islands nature reserve on pinta with their heads caved in in 2001 poachers killed 35 male sea lions
the galpagos islands were short-listed as a candidate to be one of the new7wonders of nature by the new7wonders of nature foundation as of february 2009 the archipelago was ranked first in group b the category for islands
the islands biodiversity is under threat from several sources the human population is growing at an unsustainable rate of 8% per year (1995) introduced species have caused damage and in 1996 a us$5 million five-year eradication plan commenced in an attempt to rid the islands of introduced species such as goats rats deer and donkeys el nio has adversely affected the marine ecosystem and in january 2001 an oil slick from a stranded tanker threatened the islands but winds and shifting ocean currents helped disperse the oil before much damage was done the 199798 el nio adversely affected wildlife in the waters surrounding the islands as the waters were 5 c (9 f) warmer than normal corals and barnacles suffered hammerhead sharks were driven away and most of the island's seabirds failed to breed 199798 the mortality rate of marine iguanas rose as the green algae they feed on was replaced by inedible red algae during the 198283 el nio 70% of the marine iguanas starved to death because of this
