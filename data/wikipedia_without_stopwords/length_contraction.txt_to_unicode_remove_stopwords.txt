length contraction postulated george fitzgerald hendrik antoon lorentz explain negative outcome michelsonmorley experiment rescue hypothesis stationary aether lorentzfitzgerald contraction hypothesis although fitzgerald lorentz alluded fact electrostatic fields motion deformed heavisideellipsoid oliver heaviside derived deformation electromagnetic theory considered ad hoc hypothesis time sufficient reason assume intermolecular forces behave way electromagnetic ones joseph larmor developed model forces considered electromagnetic origin length contraction appeared direct consequence model yet shown henri poincar electromagnetic forces alone cannot explain electrons stability introduce another ad hoc hypothesis nonelectric binding forces poincar stresses ensure electrons stability give dynamical explanation length contraction thus hide motion stationary aether
eventually albert einstein first completely remove ad hoc character contraction hypothesis demonstrating contraction require motion supposed aether could explained using special relativity changed notions space time simultaneity einsteins view elaborated hermann minkowski demonstrated geometrical interpretation relativistic effects introducing concept fourdimensional spacetime
basis relativityedit
first necessary carefully consider methods measuring lengths resting moving objects object simply means distance endpoints always mutually rest ie rest inertial frame reference relative velocity observer measuring instruments observed object zero proper length object simply determined directly superposing measuring rod however relative velocity one proceed follows
observer installs row clocks either synchronized exchanging light signals according poincareinstein synchronization b slow clock transport one clock transported along row clocks limit vanishing transport velocity synchronization process finished object moved along clock row every clock stores exact time left right end object passes observer look position clock stored time left end object passing clock b right end object passing time clear distance ab equal length moving object using method definition simultaneity crucial measuring length moving objects
another method use clock indicating proper time traveling one endpoint rod time measured clocks rods rest frame length rod computed multiplying travel time velocity thus rods rest frame clocks rest frame
newtonian mechanics simultaneity time duration absolute therefore methods lead equality yet relativity theory constancy light velocity inertial frames connection relativity simultaneity time dilation destroys equality first method observer one frame claims measured objects endpoints simultaneously observers inertial frames argue objects endpoints measured simultaneously second method times equal due time dilation resulting different lengths
deviation measurements inertial frames given formulas lorentz transformation time dilation see derivation turns proper length remains unchanged always denotes greatest length object yet length object measured another inertial frame shorter proper length contraction occurs line motion represented following relation relative velocity speed light

vladimir variak asserted length contraction real according lorentz apparent subjective according einstein einstein replied
author unjustifiably stated difference lorentzs view mine concerning physical facts question whether length contraction really exists misleading doesnt really exist far doesnt exist comoving observer though really exists ie way could demonstrated principle physical means noncomoving observer
einstein also argued paper length contraction simply product arbitrary definitions concerning way clock regulations length measurements performed presented following thought experiment let ab ab endpoints two rods proper length let move opposite directions speed respect resting coordinate xaxis endpoints aa meet point bb meet point b points marked axis einstein pointed length ab shorter ab ab also demonstrated one rods brought rest respect axis

derivationedit
lorentz transformationedit
length contraction derived lorentz transformation several ways
moving length knownedit
inertial reference frame shall denote endpoints object motion frame length measured according convention determining simultaneous positions endpoints proper length object shall calculated using lorentz transformation transforming time coordinates results different times problematic object rest matter endpoints measured therefore transformation spatial coordinates suffices gives
since setting proper length given
respect measured length contracted
according relativity principle objects rest contracted well exchanging signs primes symmetrically follows
thus contracted length measured given
proper length knownedit
conversely object rests proper length known simultaneity measurements objects endpoints considered another frame object constantly changes position therefore spatial temporal coordinates must transformed
results nonsimultaneous differences
order obtain simultaneous positions endpoints distance traveled second endpoint must subtracted
moving length contracted likewise preceding calculation gives symmetric result object rest
time dilationedit
length contraction also derived time dilation according rate single moving clock indicating proper time lower respect two synchronized resting clocks indicating time dilation experimentally confirmed multiple times represented relation
suppose rod proper length rest clock rest moving along respective travel times clock rods endpoints given thus inserting time dilation formula ratio lengths
therefore length measured given
effect moving clock indicates lower travel time due time dilation interpreted due length contraction moving rod likewise clock rest rod procedure would give
