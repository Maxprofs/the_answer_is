zoology (/zoldi/ zoh-ol-luh-jee) or animal biology is the branch of biology that relates to the animal kingdom including the structure embryology evolution classification habits and distribution of all animals both living and extinct and how they interact with their ecosystems the term is derived from ancient greek  zon i.e animal and  logos i.e knowledge study
== historyedit ==
=== ancient history to darwinedit ===
the history of zoology traces the study of the animal kingdom from ancient to modern times although the concept of zoology as a single coherent field arose much later the zoological sciences emerged from natural history reaching back to the works of aristotle and galen in the ancient greco-roman world this ancient work was further developed in the middle ages by muslim physicians and scholars such as albertus magnus during the renaissance and early modern period zoological thought was revolutionized in europe by a renewed interest in empiricism and the discovery of many novel organisms prominent in this movement were vesalius and william harvey who used experimentation and careful observation in physiology and naturalists such as carl linnaeus and buffon who began to classify the diversity of life and the fossil record as well as the development and behavior of organisms microscopy revealed the previously unknown world of microorganisms laying the groundwork for cell theory the growing importance of natural theology partly a response to the rise of mechanical philosophy encouraged the growth of natural history (although it entrenched the argument from design)
over the 18th and 19th centuries zoology became an increasingly professional scientific discipline explorer-naturalists such as alexander von humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment and the ways this relationship depends on geography laying the foundations for biogeography ecology and ethology naturalists began to reject essentialism and consider the importance of extinction and the mutability of species cell theory provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life
=== post-darwinedit ===
these developments as well as the results from embryology and paleontology were synthesized in charles darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection in 1859 darwin placed the theory of organic evolution on a new footing by his discovery of a process by which organic evolution can occur and provided observational evidence that it had done so
darwin gave new direction to morphology and physiology by uniting them in a common biological theory the theory of organic evolution the result was a reconstruction of the classification of animals upon a genealogical basis fresh investigation of the development of animals and early attempts to determine their genetic relationships the end of the 19th century saw the fall of spontaneous generation and the rise of the germ theory of disease though the mechanism of inheritance remained a mystery in the early 20th century the rediscovery of mendel's work led to the rapid development of genetics by thomas hunt morgan and his students and by the 1930s the combination of population genetics and natural selection in the neo-darwinian synthesis

=== structuraledit ===
cell biology studies the structural and physiological properties of cells including their behavior interactions and environment this is done on both the microscopic and molecular levels for single-celled organisms such as bacteria as well as the specialized cells in multicellular organisms such as humans understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences the similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology
anatomy considers the forms of macroscopic structures such as organs and organ systems it focuses on how organs and organ systems work together in the bodies of humans and animals in addition to how they work independently anatomy and cell biology are two studies that are closely related and can be categorized under structural studies
=== physiologicaledit ===
physiology studies the mechanical physical and biochemical processes of living organisms by attempting to understand how all of the structures function as a whole the theme of structure to function is central to biology physiological studies have traditionally been divided into plant physiology and animal physiology but some principles of physiology are universal no matter what particular organism is being studied for example what is learned about the physiology of yeast cells can also apply to human cells the field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of human physiology to non-human species physiology studies how for example nervous immune endocrine respiratory and circulatory systems function and interact
=== evolutionaryedit ===
evolutionary research is concerned with the origin and descent of species as well as their change over time and includes scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines for example it generally involves scientists who have special training in particular organisms such as mammalogy ornithology herpetology or entomology but use those organisms as systems to answer general questions about evolution
evolutionary biology is partly based on paleontology which uses the fossil record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution and partly on the developments in areas such as population genetics and evolutionary theory in the 1980s developmental biology re-entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary developmental biology related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology are phylogenetics systematics and taxonomy
=== classificationedit ===
scientific classification in zoology is a method by which zoologists group and categorize organisms by biological type such as genus or species biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy modern biological classification has its root in the work of carl linnaeus who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics these groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the darwinian principle of common descent molecular phylogenetics which uses dna sequences as data has driven many recent revisions and is likely to continue to do so biological classification belongs to the science of zoological systematics
many scientists now consider the five-kingdom system outdated modern alternative classification systems generally start with the three-domain system archaea (originally archaebacteria) bacteria (originally eubacteria) eukaryota (including protists fungi plants and animals) these domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not as well as differences in the chemical composition of the cell exteriors
further each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified the order is domain kingdom phylum class order family genus species the scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species for example humans are listed as homo sapiens homo is the genus and sapiens the specific epithet both of them combined make up the species name when writing the scientific name of an organism it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase additionally the entire term may be italicized or underlined
the dominant classification system is called the linnaean taxonomy it includes ranks and binomial nomenclature the classification taxonomy and nomenclature of zoological organisms is administered by the international code of zoological nomenclature and international code of nomenclature of bacteria for animals and bacteria respectively the classification of viruses viroids prions and all other sub-viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics is conducted by the international code of virus classification and nomenclature however several other viral classification systems do exist
a merging draft biocode was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature in these areas but has yet to be formally adopted the biocode draft has received little attention since 1997 its originally planned implementation date of january 1 2000 has passed unnoticed however a 2004 paper concerning the cyanobacteria does advocate a future adoption of a biocode and interim steps consisting of reducing the differences between the codes the international code of virus classification and nomenclature (icvcn) remains outside the biocode
=== ethologyedit ===
ethology is the scientific and objective study of animal behavior under natural conditions as opposed to behaviourism which focuses on behavioral response studies in a laboratory setting ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection in one sense the first modern ethologist was charles darwin whose book the expression of the emotions in man and animals influenced many future ethologists
=== biogeographyedit ===
biogeography studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the earth focusing on topics like plate tectonics climate change dispersal and migration and cladistics the creation of this study is widely accredited to alfred russel wallace a british biologist who had some of his work jointly published with charles darwin
== branches of zoologyedit ==
although the study of animal life is ancient its scientific incarnation is relatively modern this mirrors the transition from natural history to biology at the start of the 19th century since hunter and cuvier comparative anatomical study has been associated with morphography shapins the modern areas of zoological investigation anatomy physiology histology embryology teratology and ethology modern zoology first arose in german and british universities in britain thomas henry huxley was a prominent figure his ideas were centered on the morphology of animals many consider him the greatest comparative anatomist of the latter half of the 19th century similar to hunter his courses were composed of lectures and laboratory practical classes in contrast to the previous format of lectures only
gradually zoology expanded beyond huxley's comparative anatomy to include the following sub-disciplines
zoography also known as descriptive zoology describes animals and their habitats
comparative anatomy studies the structure of animals
animal physiology
behavioral ecology
ethology studies animal behavior
invertebrate zoology
vertebrate zoology
soil zoology
comparative zoology
the various taxonomically oriented disciplines such as mammalogy herpetology ornithology and entomology identify and classify species and study the structures and mechanisms specific to those groups
related fields
evolutionary biology development of both animals and plants is considered in the articles on evolution population genetics heredity variation mendelism reproduction
molecular biology studies the common genetic and developmental mechanisms of animals and plants
palaeontology
systematics cladistics phylogenetics phylogeography biogeography and taxonomy classify and group species via common descent and regional associations
