physical changes changes affecting form chemical substance chemical composition physical changes used separate mixtures component compounds usually used separate compounds chemical elements simpler compounds
physical changes occur objects substances undergo change change chemical composition contrasts concept chemical change composition substance changes one substances combine break form new substances general physical change reversible using physical means example salt dissolved water recovered allowing water evaporate
physical change involves change physical properties examples physical properties include melting transition gas change strength change durability changes crystal form textural change shape size color volume density
example physical change process tempering steel form knife blade steel blank repeatedly heated hammered changes hardness steel flexibility ability maintain sharp edge
many physical changes also involve rearrangement atoms noticeably formation crystals many chemical changes irreversible many physical changes reversible reversibility certain criterion classification although chemical changes may recognized indication odor color change production gas every one indicators result physical change
examples
heating cooling
many elements compounds change solids liquids liquids gases heated reverse cooled substances iodine carbon dioxide go directly solid gas process called sublimation
magnetism
ferromagnetic materials become magnetic process reversible affect chemical composition
crystalisation
many elements compounds form crystals carbon form several different forms including diamond graphite graphene fullerenes including buckminsterfullerene
crystals metals major effect physical properties metal including strength ductility crystal type shape size altered physical hammering rolling heat
mixtures
mixtures substances soluble usually readily separated physical sieving settlement however mixtures different properties individual components one familiar example mixture fine sand water used make sandcastles neither sand water make sandcastle using physical properties surface tension mixture behaves different way
solutions
solutions salts compounds sugars separated evaporation others mixtures volatile liquids low molecular weight alcohols separated fractional distillation
alloys
mixing different metal elements known alloying brass alloy copper zinc separating individual metals alloy difficult may require chemical processing making alloy example physical change cannot readily undone physical means alloys mercury one metals separated physically melting alloy boiling mercury vapour
