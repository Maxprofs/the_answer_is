waxes class chemical compounds malleable near ambient temperatures also type lipid characteristically melt c f give low viscosity liquid waxes insoluble water soluble organic nonpolar solvents waxes organic compounds synthetically naturally occurring
types
waxes organic compounds characteristically consist long alkyl chains natural waxes may contain esters carboxylic acids long chain alcohols mixtures substituted hydrocarbons long chain fatty acids primary alcohols synthetic waxes longchain hydrocarbons lacking functional groups
plant animal waxes
waxes synthesized many plants animals animal origin typically consist wax esters derived variety carboxylic acids fatty alcohols waxes plant origin characteristic mixtures unesterified hydrocarbons may predominate esters composition depends species also geographic location organism mixtures naturally produced waxes softer melt lower temperatures pure components
animal waxes
commonly known animal wax beeswax insects secrete waxes major component beeswax used constructing honeycombs ester myricyl palmitate ester triacontanol palmitic acid melting point c spermaceti occurs large amounts head oil sperm whale one main constituents cetyl palmitate another ester fatty acid fatty alcohol lanolin wax obtained wool consisting esters sterols
plant waxes
plants secrete waxes surface cuticles way control evaporation wettability hydration epicuticular waxes plants mixtures substituted longchain aliphatic hydrocarbons containing alkanes alkyl esters fatty acids primary secondary alcohols diols ketones aldehydes commercial perspective important plant wax carnauba wax hard wax obtained brazilian palm copernicia prunifera containing ester myricyl cerotate many applications confectionery food coatings car furniture polish floss coating surfboard wax uses specialized vegetable waxes include candelilla wax ouricury wax
petroleum derived waxes
although many natural waxes contain esters paraffin waxes hydrocarbons mixtures alkanes usually homologous series chain lengths materials represent significant fraction petroleum refined vacuum distillation paraffin waxes mixtures saturated n iso alkanes naphthenes alkyl naphthenesubstituted aromatic compounds degree branching important influence properties millions tons paraffin waxes produced annually used foods chewing gum cheese wrapping candles cosmetics nonstick waterproofing coatings polishes
montan wax
montan wax fossilized wax extracted coal lignite hard reflecting high concentration saturated fatty acids alcohols although dark brown smelly purified bleached give commercially useful products
polyethylene related derivatives
waxes obtained cracking polyethylene c products formula chnh n ranges million kilogramsy consumed
uses
waxes mainly consumed industrially components complex formulations often coatings main use polyethylene polypropylene waxes formulation colourants plastics waxes confer matting effects wear resistance paints polyethylene waxes incorporated inks form dispersions decrease friction employed release agents also used slip agents eg furniture corrosion resistance
candles
waxes hard fats tallow used make candles used lighting decoration
wax products
waxes used finishes coatings wood products beeswax frequently used lubricant drawer slides wood wood contact occurs
uses
sealing wax used close important documents middle ages wax tablets used writing surfaces different types wax middle ages namely four kinds wax ragusan montenegro byzantine bulgarian ordinary waxes spain poland riga unrefined waxes colored waxes red white green waxes used make wax paper impregnating coating paper card waterproof make resistant staining modify surface properties waxes also used shoe polishes wood polishes automotive polishes mold release agents mold making coating many cheeses waterproof leather fabric wax used since antiquity temporary removable model lostwax casting gold silver materials
wax colorful pigments added used medium encaustic painting used today manufacture crayons colored pencils carbon paper used making duplicate typewritten documents coated carbon black suspended wax typically montan wax largely superseded photocopiers computer printers another context lipstick mascara blends various fats waxes colored pigments beeswax lanolin used cosmetics ski wax used skiing snowboarding also sports surfing skateboarding often use wax enhance performance
waxes considered foodsafe used coat wooden cutting boards items come contact food beeswax coloured synthetic wax used decorate easter eggs ukraine poland czech republic paraffin wax used making chocolate covered bonbons wax also used wax bullets used simulation aids
