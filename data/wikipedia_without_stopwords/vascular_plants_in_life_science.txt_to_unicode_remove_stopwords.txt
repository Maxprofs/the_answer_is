definition
plants one two groups living things traditionally divided animals division goes back least far aristotle bc bc distinguished plants generally move animals often mobile catch food much later linnaeus created basis modern system scientific classification two groups became kingdoms vegetabilia later metaphyta plantae animalia also called metazoa since become clear plant kingdom originally defined included several unrelated groups fungi several groups algae removed new kingdoms however organisms still often considered plants particularly popular contexts
outside formal scientific contexts term plant implies association certain traits multicellular possessing cellulose ability carry photosynthesis
current definitions plantae
name plantae plant applied specific group organisms taxon usually refers one four concepts least inclusive four groupings
another way looking relationships different groups called plants cladogram shows evolutionary relationships evolutionary history plants yet completely settled one accepted relationship three groups described shown called plants bold
way groups green algae combined named varies considerably authors
algae
algae comprise several different groups organisms produce energy photosynthesis reason included plant kingdom past conspicuous among algae seaweeds multicellular algae may roughly resemble land plants classified among brown red green algae algal groups also includes various microscopic singlecelled organisms good evidence algal groups arose independently separate nonphotosynthetic ancestors result many groups algae longer classified within plant kingdom defined
viridiplantae green plants green algae land plants form clade group consisting descendants common ancestor exceptions among green algae green plants many features common including cell walls containing cellulose chloroplasts containing chlorophylls b food stores form starch undergo closed mitosis without centrioles typically mitochondria flat cristae chloroplasts green plants surrounded two membranes suggesting originated directly endosymbiotic cyanobacteria
two additional groups rhodophyta red algae glaucophyta glaucophyte algae also chloroplasts appear derived directly endosymbiotic cyanobacteria although differ pigments used photosynthesis different colour three groups together generally believed single common origin classified together taxon archaeplastida whose name implies chloroplasts plastids members taxon derived single ancient endosymbiotic event broadest modern definition plants
contrast algae eg brown algaediatoms haptophytes dinoflagellates euglenids different pigments also chloroplasts three four surrounding membranes close relatives archaeplastida presumably acquired chloroplasts separately ingested symbiotic green red algae thus included even broadest modern definition plant kingdom although past
green plants viridiplantae traditionally divided green algae including stoneworts land plants however known land plants evolved within group green algae green algae paraphyletic group ie group excludes descendants common ancestor paraphyletic groups generally avoided modern classifications recent treatments viridiplantae divided two clades chlorophyta streptophyta charophyta
chlorophyta name also used green algae sister group group land plants evolved species mainly marine organisms unicellular multicellular latter include sea lettuce ulva
group within viridiplantae mainly freshwater terrestrial streptophyta consist land plants together charophyta consisting several groups green algae desmids stoneworts names used differently eg streptophyta mean group excludes land plants charophyta stoneworts alone stoneworts plus land plants streptophyte algae either unicellular form multicellular filaments branched unbranched genus spirogyra filamentous streptophyte alga familiar many often used teaching one organisms responsible algal scum pondowners dislike freshwater stoneworts strongly resemble land plants believed closest relatives growing underwater consist central stalk whorls branchlets giving superficial resemblance horsetails species genus equisetum true land plants
fungi
classification fungi controversial quite recently history biology linnaeus original classification placed fungi within plantae since unquestionably animals minerals alternatives later developments microbiology th century ernst haeckel felt another kingdom required classify newly discovered microorganisms introduction new kingdom protista addition plantae animalia led uncertainty whether fungi truly best placed plantae whether ought reclassified protists haeckel found difficult decide solution found whereby robert whittaker proposed creation kingdom fungi molecular evidence since shown recent common ancestor concestor fungi probably similar animalia plantae kingdom
whittakers original reclassification based fundamental difference nutrition fungi plantae unlike plants generally gain carbon photosynthesis called autotrophs fungi generally obtain carbon breaking absorbing surrounding materials called heterotrophic saprotrophs addition substructure multicellular fungi different plants taking form many chitinous microscopic strands called hyphae may subdivided cells may form syncytium containing many eukaryotic nuclei fruiting bodies mushrooms familiar example reproductive structures fungi unlike structures produced plants
diversity
table shows species count estimates different green plant viridiplantae divisions suggests species living viridiplantae flowering plants note different sources different dates necessarily comparable like species counts subject degree uncertainty cases

embryophytes
plants likely familiar us multicellular land plants called embryophytes embryophytes include vascular plants ferns conifers flowering plants also include bryophytes mosses liverworts common
plants eukaryotic cells cell walls composed cellulose obtain energy photosynthesis using light water carbon dioxide synthesize food three hundred plant species photosynthesize parasites species photosynthetic plants plants distinguished green algae represent mode photosynthetic life similar kind modern plants believed evolved specialized reproductive organs protected nonreproductive tissues
bryophytes first appeared early paleozoic survive moisture available significant periods although species desiccationtolerant species bryophytes remain small throughout lifecycle involves alternation two generations haploid stage called gametophyte diploid stage called sporophyte bryophytes sporophyte always unbranched remains nutritionally dependent parent gametophyte bryophytes ability secrete cuticle outer surface waxy layer confers resistant desiccation mosses hornworts cuticle usually produced sporophyte stomata absent liverworts occur sporangia mosses hornworts allowing gas exchange controlling water loss
vascular plants first appeared silurian period devonian diversified spread many different terrestrial environments developed number adaptations allowed spread increasingly arid places notably vascular tissues xylem phloem transport water food throughout organism root systems capable obtaining soil water nutrients also evolved devonian modern vascular plants sporophyte typically large branched nutritionally independent longlived increasing evidence paleozoic gametophytes complex sporophytes gametophytes vascular plant groups evolved become reduced size prominence life cycle
first seed plants pteridosperms seed ferns extinct appeared devonian diversified carboniferous microgametophyte reduced pollen megagametophyte remains inside megasporangium attached parent plant megasporangium invested protective layer called integument known ovule fertilisation means sperm deposited pollen grains embryo develops inside ovule integument becomes seed coat ovule develops seed seed plants survive reproduce extremely arid conditions dependent free water movement sperm development free living gametophytes

various forms parasitism also fairly common among plants semiparasitic mistletoe merely takes nutrients host still photosynthetic leaves fully parasitic broomrape toothwort acquire nutrients connections roots plants chlorophyll plants known mycoheterotrophs parasitize mycorrhizal fungi hence act epiparasites plants
many plants epiphytes meaning grow plants usually trees without parasitizing epiphytes may indirectly harm host plant intercepting mineral nutrients light host would otherwise receive weight large numbers epiphytes may break tree limbs hemiepiphytes like strangler fig begin epiphytes eventually set roots overpower kill host many orchids bromeliads ferns mosses often grow epiphytes bromeliad epiphytes accumulate water leaf axils form phytotelmata may contain complex aquatic food webs
