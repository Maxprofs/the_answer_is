granite /rnt/ is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture granites can be predominantly white pink or gray in color depending on their mineralogy the word granite comes from the latin granum a grain in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock by definition granite is an igneous rock with at least 20% quartz and up to 65% alkali feldspar by volume
the term granitic means granite-like and is applied to granite and a group of intrusive igneous rocks with similar textures and slight variations in composition and origin these rocks mainly consist of feldspar quartz mica and amphibole minerals which form an interlocking somewhat equigranular matrix of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker biotite mica and amphibole (often hornblende) peppering the lighter color minerals occasionally some individual crystals (phenocrysts) are larger than the groundmass in which case the texture is known as porphyritic a granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite porphyry granitoid is a general descriptive field term for lighter-colored coarse-grained igneous rocks petrographic examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids
granite differs from granodiorite in that at least 35% of the feldspar in granite is alkali feldspar as opposed to plagioclase it is the potassium feldspar that gives many granites a distinctive pink color the extrusive igneous rock equivalent of granite is rhyolite
granite is nearly always massive (lacking any internal structures) hard and tough and therefore it has gained widespread use throughout human history and more recently as a construction stone the average density of granite is between 2.65 and 2.75 g/cm3 its compressive strength usually lies above 200 mpa and its viscosity near stp is 36 1019 pas
the melting temperature of dry granite at ambient pressure is 12151260 c (22192300 f) it is strongly reduced in the presence of water down to 650 c at a few kbar pressure
granite has poor primary permeability but strong secondary permeability
the rock known as black granite is usually gabbro
== mineralogyedit ==
granite is classified according to the qapf diagram for coarse grained plutonic rocks and is named according to the percentage of quartz alkali feldspar (orthoclase sanidine or microcline) and plagioclase feldspar on the a-q-p half of the diagram true granite according to modern petrologic convention contains both plagioclase and alkali feldspars when a granitoid is devoid or nearly devoid of plagioclase the rock is referred to as alkali feldspar granite when a granitoid contains less than 10% orthoclase it is called tonalite pyroxene and amphibole are common in tonalite a granite containing both muscovite and biotite micas is called a binary or two-mica granite two-mica granites are typically high in potassium and low in plagioclase and are usually s-type granites or a-type granites

== occurrenceedit ==
outcrops of granite tend to form tors and rounded massifs granites sometimes occur in circular depressions surrounded by a range of hills formed by the metamorphic aureole or hornfels granite is usually found in the continental plates of the earth's crust
granite is currently known to exist only on earth where it forms a major part of the continental crust granite often occurs as relatively small less than 100 km stock masses (stocks) and in batholiths that are often associated with orogenic mountain ranges small dikes of granitic composition called aplites are often associated with the margins of granitic intrusions in some locations very coarse-grained pegmatite masses occur with granite
granite has been intruded into the crust of the earth during all geologic periods although much of it is of precambrian age granitic rock is widely distributed throughout the continental crust and is the most abundant basement rock that underlies the relatively thin sedimentary veneer of the continents
== originedit ==
granite has a felsic composition and is more common in recent geologic time in contrast to earth's ultramafic ancient igneous history felsic rocks are less dense than mafic and ultramafic rocks and thus they tend to escape subduction whereas basaltic or gabbroic rocks tend to sink into the mantle beneath the granitic rocks of the continental cratons therefore granitic rocks form the basement of all land continents
=== geochemical originsedit ===
granitoids are a ubiquitous component of the crust they have crystallized from magmas that have compositions at or near a eutectic point (or a temperature minimum on a cotectic curve) magmas will evolve to the eutectic because of igneous differentiation or because they represent low degrees of partial melting fractional crystallisation serves to reduce a melt in iron magnesium titanium calcium and sodium and enrich the melt in potassium and silicon alkali feldspar (rich in potassium) and quartz (sio2) are two of the defining constituents of granite
this process operates regardless of the origin of the parental magma to the granite and regardless of its chemistry however the composition and origin of the magma that differentiates into granite leaves certain geochemical and mineral evidence as to what the granite's parental rock was the final mineralogy texture and chemical composition of a granite is often distinctive as to its origin for instance a granite that is formed from melted sediments may have more alkali feldspar whereas a granite derived from melted basalt may be richer in plagioclase feldspar it is on this basis that the modern alphabet classification schemes are based granite has a slow cooling process which forms larger crystals
=== chappell & white classification systemedit ===
the letter-based chappell & white classification system was proposed initially to divide granites into i-type granite (or igneous protolith) granite and s-type or sedimentary protolith granite both of these types of granite are formed by the melting of high grade metamorphic rocks either other granite or intrusive mafic rocks or buried sediment respectively
m-type or mantle derived granite was later proposed to cover those granites that were clearly sourced from crystallized mafic magmas generally sourced from the mantle these are rare because it is difficult to turn basalt into granite via fractional crystallisation
a-type or anorogenic granites are formed above volcanic hot spot activity and have a peculiar mineralogy and geochemistry these granites are formed by the melting of the lower crust under conditions that are usually extremely dry the rhyolites of the yellowstone caldera are examples of volcanic equivalents of a-type granite
h-type or hybrid granites are formed following a mixing of two granitic magmas from different sources e.g m-type and s-type
=== granitizationedit ===
an old and largely discounted theory granitization states that granite is formed in place by extreme metasomatism by fluids bringing in elements e.g potassium and removing others e.g calcium to transform the metamorphic rock into a granite this was supposed to occur across a migrating front the production of granite by metamorphic heat is difficult but is observed to occur in certain amphibolite and granulite terrains in-situ granitisation or melting by metamorphism is difficult to recognise except where leucosome and melanosome textures are present in migmatites once a metamorphic rock is melted it is no longer a metamorphic rock and is a magma so these rocks are seen as a transitional between the two but are not technically granite as they do not actually intrude into other rocks in all cases melting of solid rock requires high temperature and also water or other volatiles which act as a catalyst by lowering the solidus temperature of the rock
== ascent and emplacementedit ==
the ascent and emplacement of large volumes of granite within the upper continental crust is a source of much debate amongst geologists there is a lack of field evidence for any proposed mechanisms so hypotheses are predominantly based upon experimental data there are two major hypotheses for the ascent of magma through the crust
stokes diapir
fracture propagation
of these two mechanisms stokes diapir was favoured for many years in the absence of a reasonable alternative the basic idea is that magma will rise through the crust as a single mass through buoyancy as it rises it heats the wall rocks causing them to behave as a power-law fluid and thus flow around the pluton allowing it to pass rapidly and without major heat loss this is entirely feasible in the warm ductile lower crust where rocks are easily deformed but runs into problems in the upper crust which is far colder and more brittle rocks there do not deform so easily for magma to rise as a pluton it would expend far too much energy in heating wall rocks thus cooling and solidifying before reaching higher levels within the crust
fracture propagation is the mechanism preferred by many geologists as it largely eliminates the major problems of moving a huge mass of magma through cold brittle crust magma rises instead in small channels along self-propagating dykes which form along new or pre-existing fracture or fault systems and networks of active shear zones as these narrow conduits open the first magma to enter solidifies and provides a form of insulation for later magma
granitic magma must make room for itself or be intruded into other rocks in order to form an intrusion and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how large batholiths have been emplaced
stoping where the granite cracks the wall rocks and pushes upwards as it removes blocks of the overlying crust
assimilation where the granite melts its way up into the crust and removes overlying material in this way
inflation where the granite body inflates under pressure and is injected into position
most geologists today accept that a combination of these phenomena can be used to explain granite intrusions and that not all granites can be explained entirely by one or another mechanism
== weatheringedit ==
physical weathering occurs on a large scale in the form of exfoliation joints which are the result of granite expanding and fracturing as pressure is relieved when overlying material is removed by erosion or other processes
chemical weathering of granite occurs when dilute carbonic acid and other acids present in rain and soil waters readily alter feldspar in a process called hydrolysis as demonstrated in the following reaction this causes potassium feldspar to form kaolinite with potassium ions bicarbonate and silica in solution as byproducts an endproduct of granite weathering is grus which is often made up of coarse-grained fragments of disintegrated granite
2 kalsi3o8 + 2 h2co3 + 9 h2o => al2si2o5(oh)4 + 4 h4sio4 + 2 k+ + 2 hco3
climatic variations also influence the weathering rate of granites for about two thousand years the relief engravings on cleopatra's needle obelisk had survived the arid conditions of its origin prior to its transfer to london within two hundred years the red granite has drastically deteriorated in the damp and polluted air
== natural radiationedit ==
granite is a natural source of radiation like most natural stones however some granites have been reported to have higher radioactivity thereby raising some concerns about their safety
potassium-40 is a radioactive isotope of weak emission and a constituent of alkali feldspar which in turn is a common component of granitic rocks more abundant in alkali feldspar granite and syenites naturally a geiger counter should register this low effect
some granites contain around 10 to 20 parts per million (ppm) of uranium by contrast more mafic rocks such as tonalite gabbro and diorite have 1 to 5 ppm uranium and limestones and sedimentary rocks usually have equally low amounts many large granite plutons are sources for palaeochannel-hosted or roll front uranium ore deposits where the uranium washes into the sediments from the granite uplands and associated often highly radioactive pegmatites cellars and basements sunk into soils over granite can become a trap for radon gas which is formed by the decay of uranium radon gas poses significant health concerns and is the number two cause of lung cancer in the us behind smoking
thorium occurs in all granites as well conway granite has been noted for its relatively high thorium concentration of 566 ppm
there is some concern that materials sold as granite countertops or as building material may be hazardous to health dan steck of st johns university has stated that approximately 5% of all granite will be of concern with the caveat that only a tiny percentage of the tens of thousands of granite slab types have been tested various resources from national geological survey organizations are accessible online to assist in assessing the risk factors in granite country and design rules relating in particular to preventing accumulation of radon gas in enclosed basements and dwellings
a study of granite countertops was done (initiated and paid for by the marble institute of america) in november 2008 by national health and engineering inc of usa in this test all of the 39 full size granite slabs that were measured for the study showed radiation levels well below the european union safety standards (section 4.1.1.1 of the national health and engineering study) and radon emission levels well below the average outdoor radon concentrations in the us

==== sculpture and memorialsedit ====
in some areas granite is used for gravestones and memorials granite is a hard stone and requires skill to carve by hand until the early 18th century in the western world granite could only be carved by hand tools with generally poor results
a key breakthrough was the invention of steam-powered cutting and dressing tools by alexander macdonald of aberdeen inspired by seeing ancient egyptian granite carvings in 1832 the first polished tombstone of aberdeen granite to be erected in an english cemetery was installed at kensal green cemetery it caused a sensation in the london monumental trade and for some years all polished granite ordered came from macdonalds working with the sculptor william leslie and later sidney field granite memorials became a major status symbol in victorian britain the royal sarcophagus at frogmore was probably the pinnacle of its work and at 30 tons one of the largest it was not until the 1880s that rival machinery and works could compete with the macdonald works
modern methods of carving include using computer-controlled rotary bits and sandblasting over a rubber stencil leaving the letters numbers and emblems exposed on the stone the blaster can create virtually any kind of artwork or epitaph
the rock known as black granite is usually gabbro which has a completely different chemical composition
==== buildingsedit ====
granite has been extensively used as a dimension stone and as flooring tiles in public and commercial buildings and monuments aberdeen in scotland which is constructed principally from local granite is known as the granite city because of its abundance granite was commonly used to build foundations for homes in new england the granite railway america's first railroad was built to haul granite from the quarries in quincy massachusetts to the neponset river in the 1820s with increasing amounts of acid rain in parts of the world granite has begun to supplant marble as a monument material since it is much more durable polished granite is also a popular choice for kitchen countertops due to its high durability and aesthetic qualities in building and for countertops the term granite is often applied to all igneous rocks with large crystals and not specifically to those with a granitic composition
==== engineeringedit ====
engineers have traditionally used polished granite surface plates to establish a plane of reference since they are relatively impervious and inflexible sandblasted concrete with a heavy aggregate content has an appearance similar to rough granite and is often used as a substitute when use of real granite is impractical a most unusual use of granite was in the construction of the rails for the haytor granite tramway devon england in 1820 granite block is usually processed into slabs and after can be cut and shaped by a cutting center granite tables are used extensively as a base for optical instruments due to granite's rigidity high dimensional stability and excellent vibration characteristics
==== other usesedit ====
curling stones are traditionally fashioned of ailsa craig granite the first stones were made in the 1750s the original source being ailsa craig in scotland because of the particular rarity of the granite the best stones can cost as much as us$1,500 between 60 and 70 percent of the stones used today are made from ailsa craig granite although the island is now a wildlife reserve and is still used for quarrying under license for ailsa granite by kays of mauchline for curling stones
== rock climbingedit ==
granite is one of the rocks most prized by climbers for its steepness soundness crack systems and friction well-known venues for granite climbing include yosemite the bugaboos the mont blanc massif (and peaks such as the aiguille du dru the mountains of mourne the adamello-presanella alps the aiguille du midi and the grandes jorasses) the bregaglia corsica parts of the karakoram (especially the trango towers) the fitzroy massif patagonia baffin island ogawayama the cornish coast the cairngorms sugarloaf mountain in rio de janeiro brazil and the stawamus chief british columbia canada
granite rock climbing is so popular that many of the artificial rock climbing walls found in gyms and theme parks are made to look and feel like granite
