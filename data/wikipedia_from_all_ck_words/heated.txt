in his two-year-old season determine won prize money which totaled more than double his purchase price overall it was a modest year but when he turned three with no break in training from the year before determine was always in stakes company and was never out of the money in more than one race his small size got him through holes and his light weight made him nimble in cramped situations
after determine won the santa anita derby as well as a few other important west coast stakes races crevolin wanted to send him to kentucky for the derby but his trainer wille molter with a large stable to manage was reluctant to take the risk believing that the race was too hard on a young horse so early in the year trainer and owner went back and forth over this decision until determine made it for them by winning more races he was flown to kentucky and in the space of four days ran in two races on april 27 1954 he competed in the derby trial running side by side with hasty road in the stretch determine matched the much larger hasty road stride for stride although hasty road won by a head in a new track record time of 1:35 for the mile the show horse was eleven lengths back
on may 1 determine who had been flown in from california shortly before the race was ridden by ray york in the 1954 kentucky derby he was the second choice of the 100,000 crowd at odds of 4/1 with correlation another californian colt starting the 3/1 favourite right out of the gate york was almost unseated timely tip who had won the arkansas derby cut over badly from the outside in what churchill downs describes as one of the roughest derbys ever run determine stayed on his feet and york stayed in the saddle hasty road was well in the lead but determine caught him 1/16 of a mile from the finish and won by a length and a half becoming the first gray to win the derby as the colt had never been entered in the belmont stakes there was no hope of completing the triple crown and shortly after the derby it was announced that determine would miss the preakness stakes which was won in his absence by hasty road molter had explained that as determine was a late foal and had already run nine times in 1954 he did not want to risk over-racing him
back in california determine was sent out against older horses losing a few races he was found to have an abscessed jaw and was taken out of training when he came back he was heavily weighted which took its toll on him even so he won four stakes races and retired with winnings of almost $600,000
