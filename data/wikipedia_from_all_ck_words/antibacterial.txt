antibiotics or antibacterials are a type of antimicrobial used in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infection they may either kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria several antibiotics are also effective against fungi and protozoans and some are toxic to humans and animals even when given in therapeutic dosage antibiotics are not effective against viruses such as the common cold or influenza and may be harmful when taken inappropriately
in 1928 alexander fleming identified penicillin the first chemical compound with antibiotic properties fleming was working on a culture of disease-causing bacteria when he noticed the spores of little green mold in one of his culture plates he observed that the presence of the mold killed or prevented the growth of the bacteria
antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century and have together with vaccination led to the near eradication of diseases such as tuberculosis in the developed world their effectiveness and easy access led to overuse especially in livestock raising prompting bacteria to develop resistance this has led to widespread problems with antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance so much as to prompt the world health organization to classify antimicrobial resistance as a serious threat [that] is no longer a prediction for the future it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone of any age in any country
the era of antibacterial chemotherapy began with the discovery of arsphenamine first synthesized by alfred bertheim and paul ehrlich in 1907 used to treat syphilis the first systemically active antibacterial drug prontosil was discovered in 1933 by gerhard domagk for which he was awarded the 1939 nobel prize all classes of antibiotics in use today were first discovered prior to the mid 1980s
sometimes the term antibiotic is used to refer to any substance used against microbes synonymous to antimicrobial leading to the widespread but incorrect belief that antibiotics can be used against viruses some sources distinguish between antibacterial and antibiotic antibacterials used in soaps and cleaners etc. but not as medicine this article treats the terms as synonymous and according to the most widespread definition of antibiotics being a substance used against bacteria
== medical uses ==
treatment
bacterial infection
protozoan infection e.g. metronidazole and bactrim is effective against several parasitics
immunomodulation e.g. tetracycline which is effective in periodontal inflammation and dapsone which is effective in autoimmune diseases such as oral mucous membrane pemphigoid
nonoperative resource for patients who have non-complicated acute appendicitis treatment with antibiotics has been reported to work with almost no cases of remission
prevention of infection
surgical wound
dental antibiotic prophylaxis
conditions of neutropenia e.g cancer-related
== pharmacodynamics ==
the successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on several factors these include host defense mechanisms the location of infection and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial a bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells these findings are based on laboratory studies and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration in vitro characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial to predict clinical outcome the antimicrobial activity of an antibacterial is usually combined with its pharmacokinetic profile and several pharmacological parameters are used as markers of drug efficacy
== classes ==
antibacterial antibiotics are commonly classified based on their mechanism of action chemical structure or spectrum of activity most target bacterial functions or growth processes those that target the bacterial cell wall (penicillins and cephalosporins) or the cell membrane (polymyxins) or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes (rifamycins lipiarmycins quinolones and sulfonamides) have bactericidal activities those that target protein synthesis (macrolides lincosamides and tetracyclines) are usually bacteriostatic (with the exception of bactericidal aminoglycosides) further categorization is based on their target specificity narrow-spectrum antibacterial antibiotics target specific types of bacteria such as gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria whereas broad-spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria following a 40-year hiatus in discovering new classes of antibacterial compounds four new classes of antibacterial antibiotics have been brought into clinical use in the late 2000s and early 2010s cyclic lipopeptides (such as daptomycin) glycylcyclines (such as tigecycline) oxazolidinones (such as linezolid) and lipiarmycins (such as fidaxomicin)
== production ==
with advances in medicinal chemistry most modern antibacterials are semisynthetic modifications of various natural compounds these include for example the beta-lactam antibiotics which include the penicillins (produced by fungi in the genus penicillium) the cephalosporins and the carbapenems compounds that are still isolated from living organisms are the aminoglycosides whereas other antibacterialsfor example the sulfonamides the quinolones and the oxazolidinonesare produced solely by chemical synthesis in accordance with this many antibacterial compounds are classified on the basis of chemical/biosynthetic origin into natural semisynthetic and synthetic another classification system is based on biological activity in this classification antibacterials are divided into two broad groups according to their biological effect on microorganisms bactericidal agents kill bacteria and bacteriostatic agents slow down or stall bacterial growth many antibacterial compounds are relatively small molecules with a molecular weight of less than 2000 atomic mass units
since the first pioneering efforts of florey and chain in 1939 the importance of antibiotics including antibacterials to medicine has led to intense research into producing antibacterials at large scales following screening of antibacterials against a wide range of bacteria production of the active compounds is carried out using fermentation usually in strongly aerobic conditions
== administration ==
oral antibiotics are taken by mouth whereas intravenous administration may be used in more serious cases such as deep-seated systemic infections antibiotics may also sometimes be administered topically as with eye drops or ointments
the topical antibiotics are
erythromycin
clindamycin
gentamycin
tetracycline
meclocycline
(sodium) sulfacetamide
while topical medications that act as comedolytics as well as antibiotics are
benzoyl peroxide
azelaic acid
== side-effects ==
antibiotics are screened for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use and are usually considered safe and most are well tolerated however some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse side effects side-effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used the microbial organisms targeted and the individual patient safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis common side-effects include diarrhea resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora resulting for example in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria such as clostridium difficile antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus candida in the vulvo-vaginal area additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs such as elevated risk of tendon damage from administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid some scientists have hypothesized that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics alter the host microbiota and this has been associated with chronic disease
== drug-drug interactions ==
=== birth control pills ===
the majority of studies indicate antibiotics do not interfere with contraceptive pills such as clinical studies that suggest the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low (about 1%) in cases where antibacterials have been suggested to affect the efficiency of birth control pills such as for the broad-spectrum antibacterial rifampicin these cases may be due to an increase in the activities of hepatic liver enzymes causing increased breakdown of the pill's active ingredients effects on the intestinal flora which might result in reduced absorption of estrogens in the colon have also been suggested but such suggestions have been inconclusive and controversial clinicians have recommended that extra contraceptive measures be applied during therapies using antibacterials that are suspected to interact with oral contraceptives
=== alcohol ===
interactions between alcohol and certain antibiotics may occur and may cause side-effects and decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy
it is sensible to avoid drinking alcohol when taking medication however it is unlikely that drinking alcohol in moderation will cause problems if you are taking most common antibiotics however there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol should be avoided completely because of serious side-effects.
therefore potential risks of side-effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibiotic administered despite the lack of a categorical counterindication the belief that alcohol and antibiotics should never be mixed is widespread
antibiotics such as metronidazole tinidazole cephamandole latamoxef cefoperazone cefmenoxime and furazolidone cause a disulfiram-like chemical reaction with alcohol by inhibiting its breakdown by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase which may result in vomiting nausea and shortness of breath
other effects of alcohol on antibiotic activity include altered activity of the liver enzymes that break down the antibiotic compound in addition serum levels of doxycycline and erythromycin succinate two bacteriostatic antibiotics (see above) may be reduced by alcohol consumption resulting in reduced efficacy and diminished pharmacotherapeutic effect
== resistance ==
the emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a common phenomenon emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy the antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics under certain conditions it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug for example antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the luriadelbrck experiment antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains have become less effective due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains
resistance may take the form of biodegredation of pharmaceuticals such as sulfamethazine-degrading soil bacteria introduced to sulfamethazine through medicated pig feces the survival of bacteria often results from an inheritable resistance but the growth of resistance to antibacterials also occurs through horizontal gene transfer horizontal transfer is more likely to happen in locations of frequent antibiotic use
antibacterial resistance may impose a biological cost thereby reducing fitness of resistant strains which can limit the spread of antibacterial-resistant bacteria for example in the absence of antibacterial compounds additional mutations however may compensate for this fitness cost and can aid the survival of these bacteria
paleontological data show that both antibiotics and antibiotic resistance are ancient compounds and mechanisms useful antibiotic targets are those for which mutations negatively impact bacterial reproduction or viability
several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains for example an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal dna antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to and may have been transferred to antibacterial-resistant strains the spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of dna by horizontal genetic exchange for instance antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound
antibacterial-resistant strains and species sometimes referred to as superbugs now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were for a while well controlled for example emergent bacterial strains causing tuberculosis (tb) that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges every year nearly half a million new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (mdr-tb) are estimated to occur worldwide for example ndm-1 is a newly identified enzyme conveying bacterial resistance to a broad range of beta-lactam antibacterials the united kingdom's health protection agency has stated that most isolates with ndm-1 enzyme are resistant to all standard intravenous antibiotics for treatment of severe infections.
=== misuse ===
per the the icu book the first rule of antibiotics is try not to use them and the second rule is try not to use too many of them.
inappropriate antibiotic treatment and overuse of antibiotics have contributed to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria self prescription of antibiotics is an example of misuse many antibiotics are frequently prescribed to treat symptoms or diseases that do not respond to antibiotics or that are likely to resolve without treatment also incorrect or suboptimal antibiotics are prescribed for certain bacterial infections the overuse of antibiotics like penicillin and erythromycin has been associated with emerging antibiotic resistance since the 1950s widespread usage of antibiotics in hospitals has also been associated with increases in bacterial strains and species that no longer respond to treatment with the most common antibiotics
common forms of antibiotic misuse include excessive use of prophylactic antibiotics in travelers and failure of medical professionals to prescribe the correct dosage of antibiotics on the basis of the patient's weight and history of prior use other forms of misuse include failure to take the entire prescribed course of the antibiotic incorrect dosage and administration or failure to rest for sufficient recovery inappropriate antibiotic treatment for example is their prescription to treat viral infections such as the common cold one study on respiratory tract infections found physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients who appeared to expect them multifactorial interventions aimed at both physicians and patients can reduce inappropriate prescription of antibiotics
several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to eliminate the unnecessary use of antibiotics the issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the us interagency task force on antimicrobial resistance this task force aims to actively address antimicrobial resistance and is coordinated by the us centers for disease control and prevention the food and drug administration (fda) and the national institutes of health (nih) as well as other us agencies an ngo campaign group is keep antibiotics working in france an antibiotics are not automatic government campaign started in 2002 and led to a marked reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions especially in children
the emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the uk in 1970 (swann report 1969) and the eu has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003 moreover several organizations (e.g. the american society for microbiology (asm) american public health association (apha) and the american medical association (ama)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses however commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them two federal bills (s.742 and h.r 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in us food animals were proposed but have not passed these bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations including the american holistic nurses association the american medical association and the american public health association (apha)
there has been extensive use of antibiotics in animal husbandry in the united states the question of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains due to use of antibiotics in livestock was raised by the us food and drug administration (fda) in 1977 in march 2012 the united states district court for the southern district of new york ruling in an action brought by the natural resources defense council and others ordered the fda to revoke approvals for the use of antibiotics in livestock which violated fda regulations
== alternatives ==
the increase in bacterial strains that are resistant to conventional antibacterial therapies has prompted the development of bacterial disease treatment strategies that are alternatives to conventional antibacterials
=== resistance-modifying agents ===
one strategy to address bacterial drug resistance is the discovery and application of compounds that modify resistance to common antibacterials for example some resistance-modifying agents may inhibit multidrug resistance mechanisms such as drug efflux from the cell thus increasing the susceptibility of bacteria to an antibacterial targets include
the efflux inhibitor phe-arg--naphthylamide
beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam
metabolic stimuli such as sugar can help eradicate a certain type of antibiotic-tolerant bacteria by keeping their metabolism active
=== vaccines ===
vaccines rely on immune modulation or augmentation vaccination either excites or reinforces the immune competence of a host to ward off infection leading to the activation of macrophages the production of antibodies inflammation and other classic immune reactions antibacterial vaccines have been responsible for a drastic reduction in global bacterial diseases vaccines made from attenuated whole cells or lysates have been replaced largely by less reactogenic cell-free vaccines consisting of purified components including capsular polysaccharides and their conjugates to protein carriers as well as inactivated toxins (toxoids) and proteins
=== phage therapy ===
phage therapy is another option that is being looked into for treating resistant strains of bacteria the way that researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses more specifically bacteriophages bacteriophages also known simply as phages are precisely bacterial viruses that infect bacteria by disrupting pathogenic bacterium lytic cycles by disrupting the lytic cycles of bacterium phages destroy their metabolism which eventually results in the cell's death phages will insert their dna into the bacterium allowing their dna to be transcribed once their dna is transcribed the cell will proceed to make new phages and as soon as they are ready to be released the cell will lyse one of the worries about using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect good bacteria or the bacteria that are important in the everyday function of human beings however studies have proven that phages are very specific when they target bacteria which makes researchers confident that bacteriophage therapy is the definite route to defeating antibiotic resistant bacteria
=== supplements ===
some over-the-counter antioxidant supplements containing polyphenols such as grape seed extract demonstrate in vitro anti-bacterial properties
== status of new antibiotics development ==
in a policy report released by the infectious disease society of america (idsa) on april 2013 idsa expressed grave concern over the weak pipeline of antibiotics to combat the growing ability of bacteria especially the gram-negative bacilli (gnb) to develop resistance to antibiotics since 2009 only 2 new antibiotics were approved in united states and the number of new antibiotics annually approved for marketing continues to decline the report could identify only seven antibiotics currently in phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials to treat the gnb which includes e coli salmonella shigella and the enterobacteriaceae bacteria and these drugs do not address the entire spectrum of the resistance developed by those bacteria some of these seven new antibiotics are combination of existent antibiotics including
ceftolozane/tazobactam (cxa-201 cxa-101/tazobactam) antipseudomonal cephalosporin/-lactamase inhibitor combination (cell wall synthesis inhibitor) fda approved on 12/19/2014
ceftazidime/avibactam (ceftazidime/nxl104) antipseudomonal cephalosporin/-lactamase inhibitor combination (cell wall synthesis inhibitor) in phase 3
ceftaroline/avibactam (cpt-avibactam ceftaroline/nxl104) anti-mrsa cephalosporin/ -lactamase inhibitor combination (cell wall synthesis inhibitor)
imipenem/mk-7655 carbapenem/ -lactamase inhibitor combination (cell wall synthesis inhibitor) in phase 2
plazomicin (achn-490) aminoglycoside (protein synthesis inhibitor) in phase 2
eravacycline (tp-434) a synthetic tetracycline derivative / protein synthesis inhibitor targeting the ribosome being developed by tetraphase phase 2 trials complete
brilacidin (pmx-30063) peptide defense protein mimetic (cell membrane disruption) in phase 2
many new antibiotics are still to come from research into streptomyces including new pharmaceuticals able to treat mrsa and other infections resistant to commonly-used medication investments into this sector of research have made a profound impact on the uk economy and human health streptomyces research supported by bbsrc at the john innes centre and universities in the uk has resulted in the creation of a number of spin-out companies one of them novacta biosystems has designed the type-b lantibiotic-based compound nvb302 (in phase 1) to treat clostridium difficile infections
the idsa's prognosis for sustainable r&d infrastructure for antibiotics development will depend upon clarification of fda regulatory clinical trial guidance that would facilitate the speedy approval of new drugs and the appropriate economic incentives for the pharmaceuticals companies to invest in this endeavor on 12 december 2013 the antibiotic development to advance patient treatment (adapt) act of 2013 was introduced in the us congress the adapt act aims to fast track the drug development in order to combat the growing public health threat of superbugs under this act fda can approve antibiotics and antifungals needed for life-threatening infections based on data from smaller clinical trials the cdc will reinforce the monitoring of the use of antibiotics that treat serious and life-threatening infections and the emerging resistance and make the data publicly available the fda antibiotics labeling process susceptibility test interpretive criteria for microbial organisms or breakpoints is also streamlined to allow the most up-to-date and cutting-edge data available to healthcare professionals under the new act congress has been urged in 2014 from several parties to aid the development of new drugs via bills such as adapt allan coukell director of drugs and medical devices at the pew charitable trusts testified in from of the house committee in a statement published by reuters that by allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets and clarifying fda's authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs when making a risk/benefit calculation adapt would make the clinical trials more feasible.
== antibiotics antagonism ==
chloramphenicol and tetracyclines are antagonists to penicillins and aminoglycosides this means the combined effect of two antibiotics from separate groups can be less than a single antibiotic however this can vary depending on the species of bacteria
== history ==
before the early 20th century treatments for infections were based primarily on medicinal folklore mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago many ancient cultures including the ancient egyptians and ancient greeks used specially selected mold and plant materials and extracts to treat infections more recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms louis pasteur observed if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics the term antibiosis meaning against life was introduced by the french bacteriologist jean paul vuillemin as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when louis pasteur and robert koch observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of bacillus anthracis these drugs were later renamed antibiotics by selman waksman an american microbiologist in 1942 synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in germany with paul ehrlich in the late 1880s ehrlich noted certain dyes would color human animal or bacterial cells whereas others did not he then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host after screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms in 1907 he discovered a medicinally useful drug the synthetic antibacterial salvarsan now called arsphenamine
the effects of some types of mold on infection had been noticed many times over the course of history (see history of penicillin) in 1928 alexander fleming noticed the same effect in a petri dish where a number of disease-causing bacteria were killed by a fungus of the genus penicillium fleming postulated that the effect is mediated by an antibacterial compound he named penicillin and that its antibacterial properties could be exploited for chemotherapy he initially characterized some of its biological properties and attempted to use a crude preparation to treat some infections but he was unable to pursue its further development without the aid of trained chemists
the first sulfonamide and first commercially available antibacterial prontosil was developed by a research team led by gerhard domagk in 1932 at the bayer laboratories of the ig farben conglomerate in germany domagk received the 1939 nobel prize for medicine for his efforts prontosil had a relatively broad effect against gram-positive cocci but not against enterobacteria research was stimulated apace by its success the discovery and development of this sulfonamide drug opened the era of antibacterials
in 1939 coinciding with the start of world war ii rene dubos reported the discovery of the first naturally derived antibiotic tyrothricin a compound of 20% gramicidin and 80% tyrocidine from b brevis it was one of the first commercially manufactured antibiotics universally and was very effective in treating wounds and ulcers during world war ii gramicidin however could not be used systemically because of toxicity tyrocidine also proved too toxic for systemic usage research results obtained during that period were not shared between the axis and the allied powers during the war
florey and chain succeeded in purifying the first penicillin penicillin g in 1942 but it did not become widely available outside the allied military before 1945 the chemical structure of penicillin was determined by dorothy crowfoot hodgkin in 1945 purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans furthermore its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus unlike the synthetic sulfonamides the discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety for their successful development of penicillin which fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself as a therapeutic drug ernst chain and howard florey shared the 1945 nobel prize in medicine with fleming florey credited dubos with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived florey's research in penicillin
=== etymology ===
the term antibiotic was first used in 1942 by selman waksman and his collaborators in journal articles to describe any substance produced by a microorganism that is antagonistic to the growth of other microorganisms in high dilution this definition excluded substances that kill bacteria but that are not produced by microorganisms (such as gastric juices and hydrogen peroxide) it also excluded synthetic antibacterial compounds such as the sulfonamides
the term antibiotic derives from anti + (bitikos) fit for life lively which comes from (bisis) way of life and that from (bios) life
the term antibacterial derives from greek (anti) against + (baktrion) diminutive of (baktria) staff cane because the first ones to be discovered were rod-shaped
