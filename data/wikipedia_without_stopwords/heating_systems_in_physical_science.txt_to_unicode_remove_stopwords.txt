new zealander george hudson proposed modern idea daylight saving germany austriahungary organized first nationwide implementation starting april many countries used various times since particularly since energy crisis
practice received advocacy criticism putting clocks forward benefits retailing sports activities exploit sunlight working hours cause problems evening entertainment activities tied sunlight farming although early proponents dst aimed reduce evening use incandescent lighting formerly primary use electricity modern heating cooling usage patterns differ greatly research dst currently affects energy use limited contradictory
dst clock shifts sometimes complicate timekeeping disrupt travel billing record keeping medical devices heavy equipment sleep patterns computer software often adjust clocks automatically policy changes various jurisdictions dates timings dst may confusing
rationale
industrialized societies generally follow clockbased schedule daily activities change throughout course year time day individuals begin end work school coordination mass transit example usually remain constant yearround contrast agrarian societys daily routines work personal conduct likely governed length daylight hours solar time change seasonally earths axial tilt north south tropics daylight lasts longer summer shorter winter effect becoming greater one moves away tropics
synchronously resetting clocks region one hour ahead standard time one hour fast individuals follow yearround schedule wake hour earlier would otherwise begin complete daily work routines hour earlier extra hour daylight workday activities however one less hour daylight start day making policy less practical winter
times sunrise sunset change roughly equal rates seasons change proponents daylight saving time argue people prefer greater increase daylight hours typical ninetofive workday supporters also argued dst decreases energy consumption reducing need lighting heating actual effect overall energy use heavily disputed
manipulation time higher latitudes example iceland nunavut alaska little impact daily life length day night changes extremely throughout seasons comparison latitudes thus sunrise sunset times significantly sync standard working hours regardless manipulations clock dst also little use locations near equator regions see small variation daylight throughout year
history

computing
changes dst rules cause problems existing computer installations example change dst rules north america required many computer systems upgraded greatest impact email calendaring programs upgrades consumed significant effort corporate information technologists
applications standardize utc avoid problems clock shifts time zone differences likewise modern operating systems internally handle store times utc convert local time display
however even utc used internally systems still require information time zones correctly calculate local time needed many systems use today base datetime calculations data derived iana time zone database also known zoneinfo
iana time zone database
iana time zone database maps name named locations historical predicted clock shifts database used many computer software systems including unixlike operating systems java oracle rdbms hps tztab database similar incompatible temporal authorities change dst rules zoneinfo updates installed part ordinary system maintenance unixlike systems tz environment variable specifies location name tzamericanewyork many systems also systemwide setting applied tz environment variable isnt set setting controlled contents etclocaltime file usually symbolic link hard link one zoneinfo files internal time stored timezoneindependent epoch time tz used potentially many simultaneous users processes independently localize time display
older strippeddown systems may support tz values required posix specify one start end rule explicitly value example tzestedtmm specifies time eastern united states starting tz value must changed whenever dst rules change new value applies years mishandling older timestamps
microsoft windows
zoneinfo user microsoft windows configures dst specifying name location operating system consults table rule sets must updated dst rules change procedures specifying name updating table vary release updates issued older versions microsoft windows windows vista supports two start end rules per time zone setting canadian location observing dst single vista setting supports post time stamps mishandles older time stamps older microsoft windows systems usually store single start end rule zone canadian setting reliably supports post time stamps
limitations caused problems example dst israel varied year skipped years windows used rules correct causing problems later years windows microsoft marked israel dst forcing israeli users shift computer clocks manually twice year israeli daylight saving law established predictable rules using jewish calendar windows zone files could represent rules dates yearindependent way partial workarounds mishandled older time stamps included manually switching zone files every year microsoft tool switches zones automatically israel standardized daylight saving time according gregorian calendar
microsoft windows keeps system realtime clock local time causes several problems including compatibility multi booting operating systems set clock utc doubleadjusting clock multi booting different windows versions rescue boot disk approach problem even windowsonly systems support peruser timezone settings single systemwide setting microsoft hinted future versions windows partially support windows registry entry realtimeisuniversal introduced many years earlier windows nt supported risc machines utc clocks maintained since least two fixes related feature published microsoft
ntfs file system used recent versions windows stores file utc time stamp displays corrected localor seasonaltime however fat filesystem commonly used removable devices stores local time consequently file copied hard disk onto separate media time set current local time time adjustment changed timestamps original file copy different effect observed compressing uncompressing files file archivers ntfs file changes seen time effect kept mind trying determine file duplicate another although methods comparing files equality using checksum algorithms
