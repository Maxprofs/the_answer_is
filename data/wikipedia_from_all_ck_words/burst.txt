in 1995 students from bristol university and the university of the west of england (uwe) co-operated to run fresh fm after fresh fm ceased to exist burst fm was conceived by bristol university students in 1997 when sufficient funds had been raised a one month licence to broadcast on 106.6 fm was awarded for march 1998 housed in st paul's church in clifton
however the unavailability of further fm licences due to the launch of a new full-time station (the eagle now renamed star) prevented further broadcasts in early 2000 speakers were installed within the union building and broadcasts mounted for during fresh (bristol university's freshers week) 2000 at the same time a grant from the alumni foundation and fundraising through advertising and sponsorship allowed burst to build new studios inside the union and stream programming onto the internet around campus
while all this was happening an application was made for a further fm licence for autumn 2000 the subsequent award of this meant that burst was back on 106.6 fm with a restricted service licence an application was made for another one-month licence in summer 2001 this licence was also awarded as well as a subsequent one in november 2001 these broadcasts were promoted by club nights and attracted coverage in student and local press in 2003 burst began broadcasting via the internet permanently
