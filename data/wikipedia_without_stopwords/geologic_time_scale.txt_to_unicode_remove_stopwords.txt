geological time scale gts system chronological measurement relates stratigraphy time used geologists paleontologists earth scientists describe timing relationships events occurred throughout earths history table geologic time spans presented agrees nomenclature dates standard color codes set forth international commission stratigraphy
evidence radiometric dating indicates earth billion years old geology deep time earths past organized various units according events took place period different spans time gts usually delimited changes composition strata correspond indicating major geological paleontological events mass extinctions example boundary cretaceous period paleogene period defined cretaceouspaleogene extinction event marked demise nonavian dinosaurs many groups life older time spans predate reliable fossil record proterozoic eon defined absolute age
terminology
largest defined unit time supereon composed eons eons divided eras turn divided periods epochs ages terms eonothem erathem system series stage used refer layers rock correspond periods geologic time earths history
geologists qualify units early mid late referring time lower middle upper referring corresponding rocks example lower jurassic series chronostratigraphy corresponds early jurassic epoch geochronology adjectives capitalized subdivision formally recognized lower case thus early miocene early jurassic
geologic units time different parts world often look different contain different fossils period historically given different names different locales example north america lower cambrian called waucoban series subdivided zones based succession trilobites east asia siberia unit split alexian atdabanian botomian stages key aspect work international commission stratigraphy reconcile conflicting terminology define universal horizons used around world
anthropocene
term anthropocene used informally popular culture growing number scientists describe current epoch living term coined paul crutzen eugene stoermer describe current time humans enormous impact environmentpolluting oceans killing species etc evolved describe epoch starting time past whole defined carbon emissions plastic left ground
opponents term say term used hard nearly impossible define specific time humans started influencing rock stratadefining start epoch others say humans even started leave biggest impact earth therefore antropocene hasnt even started yet whatever case ics officially approved term september
history nomenclature time scale
early history
ancient greece aristotle saw fossils seashells rocks similar found beach inferred fossils part living animals reasoned positions land sea changed long periods time leonardo da vinci concurred aristotles view fossils remains ancient life
thcentury persian geologist avicenna ibn sina th century dominican bishop albertus magnus albert saxony extended aristotles explanation theory petrifying fluid avicenna also first proposed one principles underlying geologic time scales law superposition strata discussing origins mountains book healing chinese naturalist shen kuo also recognized concept deep time
formation primary principles
principles underlying geologic geological time scales later laid nicholas steno late th century steno argued rock layers strata laid succession represents slice time also formulated law superposition states given stratum probably older younger stenos principles simple applying real rocks proved complex course th century geologists realized
sequences strata often eroded distorted tilted even inverted deposition
strata laid time different areas could entirely different appearances
strata given area represented part earths long history
neptunist theories popular time expounded werner proposed rocks precipitated single enormous flood major shift thinking came james hutton presented theory earth investigation laws observable composition dissolution restoration land upon globe royal society edinburgh march april said things appear perspective th century james hutton readings became founder modern geology hutton proposed interior earth hot heat engine drove creation new rock land eroded air water deposited layers sea heat consolidated sediment stone uplifted new lands theory called plutonist contrast neptunist floodoriented theory
formation geologic time scale
first serious attempts formulate geological time scale could applied anywhere earth made late th century influential early attempts championed abraham werner among others divided rocks earths crust four types primary secondary tertiary quaternary type rock according theory formed specific period earth history thus possible speak tertiary period well tertiary rocks indeed tertiary paleogene neogene quaternary pleistocene holocene remained use names geological periods well th century
identification strata fossils contained pioneered william smith georges cuvier jean domalius dhalloy alexandre brogniart early th century enabled geologists divide earth history precisely also enabled correlate strata across national even continental boundaries two strata however distant space different composition contained fossils chances good laid time detailed studies strata fossils europe produced sequence geological periods still used today
naming geologic periods eras epochs
process dominated british geologists names periods reflect dominance cambrian classical name wales ordovician silurian named ancient welsh tribes periods defined using stratigraphic sequences wales devonian named english county devon name carboniferous simply adaptation coal measures old british geologists term set strata permian named perm russia defined using strata region scottish geologist roderick murchison however periods defined geologists countries triassic named german geologist friedrich von alberti three distinct layers latin trias meaning triad red beds capped chalk followed black shales found throughout germany northwest europe called trias jurassic named french geologist alexandre brogniart extensive marine limestone exposures jura mountains cretaceous latin creta meaning chalk separate period first defined belgian geologist jean domalius dhalloy using strata paris basin named extensive beds chalk calcium carbonate deposited shells marine invertebrates
british geologists also responsible grouping periods eras subdivision tertiary quaternary periods epochs john phillips published first global geological time scale based types fossils found era phillips scale helped standardize use terms like paleozoic old life extended cover larger period previous usage mesozoic middle life invented
dating time scales
william smith sir charles lyell first recognized rock strata represented successive time periods time scales could estimated imprecisely since various kinds rates change used estimation highly variable creationists proposing dates around six seven thousand years age earth based bible early geologists suggesting millions years geologic periods even suggesting virtually infinite age earth geologists paleontologists constructed geologic table based relative positions different strata fossils estimated time scales based studying rates various kinds weathering erosion sedimentation lithification discovery radioactivity development geological applications radiometric dating first half th century pioneered geologists arthur holmes allowed precise absolute dating rocks ages various rock strata age earth subject considerable debate
first geologic time scale included absolute dates published british geologist arthur holmes greatly furthered newly created discipline geochronology published worldrenowned book age earth estimated earths age least billion years
