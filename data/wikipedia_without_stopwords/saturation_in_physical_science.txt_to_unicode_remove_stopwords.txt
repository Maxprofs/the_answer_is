colorimetry color theory colorfulness chroma saturation related distinct concepts referring perceived intensity specific color colorfulness visual sensation according perceived color area appears less chromatic
chroma colorfulness relative brightness similarly illuminated area appears white highly transmitting therefore chroma confused colorfulness
saturation colorfulness color relative brightness though general concept intuitive terms chroma saturation purity intensity often used without great precision even welldefined depend greatly specific color model use
highly colorful stimulus vivid intense less colorful stimulus appears muted closer gray colorfulness color neutral gray image colorfulness colors called grayscale three color appearance parameterscolorfulness chroma saturation lightness brightness hueany color described
saturationedit
saturation one three coordinates hsl hsv color spaces
saturation color determined combination light intensity much distributed across spectrum different wavelengths purest saturated color achieved using one wavelength high intensity laser light intensity drops result saturation drops desaturate color given intensity subtractive system watercolor one add white black gray hues complement
various correlates saturation follow
cieluv
chroma normalized lightness
un vn chromaticity white point chroma defined
analogy cielab would yield
cie formally recommended equation since cielab chromaticity diagram definition therefore lacks direct correlation older concepts saturation nevertheless equation provides reasonable predictor saturation demonstrates adjusting lightness cielab holding b fixed affect saturation
following formula agreement human perception saturation formula proposed eva lbbe agreement verbal definition manfred richter saturation proportion pure chromatic color total color sensation
sab saturation l lightness cab chroma color
ciecam
square root colorfulness divided brightness
definition inspired experimental work done intention remedying ciecamss poor performance m proportional chroma c m cfl thus ciecam definition bears similarity cieluv definition important difference ciecam model accounts viewing conditions parameter fl
excitation purityedit

xn yn chromaticity white point xi yi point perimeter whose line segment white point contains chromaticity stimulus different color spaces cielab cieluv may used yield different results
chroma cie lab luv color spacesedit
nave definition saturation specify response function cie xyz rgb color spaces saturation defined terms additive color mixing property proportional scaling centered white white point illuminant however color spaces nonlinear terms psychovisually perceived color differences also possibleand sometimes desirableto define saturationlike quantity linearized term psychovisual perception

chroma color appearance modelsedit
another psychovisually even accurate also complex method obtain specify saturation use color appearance model chroma color appearance parameter might depending color appearance model intertwined eg physical brightness illumination characteristics emittingreflecting surface sensible psychovisually
