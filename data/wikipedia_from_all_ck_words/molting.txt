morning is the period of time between midnight and noon or more commonly the interval between sunrise and noon morning precedes afternoon evening and night in the sequence of a day originally the term referred to sunrise
== etymology ==
the name (which comes from the middle english word morwening) was formed from the analogy of evening using the word morn (in middle english morwen) and originally meant the coming of the sunrise as evening meant the beginning of the close of the day the middle english morwen dropped over time and became morwe then eventually morrow which properly means morning but was soon used to refer to the following day (i.e. tomorrow") as in other germanic languagesenglish is unique in restricting the word to the newer usage the spanish word maana has two meanings in english morning, and tomorrow, along with the word morgen in dutch and german which also means both morning, and tomorrow. max weber (general economic history pp23) states that the english word morning and the german word morgen both signify the size of land strip which an ox could plow in a day without giving out tagwerk in german and a day's work in english mean the same a good morning in this sense might mean a good day's plow
== usage ==
the most obvious manifestation of this meaning is in english speaking countries where the greeting changes from good night to good morning when midnight passes
morning may also be used in a strictly personal sense to refer to the period immediately following waking up irrespective of the current time of day in this sense morning encompasses the (mostly menial) prerequisites for full productivity and life in public (i.e cleaning a morning mealoften breakfast dressing etc.) the boundaries of such morning periods are by necessity idiosyncratic but they are typically considered to have ended on reaching a state of full readiness for the day's productive activity this modern permutation of morning is due largely to the worldwide spread of electricity and the concomitant independence from natural light sources
a morning newspaper is one on sale in the mornings (as opposed to an evening newspaper on sale from about noon onwards) in practice (though this may vary according to country) this means that a morning newspaper is available in early editions from before midnight on the night before its cover date further editions being printed and distributed during the night previews of tomorrow's newspapers are often a feature of late night news programmes such as newsnight in the united kingdom
morning meals include breakfast though logically this need not be in the morning and are varied across cultures brunch is a late morning meal
the ability of a person to wake up effectively in the morning may be influenced by a gene called period 3 this gene comes in two forms a long and a short variant it seems to affect the person's preference for mornings or evenings people who carry the long variant were over-represented as morning people while the ones carrying the short variant were evening preference people
