in communications and information processing code is a system of rules to convert informationsuch as a letter word sound image or gestureinto another form or representation sometimes shortened or secret for communication through a channel or storage in a medium an early example is the invention of language which enabled a person through speech to communicate what he or she saw heard felt or thought to others but speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered the invention of writing which converted spoken language into visual symbols extended the range of communication across space and time
the process of encoding converts information from a source into symbols for communication or storage decoding is the reverse process converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands
one reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language spoken or written is difficult or impossible for example semaphore where the configuration of flags held by a signaller or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message typically individual letters and numbers another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent
== theory ==
in information theory and computer science a code is usually considered as an algorithm which uniquely represents symbols from some source alphabet by encoded strings which may be in some other target alphabet an extension of the code for representing sequences of symbols over the source alphabet is obtained by concatenating the encoded strings
before giving a mathematically precise definition we give a brief example the mapping
is a code whose source alphabet is the set and whose target alphabet is the set  using the extension of the code the encoded string 0011001011 can be grouped into codewords as 0011001011 and these in turn can be decoded to the sequence of source symbols acabc
using terms from formal language theory the precise mathematical definition of this concept is as follows let s and t be two finite sets called the source and target alphabets respectively a code is a total function mapping each symbol from s to a sequence of symbols over t and the extension of to a homomorphism of into  which naturally maps each sequence of source symbols to a sequence of target symbols is referred to as its extension
=== variable-length codes ===
in this section we consider codes which encode each source (clear text) character by a code word from some dictionary and concatenation of such code words give us an encoded string variable-length codes are especially useful when clear text characters have different probabilities see also entropy encoding
a prefix code is a code with the prefix property there is no valid code word in the system that is a prefix (start) of any other valid code word in the set huffman coding is the most known algorithm for deriving prefix codes prefix codes are widely referred to as huffman codes even when the code was not produced by a huffman algorithm other examples of prefix codes are country calling codes the country and publisher parts of isbns and the secondary synchronization codes used in the umts w-cdma 3g wireless standard
kraft's inequality characterizes the sets of code word lengths that are possible in a prefix code virtually any uniquely decodable one-to-many code not necessary a prefix one must satisfy kraft's inequality
=== error-correcting codes ===
codes may also be used to represent data in a way more resistant to errors in transmission or storage such a code is called an error-correcting code and works by including carefully crafted redundancy with the stored (or transmitted) data examples include hamming codes reedsolomon reedmuller walshhadamard bosechaudhurihochquenghem turbo golay goppa low-density parity-check codes and spacetime codes error detecting codes can be optimised to detect burst errors or random errors

=== codes in communication used for brevity ===
a cable code replaces words (e.g. ship or invoice) with shorter words allowing the same information to be sent with fewer characters more quickly and most important less expensively
codes can be used for brevity when telegraph messages were the state of the art in rapid long distance communication elaborate systems of commercial codes that encoded complete phrases into single words (commonly five-minute groups) were developed so that telegraphers became conversant with such words as byoxo ("are you trying to weasel out of our deal?") liouy ("why do you not answer my question?") bmuld ("you're a skunk!") or ayylu ("not clearly coded repeat more clearly.") code words were chosen for various reasons length pronounceability etc meanings were chosen to fit perceived needs commercial negotiations military terms for military codes diplomatic terms for diplomatic codes any and all of the preceding for espionage codes codebooks and codebook publishers proliferated including one run as a front for the american black chamber run by herbert yardley between the first and second world wars the purpose of most of these codes was to save on cable costs the use of data coding for data compression predates the computer era an early example is the telegraph morse code where more-frequently used characters have shorter representations techniques such as huffman coding are now used by computer-based algorithms to compress large data files into a more compact form for storage or transmission
=== character encodings ===
probably the most widely known data communications code so far (a.k.a character representation) in use today is ascii in one or another (somewhat compatible) version it is used by nearly all personal computers terminals printers and other communication equipment it represents 128 characters with seven-bit binary numbersthat is as a string of seven 1s and 0s (bits) in ascii a lowercase a is always 1100001 an uppercase a always 1000001 and so on there are many other encodings which represent each character by a byte (usually referred as code pages) integer code point (unicode) or a byte sequence (utf-8)
=== genetic code ===
biological organisms contain genetic material that is used to control their function and development this is dna which contains units named genes that can produce proteins through a code (genetic code) in which a series of triplets (codons) of four possible nucleotides are translated into one of twenty possible amino acids a sequence of codons results in a corresponding sequence of amino acids that form a protein
=== gdel code ===
in mathematics a gdel code was the basis for the proof of gdel's incompleteness theorem here the idea was to map mathematical notation to a natural number (using a gdel numbering)
=== other ===
there are codes using colors like traffic lights the color code employed to mark the nominal value of the electrical resistors or that of the trashcans devoted to specific types of garbage (paper glass biological etc.)
in marketing coupon codes can be used for a financial discount or rebate when purchasing a product from an internet retailer
in military environments specific sounds with the cornet are used for different uses to mark some moments of the day to command the infantry in the battlefield etc
communication systems for sensory impairments such as sign language for deaf people and braille for blind people are based on movement or tactile codes
musical scores are the most common way to encode music
specific games as chess have their own code systems to record the matches (chess notation)
=== cryptography ===
in the history of cryptography codes were once common for ensuring the confidentiality of communications although ciphers are now used instead see code (cryptography)
secret codes intended to obscure the real messages ranging from serious (mainly espionage in military diplomatic business etc.) to trivial (romance games) can be any kind of imaginative encoding flowers game cards clothes fans hats melodies birds etc. in which the sole requisite is the previous agreement of the meaning by both the sender and the receiver
== other examples ==
other examples of encoding include
encoding (in cognition) is a basic perceptual process of interpreting incoming stimuli technically speaking it is a complex multi-stage process of converting relatively objective sensory input (e.g. light sound) into subjectively meaningful experience
a content format is a specific encoding format for converting a specific type of data to information
text encoding uses a markup language to tag the structure and other features of a text to facilitate processing by computers (see also text encoding initiative.)
semantics encoding of formal language a in formal language b is a method of representing all terms (e.g programs or descriptions) of language a using language b
electronic encoding transforms a signal into a code optimized for transmission or storage generally done with a codec
neural encoding is the way in which information is represented in neurons
memory encoding is the process of converting sensations into memories

decoding methods methods in communication theory for decoding code words sent over a noisy channel
digital signal processing the study of signals in a digital representation and the processing methods of these signals
digital-to-analog converter the use of analog circuit for decoding operations
word decoding the use of phonics to decipher print patterns and translate them into the sounds of language
== codes and acronyms ==
acronyms and abbreviations can be considered codes and in a sense all languages and writing systems are codes for human thought
international air transport association airport codes are three-letter codes used to designate airports and used for bag tags station codes are similarly used on railways but are usually national so the same code can be used for different stations if they are in different countries
occasionally a code word achieves an independent existence (and meaning) while the original equivalent phrase is forgotten or at least no longer has the precise meaning attributed to the code word for example 30 was widely used in journalism to mean end of story and has been used in other contexts to signify the end
