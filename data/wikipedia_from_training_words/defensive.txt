in international human rights law a forced disappearance (or enforced disappearance) occurs when a person is secretly abducted or imprisoned by a state or political organization or by a third party with the authorization support or acquiescence of a state or political organization followed by a refusal to acknowledge the person's fate and whereabouts with the intent of placing the victim outside the protection of the law
according to the rome statute of the international criminal court which came into force on 1 july 2002 when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed at any civilian population a forced disappearance qualifies as a crime against humanity and thus is not subject to a statute of limitations on 20 december 2006 the united nations general assembly adopted the international convention for the protection of all persons from enforced disappearance
often forced disappearance implies murder the victim in such a case is abducted illegally detained and often tortured during interrogation killed and the body hidden typically a murder will be surreptitious with the corpse disposed of to escape discovery so that the person apparently vanishes the party committing the murder has deniability as nobody provides evidence of the victim's death
disappearing political rivals is also a way for regimes to engender feelings of complicity in populations that is the difficulty of publicly fighting a government which murders in secret can result in widespread pretense that everything is normal as it did in the dirty war in argentina
== human rights law ==
in international human rights law disappearances at the hands of the state have been codified as enforced or forced disappearances since the vienna declaration and programme of action for example the rome statute establishing the international criminal court defines enforced disappearance as a crime against humanity and the practice is specifically addressed by the oas's inter-american convention on forced disappearance of persons there is also some authority indicating that enforced disappearances occurring during armed conflict such as the third reich's night and fog program may constitute war crimes
in february 1980 the united nations established the working group on enforced or involuntary disappearances the first united nations human rights thematic mechanism to be established with a universal mandate. its main task is to assist families in determining the fate or whereabouts of their family members who are reportedly disappeared. in august 2014 the working group reported 43,250 unresolved cases of disappearances in 88 different states
the international convention for the protection of all persons from enforced disappearance adopted by the un general assembly on 20 december 2006 also states that the widespread or systematic practice of enforced disappearances constitutes a crime against humanity it gives victims families the right to seek reparations and to demand the truth about the disappearance of their loved ones the convention provides for the right not to be subjected to enforced disappearance as well as the right for the relatives of the disappeared person to know the truth the convention contains several provisions concerning prevention investigation and sanctioning of this crime as well as the rights of victims and their relatives and the wrongful removal of children born during their captivity the convention further sets forth the obligation of international co-operation both in the suppression of the practice and in dealing with humanitarian aspects related to the crime the convention establishes a committee on enforced disappearances which will be charged with important and innovative functions of monitoring and protection at international level currently an international campaign of the international coalition against enforced disappearances is working towards universal ratification of the convention
disappearances work on two levels not only do they silence opponents and critics who have disappeared but they also create uncertainty and fear in the wider community silencing others who would oppose and criticise disappearances entail the violation of many fundamental human rights for the disappeared person these include the right to liberty the right to personal security and humane treatment (including freedom from torture) the right to a fair trial to legal counsel and to equal protection under the law and the right of presumption of innocence among others their families who often spend the rest of their lives searching for information on the disappeared are also victims

=== algeria ===
during the algerian civil war which began in 1992 as islamist guerrillas attacked the military government which had annulled an islamist electoral victory thousands of people were forcibly disappeared disappearances continued up to the late 1990s but thereafter dropped off sharply with the decline in violence in 1997 some of the disappeared were kidnapped or killed by the guerrillas but others are presumed to have been taken by state security services this latter group has become the most controversial their exact numbers remain disputed but the government has acknowledged a figure of just over 6,000 disappeared now presumed dead opposition sources claim the real number is closer to 17,000 (the war claimed a total toll of 150200,000 deaths)
in 2005 a controversial amnesty law was approved in a referendum it granted financial compensation to families of the disappeared but also effectively ended the police investigations into the crimes
=== argentina ===
during argentina's dirty war and operation condor many alleged political dissidents were abducted or illegally detained and kept in clandestine detention centres such as esma where they were questioned tortured and sometimes killed the disappeared ones were people who were considered to be a political or ideological threat to the military junta the argentine military justified torture to obtain intelligence and saw the disappearances as a way to curb political dissidence whenever the female captives were pregnant their children were stolen away right after giving birth while they themselves remained detained it is estimated that 500 young children and infants were given to families with close ties to the military to be raised
eventually many of the captives were heavily drugged and loaded onto aircraft from which they were thrown alive while in flight over the atlantic ocean in the so-called death flights or (vuelos de la muerte) so as to leave no trace of their death without any dead bodies the government could easily deny any knowledge of their whereabouts and any accusations that they had been killed in addition the forced disappearances was the military junta's attempt to silence the opposition and break the determination of the guerrillas people murdered in this way (and in others) are today referred to as the disappeared (los desaparecidos)
there is an activist group called mothers of the plaza de mayo formed by mothers of those victims of the dictatorship in addition a similar group was formed grandmothers of the plaza de mayo with the goal of finding the children stolen by the argentine government during the dirty war
the phrase was recognized by de facto president general jorge rafael videla who said in a press conference they are neither dead nor alive they are desaparecidos (missing) it is thought that in argentina between 1976 and 1983 up to 30,000 people (8,960 named cases according to the official report by the conadep) were killed or disappeared according to a declassified cable an estimate by the argentine 601st intelligence battalion in mid-july 1978 (which started counting victims in 1975) produced a figure of 22,000 persons killed or disappeared"this document was first published by john dinges in 2004

=== chile ===
almost immediately after the military's seizure of power on 11 september 1973 the chilean military junta banned all the leftist parties that had constituted the democratically-elected president salvador allende's up coalition all other parties were placed in indefinite recess and were later banned outright the regime's violence was directed not only against dissidents but also against their families and other civilians [see missing (1982)]
the rettig report concluded 2,279 persons who disappeared during the military dictatorship were killed for political reasons or as a result of political violence and approximately 31,947 tortured according to the later valech report while 1,312 were exiled the latter were chased all over the world by the intelligence agencies in latin america this was made under the auspices of operation condor a combined operation between the intelligence agencies of various south american countries assisted by a united states central intelligence agency (cia) communication base in panama pinochet justified these operations as being necessary in order to save the country from communism
some political scientists have ascribed the relative bloodiness of the coup to the stability of the existing democratic system which required extreme action to overturn some of the most famous cases of human rights violations occurred during the early period in october 1973 at least 70 people were killed throughout the country by the caravan of death charles horman a us journalist disappeared as did vctor olea alegra a member of the socialist party and many others in 1973 mathematician boris weisfeiler is thought to have disappeared near colonia dignidad a german colony founded by anti-communist paul schfer in chile which was used as a detention center by the dina the secret police
furthermore many other important officials of allende's government were tracked down by the direccin de inteligencia nacional (dinathe chilean secret police) during operation condor thus general carlos prats pinochet's predecessor and army commander under allende who had resigned rather than support the moves against allende's government was assassinated by a car bomb in buenos aires argentina in 1974 a year later the deaths of 119 opponents abroad was claimed as the product of infighting between marxist factions the dina setting up a disinformation campaign to propagate this thesis operation colombo the campaign was legitimized and supported by the leading newspaper in chile el mercurio
other victims of condor included among hundreds of less famous persons juan jos torres the former president of bolivia assassinated in buenos aires on 2 june 1976 carmelo soria a un diplomat working for the cepal assassinated in july 1976 and orlando letelier a former chilean ambassador to the united states and minister in allende's cabinet assassinated after his release from internment and exile in washington d.c by a car bomb on 21 september 1976 this led to strained relations with the us and to the extradition of michael townley a us citizen who worked for the dina and had organized letelier's assassination other targeted victims who escaped assassination included christian-democrat politician bernardo leighton who barely escaped an assassination attempt in rome in 1975 by the italian neo-fascist terrorist stefano delle chiaie (the assassination attempt seriously injured leighton and his wife anita fresno leaving her permanently disabled) carlos altamirano the leader of the chilean socialist party targeted for murder in 1975 by pinochet along with volodia teitelboim writer and member of the communist party pascal allende the nephew of salvador allende and president of the mir who escaped an assassination attempt in costa rica in march 1976 and us congressman edward koch who became aware in 2001 of the relationship between death threats he received and his denunciation of operation condor furthermore according to current investigations eduardo frei montalva the christian democrat president of chile from 1964 to 1970 may have been poisoned in 1982 by a toxin produced by dina biochemist eugenio berrios berros himself is reputed to having been assassinated by chilean intelligence in uruguay after being spirited away to said country in the early 1990s
protests continued however during the 1980s leading to several scandals in march 1985 the gruesome murder of three communist party of chile (pcc) members led to the resignation of csar mendoza head of the chilean gendarmerie the carabineros de chile and member of the junta since its formation during a 1986 protest against pinochet 21-year-old american photographer rodrigo rojas denegri and 18-year-old student carmen gloria quintana were burnt alive killing rojas
in august 1989 marcelo barrios andres a 21-year-old member of the manuel rodrguez patriotic front (fpmr the armed wing of the pcc created in 1983 which had attempted to assassinate pinochet on 7 september 1986) was assassinated by a group of military personnel who were supposed to arrest him on orders of valparaso's public prosecutor however they simply summarily executed him this case was included in the rettig report among the killed and disappeared during the military dictatorship were 440 mir guerrillas
