creatine kinase ck also known creatine phosphokinase cpk phosphocreatine kinase enzyme ec expressed various tissues cell types ck catalyses conversion creatine utilizes adenosine triphosphate atp create phosphocreatine pcr adenosine diphosphate adp ck enzyme reaction reversible thus atp generated pcr adp
tissues cells consume atp rapidly especially skeletal muscle also brain photoreceptor cells retina hair cells inner ear spermatozoa smooth muscle pcr serves energy reservoir rapid buffering regeneration atp situ well intracellular energy transport pcr shuttle circuit thus creatine kinase important enzyme tissues
clinically creatine kinase assayed blood tests marker damage ckrich tissue myocardial infarction heart attack rhabdomyolysis severe muscle breakdown muscular dystrophy autoimmune myositides acute renal failure
typesedit
cells cytosolic ck enzymes consist two subunits either b brain type m muscle type therefore three different isoenzymes ckmm ckbb ckmb genes subunits located different chromosomes b q m q addition three cytosolic ck isoforms two mitochondrial creatine kinase isoenzymes ubiquitous sarcomeric form functional entity latter two mitochondrial ck isoforms octamer consisting four dimers
mitochondrial creatine kinase directly involved formation phosphocreatine mitochondrial atp cytosolic ck regenerates atp adp using pcr happens intracellular sites atp used cell ck acting situ atp regenerator
isoenzyme patterns differ tissues skeletal muscle expresses ckmm low levels ckmb myocardium heart muscle contrast expresses ckmm ckmb ckbb predominantly expressed brain smooth muscle including vascular uterine tissue

laboratory testingedit
ck often determined routinely medical laboratory used determined specifically patients chest pain test replaced troponin normal values rest usually iul one unit enzyme activity specifically amount enzyme catalyze mol substrate per minute specified conditions temperature ph substrate concentrations activators test specific type ck elevated

furthermore isoenzyme determination used extensively indication myocardial damage heart attacks troponin measurement largely replaced many hospitals although centers still rely ckmb
