maxwells equations lead prediction electromagnetic waves vacuum transverse electric fields magnetic fields vary perpendicularly direction propagation however waves exist plasmas confined spaces called plasma waves longitudinal transverse mixture plasma waves also occur forcefree magnetic fields
early development electromagnetism like alexandru proca known developing relativistic quantum field equations bearing name procas equations massive vector spin mesons recent decades extended electromagnetic theorists jeanpierre vigier bo lehnert swedish royal society used proca equation attempt demonstrate photon mass longitudinal electromagnetic component maxwells equations suggesting longitudinal electromagnetic waves could exist dirac polarized vacuum
heavisides attempts generalize maxwells equations heaviside came conclusion electromagnetic waves found longitudinal waves free space homogeneous media maxwells equations lead appearance longitudinal waves circumstances example plasma waves guided waves basically distinct freespace waves studied hertz uhf experiments zenneck waves longitudinal modes resonant cavity particular standing wave patterns formed waves confined cavity longitudinal modes correspond wavelengths wave reinforced constructive interference many reflections cavitys reflecting surfaces recently haifeng wang et al proposed method generate longitudinal electromagnetic light wave free space wave propagate without divergence wavelengths
