seismic waves waves energy travel earths layers result earthquake explosion volcano gives lowfrequency acoustic energy many natural anthropogenic sources create lowamplitude waves commonly referred ambient vibrations seismic waves studied geophysicists called seismologists seismic wave fields recorded seismometer hydrophone water accelerometer
propagation velocity waves depends density elasticity medium velocity tends increase depth ranges approximately kms earths crust kms deep mantle
earthquakes create distinct types waves different velocities reaching seismic observatories different travel times help scientists locate source hypocenter geophysics refraction reflection seismic waves used research structure earths interior manmade vibrations often generated investigate shallow subsurface structures
types
among many types seismic waves one make broad distinction body waves surface waves
body waves travel interior earth
surface waves travel across surface surface waves decay slowly distance body waves travel three dimensions
particle motion surface waves larger body waves surface waves tend cause damage
modes wave propagation exist described article though comparatively minor importance earthborne waves important case asteroseismology
body waves
body waves travel interior earth create raypaths refracted varying density modulus stiffness earths interior density modulus turn vary according temperature composition phase effect resembles refraction light waves includes primary secondary waves
primary waves
primary waves pwaves compressional waves longitudinal nature p waves pressure waves travel faster waves earth arrive seismograph stations first hence name primary waves travel type material including fluids travel nearly twice speed waves air take form sound waves hence travel speed sound typical speeds ms air ms water ms granite

p waves earths mantle core
earthquake occurs seismographs near epicenter able record p waves greater distance longer detect high frequencies first wave since shear waves cannot pass liquids phenomenon original evidence wellestablished observation earth liquid outer core demonstrated richard dixon oldham kind observation also used argue seismic testing moon solid core although recent geodetic studies suggest core still molten

spkikp wave path begins traveling towards surface swave surface reflects pwave pwave travels outer core inner core outer core mantle
usefulness p waves locating event
case local nearby earthquakes difference arrival times p waves used determine distance event case earthquakes occurred global distances three geographically diverse observing stations using common clock recording pwave arrivals permits computation unique time location planet event typically dozens even hundreds pwave arrivals used calculate hypocenters misfit generated hypocenter calculation known residual residuals second less typical distant events residuals typical local events meaning reported p arrivals fit computed hypocenter well typically location program start assuming event occurred depth km minimizes residual adjusting depth events occur depths shallower km occur deep km
quick way determine distance location origin seismic wave less km away take difference arrival time p wave wave seconds multiply kilometers per second modern seismic arrays use complicated earthquake location techniques
teleseismic distances first arriving p waves necessarily travelled deep mantle perhaps even refracted outer core planet travelling back earths surface seismographic stations located waves travel quickly traveled straight line earthquake due appreciably increased velocities within planet termed huygens principle density planet increases depth would slow waves modulus rock increases much deeper means faster therefore longer route take shorter time
travel time must calculated accurately order compute precise hypocenter since p waves move many kilometers per second traveltime calculation even half second mean error many kilometers terms distance practice p arrivals many stations used errors cancel computed epicenter likely quite accurate order km around world dense arrays nearby sensors exist california provide accuracy roughly kilometer much greater accuracy possible timing measured directly crosscorrelation seismogram waveforms
