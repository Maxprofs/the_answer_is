endocrine glands glands endocrine system secrete products hormones directly blood rather duct major glands endocrine system include pineal gland pituitary gland pancreas ovaries testes thyroid gland parathyroid gland hypothalamus adrenal glands hypothalamus pituitary gland neuroendocrine organs local chemical messengers generally considered part endocrine system include autocrines act cells secrete paracrines act different cell type nearby
ability target cell respond hormone depends presence receptors within cell plasma membrane hormone bind
hormone receptors dynamic structures changes number sensitivity hormone receptors may occur response high low levels stimulating hormones
blood levels hormones reflect balance secretion degradationexcretion liver kidneys major organs degrade hormones breakdown products excreted urine feces
hormone halflife duration activity limited vary hormone hormone
interaction hormones target cellsedit
permissiveness situation hormone cannot exert full effects without presence another hormone
synergyism occurs two hormones produce effects target cell results amplified
antagonism occurs hormone opposes reverses effect another hormone
control hormone releaseedit
endocrine organs activated release hormones humoral neural hormonal stimuli negative feedback important regulating hormone levels blood
nervous system acting hypothalamic controls certain cases override modulate hormonal effects
major endocrine organsedit
pituitary gland hypophysisedit
pituitary gland hangs base brain stalk enclosed bone consists hormoneproducing glandular portion anterior pituitary neural portion posterior pituitary extension hypothalamus hypothalamus regulates hormonal output anterior pituitary synthesizes two hormones exports posterior pituitary storage later release
four six adenohypophyseal hormones tropic hormones regulate function endocrine organs anterior pituitary hormones exhibit diurnal rhythm release subject modification stimuli influencing hypothalamus
somatotropic hormone growth hormone gh anabolic hormone stimulates growth body tissues especially skeletal muscle bone may act directly indirectly via insulinlike growth factors igfs gh mobilizes fats stimulates protein synthesis inhibits glucose uptake metabolism secretion regulated growth hormone releasing hormone ghrh growth hormone inhibiting hormone ghih somatostatin hypersecretion causes gigantism children acromegaly adults hyposecretion children causes pituitary dwarfism
thyroidstimulating hormone tsh promotes normal development activity thyroid gland thyrotropinreleasing hormone trh stimulates release negative feedback thyroid hormone inhibits
adrenocorticotropic hormone acth stimulates adrenal cortex release corticosteroids acth release triggered corticotropinreleasing hormone crh inhibited rising glucocorticoid levels
gonadotropinsfolliclestimulating hormone fsh luteinizing hormone lh regulate functions gonads sexes fsh stimulates sex cell production lh stimulates gonadal hormone production gonadotropin levels rise response gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh negative feedback gonadal hormones inhibits gonadotropin release
prolactin prl promotes milk production humans females secretion prompted prolactinreleasing hormone prh inhibited prolactininhibiting hormone pih
neurohypophysis stores releases two hypothalamic hormones
oxytocin stimulates powerful uterine contractions trigger labor delivery infant milk ejection nursing women release mediated reflexively hypothalamus represents positive feedback mechanism
antidiuretic hormone adh stimulates kidney tubules reabsorb conserve water resulting small volumes highly concentrated urine decreased plasma osmolarity adh released response high solute concentrations blood inhibited low solute concentrations blood hyposecretion results diabetes insipidus
thyroid glandedit
thyroid gland located anterior throat thyroid follicles store colloid containing thyroglobulin glycoprotein thyroid hormone derived
thyroid hormone th includes thyroxine triiodothyronine increase rate cellular metabolism consequently oxygen use heat production rise
secretion thyroid hormone prompted tsh requires reuptake stored colloid follicle cells splitting hormones colloid release rising levels thyroid hormone feed back inhibit pituitary hypothalamus
converted active form target tissues hormones act turning gene protein synthesis
graves disease common cause hyperthyroidism hyposecretion causes cretinism infants myxoedema adults
calcitonin produced parafollicular cells thyroid gland response rising blood calcium levels depresses blood calcium levels inhibiting bone matrix resorption enhancing calcium deposit bone
parathyroid glandsedit
parathyroid glands located dorsal aspect thyroid gland secrete parathyroid hormone pth causes increase blood calcium levels targeting bone intestine kidneys pth antagonist calcitonin pth release triggered falling blood calcium levels inhibited rising blood calcium levels
hyperparathyroidism results hypercalcaemia effects extreme bone wasting hypoparathyroidism leads hypocalcaemia evidenced tetany respiratory paralysis
pancreasedit
pancreas located abdomen close stomach exocrine endocrine gland endocrine portion islets langerhans releases insulin glucagon smaller amounts hormones blood
glucagon released alpha cells glucose level blood low stimulates liver release glucose blood
insulin released beta cells blood levels glucose amino acids rising increases rate glucose uptake metabolism body cells hyposecretion insulin results diabetes mellitus cardinal signs polyuria polydipsia polyphagia
gonadsedit
ovaries female located pelvic cavity release two main hormones secretion estrogens ovarian follicles begins puberty influence fsh estrogens stimulate maturation female reproductive system development secondary sexual characteristics progesterone released response high blood levels lh works estrogens establishing menstrual cycle
testes male begin produce testosterone puberty response lh testosterone promotes maturation male reproductive organs development secondary sex characteristics production sperm testes
pineal glandedit
pineal gland located diencephalon primary hormone melatonin influences daily rhythms may antigonadotropic effect humans
hormoneproducing structuresedit
many body organs normally considered endocrine organs contain isolated cell clusters secrete hormones examples include heart atrial natriuretic peptide gastrointestinal tract organs gastrin secretin others placenta hormones pregnancyestrogen progesterone others kidneys erythropoietin renin thymus skin cholecalciferol adipose tissue leptin resistin
developmental aspects endocrine systemsedit
endocrine glands derive three germ layers derived mesoderm produce steroidal hormones others produce amino acidbased hormones
natural decrease function females ovaries late middle age results menopause efficiency endocrine glands seems decrease gradually aging occurs leads generalized increase incidence diabetes mellitus lower metabolic rate
