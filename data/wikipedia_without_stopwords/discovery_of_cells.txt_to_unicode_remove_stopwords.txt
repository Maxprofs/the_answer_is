biology cell theory scientific theory describes properties cells cells basic unit structure organisms also basic unit reproduction continual improvements made microscopes time magnification technology advanced enough discover cells th century discovery largely attributed robert hooke began scientific study cells also known cell biology century later many debates cells began amongst scientists debates involved nature cellular regeneration idea cells fundamental unit life cell theory eventually formulated usually credited matthias schleiden theodor schwann however many scientists like rudolf virchow contributed theory cell theory become foundation biology widely accepted explanation function cells
three tenets cell theory described
living organisms composed one cells
cell basic unit structure organization organisms
cells come preexisting cells
microscopes
discovery cell made possible invention microscope first century bc romans able make glass discovering objects appeared larger glass italy th century salvino darmate made piece glass fit one eye allowing magnification effect eye dutch spectacle maker zacharias jansen began test lenses progress made microscopes jansen able obtain x magnification objects appeared blurry jansen father built first compound microscope simple glasses able magnify objects considered microscope compound microscope defined two lenses hollow tube robert hooke used microscope six inches long two convex lenses inside examined specimens reflected light observations book micrographia hooke also used simpler microscope single lens examining specimens direct transmitted light allowed clearer image
however first real invention use microscope anton van leeuwenhoek dutch draper took interest microscopes seeing one apprenticeship amsterdam point life able learn grind lenses eventually led leeuwenhoek making microscope instead simple powerful magnifying glasses rather compound microscope able use single lens small glass sphere allowed magnification x large progression since magnification maximum x leeuwenhoek much progress microscopes two hundred years later carl zeiss german engineer manufactured microscopes began make changes lenses used optical quality improve hired otto schott eventually ernst abbe
microscopes could focus objects size wavelength larger giving restrictions still advancement discoveries objects smaller wavelength later electron microscope developed making possible view objects smaller wavelength changing possibilities science
discovery cells
cell first discovered robert hooke found described book micrographia book gave observations detail various objects coarse compound microscope one observation thin slices bottle cork hooke discovered multitude tiny pores named cells came latin word cella meaning small room like monks lived also cellulae meant six sided cell honeycomb however hooke know real structure function hooke thought cells actually empty cell walls plant tissues microscopes time low magnification hooke unable see internal components cells observing therefore think cellulae alive cell observations gave indication nucleus organelles found living cells micrographia hooke also observed mould bluish color found leather studying microscope unable observe seeds would indicated mould multiplying quantity led hooke suggesting spontaneous generation either natural artificial heat cause since old aristotelian theory still accepted time others reject disproved leeuwenhoek later discovers generation achieved otherwise
anton van leeuwenhoek another scientist saw cells soon hooke made use microscope containing improved lenses could magnify objects almost fold x microscopes leeuwenhoek found motile objects letter royal society october states motility quality life therefore living organisms time wrote many papers described many specific forms microorganisms leeuwenhoek named animalcules included protozoa unicellular organisms like bacteria though much formal education able identify first accurate description red blood cells discovered bacteria gaining interest sense taste resulted leeuwenhoek observe tongue ox leading study pepper water also found first time sperm cells animals humans discovering types cells leeuwenhoek saw fertilization process requires sperm cell enter egg cell put end previous theory spontaneous generation reading letters leeuwenhoek hooke first confirm observations thought unlikely contemporaries
cells animal tissues observed plants tissues fragile susceptible tearing difficult thin slices prepared studying biologists believed fundamental unit life unsure would hundred years later fundamental unit connected cellular structure existence cells animals plants conclusion made henri dutrochet besides stating cell fundamental element organization dutrochet also claimed cells structural unit also physiological unit
karl rudolphi jhf link awarded prize solving problem nature cells meaning first prove cells independent cell walls knigliche societt der wissenschaft royal society science gttingen thought cells shared walls fluid passed way
cell theory
credit developing cell theory usually given two scientists theodor schwann matthias jakob schleiden rudolf virchow contributed theory credited attributions toward schleiden suggested every structural part plant made cells result cells also suggested cells made crystallization process either within cells outside however original idea schlieden claimed theory though barthelemy dumortier stated years crystallization process longer accepted modern cell theory theodor schwann states along plants animals composed cells product cells structures major advancement field biology since little known animal structure point compared plants conclusions plants animals two three tenets cell theory postulated
living organisms composed one cells
cell basic unit life
schleidens theory free cell formation crystallization refuted robert remak rudolf virchow albert kolliker rudolf virchow added third tenet cell theory latin tenet states omnis cellula e cellula translated
cells arise preexisting cells
however idea cells come preexisting cells fact already proposed robert remak suggested virchow plagiarized remak give credit remak published observations cell division claiming schleiden schawnn incorrect generation schemes instead said binary fission first introduced dumortier reproduction new animal cells made tenet added classical cell theory complete
modern interpretation
generally accepted parts modern cell theory include
known living things made one cells
living cells arise preexisting cells division
cell fundamental unit structure function living organisms
activity organism depends total activity independent cells
energy flow metabolism biochemistry occurs within cells
cells contain dna found specifically chromosome rna found cell nucleus cytoplasm
cells basically chemical composition organisms similar species
modern version cell theory
modern version cell theory includes ideas
energy flow occurs within cells
heredity information dna passed cell cell
cells basic chemical composition
opposing concepts cell theory history background
cell first discovered robert hooke using microscope first cell theory credited work theodor schwann matthias jakob schleiden theory internal contents cells called protoplasm described jellylike substance sometimes called living jelly time colloidal chemistry began development concepts bound water emerged colloid something solution suspension brownian motion sufficient prevent sedimentation idea semipermeable membrane barrier permeable solvent impermeable solute molecules developed time term osmosis originated importance physiological phenomena realized wasnt botanist pfeffer proposed membrane theory cell physiology view cell seen enclosed thin surface plasma membrane cell water solutes potassium ion existed physical state like dilute solution hamburger used hemolysis erythrocytes determine permeability various solutes measuring time required cells swell past elastic limit rate solutes entered cells could estimated accompanying change cell volume also found apparent nonsolvent volume red blood cells later showed includes water hydration addition protein nonsolvent components cells
