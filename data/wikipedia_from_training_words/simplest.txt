in geometry a simplex (plural simplexes or simplices) is a generalization of the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimensions specifically a k-simplex is a k-dimensional polytope which is the convex hull of its k + 1 vertices more formally suppose the k + 1 points are affinely independent which means are linearly independent then the simplex determined by them is the set of points
for example a 2-simplex is a triangle a 3-simplex is a tetrahedron and a 4-simplex is a 5-cell a single point may be considered a 0-simplex and a line segment may be considered a 1-simplex a simplex may be defined as the smallest convex set containing the given vertices
a regular simplex is a simplex that is also a regular polytope a regular n-simplex may be constructed from a regular (n 1)-simplex by connecting a new vertex to all original vertices by the common edge length
in topology and combinatorics it is common to glue together simplices to form a simplicial complex the associated combinatorial structure is called an abstract simplicial complex in which context the word simplex simply means any finite set of vertices
== examples ==
a 0-simplex is a point
a 1-simplex is a line segment
a 2-simplex is a triangle
a 3-simplex is a tetrahedron
== elements ==
the convex hull of any nonempty subset of the n+1 points that define an n-simplex is called a face of the simplex faces are simplices themselves in particular the convex hull of a subset of size m+1 (of the n+1 defining points) is an m-simplex called an m-face of the n-simplex the 0-faces (i.e. the defining points themselves as sets of size 1) are called the vertices (singular vertex) the 1-faces are called the edges the (n 1)-faces are called the facets and the sole n-face is the whole n-simplex itself in general the number of m-faces is equal to the binomial coefficient  consequently the number of m-faces of an n-simplex may be found in column (m + 1) of row (n + 1) of pascal's triangle a simplex a is a coface of a simplex b if b is a face of a face and facet can have different meanings when describing types of simplices in a simplicial complex see simplical complex for more detail
the regular simplex family is the first of three regular polytope families labeled by coxeter as n the other two being the cross-polytope family labeled as n and the hypercubes labeled as n a fourth family the infinite tessellation of hypercubes he labeled as n
the number of 1-faces (edges) of the n-simplex is the (n-1)th triangle number the number of 2-faces of the n-simplex is the (n-2)th tetrahedron number the number of 3-faces of the n-simplex is the (n-3)th 5-cell number and so on
an (n+1)-simplex can be constructed as a join ( operator) of an n-simplex and a point ( ) an (m+n+1)-simplex can be constructed as a join of an m-simplex and an n-simplex the two simplices are oriented to be completely normal from each other with translation in a direction orthogonal to both of them a 1-simplex is a joint of two points ( )( ) = 2.( ) a general 2-simplex (scalene triangle) is the join of 3 points ( )( )( ) an isosceles triangle is the join of a 1-simplex and a point { }( ) an equilateral triangle is 3.( ) or {3} a general 3-simplex is the join of 4 points ( )( )( )( ) a 3-simplex with mirror symmetry can be expressed as the join of an edge and 2 points { }( )( ) a 3-simplex with triangular symmetry can be expressed as the join of an equilateral triangle and 1 point 3.( )( ) or {3}( ) a regular tetrahedron is 4.( ) or {3,3} and so on
in some conventions the empty set is defined to be a (1)-simplex the definition of the simplex above still makes sense if n = 1 this convention is more common in applications to algebraic topology (such as simplicial homology) than to the study of polytopes
== symmetric graphs of regular simplices ==
these petrie polygon (skew orthogonal projections) show all the vertices of the regular simplex on a circle and all vertex pairs connected by edges
== the standard simplex ==
the standard n-simplex (or unit n-simplex) is the subset of rn+1 given by
the simplex n lies in the affine hyperplane obtained by removing the restriction ti 0 in the above definition
the n+1 vertices of the standard n-simplex are the points ei rn+1 where
e0 = (1 0 0  0)
e1 = (0 1 0  0)
en = (0 0 0  1)
there is a canonical map from the standard n-simplex to an arbitrary n-simplex with vertices (v0  vn) given by
the coefficients ti are called the barycentric coordinates of a point in the n-simplex such a general simplex is often called an affine n-simplex to emphasize that the canonical map is an affine transformation it is also sometimes called an oriented affine n-simplex to emphasize that the canonical map may be orientation preserving or reversing
more generally there is a canonical map from the standard -simplex (with n vertices) onto any polytope with n vertices given by the same equation (modifying indexing)
these are known as generalized barycentric coordinates and express every polytope as the image of a simplex
=== examples ===
0 is the point 1 in r1
1 is the line segment joining (1,0) and (0,1) in r2
2 is the equilateral triangle with vertices (1,0,0) (0,1,0) and (0,0,1) in r3
3 is the regular tetrahedron with vertices (1,0,0,0) (0,1,0,0) (0,0,1,0) and (0,0,0,1) in r4
=== increasing coordinates ===
an alternative coordinate system is given by taking the indefinite sum
this yields the alternative presentation by order namely as nondecreasing n-tuples between 0 and 1
geometrically this is an n-dimensional subset of (maximal dimension codimension 0) rather than of (codimension 1) the facets which on the standard simplex correspond to one coordinate vanishing here correspond to successive coordinates being equal while the interior corresponds to the inequalities becoming strict (increasing sequences)
a key distinction between these presentations is the behavior under permuting coordinates the standard simplex is stabilized by permuting coordinates while permuting elements of the ordered simplex do not leave it invariant as permuting an ordered sequence generally makes it unordered indeed the ordered simplex is a (closed) fundamental domain for the action of the symmetric group on the n-cube meaning that the orbit of the ordered simplex under the n elements of the symmetric group divides the n-cube into mostly disjoint simplices (disjoint except for boundaries) showing that this simplex has volume alternatively the volume can be computed by an iterated integral whose successive integrands are
a further property of this presentation is that it uses the order but not addition and thus can be defined in any dimension over any ordered set and for example can be used to define an infinite-dimensional simplex without issues of convergence of sums
=== projection onto the standard simplex ===
especially in numerical applications of probability theory a projection onto the standard simplex is of interest given with possibly negative entries the closest point on the simplex has coordinates
where is chosen such that
can be easily calculated from sorting  the sorting approach takes complexity which can be improved to complexity via median-finding algorithms projecting onto the simplex is computationally similar to projecting onto the ball
=== corner of cube ===
finally a simple variant is to replace summing to 1 with summing to at most 1 this raises the dimension by 1 so to simplify notation the indexing changes
this yields an n-simplex as a corner of the n-cube and is a standard orthogonal simplex this is the simplex used in the simplex method which is based at the origin and locally models a vertex on a polytope with n facets
== cartesian coordinates for regular n-dimensional simplex in rn ==
the coordinates of the vertices of a regular n-dimensional simplex can be obtained from these two properties
for a regular simplex the distances of its vertices to its center are equal
the angle subtended by any two vertices of an n-dimensional simplex through its center is
these can be used as follows let vectors (v0 v1  vn) represent the vertices of an n-simplex center the origin all unit vectors so a distance 1 from the origin satisfying the first property the second property means the dot product between any pair of the vectors is  this can be used to calculate positions for them
for example in three dimensions the vectors (v0 v1 v2 v3) are the vertices of a 3-simplex or tetrahedron write these as
choose the first vector v0 to have all but the first component zero so by the first property it must be (1 0 0) and the vectors become
by the second property the dot product of v0 with all other vectors is -13 so each of their x components must equal this and the vectors become
next choose v1 to have all but the first two elements zero the second element is the only unknown it can be calculated from the first property using the pythagorean theorem (choose any of the two square roots) and so the second vector can be completed
the second property can be used to calculate the remaining y components by taking the dot product of v1 with each and solving to give
from which the z components can be calculated using the pythagorean theorem again to satisfy the first property the two possible square roots giving the two results
this process can be carried out in any dimension using n + 1 vectors applying the first and second properties alternately to determine all the values
== geometric properties ==
=== volume ===
the oriented volume of an n-simplex in n-dimensional space with vertices (v0  vn) is
where each column of the n n determinant is the difference between the vectors representing two vertices a derivation of a very similar formula can be found in without the 1/n it is the formula for the volume of an n-parallelepiped one way to understand the 1/n factor is as follows if the coordinates of a point in a unit n-box are sorted together with 0 and 1 and successive differences are taken then since the results add to one the result is a point in an n simplex spanned by the origin and the closest n vertices of the box the taking of differences was a unimodular (volume-preserving) transformation but sorting compressed the space by a factor of n
the volume under a standard n-simplex (i.e between the origin and the simplex in rn+1) is
the volume of a regular n-simplex with unit side length is
as can be seen by multiplying the previous formula by xn+1 to get the volume under the n-simplex as a function of its vertex distance x from the origin differentiating with respect to x at (where the n-simplex side length is 1) and normalizing by the length of the increment  along the normal vector
the dihedral angle of a regular n-dimensional simplex is cos1(1/n) while its central angle is cos1(-1/n)
=== simplexes with an orthogonal corner ===
orthogonal corner means here that there is a vertex at which all adjacent facets are pairwise orthogonal such simplexes are generalizations of right angle triangles and for them there exists an n-dimensional version of the pythagorean theorem
the sum of the squared (n-1)-dimensional volumes of the facets adjacent to the orthogonal corner equals the squared (n-1)-dimensional volume of the facet opposite of the orthogonal corner
where are facets being pairwise orthogonal to each other but not orthogonal to  which is the facet opposite the orthogonal corner
for a 2-simplex the theorem is the pythagorean theorem for triangles with a right angle and for a 3-simplex it is de gua's theorem for a tetrahedron with a cube corner
=== relation to the (n+1)-hypercube ===
the hasse diagram of the face lattice of an n-simplex is isomorphic to the graph of the (n+1)-hypercube's edges with the hypercube's vertices mapping to each of the n-simplex's elements including the entire simplex and the null polytope as the extreme points of the lattice (mapped to two opposite vertices on the hypercube) this fact may be used to efficiently enumerate the simplex's face lattice since more general face lattice enumeration algorithms are more computationally expensive
the n-simplex is also the vertex figure of the (n+1)-hypercube it is also the facet of the (n+1)-orthoplex
=== topology ===
topologically an n-simplex is equivalent to an n-ball every n-simplex is an n-dimensional manifold with corners
=== probability ===
in probability theory the points of the standard n-simplex in -space are the space of possible parameters (probabilities) of the categorical distribution on n+1 possible outcomes
== algebraic topology ==
in algebraic topology simplices are used as building blocks to construct an interesting class of topological spaces called simplicial complexes these spaces are built from simplices glued together in a combinatorial fashion simplicial complexes are used to define a certain kind of homology called simplicial homology
a finite set of k-simplexes embedded in an open subset of rn is called an affine k-chain the simplexes in a chain need not be unique they may occur with multiplicity rather than using standard set notation to denote an affine chain it is instead the standard practice to use plus signs to separate each member in the set if some of the simplexes have the opposite orientation these are prefixed by a minus sign if some of the simplexes occur in the set more than once these are prefixed with an integer count thus an affine chain takes the symbolic form of a sum with integer coefficients
note that each facet of an n-simplex is an affine n-1-simplex and thus the boundary of an n-simplex is an affine n-1-chain thus if we denote one positively oriented affine simplex as
with the denoting the vertices then the boundary of is the chain
it follows from this expression and the linearity of the boundary operator that the boundary of the boundary of a simplex is zero
likewise the boundary of the boundary of a chain is zero 
more generally a simplex (and a chain) can be embedded into a manifold by means of smooth differentiable map  in this case both the summation convention for denoting the set and the boundary operation commute with the embedding that is
where the are the integers denoting orientation and multiplicity for the boundary operator  one has
where is a chain the boundary operation commutes with the mapping because in the end the chain is defined as a set and little more and the set operation always commutes with the map operation (by definition of a map)
a continuous map to a topological space x is frequently referred to as a singular n-simplex
== algebraic geometry ==
since classical algebraic geometry allows to talk about polynomial equations but not inequalities the algebraic standard n-simplex is commonly defined as the subset of affine n+1-dimensional space where all coordinates sum up to 1 (thus leaving out the inequality part) the algebraic description of this set is
which equals the scheme-theoretic description with
the ring of regular functions on the algebraic n-simplex (for any ring )
by using the same definitions as for the classical n-simplex the n-simplices for different dimensions n assemble into one simplicial object while the rings assemble into one cosimplicial object (in the category of schemes resp rings since the face and degeneracy maps are all polynomial)
the algebraic n-simplices are used in higher k-theory and in the definition of higher chow groups
== applications ==
simplices are used in plotting quantities that sum to 1 such as proportions of subpopulations as in a ternary plot
in industrial statistics simplices arise in problem formulation and in algorithmic solution in the design of bread the producer must combine yeast flour water sugar etc in such mixtures only the relative proportions of ingredients matters for an optimal bread mixture if the flour is doubled then the yeast should be doubled such mixture problem are often formulated with normalized constraints so that the nonnegative components sum to one in which case the feasible region forms a simplex the quality of the bread mixtures can be estimated using response surface methodology and then a local maximum can be computed using a nonlinear programming method such as sequential quadratic programming
in operations research linear programming problems can be solved by the simplex algorithm of george dantzig
in geometric design and computer graphics many methods first perform simplicial triangulations of the domain and then fit interpolating polynomials to each simplex
