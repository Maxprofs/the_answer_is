nekton or necton refers to the aggregate of actively swimming aquatic organisms in a body of water
the term was first proposed and used by the german biologist ernst haeckel in 1890 in his book plankton-studien where he contrasted it with plankton the aggregate of passively floating drifting or somewhat motile organisms present in a body of water primarily tiny algae and bacteria small eggs and larvae of marine organisms and protozoa and other minute consumers today it is considered an obsolete term because it does not allow for the meaningful quantifiable distinction between these two groups modern biologists no longer use it
as a guideline nekton were larger and tend to swim largely at biologically high reynolds numbers (>10 and up beyond 10) where inertial flows are the rule and eddies (vortices) are easily shed plankton on the other hand are small and if they swim at all do so at biologically low reynolds numbers (0.001 to 10) where the viscous behavior of water dominates and reversible flows are the rule organisms such as jellyfish and others were considered plankton when they are very small and swim at low reynolds numbers and considered nekton as they grew large enough to swim at high reynolds numbers many animals considered classic examples of nekton (e.g. mola mola squid marlin) start out life as tiny members of the plankton and then it was argued gradually transitioned to nekton as they grew
== oceanic nektonedit ==
oceanic nekton comprised animals largely from three clades
vertebrates formed the largest contribution these animals are supported by either bones or cartilage
mollusks are animals such as squids and scallops
crustaceans are animals such as lobsters and crabs
there are organisms whose initial part of their lives were identified as being planktonic but when they grew and increased in body size they become nektonic a typical example was the medusa of the jellyfish
