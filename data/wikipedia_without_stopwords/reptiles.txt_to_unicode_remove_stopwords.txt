antediluvian monstersedit
beginning th century became clear reptiles amphibians fact quite different animals pierre andr latreille erected class batracia latter dividing tetrapods four familiar classes reptiles amphibians birds mammals
british anatomist thomas henry huxley made latreilles definition popular together richard owen expanded reptilia include various fossil antediluvian monsters including dinosaurs mammallike synapsid dicynodon helped describe possible classification scheme hunterian lectures delivered royal college surgeons huxley grouped vertebrates mammals sauroids ichthyoids latter containing fishes amphibians subsequently proposed names sauropsida ichthyopsida latter two groups
haeckel demonstrated vertebrates could divided based reproductive strategies reptiles birds mammals united amniotic egg
terms sauropsida lizard faces theropsida beast faces used es goodrich distinguish lizards birds relatives one hand sauropsida mammals extinct relatives theropsida goodrich supported division nature hearts blood vessels group features structure forebrain according goodrich lineages evolved earlier stem group protosauria first lizards included animals today considered reptilelike amphibians well early reptiles
dms watson observed first two groups diverged early reptilian history divided goodrichs protosauria also reinterpreted sauropsida theropsida exclude birds mammals respectively thus sauropsida included procolophonia eosuchia millerosauria chelonia turtles squamata lizards snakes rhynchocephalia crocodilia thecodonts paraphyletic basal archosauria nonavian dinosaurs pterosaurs ichthyosaurs sauropterygians
late th century number definitions reptilia offered traits listed lydekker example include single occipital condyle jaw joint formed quadrate articular bones certain characteristics vertebrae animals singled formulations amniotes mammals birds still considered reptiles today
skull openings thcentury classificationedit
synapsidsauropsid division supplemented another approach one split reptiles four subclasses based number position temporal fenestrae openings sides skull behind eyes classification initiated henry fairfield osborn elaborated made popular romers classic vertebrate paleontology four subclasses
anapsida fenestrae cotylosaurs chelonia turtles relatives
synapsida one low fenestra pelycosaurs therapsids mammallike reptiles
euryapsida one high fenestra postorbital squamosal protorosaurs small early lizardlike reptiles marine sauropterygians ichthyosaurs latter called parapsida osborns work
diapsida two fenestrae reptiles including lizards snakes crocodilians dinosaurs pterosaurs
composition euryapsida uncertain ichthyosaurs times considered arisen independently euryapsids given older name parapsida parapsida later discarded group part ichthyosaurs classified incertae sedis euryapsida however four three euryapsida sunk diapsida subclasses remained less universal nonspecialist work throughout th century largely abandoned among recent researchers particular anapsid condition found occur variably among unrelated groups considered useful distinction
phylogenetics modern definitionedit
early st century vertebrate paleontologists beginning adopt phylogenetic taxonomy groups defined way monophyletic groups include descendants particular ancestor reptiles historically defined paraphyletic since exclude birds mammals respectively evolved dinosaurs early therapsids traditionally called reptiles birds closely related crocodilians latter rest extant reptiles colin tudge wrote
mammals clade therefore cladists happy acknowledge traditional taxon mammalia birds clade universally ascribed formal taxon aves mammalia aves fact subclades within grand clade amniota traditional class reptilia clade section clade amniota section left mammalia aves hived cannot defined synapomorphies proper way instead defined combination features features lacks reptiles amniotes lack fur feathers best cladists suggest could say traditional reptilia nonavian nonmammalian amniotes
despite early proposals replacing paraphyletic reptilia monophyletic sauropsida includes birds term never adopted widely applied consistently sauropsida used often content even definition reptilia jacques gauthier proposed cladistic definition reptilia monophyletic nodebased crown group containing turtles lizards snakes crocodilians birds common ancestor descendants actual relationship turtles reptiles yet well understood time gauthiers definition came considered inadequate
variety definitions proposed scientists years following gauthiers paper first new definition attempted adhere standards phylocode published modesto anderson modesto anderson reviewed many previous definitions proposed modified definition intended retain traditional content group keeping stable monophyletic defined reptilia amniotes closer lacerta agilis crocodylus niloticus homo sapiens stembased definition equivalent common definition sauropsida modesto anderson synonymized reptilia since latter well known frequently used unlike previous definitions reptilia however modesto andersons definition includes birds way establish monophyletic clade includes lizards crocodiles

permian reptilesedit
close carboniferous amniotes became dominant tetrapod fauna primitive terrestrial reptiliomorphs still existed synapsid amniotes evolved first truly terrestrial megafauna giant animals form pelycosaurs edaphosaurus carnivorous dimetrodon midpermian period climate became drier resulting change fauna pelycosaurs replaced therapsids

early period modern reptiles crowngroup reptiles evolved split two main lineages archosauromorpha forebears turtles crocodiles dinosaurs lepidosauromorpha predecessors modern lizards tuataras groups remained lizardlike relatively small inconspicuous permian
mesozoic eraedit
close permian saw greatest mass extinction known see permiantriassic extinction event prolonged event due accumulation least two distinct extinction pulses earlier parareptile synapsid megafauna disappeared replaced true reptiles particularly archosauromorphs characterized elongated hind legs erect pose early forms looking somewhat like longlegged crocodiles archosaurs became dominant group triassic period though took million years diversity great animals lived permian archosaurs developed wellknown dinosaurs pterosaurs well ancestors crocodiles since reptiles first rauisuchians dinosaurs dominated mesozoic era interval popularly known age reptiles dinosaurs also developed smaller forms including featherbearing smaller theropods cretaceous period gave rise first true birds

extinction archosaur marine reptile lines end cretaceous reptile diversification continued throughout cenozoic squamates took massive hit ktevent recovering ten million years underwent great radiation event recovered today squamates make majority living reptiles approximately extant species traditional reptiles known birds adding almost twice number mammals represented living species excluding domesticated species
morphology physiologyedit
circulationedit
many squamates turtles threechambered heart consisting two atria one variably partitioned ventricle two aortas lead systemic circulation degree mixing oxygenated deoxygenated blood threechambered heart varies depending species physiological state different conditions deoxygenated blood shunted back body oxygenated blood shunted back lungs variation blood flow hypothesized allow effective thermoregulation longer diving times aquatic species shown fitness advantage
crocodilians anatomically fourchambered heart similar birds also two systemic aortas therefore capable bypassing pulmonary circulation also snake lizard species eg pythons monitor lizards threechambered hearts become functionally fourchambered hearts contraction made possible muscular ridge subdivides ventricle ventricular diastole completely divides ventricular systole ridge squamates capable producing ventricular pressure differentials equivalent seen mammalian avian hearts
metabolismedit
modern reptiles exhibit form coldbloodedness ie mix poikilothermy ectothermy bradymetabolism limited physiological means keeping body temperature constant often rely external sources heat due less stable core temperature birds mammals reptilian biochemistry requires enzymes capable maintaining efficiency greater range temperatures case warmblooded animals optimum body temperature range varies species typically warmblooded animals many lizards falls c f range extreme heatadapted species like american desert iguana dipsosaurus dorsalis optimal physiological temperatures mammalian range c f optimum temperature often encountered animal active low basal metabolism makes body temperature drop rapidly animal inactive
animals reptilian muscle action produces heat large reptiles like leatherback turtles low surfacetovolume ratio allows metabolically produced heat keep animals warmer environment although warmblooded metabolism form homeothermy called gigantothermy suggested common large dinosaurs extinct largebodied reptiles
benefit low resting metabolism requires far less fuel sustain bodily functions using temperature variations surroundings remaining cold need move reptiles save considerable amounts energy compared endothermic animals size crocodile needs tenth fifth food necessary lion weight live half year without eating lower food requirements adaptive metabolisms allow reptiles dominate animal life regions net calorie availability low sustain largebodied mammals birds
generally assumed reptiles unable produce sustained high energy output necessary long distance chases flying higher energetic capacity might responsible evolution warmbloodedness birds mammals however investigation correlations active capacity thermophysiology show weak relationship extant reptiles carnivores sitandwait feeding strategy whether reptiles cold blooded due ecology metabolism result ecology clear energetic studies reptiles shown active capacities equal greater similar sized warmblooded animals
respirationedit
reptilian lungsedit
reptiles breathe using lungs aquatic turtles developed permeable skin species modified cloaca increase area gas exchange even adaptations breathing never fully accomplished without lungs lung ventilation accomplished differently main reptile group squamates lungs ventilated almost exclusively axial musculature also musculature used locomotion constraint squamates forced hold breath intense runs however found way around varanids lizard species employ buccal pumping complement normal axial breathing allows animals completely fill lungs intense locomotion thus remain aerobically active long time tegu lizards known possess protodiaphragm separates pulmonary cavity visceral cavity actually capable movement allow greater lung inflation taking weight viscera lungs
crocodilians actually muscular diaphragm analogous mammalian diaphragm difference muscles crocodilian diaphragm pull pubis part pelvis movable crocodilians back brings liver thus freeing space lungs expand type diaphragmatic setup referred hepatic piston airways bronchia form number double tubular chambers within lung inhalation exhalation air moves airways direction thus creating unidirectional airflow lungs similar system found birds monitor lizards iguanas
turtles tortoisesedit
turtles tortoises breathe subject much study date species studied thoroughly enough get idea turtles breathe results indicate turtles tortoises found variety solutions problem
difficulty turtle shells rigid allow type expansion contraction amniotes use ventilate lungs turtles indian flapshell lissemys punctata sheet muscle envelops lungs contracts turtle exhale rest turtle retract limbs body cavity force air lungs turtle protracts limbs pressure inside lungs reduced turtle suck air turtle lungs attached inside top shell carapace bottom lungs attached via connective tissue rest viscera using series special muscles roughly equivalent diaphragm turtles capable pushing viscera resulting effective respiration since many muscles attachment points conjunction forelimbs indeed many muscles expand limb pockets contraction
breathing locomotion studied three species show different patterns adult female green sea turtles breathe crutch along nesting beaches hold breath terrestrial locomotion breathe bouts rest north american box turtles breathe continuously locomotion ventilation cycle coordinated limb movements use abdominal muscles breathe locomotion last species studied redeared slider also breathes locomotion takes smaller breaths locomotion small pauses locomotor bouts indicating may mechanical interference limb movements breathing apparatus box turtles also observed breathe completely sealed inside shells
palateedit
reptiles lack secondary palate meaning must hold breath swallowing crocodilians evolved bony secondary palate allows continue breathing remaining submerged protect brains damage struggling prey skinks family scincidae also evolved bony secondary palate varying degrees snakes took different approach extended trachea instead tracheal extension sticks like fleshy straw allows animals swallow large prey without suffering asphyxiation
skinedit
reptilian skin covered horny epidermis making watertight enabling reptiles live dry land contrast amphibians compared mammalian skin reptiles rather thin lacks thick dermal layer produces leather mammals exposed parts reptiles protected scales scutes sometimes bony base forming armor lepidosaurians lizards snakes whole skin covered overlapping epidermal scales scales thought typical class reptilia whole known occur lepidosaurians scales found turtles crocodiles dermal rather epidermal origin properly termed scutes turtles body hidden inside hard shell composed fused scutes
lacking thick dermis reptilian leather strong mammalian leather used leatherwares decorative purposes shoes belts handbags particularly crocodile skin
excretionedit
excretion performed mainly two small kidneys diapsids uric acid main nitrogenous waste product turtles like mammals excrete mainly urea unlike kidneys mammals birds reptile kidneys unable produce liquid urine concentrated body fluid lack specialized structure called loop henle present nephrons birds mammals many reptiles use colon aid reabsorption water also able take water stored bladder excess salts also excreted nasal lingual salt glands reptiles
digestionedit
reptiles insectivorous carnivorous rather simple comparatively short digestive tracts meat fairly simple break digest digestion slower mammals reflecting lower resting metabolism inability divide masticate food poikilotherm metabolism low energy requirements allowing large reptiles like crocodiles large constrictors live single large meal months digesting slowly
modern reptiles predominantly carnivorous early history reptiles several groups produced herbivorous megafauna paleozoic pareiasaurs synapsid dicynodonts mesozoic several lines dinosaurs today turtles predominantly herbivorous reptile group several lines agamas iguanas evolved live wholly partly plants
herbivorous reptiles face problems mastication herbivorous mammals lacking complex teeth mammals many species swallow rocks pebbles called gastroliths aid digestion rocks washed around stomach helping grind plant matter fossil gastroliths found associated ornithopods sauropods though whether actually functioned gastric mill latter disputed salt water crocodiles also use gastroliths ballast stabilizing water helping dive dual function stabilizing ballast digestion aid suggested gastroliths found plesiosaurs
nervesedit
reptilian nervous system contains basic part amphibian brain reptile cerebrum cerebellum slightly larger typical sense organs well developed certain exceptions notably snakes lack external ears middle inner ears present twelve pairs cranial nerves due short cochlea reptiles use electrical tuning expand range audible frequencies
intelligenceedit
reptiles generally considered less intelligent mammals birds size brain relative body much less mammals encephalization quotient one tenth mammals though larger reptiles show complex brain development larger lizards like monitors known exhibit complex behavior including cooperation crocodiles relatively larger brains show fairly complex social structure komodo dragon even known engage play turtles also considered social creatures sometimes switch monogamy promiscuity sexual behavior one study found wood turtles better white rats learning navigate mazes
visionedit
reptiles diurnal animals vision typically adapted daylight conditions color vision advanced visual depth perception amphibians mammals species blind snakes vision reduced
snakes extra sets visual organs loosest sense word form pits sensitive infrared radiation heat heatsensitive pits particularly well developed pit vipers also found boas pythons pits allow snakes sense body heat birds mammals enabling pit vipers hunt rodents dark
reproductionedit
reptiles generally reproduce sexually though capable asexual reproduction reproductive activity occurs cloaca single exitentrance base tail waste also eliminated reptiles copulatory organs usually retracted inverted stored inside body turtles crocodilians male single median penis squamates including snakes lizards possess pair hemipenes one typically used session tuatara however lack copulatory organs male female simply press cloacas together male discharges sperm
reptiles lay amniotic eggs covered leathery calcareous shells amnion chorion allantois present embryonic life eggshell protects crocodile embryo keeps drying flexible allow gas exchange chorion aids gas exchange inside outside egg allows carbon dioxide exit egg oxygen gas enter egg albumin protects embryo serves reservoir water protein allantois sac collects metabolic waste produced embryo amniotic sac contains amniotic fluid protects cushions embryo amnion aids osmoregulation serves saltwater reservoir yolk sac surrounding yolk contains protein fat rich nutrients absorbed embryo via vessels allow embryo grow metabolize air space provides embryo oxygen hatching ensures embryo suffocate hatching larval stages development viviparity ovoviviparity evolved many extinct clades reptiles squamates latter group many species including boas vipers utilize mode reproduction degree viviparity varies species simply retain eggs hatching others provide maternal nourishment supplement yolk yet others lack yolk provide nutrients via structure similar mammalian placenta earliest documented case viviparity reptiles early permian mesosaurs although individuals taxa clade may also oviparous putative isolated egg also found several groups mesozoic marine reptiles also exhibited viviparity mosasaurs ichthyosaurs sauropterygia group include pachypleurosaurs plesiosauria
asexual reproduction identified squamates six families lizards one snake species squamates population females able produce unisexual diploid clone mother form asexual reproduction called parthenogenesis occurs several species gecko particularly widespread teiids especially aspidocelis lacertids lacerta captivity komodo dragons varanidae reproduced parthenogenesis
parthenogenetic species suspected occur among chameleons agamids xantusiids typhlopids
reptiles exhibit temperaturedependent sex determination tdsd incubation temperature determines whether particular egg hatches male female tdsd common turtles crocodiles also occurs lizards tuatara date confirmation whether tdsd occurs snakes
defense mechanismsedit
many small reptiles snakes lizards live ground water vulnerable preyed kinds carnivorous animals thus avoidance common form defense reptiles first sign danger snakes lizards crawl away undergrowth turtles crocodiles plunge water sink sight
camouflage warningedit
reptiles tend avoid confrontation camouflage two major groups reptile predators birds reptiles well developed colour vision thus skins many reptiles cryptic colouration plain mottled gray green brown allow blend background natural environment aided reptiles capacity remaining motionless long periods camouflage many snakes effective people domestic animals typically bitten accidentally step
camouflage fail protect bluetongued skinks try ward attackers displaying blue tongues frillnecked lizard display brightly coloured frill displays used territorial disputes courtship danger arises suddenly flight useless crocodiles turtles lizards snakes hiss loudly confronted enemy rattlesnakes rapidly vibrate tip tail composed series nested hollow beads ward approaching danger
contrast normal drab colouration reptiles lizards genus heloderma gila monster beaded lizard many coral snakes highcontrast warning colouration warning potential predators venomous number nonvenomous north american snake species colourful markings similar coral snake oft cited examples batesian mimicry
alternative defense snakesedit
camouflage always fool predator caught snake species adopt different defensive tactics use complicated set behaviors attacked first elevate head spread skin neck effort look large threatening failure strategy may lead measures practiced particularly cobras vipers closely related species use venom attack venom modified saliva delivered fangs venom gland nonvenomous snakes american corn snake european grass snake play dead danger
defense crocodiliansedit
crocodilian concerned safety gape expose teeth yellow tongue doesnt work crocodilian gets little agitated typically begins make hissing sounds crocodilian start change posture dramatically make look intimidating body inflated increase apparent size absolutely necessary may decide attack enemy
species try bite immediately use heads sledgehammers literally smash opponent rush swim toward threat distance even chasing opponent onto land galloping main weapon crocodiles bite generate high bite force many species also possess caninelike teeth used primarily seizing prey also used fighting display
shedding regenerating tailsedit
geckos skinks lizards captured tail shed part tail structure process called autotomy thus able flee detached tail continue wiggle creating deceptive sense continued struggle distracting predators attention fleeing prey animal detached tails leopard geckos wiggle minutes many species tails separate dramatically intense color rest body encourage potential predators strike tail first shingleback skink species geckos tail short broad resemble head predators may attack rather vulnerable front part
reptiles capable shedding tails partially regenerate period weeks new section however contain cartilage rather bone never grow length original tail often also distinctly discolored compared rest body may lack external sculpting features seen original tail
