potential generally refers to a currently unrealized ability the term is used in a wide variety of fields from physics to the social sciences to indicate things that are in a state where they are able to change in ways ranging from the simple release of energy by objects to the realization of abilities in people examples include
in linguistics the potential mood
the mathematical study of potentials is known as potential theory it is the study of harmonic functions on manifolds this mathematical formulation arises from the fact that in physics the scalar potential is irrotational and thus has a vanishing laplacian the very definition of a harmonic function
in physics a potential may refer to the scalar potential or to the vector potential in either case it is a field defined in space from which many important physical properties may be derived
leading examples are the gravitational potential and the electric potential from which the motion of gravitating or electrically charged bodies may be obtained
specific forces have associated potentials including the coulomb potential the van der waals potential the lennard-jones potential and the yukawa potential
in electrochemistry there are galvani potential volta potential electrode potential standard electrode potential
in thermodynamics potential refers to thermodynamic potential
