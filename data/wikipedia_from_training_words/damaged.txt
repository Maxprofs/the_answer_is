in the apg ii system (2003) for the classification of flowering plants the name asterids denotes a clade (a monophyletic group) common examples include the forget-me-nots nightshades potatoes eggplants tomatoes peppers tobacco petunias morning glory sweet potato coffee lavender lilac olive jasmine honeysuckle ash tree teak snapdragon sesame psyllium garden sage and a number of table herbs such as mint basil and rosemary
most of the taxa belonging to this clade had been referred to the asteridae in the cronquist system (1981) and to the sympetalae in earlier systems the name asterids (not necessarily capitalised) resembles the earlier botanical name but is intended to be the name of a clade rather than a formal ranked name in the sense of the icbn this clade is one of the two most speciose groups of eudicots the other being the rosids it consists of
