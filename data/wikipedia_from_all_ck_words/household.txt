a household consists of one or more people who live in the same dwelling and also share at meals or living accommodation and may consist of a single family or some other grouping of people a single dwelling will be considered to contain multiple households if either meals or living space are not shared the household is the basic unit of analysis in many social microeconomic and government models and is important to the fields of economics and inheritance household models include the family varieties of blended families share housing group homes boarding houses houses in multiple occupation (uk) and a single room occupancy (us) in feudal times the royal household and medieval households of the wealthy would also have included servants and other retainers
== governmentedit ==
for statistical purposes in the united kingdom a household is defined as one person or a group of people who have the accommodation as their only or main residence and for a group either share at least one meal a day or share the living accommodation that is a living room or sitting room
the united states census definition similarly turns on separate living quarters i.e those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building a householder in the u.s census is the person (or one of the people) in whose name the housing unit is owned or rented (maintained); if no person qualifies any adult resident of a housing unit is a householder the u.s government formerly used the terms head of the household and head of the family to describe householders beginning in 1980 these terms were officially dropped from the census and replaced with householder
a household is officially defined as follows
a household includes all the persons who occupy a housing unit a housing unit is a house an apartment a mobile home a group of rooms or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall the occupants may be a single family one person living alone two or more families living together or any other group of related or unrelated persons who share living arrangements (people not living in households are classified as living in group quarters.)
according to statistics canada since july 15 1998 a household is generally defined as being composed of a person or group of persons who co-reside in or occupy a dwelling.
== economic theoriesedit ==
most economic theories assume there is only one income stream to a household this a useful simplification for modeling but does not necessarily reflect reality many households now include multiple income-earning members
most economic models do not address whether the members of a household are a family in the traditional sense government and policy discussions often treat the terms household and family as synonymous especially in western societies where the nuclear family has become the most common family structure in reality there is not always a one-to-one relationship between households and families
== socialedit ==
in social work the household is a residential grouping defined similarly to the above in which housework is divided and performed by householders care may be delivered by one householder to another depending upon their respective needs abilities and perhaps disabilities different household compositions may lead to differential life and health expectations and outcomes for household members eligibility for certain community services and welfare benefits may depend upon household composition
in sociology household work strategy a term coined by ray pahl is the division of labour between members of a household whether implicit or the result of explicit decisionmaking with the alternatives weighed up in a simplified type of cost-benefit analysis it is a plan for the relative deployment of household members time between the three domains of employment i) in the market economy including home-based self-employment second jobs in order to obtain money to buy goods and services in the market ii) domestic production work such as cultivating a vegetable patch or raising chickens purely to supply food to the household and iii) domestic consumption work to provide goods and services directly within the household such as cooking meals childcare household repairs or the manufacture of clothes and gifts household work strategies may vary over the life-cycle as household members age or with the economic environment they may be imposed by one person or be decided collectively
feminism examines the ways that gender roles affect the division of labour within households sociologist arlie russell hochschild in the second shift and the time bind presents evidence that in two-career couples men and women on average spend about equal amounts of time working but women still spend more time on housework cathy young another feminist writer responds to hochschild's assertions by arguing that in some cases women may prevent the equal participation of men in housework and parenting
== household modelsedit ==
household models in anglophone culture include the family and varieties of blended families share housing and group homes for people with support needs other models of living situations which may meet definitions of a household include boarding houses a house in multiple occupation (uk) and a single room occupancy (us)
== historyedit ==
in feudal or aristocratic societies a household may include servants or retainers whether or not they are explicitly so named their roles may blur the line between a family member and an employee in such cases they ultimately derive their income from the household's principal income

historical housing conditions in belgium
a survey carried out by the national housing institute in 1961/62 estimated that out of all the dwellings in belgium 13.8% were unfit and incapable of improvement 19.5% although unfit showed potential for improvement and 54% were considered to be suitable (without alteration or improvement) for modern living standards 74% lacked a shower or bath 19% had inadequate arrangements for sewage disposal 3.6% lacked a proper supply of drinking water and only 36.8% had an internal w.c
postwar housing conditions in france
between 1954 and 1973 the proportion of homes with shower or bath increased from 10% to 65,% while during that same period the percentage of homes without flushing lavatories fell from 73% to 30% and those without running water from 42% to 3.4% a 1948 law permitted gradual long-term rent rises for existing flats on condition that part of the money was spent on repairs according to john ardagh the law vigorously applied was partly successful in its twofold aim to encourage both repairs and new building
