estolas (extremely short take off and landing on any surface) - a hybrid type of an aircraft that is being developed in a project funded by the european commission instead of an airplane's usual long and relatively thin fuselage it will have a bloated central void that can be filled with helium gas to make the aircraft lighter in addition to that vertical lift will be provided by a centrally located horizontal propeller which together with a skirt gives estolas properties of a hovercraft and capability to land and take off from water snow and other surfaces
