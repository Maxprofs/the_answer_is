x (named ex /ks/ plural exes) is the 24th letter in the modern english alphabet and the iso basic latin alphabet
== history ==
in ancient greek  and  were among several variants of the same letter used originally for /k/ and later in western areas such as arcadia as a simplification of the digraph  for /ks/ in the end more conservative eastern forms became the standard of classical greek and thus  (chi) stands for /k/ (later /x/) however the etruscans had taken over  from western greek and it therefore stands for /ks/ in etruscan and latin
the letter  ~  for /k/ was a greek addition to the alphabet placed after the semitic letters along with phi  for /p/ (the variant  later replaced the digraph  for /ps/ omega was a later addition)

in english orthography x is typically pronounced as the voiceless consonant cluster /ks/ when it follows the stressed vowel (e.g ox) and the voiced consonant /z/ when it precedes the stressed vowel (e.g exam) it is also pronounced /z/ when it precedes a silent h and a stressed vowel (e.g exhaust) before i or u it can be pronounced /k/ or // (e.g sexual and luxury) these result from earlier /ksj/ and /zj/ it also makes the sound /k/ in words ending in -xion (typically used only in british-based spellings of the language american spellings tend to use -ction) when x ends a word it is always /ks/ (e.g ax) except in loan words such as faux (see french below)
there are very few english words that start with x (the least amount of any letter) when x does start a word it is usually pronounced /z/ (e.g xylophone xenophobia and xanthan) in rare recent loanwords or foreign proper names it can also be pronounced /s/ (e.g the obsolete vietnamese monetary unit xu) or // (e.g chinese names starting with xi like xiaomi or xinjiang) many of the words that start with x are of greek origin or standardized trademarks (xerox) or acronyms (xc) in abbreviations it can represent trans- (e.g xmit for transmit xfer for transfer) cross- (e.g x-ing for crossing xref for cross-reference) christ- as shorthand for the labarum (e.g xmas for christmas xian for christian) the crys- in crystal (xtal) or various words starting with ex- (e.g xl for extra large xor for exclusive-or)
it is the third least common letter in english (after q and z) with a frequency of about 0.15% in words
