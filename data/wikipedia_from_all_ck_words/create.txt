the endocrine system refers to the collection of glands of an organism that secrete hormones directly into the circulatory system to be carried towards distant target organs the major endocrine glands include the pineal gland pituitary gland pancreas ovaries testes thyroid gland parathyroid gland hypothalamus gastrointestinal tract and adrenal glands the endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts the endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different the endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate and prolonged in their response lasting from a few hours up to weeks the nervous system sends information very quickly and responses are generally short lived in vertebrates the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems the field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology a branch of internal medicine special features of endocrine glands are in general their ductless nature their vascularity and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones in contrast exocrine glands such as salivary glands sweat glands and glands within the gastrointestinal tract tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen
in addition to the specialized endocrine organs mentioned above many other organs that are part of other body systems such as bone kidney liver heart and gonads have secondary endocrine functions for example the kidney secretes endocrine hormones such as erythropoietin and renin hormones can consist of either amino acid complexes steroids eicosanoids leukotrienes or prostaglandins
a number of glands that signal each other in sequence are usually referred to as an axis for example the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
as opposed to endocrine factors that travel considerably longer distances via the circulatory system other signaling molecules such as paracrine factors involved in paracrine signalling diffuse over a relatively short distance
the word endocrine derives from the greek words - endo- inside within, and krinein to separate distinguish
== endocrine organs and known secreted hormones ==
=== hypothalamus ===
=== pineal body (epiphysis) ===
=== pituitary gland (hypophysis) ===
the pituitary gland (or hypophysis) is an endocrine gland about the size of a pea and weighing 0.5 grams (0.018 oz) in humans it is a protrusion off the bottom of the hypothalamus at the base of the brain and rests in a small bony cavity (sella turcica) covered by a dural fold (diaphragma sellae) the pituitary is functionally connected to the hypothalamus by the median eminence via a small tube called the infundibular stem or pituitary stalk the pituitary fossa in which the pituitary gland sits is situated in the sphenoid bone in the middle cranial fossa at the base of the brain the pituitary gland secretes nine hormones that regulate homeostasis and the secretion of other hormones
==== anterior pituitary lobe (adenohypophysis) ====
==== posterior pituitary lobe (neurohypophysis) ====
oxytocin and anti-diuretic hormone are not secreted in the posterior lobe merely stored
=== thyroid ===
=== alimentary system ===
==== stomach ====
==== duodenum (small intestine) ====
==== liver ====
==== pancreas ====
the pancreas is a mixocrine gland and it secretes both enzymes and hormones
=== kidney ===
=== adrenal glands ===
==== adrenal cortex ====
==== adrenal medulla ====
=== reproductive ===
==== testes ====
==== ovarian follicle and corpus luteum ====
==== placenta (when pregnant) ====
==== uterus (when pregnant) ====
=== calcium regulation ===
==== parathyroid ====
==== skin ====
== targets ==
=== heart ===
=== bone marrow ===
=== skeletal muscle ===
in 1998 skeletal muscle was identified as an endocrine organ due to its now well-established role in the secretion of myokines the use of the term myokine to describe cytokines and other peptides produced by muscle as signalling molecules was proposed in 2003
=== adipose tissue ===
signalling molecules released by adipose tissue are referred to as adipokines
== diffuse neuro-endocrine system (dnes) ==
the diffuse neuro-endocrine system (dnes) comprises hormone-secreted cells that have commonalities with neurons and are found in the epithelium of organs of the body
== major endocrine systems ==
the human endocrine system consists of several systems that operate via feedback loops several important feedback systems are mediated via the hypothalamus and pituitary
trh tsh t3/t4
gnrh lh/fsh sex hormones
crh acth cortisol
renin angiotensin aldosterone
leptin vs insulin
== interaction with immune system ==
extensive bidirectional interactions exist between the endocrine system and the immune system cortisol has major immunosuppressive effects and dopamine has immunomodulatory functions on the other hand cytokines produced during inflammation activate the hpa axis at all three levels sensible to negative feedback moreover cytokines stimulate hepcidin release from the liver which is eventually responsible for the anemia of chronic disease
== in other species ==
a neuroendocrine system has been observed in all animals with a nervous system and all vertebrates have an hypothalamus-pituitary axis all vertebrates have a thyroid which in amphibians is also crucial for transformation of larvae into adult form all vertebrates have adrenal gland tissue with mammals unique in having it organized into layers all vertebrates have some form of renin-angiotensin axis and all tetrapods have aldosterone as primary mineralocorticoid
== diseases ==
diseases of the endocrine system are common including conditions such as diabetes mellitus thyroid disease and obesity endocrine disease is characterized by disregulated hormone release (a productive pituitary adenoma) inappropriate response to signaling (hypothyroidism) lack of a gland (diabetes mellitus type 1 diminished erythropoiesis in chronic renal failure) or structural enlargement in a critical site such as the thyroid (toxic multinodular goitre) hypofunction of endocrine glands can occur as a result of loss of reserve hyposecretion agenesis atrophy or active destruction hyperfunction can occur as a result of hypersecretion loss of suppression hyperplastic or neoplastic change or hyperstimulation
endocrinopathies are classified as primary secondary or tertiary primary endocrine disease inhibits the action of downstream glands secondary endocrine disease is indicative of a problem with the pituitary gland tertiary endocrine disease is associated with dysfunction of the hypothalamus and its releasing hormones
as the thyroid and hormones have been implicated in signaling distant tissues to proliferate for example the estrogen receptor has been shown to be involved in certain breast cancers endocrine paracrine and autocrine signaling have all been implicated in proliferation one of the required steps of oncogenesis
== other types of signaling ==
the typical mode of cell signaling in the endocrine system is endocrine signaling however there are also other modes i.e. paracrine autocrine and neuroendocrine signaling purely neurocrine signaling between neurons on the other hand belongs completely to the nervous system
=== autocrine ===
autocrine signaling is a form of signaling in which a cell secretes a hormone or chemical messenger (called the autocrine agent) that binds to autocrine receptors on the same cell leading to changes in the cells
=== paracrine ===
some endocrinologists and clinicians include the paracrine system as part of the endocrine system but there is not consensus paracrines are slower acting targeting cells in the same tissue or organ an example of this is somatostatin which is released by some pancreatic cells and target other pancreatic cells
=== juxtacrine ===
juxtacrine signaling is a type of intercellular communication that is transmitted via oligosaccharide lipid or protein components of a cell membrane and may affect either the emitting cell or the immediately adjacent cells
it occurs between adjacent cells that possess broad patches of closely opposed plasma membrane linked by transmembrane channels known as connexons the gap between the cells can usually be between only 2 and 4 nm
unlike other types of cell signaling (such as paracrine and endocrine) juxtacrine signaling requires physical contact between the two cells involved
juxtacrine signaling has been observed for some growth factors cytokine and chemokine cellular signals
