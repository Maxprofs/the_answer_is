altitude or height (sometimes known as depth) is defined based on the context in which it is used (aviation geometry geographical survey sport and more) as a general definition altitude is a distance measurement usually in the vertical or up direction between a reference datum and a point or object the reference datum also often varies according to the context although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage
vertical distance measurements in the down direction are commonly referred to as depth
== altitude in aviationedit ==
in aviation the term altitude can have several meanings and is always qualified by either explicitly adding a modifier (e.g true altitude") or implicitly through the context of the communication parties exchanging altitude information must be clear which definition is being used
aviation altitude is measured using either mean sea level (msl) or local ground level (above ground level or agl) as the reference datum
pressure altitude divided by 100 feet (30 m) as the flight level and is used above the transition altitude (18,000 feet (5,500 m) in the us but may be as low as 3,000 feet (910 m) in other jurisdictions) so when the altimeter reads 18,000 ft on the standard pressure setting the aircraft is said to be at flight level 180 when flying at a flight level the altimeter is always set to standard pressure (29.92 inhg or 1013.25 hpa)
on the flight deck the definitive instrument for measuring altitude is the pressure altimeter which is an aneroid barometer with a front face indicating distance (feet or metres) instead of atmospheric pressure
there are several types of aviation altitude
indicated altitude is the reading on the altimeter when the altimeter is set to the local barometric pressure at mean sea level in uk aviation radiotelephony usage the vertical distance of a level a point or an object considered as a point measured from mean sea level this is referred to over the radio as altitude.(see qnh)
absolute altitude is the height of the aircraft above the terrain over which it is flying it can be measured using a radar altimeter (or absolute altimeter") also referred to as radar height or feet/metres above ground level (agl)
true altitude is the actual elevation above mean sea level it is indicated altitude corrected for non-standard temperature and pressure
height is the elevation above a ground reference point commonly the terrain elevation in uk aviation radiotelephony usage the vertical distance of a level a point or an object considered as a point measured from a specified datum this is referred to over the radio as height where the specified datum is the airfield elevation (see qfe)
pressure altitude is the elevation above a standard datum air-pressure plane (typically 1013.25 millibars or 29.92 hg) pressure altitude is used to indicate flight level which is the standard for altitude reporting in the u.s in class a airspace (above roughly 18,000 feet) pressure altitude and indicated altitude are the same when the altimeter setting is 29.92 hg or 1013.25 millibars
density altitude is the altitude corrected for non-isa international standard atmosphere atmospheric conditions aircraft performance depends on density altitude which is affected by barometric pressure humidity and temperature on a very hot day density altitude at an airport (especially one at a high elevation) may be so high as to preclude takeoff particularly for helicopters or a heavily loaded aircraft
these types of altitude can be explained more simply as various ways of measuring the altitude
indicated altitude the altimeter reading
absolute altitude altitude in terms of the distance above the ground directly below
true altitude altitude in terms of elevation above sea level
height altitude in terms of the distance above a certain point
pressure altitude the air pressure in terms of altitude in the international standard atmosphere
density altitude the density of the air in terms of altitude in the international standard atmosphere

=== regionsedit ===
the earth's atmosphere is divided into several altitude regions these regions start and finish at varying heights depending on season and distance from the poles the altitudes stated below are averages
troposphere surface to 8,000 metres (5.0 mi) at the poles 18,000 metres (11 mi) at the equator ending at the tropopause
stratosphere troposphere to 50 kilometres (31 mi)
mesosphere stratosphere to 85 kilometres (53 mi)
thermosphere mesosphere to 675 kilometres (419 mi)
exosphere thermosphere to 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi)
=== high altitude and low pressureedit ===
regions on the earth's surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude high altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 metres (8,000 ft) above sea level
at high altitude atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level this is due to two competing physical effects gravity which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground and the heat content of the air which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand
because of the lower pressure the air expands as it rises which causes it to cool thus high altitude air is cold which causes a characteristic alpine climate this climate dramatically affects the ecology at high altitude
==== relation between temperature and altitude in earth's atmosphereedit ====
the environmental lapse rate (elr) is the rate of decrease of temperature with altitude in the stationary atmosphere at a given time and location as an average the international civil aviation organization (icao) defines an international standard atmosphere (isa) with a temperature lapse rate of 6.49 k(c)/1,000 m (3.56 f or 1.98 k(c)/1,000 ft) from sea level to 11 kilometres (36,000 ft) from 11 to 20 kilometres (36,000 to 66,000 ft) the constant temperature is 56.5 c (69.7 f) which is the lowest assumed temperature in the isa the standard atmosphere contains no moisture unlike the idealized isa the temperature of the actual atmosphere does not always fall at a uniform rate with height for example there can be an inversion layer in which the temperature increases with height
== altitude effects on organismsedit ==
=== humansedit ===
medicine recognizes that altitudes above 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) start to affect humans and there is no record of humans living at extreme altitudes above 5,5006,000 metres (18,00019,700 ft) for more than two years as the altitude increases atmospheric pressure decreases which affects humans by reducing the partial pressure of oxygen the lack of oxygen above 2,400 metres (8,000 ft) can cause serious illnesses such as altitude sickness high altitude pulmonary edema and high altitude cerebral edema the higher the altitude the more likely are serious effects the human body can adapt to high altitude by breathing faster having a higher heart rate and adjusting its blood chemistry it can take days or weeks to adapt to high altitude however above 8,000 metres (26,000 ft) (in the death zone") altitude acclimatization becomes impossible according to the traditional view while some research suggests adaptation is possible
there is a significantly lower overall mortality rate for permanent residents at higher altitudes additionally there is a dose response relationship between increasing elevation and decreasing obesity prevalence in the united states in addition the recent hypothesis suggests that high altitude could be protective against alzheimer's disease via action of erythropoietin a hormone released by kidney in response to hypoxia however people living at higher elevations have a statistically significant higher rate of suicide the cause for the increased suicide risk is unknown so far
==== athletesedit ====
for athletes high altitude produces two contradictory effects on performance for explosive events (sprints up to 400 metres long jump triple jump) the reduction in atmospheric pressure signifies less atmospheric resistance which generally results in improved athletic performance for endurance events (races of 5,000 metres or more) the predominant effect is the reduction in oxygen which generally reduces the athlete's performance at high altitude sports organizations acknowledge the effects of altitude on performance the international association of athletic federations (iaaf) for example marks record performances achieved at an altitude greater than 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) with the letter a
athletes also can take advantage of altitude acclimatization to increase their performance the same changes that help the body cope with high altitude increase performance back at sea level these changes are the basis of altitude training which forms an integral part of the training of athletes in a number of endurance sports including track and field distance running triathlon cycling and swimming
=== other organismsedit ===
decreased oxygen availability and decreased temperature make life at high altitude challenging despite these environmental conditions many species have been successfully adapted at high altitudes animals have developed physiological adaptations to enhance oxygen uptake and delivery to tissues which can be used to sustain metabolism the strategies used by animals to adapt to high altitude depend on their morphology and phylogeny for example small mammals face the challenge of maintaining body heat in cold temperatures due to their large volume to surface area ratio as oxygen is used as a source of metabolic heat production the hypobaric hypoxia at high altitudes is problematic
there is also a general trend of smaller body sizes and lower species richness at high altitudes likely due to lower oxygen partial pressures these factors may decrease productivity in high altitude habitats meaning there will be less energy available for consumption growth and activity
however some species such as birds,thrive at high altitude birds thrive because of physiological features that are advantageous for high-altitude flight
