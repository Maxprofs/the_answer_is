a drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where surface water from rain melting snow or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation usually the exit of the basin where the waters join another waterbody such as a river lake reservoir estuary wetland sea or ocean for example a tributary stream of a brook that joins a small river is tributary of a larger river which is thus part of a series of successively smaller area but higher elevation drainage basins similarly the missouri and ohio rivers are each part of their own drainage basins and that of the mississippi river
other terms that are used to describe drainage basins are catchment catchment area drainage area river basin and water basin in north america the term watershed is commonly used to mean a drainage basin though in other english-speaking countries it is used only in its original sense to mean a drainage divide the former meaning an area the latter the high elevation perimeter of that area drainage basins drain into other drainage basins in a hierarchical pattern with smaller sub-drainage basins combining into larger drainage basins
in closed ("endorheic") drainage basins the water converges to a single point inside the basin known as a sink which may be a permanent lake dry lake or a point where surface water is lost underground the drainage basin includes both the streams and rivers that convey the water as well as the land surfaces from which water drains into those channels and is separated from adjacent basins by a drainage divide
the drainage basin acts as a funnel by collecting all the water within the area covered by the basin and channelling it to a single point each drainage basin is separated topographically from adjacent basins by a perimeter the drainage divide making up a succession of higher geographical features (such as a ridge hill or mountains) forming a barrier
drainage basins are similar but not identical to hydrologic units which are drainage areas delineated so as to nest into a multi-level hierarchical drainage system hydrologic units are designed to allow multiple inlets outlets or sinks in a strict sense all drainage basins are hydrologic units but not all hydrologic units are drainage basins
== major drainage basins of the worldedit ==
=== mapedit ===
drainage basins of the principal oceans and seas of the world grey areas are endorheic basins that do not drain to the ocean
=== ocean basinsedit ===
the following is a list of the major ocean basins
about 48.7% of the world's land drains to the atlantic ocean in north america surface water drains to the atlantic via the saint lawrence river and great lakes basins the eastern seaboard of the united states the canadian maritimes and most of newfoundland and labrador nearly all of south america east of the andes also drains to the atlantic as does most of western and central europe and the greatest portion of western sub-saharan africa as well as western sahara and part of morocco the two major mediterranean seas of the world also flow to the atlantic
the american mediterranean sea (the caribbean sea and gulf of mexico) basin includes most of the u.s interior between the appalachian and rocky mountains a small part of the canadian provinces of alberta and saskatchewan eastern central america the islands of the caribbean and the gulf and a small part of northern south america
the european mediterranean sea basin includes much of north africa east-central africa (through the nile river) southern central and eastern europe turkey and the coastal areas of israel lebanon and syria
the arctic ocean drains most of western and northern canada east of the continental divide northern alaska and parts of north dakota south dakota minnesota and montana in the united states the north shore of the scandinavian peninsula in europe and much of central and northern russia and parts of kazakhstan and mongolia in asia which totals to about 17% of the world's land
just over 13% of the land in the world drains to the pacific ocean its basin includes much of china eastern and southeastern russia japan the korean peninsula most of indochina indonesia and malaysia the philippines all of the pacific islands the northeast coast of australia and canada and the united states west of the continental divide (including most of alaska) as well as western central america and south america west of the andes
the indian ocean's drainage basin also comprises about 13% of earth's land it drains the eastern coast of africa the coasts of the red sea and the persian gulf the indian subcontinent burma and most of australia
the southern ocean drains antarctica antarctica comprises approximately eight percent of the earth's land
=== largest river basinsedit ===
the five largest river basins (by area) from largest to smallest are the basins of the amazon the ro de la plata the congo the nile and the mississippi the three rivers that drain the most water from most to least are the amazon ganga and congo rivers
=== endorheic drainage basinsedit ===
endorheic drainage basins are inland basins that do not drain to an ocean around 18% of all land drains to endorheic lakes or seas or sinks the largest of these consists of much of the interior of asia which drains into the caspian sea the aral sea and numerous smaller lakes other endorheic regions include the great basin in the united states much of the sahara desert the drainage basin of the okavango river (kalahari basin) highlands near the african great lakes the interiors of australia and the arabian peninsula and parts in mexico and the andes some of these such as the great basin are not single drainage basins but collections of separate adjacent closed basins
in endorheic bodies of standing water where evaporation is the primary means of water loss the water is typically more saline than the oceans an extreme example of this is the dead sea
== importance of drainage basinsedit ==
=== geopolitical boundariesedit ===
drainage basins have been historically important for determining territorial boundaries particularly in regions where trade by water has been important for example the english crown gave the hudson's bay company a monopoly on the fur trade in the entire hudson bay basin an area called rupert's land bioregional political organization today includes agreements of states (e.g. international treaties and within the u.s.a. interstate compacts) or other political entities in a particular drainage basin to manage the body or bodies of water into which it drains examples of such interstate compacts are the great lakes commission and the tahoe regional planning agency
=== hydrologyedit ===
in hydrology the drainage basin is a logical unit of focus for studying the movement of water within the hydrological cycle because the majority of water that discharges from the basin outlet originated as precipitation falling on the basin a portion of the water that enters the groundwater system beneath the drainage basin may flow towards the outlet of another drainage basin because groundwater flow directions do not always match those of their overlying drainage network measurement of the discharge of water from a basin may be made by a stream gauge located at the basin's outlet
rain gauge data is used to measure total precipitation over a drainage basin and there are different ways to interpret that data if the gauges are many and evenly distributed over an area of uniform precipitation using the arithmetic mean method will give good results in the thiessen polygon method the drainage basin is divided into polygons with the rain gauge in the middle of each polygon assumed to be representative for the rainfall on the area of land included in its polygon these polygons are made by drawing lines between gauges then making perpendicular bisectors of those lines form the polygons the isohyetal method involves contours of equal precipitation are drawn over the gauges on a map calculating the area between these curves and adding up the volume of water is time consuming
isochrone maps can be used to show the time taken for runoff water within a drainage basin to reach a lake reservoir or outlet assuming constant and uniform effective rainfall
=== geomorphologyedit ===
drainage basins are the principal hydrologic unit considered in fluvial geomorphology a drainage basin is the source for water and sediment that moves through the river system and reshapes the channel
=== ecologyedit ===
drainage basins are important elements to consider also in ecology as water flows over the ground and along rivers it can pick up nutrients sediment and pollutants like the water they get transported towards the outlet of the basin and can affect the ecological processes along the way as well as in the receiving water source
modern usage of artificial fertilizers containing nitrogen phosphorus and potassium has affected the mouths of drainage basins the minerals will be carried by the drainage basin to the mouth and accumulate there disturbing the natural mineral balance this can cause eutrophication where plant growth is accelerated by the additional material
=== resource managementedit ===
because drainage basins are coherent entities in a hydrological sense it has become common to manage water resources on the basis of individual basins in the u.s state of minnesota governmental entities that perform this function are called watershed districts in new zealand they are called catchment boards comparable community groups based in ontario canada are called conservation authorities in north america this function is referred to as watershed management in brazil the national policy of water resources regulated by act n 9.433 of 1997 establishes the drainage basin as territorial division of brazilian water management
== catchment factorsedit ==
the catchment is the most significant factor determining the amount or likelihood of flooding
catchment factors are topography shape size soil type and land use (paved or roofed areas) catchment topography and shape determine the time taken for rain to reach the river while catchment size soil type and development determine the amount of water to reach the river
=== topographyedit ===
generally topography plays a big part in how fast runoff will reach a river rain that falls in steep mountainous areas will reach the primary river in the drainage basin faster than flat or lightly sloping areas (e.g. > 1% gradient)
=== shapeedit ===
shape will contribute to the speed with which the runoff reaches a river a long thin catchment will take longer to drain than a circular catchment
=== sizeedit ===
size will help determine the amount of water reaching the river as the larger the catchment the greater the potential for flooding it also determined on the basis of length and width of the drainage basin
=== soil typeedit ===
soil type will help determine how much water reaches the river certain soil types such as sandy soils are very free-draining and rainfall on sandy soil is likely to be absorbed by the ground however soils containing clay can be almost impermeable and therefore rainfall on clay soils will run off and contribute to flood volumes after prolonged rainfall even free-draining soils can become saturated meaning that any further rainfall will reach the river rather than being absorbed by the ground if the surface is impermeable the precipitation will create surface run-off which will lead to higher risk of flooding if the ground is permeable the precipitation will infiltrate the soil
=== land useedit ===
land use can contribute to the volume of water reaching the river in a similar way to clay soils for example rainfall on roofs pavements and roads will be collected by rivers with almost no absorption into the groundwater
