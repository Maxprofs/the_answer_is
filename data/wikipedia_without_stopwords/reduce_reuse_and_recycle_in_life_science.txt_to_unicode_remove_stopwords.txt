computers quarter total electronic waste recycled united states years prior respectively since inception early devices recycled worldwide due increased awareness investment electronic recycling occurs primarily order recover valuable rare earth metals precious metals short supply well plastics metals resold used new devices purification effect creating circular economy
recycling considered environmentally friendly prevents hazardous waste including heavy metals carcinogens entering atmosphere landfill waterways electronics consist small fraction total waste generated far dangerous stringent legislation designed enforce encourage sustainable disposal appliances notable waste electrical electronic equipment directive european union united states national computer recycling act
opponents argue recycling expensive ineffective safeguard data stifles innovation also criticised exporting often illegally large volumes toxic waste poorer countries india china nigeria crude manual disassembly workers little regard risk environment
reasons recycling
obsolete computers old electronics valuable sources secondary raw materials recycled devices source toxins carcinogens rapid technology change low initial cost planned obsolescence resulted fastgrowing surplus computers electronic components around globe technical solutions available cases legal framework collection system logistics services need implemented applying technical solution us environmental protection agency estimates million surplus pcs classified hazardous household waste would ready endoflife management next years us national safety council estimates personal computers ever sold surplus electronics
united states environmental protection agency epa said million computers us traded replacements discarded today electronic devices equipment recycled united states electronic waste sent landfills incinerated releases materials lead mercury cadmium soil groundwater atmosphere thus negative impact environment
many materials used computer hardware recovered recycling use future production reuse tin silicon iron aluminium variety plastics present bulk computers electronics reduce costs constructing new systems components frequently contain lead copper gold valuable materials suitable reclamation
computer components contain many toxic substances like dioxins polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs cadmium chromium radioactive isotopes mercury typical computer monitor may contain lead weight much lead glass cathode ray tube crt typical inch cm computer monitor may contain pounds kg lead monitors estimated pounds kg lead circuit boards contain considerable quantities leadtin solders likely leach groundwater create air pollution due incineration processing eg incineration acid treatments required reclaim precious substances may release generate synthesize toxic byproducts
export waste countries lower environmental standards major concern basel convention includes hazardous wastes limited crt screens item may exported transcontinentally without prior consent country exporting receiving waste companies may find costeffective short term sell outdated computers less developed countries lax regulations commonly believed majority surplus laptops routed developing nations dumping grounds ewaste high value working reusable laptops computers components eg ram help pay cost transportation many worthless commodities laws governing exportation waste electronics put place stop recycling companies developed countries shipping waste rd world countries working devices never working devices rd world workers scavenge specific items selling value throw rest away rot become health hazard backyard

ecycling
ecycling ewaste initiative united states environmental protection agency epa refers donations reuse shredding general collection used electronics generically term refers process collecting brokering disassembling repairing recycling components metals contained used discarded electronic equipment otherwise known electronic waste ewaste ecyclable items include limited televisions computers microwave ovens vacuum cleaners telephones cellular phones stereos vcrs dvds anything cord light takes kind battery
investment ecycling facilities increasing recently due technologys rapid rate obsolescence concern improper methods opportunities manufacturers influence secondary market used reused products higher metal prices also recycling taking place controversy around methods stems lack agreement preferred outcomes
world markets lower disposable incomes consider repair reuse valuable enough justify disposal debate certification standards may leading better definitions though civil law contracts governing expected process still vital contracted process poorly defined ecycling
pros ecycling
ewaste disposal occurring processing reuse repair equipment recovery metals may unethical illegal escrap many kinds transported overseas developing countries processing transported repaired andor recycled processing less valuable escrap becomes ewastepollution another point view net environmental cost must compared include mining refining extraction waste pollution cost new products manufactured replace secondary products routinely destroyed wealthier nations cannot economically repaired older obsolete products example negative impacts ewaste pollution groundwater become serious areas surrounding chinas landfills water must shipped miles km away however mining new metals even broader impacts groundwater either thorough ecycling processing domestic processing overseas repair help environment avoiding pollution ecycling theoretically sustainable alternative disposing ewaste landfills addition ecycling allows reclamation potential conflict minerals like gold wolframite requires less mined lessens potential money flow militias exploitative actors thirdworld profit mining
supporters one form required ecycling legislation argue ecycling saves taxpayers money financial responsibility would shifted taxpayer manufacturers advocates simple legislation landfill bans ewaste argue involving manufacturers reduce cost consumers reuse value lost resulting costs passed consumers new products particularly affecting markets hardly afford new products theorized manufacturers take part ecycling would motivated use fewer materials production process create longer lasting products implement safer efficient recycling systems theory sharply disputed never demonstrated
criticisms ecycling
critics ecycling vocal advocates according reason foundation ecycling raises product waste management costs ewaste consumers limits innovation part hightech companies also believe ecycling facilities could unintentionally cause great harm environment critics claim ewaste doesnt occupy significant portion total waste according european study waste electronic
another opposition ecycling many problems posed disassembly process costly dangerous heavy metals electronic products composed little original cost materials retrieved final problem people find identity fraud common regards disposal electronic products programs legislated creating winners losers among ecyclers different locations processes may difficult distinguish criticism ecycling practice criticism specific legislated means proposed enhance
fate ewaste
hefty criticism often lobbed reuse based recyclers people think recycling electronic waste reality actually exported developing countries like china india nigeria instance free recycling drives recyclers may staying true word selling ewaste overseas parts brokers studies indicate tons tonnes ewaste sent overseas approximately million tons million tonnes per year go us landfills
although possible circumstances best way ecycle upcycle ewaste hand electronic products babies ame nations please fix antireuse recyclers depict primitive reusebased erecyclers believe fairtrade incentives export markets lead better results domestic shredding debate exportfriendly ecycling increased regulation practice described
european union debate regarding export ewaste resulted significant amendment weee directive january view significantly diminishing export weee untreated ewaste debate strasburg meps stated million tonnes weee generated collected recycling remainder exported sent landfill amendment voted unanimous representatives removed reuse repair refurbishmet aspect directive placed emphasis upon recycling recovery precious metals base metals changes went placing burden upon registered exporters prove used equipment leaving europe fit purpose
policy issues current efforts
currently pieces government legislation number grassroots efforts contributed growth ecycling processes emphasize decreased exports increased reuse rates electronic waste recycling act passed california requires consumers pay extra fee certain types electronics collected money redistributed recycling companies qualified properly recycle products state legislates ewaste kind consumer fee states efforts focus producer responsibility laws waste disposal bans study shown per capita recovery greater one type legislated program eg california versus ordinary waste disposal bans eg massachusetts though recovery greatly increased states use either method
september dell developed nations first completely free recycling program furthering responsibilities manufacturers taking ecycling manufacturers retailers best buy sony samsung also set recycling programs program accept televisions expensive used electronic item unpopular markets must deal televisions valuable computers cherry picked
another step taken recyclers pledge true stewardship sponsored computer takeback campaign signed numerous recyclers promising recycle responsibly grassroots efforts also played big part issue community organizations formed help responsibly recycle ewaste grassroots campaigns basel computer takeback campaign cocoordinated grassroots recycling network silicon valley toxics coalition study shown difference recycling methods pledge data available demonstrate difference management pledge nonpledge companies though assumed risk making false claims prevent pledge companies wrongly describing processes
many people believe us follow european union model regards management ewaste program directive forces manufacturers take responsibility ecycling also demands manufacturers mandatory takeback places bans exporting ewaste developing countries another longerterm solution computers composed less dangerous products many people disagree data provided show people agree european model based agreement measured outcomes experiencebased scientific method
