mathemat slope gradient line number describ direct steep line slope often denot letter m
direct line either increas decreas horizont vertic
line increas goe left right slope posit ie
line decreas goe left right slope negat ie
line horizont slope zero constant function

exampl
suppos line run two point p q divid differ ycoordin differ xcoordin one obtain slope line
sinc slope posit direct line increas sinc m inclin steep inclin

m slope form line equat call slopeintercept form b interpret yintercept line ycoordin line intersect yaxi
slope m line point xy line known equat line found use pointslop formula
slope line defin linear equat
two line parallel slope equal line coincid vertic therefor undefin slope two line perpendicular product slope one slope horizont line undefin slope vertic line

concept slope central differenti calculus nonlinear function rate chang vari along curv deriv function point slope line tangent curv point thus equal rate chang function point
let x y distanc along x y axe respect two point curv slope given definit
slope secant line curv line secant two point line case type curv
exampl slope secant intersect y x slope tangent x also consequ mean valu theorem
move two point closer togeth y x decreas secant line close approxim tangent line curv slope secant approach tangent use differenti calculus determin limit valu yx approach y x get closer zero follow limit exact slope tangent y depend x suffici take limit x approach zero therefor slope tangent limit yx x approach zero dydx call limit deriv
valu point function give us slope tangent point exampl let yx point function deriv function dydxx slope line tangent y equat tangent line yx y x
