taxonomy food web
links food webs map feeding connections eats ecological community food cycle antiquated term synonymous food web ecologists broadly lump life forms one two trophic layers autotrophs heterotrophs autotrophs produce biomass energy either chemically without suns energy capturing suns energy photosynthesis use metabolic respiration heterotrophs consume rather produce biomass energy metabolize grow add levels secondary production food web depicts collection polyphagous heterotrophic consumers network cycle flow energy nutrients productive base selffeeding autotrophs
base basal species food web species without prey include autotrophs saprophytic detritivores ie community decomposers soil biofilms periphyton feeding connections web called trophic links number trophic links per consumer measure food web connectance food chains nested within trophic links food webs food chains linear noncyclic feeding pathways trace monophagous consumers base species top consumer usually larger predatory carnivore
linkages connect nodes food web aggregates biological taxa called trophic species trophic species functional groups predators prey food web common examples aggregated node food web might include parasites microbes decomposers saprotrophs consumers predators containing many species web otherwise connected trophic species
trophic levels
food webs trophic levels positions basal species plants form first level resource limited species feed living creature web basal species autotrophs detritivores including decomposing organic material associated microorganisms defined detritus microinorganic material associated microorganisms mip vascular plant material autotrophs capture suns energy chlorophyll autotrophs chemolithotrophs obtain energy chemical oxidation inorganic compounds grow dark environments sulfur bacterium thiobacillus lives hot sulfur springs top level top apex predators species kills directly food resource needs intermediate levels filled omnivores feed one trophic level cause energy flow number food pathways starting basal species

trophic dynamics
trophic level concept introduced historical landmark paper trophic dynamics raymond l lindeman basis trophic dynamics transfer energy one part ecosystem another trophic dynamic concept served useful quantitative heuristic several major limitations including precision organism allocated specific trophic level omnivores example restricted single level nonetheless recent research found discrete trophic levels exist herbivore trophic level food webs better characterized tangled web omnivores
central question trophic dynamic literature nature control regulation resources production ecologists use simplified one trophic position food chain models producer carnivore decomposer using models ecologists tested various types ecological control mechanisms example herbivores generally abundance vegetative resources meant populations largely controlled regulated predators known topdown hypothesis greenworld hypothesis alternatively topdown hypothesis plant material edible nutritional quality antiherbivore defenses plants structural chemical suggests bottomup form regulation control recent studies concluded topdown bottomup forces influence community structure strength influence environmentally context dependent complex multitrophic interactions involve two trophic levels food web
