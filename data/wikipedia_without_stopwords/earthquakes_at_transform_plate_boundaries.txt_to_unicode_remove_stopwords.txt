transform fault transform boundary also known conservative plate boundary since faults neither create destroy lithosphere type fault whose relative motion predominantly horizontal either sinistral dextral direction furthermore transform faults end abruptly connected ends faults ridges subduction zones transform faults hidden deep oceans form series short zigzags accommodating seafloor spreading see graphic right bestknown destructive land margins tectonic plates transform faults type strikeslip fault classified plate boundary
background
john tuzo wilson recognized offsets oceanic ridges faults follow classical pattern offset fence geological marker reids rebound theory faulting sense slip derived new class faults called transform faults produce slip opposite direction one would surmise standard interpretation offset geological feature slip along transform faults increase distance ridges separates distance remains constant earthquakes ridges spreading centers hypothesis confirmed study fault plane solutions showed slip transform faults points opposite direction classical interpretation would suggest
difference transform transcurrent faults
transform faults closely related transcurrent faults types faults strikeslip sidetoside movement see diagrams right however transform faults end junction another plate boundary fault type transcurrent faults die without junction addition transform faults equal deformation across entire fault line transcurrent faults greater displacement middle fault zone less margins finally transform faults form tectonic plate boundary transcurrent faults cannot

effect fault relieve strain caused compression extension lateral stress rock layers surface deep earths subsurface transform faults specifically relieve strain transporting strain ridges subduction zones transform faults also act plane weakness allowing splitting rift zones
examples
transform faults commonly found linking segments midoceanic ridges spreading centres midoceanic ridges new seafloor constantly created upwelling new basaltic magma new seafloor pushed pulled older seafloor slowly slides away midoceanic ridges toward continents although separated tens kilometers separation segments ridges causes portions seafloor push past opposing directions lateral movement seafloors past transform faults currently active
transform faults move differently strikeslip fault midoceanic ridge instead ridges moving away like strikeslip faults transform fault ridges stay fixed location new ocean seafloor created ridges pushed away ridge evidence found paleomagnetic striping seafloor
paper written gerya theorizes creation transform faults ridges midoceanic ridge attributed rotated stretched sections midoceanic ridge occurs long period time spreading center ridge slowly deforming straight line curved line finally fracturing along planes forms transform faults takes place fault changes normal fault extensional stress strike slip fault lateral stress study done bonatti crane peridotite gabbro rocks discovered edges transform ridges rocks created deep inside earths mantle rapidly exhumed surface evidence helps prove new seafloor created midoceanic ridges supports theory plate tectonics
previously stated active transform faults two tectonic structures faults fracture zones represent previously active transform fault lines since passed active transform zone pushed toward continents elevated ridges ocean floor traced hundreds miles cases even one continent across ocean continent

transform fault types
groundbreaking work transform fault systems tuzo wilson said transform faults must connected faults tectonic plate boundaries ends requirement transform faults grow length keep constant length decrease length length changes dependent type faults tectonic structures connect transform fault mind wilson described six types transform faults
growing length faults situations transform fault links together spreading center upper block subduction zone two upper blocks subduction zones linked transform fault grow length
constant length faults cases transform faults remain constant length consistency attributed many different reasons case ridgetoridge transforms caused continuous growth ridges outward canceling change length opposite occurs ridge linked subducting plate lithosphere new sea floor created ridge subducted swallowed subduction zone finally two upper subduction plates linked change length due plates moving parallel new lithosphere created change length
decreasing length faults rare cases transform faults shrink length occur two descending subduction plates linked transform fault time plates subducted transform fault decrease length transform fault disappears completely leaving two subduction zones facing opposite directions
