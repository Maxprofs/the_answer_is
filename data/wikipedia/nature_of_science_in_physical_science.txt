the pennsylvania system of school assessment (pssa) is a standardized test administered to public schools in the state of pennsylvania students in grades 3-8 are assessed in reading skills and mathematics students in grades 5 and 8 are assessed in writing skills students in grades 4 and 8 are also assessed in skills relating to natural science including the field of data interpretation and analysis there are reporting categories for each subject which list eligible content to be tested in each grade assessment anchors specify what is considered eligible content for each grade level tested a proficient or advanced level is needed to be able to qualify as passing the pssa
== underlying principles ==
the pssa applies to all public schools and districts including charter schools and cyber charter schools the questions are based on common core standards and content expectations the goal is to have 100% of students proficient or above in reading and math by 2014
== scoring ==
there are four levels on which a student may score: advanced proficient basic and below basic the pennsylvania department of education defines the four levels as follows
=== advanced ===
the advanced level reflects superior academic performance and excellent work ethic advanced work indicates an in-depth understanding and exemplary display of the skills included in the pennsylvania academic content standards
=== proficient ===
the proficient level reflects satisfactory academic performance proficient work indicates a solid understanding and adequate display of the skills included in the pennsylvania academic content standards
=== basic ===
the basic level reflects marginal academic performance basic work indicates a partial understanding and limited display of the skills included in the pennsylvania academic content standards this work is approaching satisfactory performance but has not been reached there is a need for additional instructional opportunities and/or increased student academic commitment to achieve the proficient level
=== below basic ===
the below basic level reflects inadequate academic performance below basic work indicates little understanding and minimal display of the skills included in the pennsylvania academic content standards there is a major need for additional instructional opportunities and/or increased student academic commitment to achieve the proficient level
== adequate yearly progress ==
districts must meet adequate yearly progress (ayp) in reading and math to make ayp the school and district must meet target percentages with all students as well as with every subgroup of 40 or more students scoring at the advanced or proficient level
in 2003 targets were 1% in math and 45% in reading (5th 8th 11th tested)
in 2004 targets were 35% in math and 45% in reading (5th 8th 11th tested)
in 2005 targets were 45% in math and 54% in reading (3rd 5th 8th 11th tested)
in 2006 targets were 45% in math and 54% in reading
