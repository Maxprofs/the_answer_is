multicellular organisms organisms consist one cell contrast unicellular organisms
species animals land plants filamentous fungi multicellular many algae organisms partially uni partially multicellular like slime moulds social amoebae genus dictyostelium
multicellular organisms arise various different ways example cell division aggregation many single cells colonial organisms result many identical individuals joining together form colony pluricellular colonies evolved independently volvox flagellated green algae form coenobia
volvox cells comprising colony arise cell division two different types specialized different functions approximately flagellate somatic cells forming outer spherical shell colony identical similar structure freeliving unicellular relative chlamydomonas incapable cell division reproduction volvox carried specialized cells called gonidia larger somatic cells lack flagella cannot swim divide form new colonies
evolution multicellularity unicellular ancestors replicated laboratory evolution experiments using predation selective pressure
evolutionary history
occurrence
multicellularity evolved independently least times including prokaryotes like cyanobacteria myxobacteria actinomycetes magnetoglobus multicellularis methanosarcina however complex multicellular organisms evolved six eukaryotic groups animals fungi brown algae red algae green algae land plants evolved repeatedly chloroplastida green algae land plants twice animals brown algae three times fungi chytrids ascomycetes basidiomycetes perhaps several times slime molds red algae
first evidence multicellularity cyanobacterialike organisms lived billion years ago order reproduce true multicellular organisms must solve problem regenerating whole organism germ cells ie sperm egg cells issue studied developmental biology
animals evolved greater diversity cell types multicellular body different cell types compared plants fungi protoctists
loss multicellularity
loss multicellularity occurred groups fungi predominantly multicellular though early diverging lineages largely unicellular eg microsporidia numerous reversions unicellularity across fungi eg saccharomycotina cryptococcus yeasts may also occurred red algae eg porphyridium possible primitivelly unicellular loss multicellularity also considered probable green algae eg chlorella vulgaris ulvophyceae groups generally parasites reduction multicellularity occurred number types cells eg myxozoans multicellular organisms early thought unicellular probably extremely reduced cnidarians
cancer
multicellular organisms especially longliving animals face challenge cancer occurs cells fail regulate growth within normal program development changes tissue morphology observed process cancer animals metazoans often described loss multicellularity discussion possibility existence cancer multicellular organisms even protozoa example plant galls characterized tumors however authors argue plants get cancer
separation somatic germ cells
multicellular groups called weismannists separation sterile somatic cell line germ cell line evolved however weismannist development relatively rare eg vertebrates arthropods volvox great part species capacity somatic embryogenesis eg land plants algae many invertebrates
hypotheses origin
various mechanisms multicellularity could evolved
one hypothesis group functionspecific cells aggregated sluglike mass called grex moved multicellular unit essentially slime molds another hypothesis primitive cell underwent nucleus division thereby becoming syncytium membrane would form around nucleus cellular space organelles occupied space thereby resulting group connected cells one organism mechanism observable drosophila third hypothesis unicellular organism divided daughter cells failed separate resulting conglomeration identical cells one organism could later develop specialized tissues plant animal embryos well colonial choanoflagellates
first multicellular organisms simple soft organisms lacking bone shell hard body parts well preserved fossil record one exception may demosponge may left chemical signature ancient rocks earliest fossils multicellular organisms include contested grypania spiralis fossils black shales palaeoproterozoic francevillian group fossil b formation gabon gabonionta doushantuo formation yielded million year old microfossils evidence multicellular traits
recently phylogenetic reconstruction anatomical particularly embryological similarities inexact living multicellular organisms animals plants million years removed singlecell ancestors passage time allows divergent convergent evolution time mimic similarities accumulate differences groups modern extinct ancestral species modern phylogenetics uses sophisticated techniques alloenzymes satellite dna molecular markers describe traits shared distantly related lineages
evolution multicellularity could occurred three ways latter colonial theory credited scientific community
symbiotic theory
theory suggests first multicellular organisms occurred symbiosis cooperation different species singlecell organisms different roles time organisms would become dependent would able survive independently eventually leading incorporation genomes one multicellular organism respective organism would become separate lineage differentiated cells within newly created species
kind severely codependent symbiosis seen frequently relationship clown fish riterri sea anemones cases extremely doubtful whether either species would survive long became extinct however problem theory still known organisms dna could incorporated one single genome constitute single species although symbiosis theorized occurred eg mitochondria chloroplasts animal plant cells endosymbiosis happened extremely rarely even genomes endosymbionts retained element distinction separately replicating dna mitosis host species instance two three symbiotic organisms forming composite lichen dependent survival separately reproduce reform create one individual organism
cellularization syncytial theory
theory states single unicellular organism multiple nuclei could developed internal membrane partitions around nuclei many protists ciliates slime molds several nuclei lending support hypothesis however simple presence multiple nuclei enough support theory multiple nuclei ciliates dissimilar clear differentiated functions macronucleus serves organisms needs micronucleus used sexual reproduction exchange genetic material slime molds syncitia form individual amoeboid cells like syncitial tissues multicellular organisms way round deemed valid theory needs demonstrable example mechanism generation multicellular organism preexisting syncytium
colonial theory
third explanation multicellularisation colonial theory proposed haeckel theory claims symbiosis many organisms species unlike symbiotic theory suggests symbiosis different species led multicellular organism least presumed landevolved multicellularity occurs cells separating rejoining eg cellular slime molds whereas majority multicellular types evolved within aquatic environments multicellularity occurs consequence cells failing separate following division mechanism latter colony formation simple incomplete cytokinesis though multicellularity also typically considered involve cellular differentiation
advantage colonial theory hypothesis seen occur independently different protoctistan phyla instance food shortages amoeba dictyostelium groups together colony moves one new location amoeba slightly differentiate examples colonial organisation protista volvocaceae eudorina volvox latter consists cells depending species fraction reproduce example one species cells reproduce asexually around sexually however often hard separate colonial protists true multicellular organisms two concepts distinct colonial protists dubbed pluricellular rather multicellular problem plagues hypotheses multicellularisation could occurred
synzoospore theory
authors suggest origin multicellularity least metazoa occurred due transition temporal spatial cell differentiation rather gradual evolution cell differentiation affirmed haeckels gastraea theory
experimental evidence
evolution multicellularity unicellular ancestors modeled laboratory evolution experiments using predation selective pressure similar experiments demonstrate facultative induction multicellularity
advantages
multicellularity allows organism exceed size limits normally imposed diffusion single cells increased size decreased surfacetovolume ratio difficulty absorbing sufficient nutrients transporting throughout cell confers multicellular organisms competitive advantages increase size also permits increasing complexity allowing differentiation numerous cellular lineages within organism multicellular also benefits longer life span thus still living even singlecell dies
