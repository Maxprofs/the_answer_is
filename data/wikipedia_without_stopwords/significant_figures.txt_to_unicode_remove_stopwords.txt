identifying significant figures
concise rules
nonzero digits significant
zeros nonzero digits significant
leading zeros never significant
number decimal point trailing zeros right last nonzero digit significant
number without decimal point trailing zeros may may significant information additional graphical symbols explicit information errors needed clarify significance trailing zeros
significant figures rules explained
specifically rules identifying significant figures writing interpreting numbers follows
nonzero digits considered significant example two significant figures five significant figures
zeros appearing anywhere two nonzero digits significant example seven significant figures
leading zeros significant example two significant figures
trailing zeros number containing decimal point significant example six significant figures number still six significant figures zeros significant addition five significant figures since three trailing zeros convention clarifies precision numbers example measurement precise four decimal places given might understood two decimal places precision available stating result makes clear precise four decimal places case six significant figures
significance trailing zeros number containing decimal point ambiguous example may always clear number like precise nearest unit happens coincidentally exact multiple hundred shown nearest hundred due rounding uncertainty many conventions exist address issue
overline sometimes also called overbar less accurately vinculum macron may placed last significant figure trailing zeros following insignificant example three significant figures hence indicates number precise nearest ten
less often using closely related convention last significant figure number may underlined example two significant figures
decimal point may placed number example indicates specifically three significant figures meant
combination number unit measurement ambiguity avoided choosing suitable unit prefix example number significant figures mass specified g ambiguous mass hg kg
however conventions universally used often necessary determine context whether trailing zeros intended significant else fails level rounding specified explicitly abbreviation sf sometimes used example sf sf alternatively uncertainty stated separately explicitly plusminus sign significantfigures rules apply also allows specifying precision inbetween powers ten whatever base power numbering system
scientific notation
cases rules apply numbers expressed scientific notation however normalized form notation placeholder leading trailing digits occur digits significant example two significant figures becomes six significant figures becomes particular potential ambiguity significance trailing zeros eliminated example four significant figures written two significant figures written
part representation contains significant figures opposed base exponent known significand mantissa
rounding decimal places
basic concept significant figures often used connection rounding rounding significant figures generalpurpose technique rounding n decimal places since handles numbers different scales uniform way example population city might known nearest thousand stated population country might known nearest million stated former might error hundreds latter might error hundreds thousands two significant figures reflects fact significance error likely size relative size quantity measured cases
round n significant figures
first nonsignificant figure followed nonzero digits round last significant figure away zero example result calculation measurement allows significant figures written
first nonsignificant figure followed digits followed zeros rounding requires tiebreaking rule example round significant figures
round half also known rounds default rounding method implied many disciplines specified
round half even rounds nearest even number rounds case strategy applied would instead round
replace nonsignificant figures front decimal zeros
financial calculations number often rounded given number places example two places decimal separator many world currencies rounding fixed number decimal places way orthographic convention maintain significance may either lose information create false precision

base logarithm normalized number result rounded number significant figures normalized number example log log log rounded
taking antilogarithms resulting number many significant figures mantissa logarithm

estimating tenths
using ruler initially use smallest mark first estimated digit example rulers smallest mark cm cm read cm cm
possible overall length ruler may accurate degree smallest mark marks may imperfectly spaced within unit however assuming normal good quality ruler possible estimate tenths nearest two marks achieve extra decimal place accuracy failing adds error reading ruler error calibration ruler
estimation
estimating proportion individuals carrying particular characteristic population random sample population number significant figures exceed maximum precision allowed sample size correct number significant figures given order magnitude sample size found taking base logarithm sample size rounding nearest integer
example poll randomly chosen viewers regularly visited web page find people disagree proposition web page order magnitude sample size log rounds estimated proportion people disagree proposition therefore significant figures different samples people population estimate would vary units additional figures would misrepresent size sample giving spurious precision interpret estimate number viewers disagree proposition calculate measure confidence estimate
