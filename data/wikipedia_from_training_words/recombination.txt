== originsedit ==
move was originally called the christian movement for life when it was founded in 1972 its founder john africa was functionally illiterate so he dictated a document called the guideline to donald glassey a social worker from the university of pennsylvania africa and his contemporary mostly african-american followers wore their hair in dreadlocks they advocated a radical form of green politics and a return to a hunter-gatherer society while stating their opposition to science medicine and technology as john africa himself had done his devotees changed their surnames to africa to show reverence to what they regarded as their mother continent
john africa's move members lived in a commune in a house owned by glassey in the powelton village section of west philadelphia they staged bullhorn-amplified profanity-laced demonstrations against institutions that they opposed such as zoos (move had strong views on animal rights) and speakers whose views they opposed move made compost piles of garbage and human waste in their yards which attracted rats and cockroaches they considered it morally wrong to kill the vermin with pest control move attracted much hostility from their neighbors the majority of whom were african-americans move activities drew close scrutiny from law enforcement authorities

== 1985 bombingedit ==
in 1981 move relocated to a row house at 6221 osage avenue in the cobbs creek area of west philadelphia after the move neighbors complained for years that move members were broadcasting political messages by bullhorn at all hours and also about the health hazards created from piles of compost after the complaints as well as indictments of numerous move members for crimes including parole violations contempt of court illegal possession of firearms and making terrorist threats then-mayor w wilson goode and police commissioner gregore j sambor had begun classifying move as a terrorist organization
on may 13 1985 the police along with city manager leo brooks arrived in force with arrest warrants and attempted to clear the building and arrest the indicted move members this led to an armed standoff with police who lobbed tear gas canisters at the building move members fired at the police who returned fire with automatic weapons commissioner sambor then ordered that the compound be bombed from a pennsylvania state police helicopter philadelphia police department lt frank powell proceeded to drop two one-pound bombs (which the police referred to as entry devices") made of fbi-supplied water gel explosive a dynamite substitute targeting a fortified bunker-like cubicle on the roof of the house
the resulting explosions ignited a fire that eventually destroyed approximately 65 nearby houses the firefighters who had earlier deluge-hosed the move members in a failed attempt to evict them from the building stood by as the fire caused by the bomb engulfed the first house and spread to others having been given orders to let the fire burn despite the earlier drenching of the building by firefighters officials said that they feared that move would shoot at the firefighters eleven people (john africa five other adults and five children aged 7 to 13) died in the resulting fire and more than 250 people were left homeless ramona africa one of the two survivors stated that police fired at those trying to escape the burning house while the police stated that move members had been firing at police

mayor goode soon appointed an investigative commission called the psic (aka move commission) chaired by william h brown iii police commissioner sambor resigned in november 1985 reporting that he felt that he was being made a surrogate by goode the move commission issued its report on march 6 1986 the report denounced the actions of the city government stating that dropping a bomb on an occupied row house was unconscionable. following the release of the report mayor goode made a formal public apology no one from the city government was charged criminally
in 1996 a federal jury ordered the city to pay a $1.5 million civil suit judgement to survivor ramona africa and relatives of two people killed in the bombing the jury had found that the city used excessive force and violated the members constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure philadelphia was given the sobriquet the city that bombed itself.
