terminology

formation
believed planetesimals asteroid belt evolved much like rest solar nebula jupiter neared current mass point excitation orbital resonances jupiter ejected planetesimals belt simulations discontinuity spin rate spectral properties suggest asteroids larger approximately km mi diameter accreted early era whereas smaller bodies fragments collisions asteroids jovian disruption ceres vesta grew large enough melt differentiate heavy metallic elements sinking core leaving rocky minerals crust
nice model many kuiperbelt objects captured outer asteroid belt distances greater au later ejected jupiter remained may dtype asteroids possibly include ceres

asteroid belt
majority known asteroids orbit within asteroid belt orbits mars jupiter generally relatively loweccentricity ie elongated orbits belt estimated contain million asteroids larger km mi diameter millions smaller ones asteroids may remnants protoplanetary disk region accretion planetesimals planets formative period solar system prevented large gravitational perturbations jupiter

characteristics
size distribution
asteroids vary greatly size almost km largest rocks tens metres across three largest much like miniature planets roughly spherical least partly differentiated interiors thought surviving protoplanets vast majority however much smaller irregularly shaped thought either surviving planetesimals fragments larger bodies
dwarf planet ceres far largest asteroid diameter km mi next largest pallas vesta diameters km mi vesta mainbelt asteroid occasion visible naked eye rare occasions nearearth asteroid may briefly become visible without technical aid see apophis
mass objects asteroid belt lying orbits mars jupiter estimated kg mass moon ceres comprises kg third total adding next three massive objects vesta pallas hygiea brings figure whereas three davida interamnia europa add another total mass number asteroids increases rapidly individual masses decrease
number asteroids decreases markedly size although generally follows power law bumps km km asteroids expected logarithmic distribution found
largest asteroids
although location asteroid belt excludes planet status three largest objects ceres vesta pallas intact protoplanets share many characteristics common planets atypical compared majority potatoshaped asteroids
ceres asteroid fully ellipsoidal shape hence one dwarf planet much higher absolute magnitude asteroids around may possess surface layer ice like planets ceres differentiated crust mantle core meteorites ceres found earth
vesta differentiated interior though formed inside solar systems frost line devoid water composition mainly basaltic rock olivine aside large crater southern pole rheasilvia vesta also ellipsoidal shape vesta parent body vestian family vtype asteroids source hed meteorites constitute meteorites earth
pallas unusual like uranus rotates side axis rotation tilted high angles orbital plane composition similar ceres high carbon silicon perhaps partially differentiated pallas parent body palladian family asteroids
fourthmostmassive asteroid hygiea largest carbonaceous asteroid unlike largest asteroids lies relatively close plane ecliptic largest member presumed parent body hygiean family asteroids four largest asteroids constitute half mass asteroid belt
rotation
measurements rotation rates large asteroids asteroid belt show upper limit asteroid diameter larger meters rotation period smaller hours asteroids rotating faster approximately rate inertia surface greater gravitational force loose surface material would flung however solid object able rotate much rapidly suggests asteroids diameter meters rubble piles formed accumulation debris collisions asteroids
composition
physical composition asteroids varied cases poorly understood ceres appears composed rocky core covered icy mantle vesta thought nickeliron core olivine mantle basaltic crust hygiea however appears uniformly primitive composition carbonaceous chondrite thought largest undifferentiated asteroid smaller asteroids thought piles rubble held together loosely gravity though largest probably solid asteroids moons coorbiting binaries rubble piles moons binaries scattered asteroid families believed results collisions disrupted parent asteroid
asteroids contain traces amino acids organic compounds speculate asteroid impacts may seeded early earth chemicals necessary initiate life may even brought life earth also see panspermia august report based nasa studies meteorites found earth published suggesting dna rna components adenine guanine related organic molecules may formed asteroids comets outer space
composition calculated three primary sources albedo surface spectrum density last determined accurately observing orbits moons asteroid might far every asteroid moons turned rubble pile loose conglomeration rock metal may half empty space volume investigated asteroids large km diameter include hermione km sylvia km half dozen asteroids larger sylvia though none moons however smaller asteroids thought massive suggesting may disrupted indeed davida size sylvia within measurement error estimated two half times massive though highly uncertain fact large asteroids sylvia rubble piles presumably due disruptive impacts important consequences formation solar system computer simulations collisions involving solid bodies show destroying often merging colliding rubble piles likely merge means cores planets could formed relatively quickly

color
asteroids become darker redder age due space weathering however evidence suggests color change occurs rapidly first hundred thousands years limiting usefulness spectral measurement determining age asteroids
classification
asteroids commonly classified according two criteria characteristics orbits features reflectance spectrum
orbital classification
many asteroids placed groups families based orbital characteristics apart broadest divisions customary name group asteroids first member group discovered groups relatively loose dynamical associations whereas families tighter result catastrophic breakup large parent asteroid sometime past families recognized within asteroid belt first recognized kiyotsugu hirayama often called hirayama families honor
bodies asteroid belt belong dynamical families thought common origin past collision asteroids family also associated plutoid dwarf planet haumea

sometimes horseshoe objects temporarily become quasisatellites decades hundred years returning earlier status earth venus known quasisatellites
objects associated earth venus even hypothetically mercury special class aten asteroids however objects could associated outer planets well
spectral classification
asteroid taxonomic system based color albedo spectral shape developed clark r chapman david morrison ben zellner properties thought correspond composition asteroids surface material original classification system three categories ctypes dark carbonaceous objects known asteroids stypes stony silicaceous objects known asteroids u fit either c classification since expanded include many asteroid types number types continues grow asteroids studied
two widely used taxonomies used tholen classification smass classification former proposed david j tholen based data collected eightcolor asteroid survey performed resulted asteroid categories small mainbelt asteroid spectroscopic survey resulted modified version tholen taxonomy different types systems three broad categories c x asteroids x consists mostly metallic asteroids mtype also several smaller classes
proportion known asteroids falling various spectral types necessarily reflect proportion asteroids type types easier detect others biasing totals
problems
originally spectral designations based inferences asteroids composition however correspondence spectral class composition always good variety classifications use led significant confusion although asteroids different spectral classifications likely composed different materials assurances asteroids within taxonomic class composed similar materials
