fluid dynamics baroclinity sometimes called baroclinicity stratified fluid measure misaligned gradient pressure gradient density fluid meteorology baroclinic atmosphere one density depends temperature pressure contrast barotropic atmosphere density depends pressure atmospheric terms barotropic zones earth generally found central latitudes tropics whereas baroclinic areas generally found midlatitudepolar regions
baroclinity proportional
proportional sine angle surfaces constant pressure surfaces constant density thus barotropic fluid defined zero baroclinity surfaces parallel
areas high atmospheric baroclinity characterized frequent formation cyclones
baroclinic instability
