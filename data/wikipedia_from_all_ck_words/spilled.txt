the church of the savior on spilled blood (russian  tserkov spasa na krovi) is one of the main sights of st petersburg russia other names include the church on spilled blood (russian  tserkov na krovi) the temple of the savior on spilled blood (russian  khram spasa na krovi) and the cathedral of the resurrection of christ (russian  sobor voskreseniya khristova)
this church was built on the site where emperor alexander ii was fatally wounded in march 1881.the church was built between 1883 and 1907 the construction was funded by the imperial family the name of the church should not be confused with the church on blood in honour of all saints resplendent in the russian land in yekaterinburg where alexander's grandson nicholas ii and his family were killed by the bolsheviks in 1918
== history ==
construction began in 1883 during the reign of alexander iii the church was dedicated to be a memorial to his father alexander ii estimates suggest that the construction cost 4.5 million rubles the construction was completed during the reign of nicholas ii in 1907 funding was provided by the imperial family with the support of many private donors
the church is prominently situated along the griboedov canal paved roads run along both sides of the canal on march 13 1881 (julian date march 1) as tsar alexander's carriage passed along the embankment a grenade thrown by an anarchist conspirator exploded the tsar shaken but unhurt got out of the carriage and started to remonstrate with the presumed culprit a second conspirator took the chance to throw another bomb killing himself and mortally wounding the tsar the tsar bleeding heavily was taken back to the winter palace where he died a few hours later
a temporary shrine was erected on the site of the attack while plans and fundraising for a more permanent memorial were undertaken in order to build a permanent shrine on the exact spot where the assassination took place it was decided to narrow the canal so that the section of road on which the tsar had been driving could be included within the walls of the church an elaborate shrine was constructed at the end of the church opposite the altar on the exact place of alexander's death it is embellished with topaz lazurite and other semi-precious stones making a striking contrast with the simple cobblestones of the old road which are exposed in the floor of the shrine
== architecture ==
architecturally the cathedral differs from st petersburg's other structures the city's architecture is predominantly baroque and neoclassical but the savior on blood harks back to medieval russian architecture in the spirit of romantic nationalism it intentionally resembles the 17th-century yaroslavl churches and the celebrated st basil's cathedral in moscow
the church contains over 7500 square meters of mosaicsaccording to its restorers more than any other church in the world this record may be surpassed by the cathedral basilica of st louis which houses 7700 square meters of mosaics the interior was designed by some of the most celebrated russian artists of the dayincluding viktor vasnetsov mikhail nesterov and mikhail vrubel but the church's chief architect alfred alexandrovich parland was relatively little-known (born in st petersburg in 1842 in a baltic-german lutheran family) perhaps not surprisingly the church's construction ran well over budget having been estimated at 3.6 million rubles but ending up costing over 4.6 million the walls and ceilings inside the church are completely covered in intricately detailed mosaics the main pictures being biblical scenes or figures but with very fine patterned borders setting off each picture
== russian revolution of 1917 ==
in the aftermath of the russian revolution the church was ransacked and looted badly damaging its interior the soviet government closed the church in the early 1930s during the second world war when many people were starving due to the siege of leningrad by nazi german military forces the church was used as a temporary morgue for those who died in combat and from starvation and illness the church suffered significant damage after the war it was used as a warehouse for vegetables leading to the sardonic name of saviour on potatoes
== modern usage ==
in july 1970 management of the church passed to saint isaac's cathedral and was used as a museum the proceeds from the cathedral funded the restoration of the church it was reopened in august 1997 after 27 years of restoration but has not been reconsecrated and does not function as a full-time place of worship the church of the saviour on blood is a museum of mosaics in the pre-revolution period it was not used as a public place of worship the church was dedicated to the memory of the assassinated tsar and only panikhidas (memorial services) took place the church is now one of the main tourist attractions in st petersburg
== holy gates ==
in 2005 the state museum of st.isaac's cathedral began a new project for the recreation of the holy gates (permanently lost in the 1920s during the soviet period) entirely produced with enamels and based on the pictures and lithographies of the time the new holy gates have been designed by v j nikolsky and s g kochetova while famous enamel artist l solomnikova and her atelier have been assigned the task to produce the holy gates whose reconsecration has been celebrated by orthodos bishop amvrosij of gatchina on 14 march 2012 the 129th anniversary of alexander ii's assassination
