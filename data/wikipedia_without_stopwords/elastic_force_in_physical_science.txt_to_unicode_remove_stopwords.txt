hypoelastic materials
hypoelastic materials described relation form
model extension linear elasticity suffers form nonconservative behaviour cauchy elastic materials
hyperelastic materials
hyperelastic materials also called green elastic materials conservative models derived strain energy density function w stressstrain relation materials takes form
applications
linear elasticity used widely design analysis structures beams plates shells sandwich composites theory also basis much fracture mechanics
hyperelasticity primarily used determine response elastomerbased objects gaskets biological materials soft tissues cell membranes
