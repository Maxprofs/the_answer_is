y (named wye /wa/ plural wyes) is the 25th and next-to-last letter in the modern english alphabet and the iso basic latin alphabet in the english writing system it represents either a vowel or a consonant
== name ==
in latin y was named i graeca since the classical greek sound /y/ similar to modern german or french u was not a native sound for latin speakers and the letter was initially only used to spell foreign words this history has led to the standard modern names of the letter in romance languages in galician i grego in catalan i grega in french and romanian i grec all meaning greek i the names igrek in polish and i g-rt in vietnamese are both phonetic borrowings of the french name in dutch both griekse ij and i-grec are used in spanish y is also called i griega however in the twentieth century the shorter name ye was proposed and was officially recognized as its name in 2010 by the real academia espaola although its original name is still accepted the original greek name (upsilon) has also been adapted into several modern languages in german for example it is called ypsilon and in italian the name is ipsilon or i greca in portuguese both names are used (psilon and i grego)
old english borrowed latin y to write the native old english sound /y/ (previously written with the rune yr ) the name of the letter may be related to ui (or vi') in various medieval languages in middle english it was wi /wi/ which through the great vowel shift became the modern english wy /wa/
== history ==
the oldest direct ancestor of english letter y was the semitic letter waw from which also come f u v and w see f for details the greek and latin alphabets developed from the phoenician form of this early alphabet in modern english there is also some historical influence from the old english letter yogh () which developed from semitic gimel as shown below
=== vowel ===
the letter y first appeared in this form as the capital of the greek letter upsilon the romans first borrowed a form of upsilon as the single letter v representing both the vowel sound /u/ and the consonant /w/ (in modern ways of writing latin v is typically written as u for a vowel or v for the consonant.) however this first loaning of upsilon into latin is not the source of modern english y
the usage of the greek y form of upsilon as opposed to u v or w dates back to the latin of the first century bc when upsilon was introduced a second time this time with its foot to distinguish it it was used to transcribe loanwords from the prestigious attic dialect of greek which had the non-latin sound /y/ as found in modern french cru (raw) or german grn (green) because it was not a native sound of latin it was usually pronounced /u/ or /i/ the latter pronunciation was the most common in the classical period and was used by most people except greek educated ones
the letter was also used for other languages with a /y/ sound some words of italic origin were re-spelled with a y latin silva ('forest') was commonly spelled sylva in analogy with the greek cognate and synonym 
the roman emperor claudius proposed introducing a new letter into the latin alphabet to transcribe the so-called sonus medius (a short vowel before labial consonants) which in inscriptions was sometimes used for greek upsilon instead
in old english there was a native /y/ sound and so all of latin u y and i were used to represent distinct vowels but by the time of middle english /y/ had lost its roundedness and became identical to i (/i/ and //) therefore many words that originally had i were spelled with y and vice versa
likewise modern english vocalic y is pronounced identically to the letter i but modern english uses it in only certain places unlike middle and early modern english it has three uses for upsilon in greek loan-words (system greek ) at the end of a word (rye city compare cities where s is final) and in place of i before the ending -ing (dy-ing justify-ing)
=== consonant ===
as a consonant in english y is normally a palatal approximant /j/ (year german jahr) this is possibly influenced by the middle english letter yogh () which represented /j/ (yogh's other sound // came to be written gh in middle english.)
=== confusion in writing with the letter thorn ===
when printing was introduced to great britain caxton and other english printers used y in place of (thorn modern english th) which did not exist in continental typefaces from this convention comes the spelling of the as ye in the mock archaism ye olde shoppe but in spite of the spelling pronunciation was the same as for modern the (stressed /i/ unstressed //) ye (/ji/) is purely a modern spelling pronunciation

in dutch it usually represents /i/ it may sometimes be left out of the dutch alphabet and replaced with the ij digraph in addition y and are occasionally used instead of dutch ij and ij albeit very rarely
in german the pronunciation /y/ has taken hold since the 19th century in classical loanwords for instance in words like typisch /typ/ typical hyne hysterie mysteris syndrom system typ it is also used for the sound /j/ in loanwords such as yacht (variation spelling jacht) yak yeti however e.g yo-yo is spelled jo-jo in german and yoghurt/yogurt/yoghourt jog(h)urt [mostly spelled with h]) the letter y is also used in many geographical names e.g bayern bavaria gypten egypt libyen libya paraguay syrien syria uruguay zypern cyprus (but jemen yemen jugoslawien yugoslavia) especially in german names the pronunciations /i/ or // occur as well for instance in the name meyer where it serves as a variant of i cf meier another common spelling of the name
a y that derives from the ij ligature occurs in the afrikaans language a descendant of dutch and in alemannic german names in afrikaans it denotes the diphthong [i] in alemannic german names it denotes long /i/ for instance in schnyder [nidr] or schwyz [its] the cognate non-alemannic german names schneider [nadr] or schweiz [ats] have the diphthong /a/ that developed from long /i/

in french orthography y is pronounced as [i] when a vowel (as in the words cycle y) and as [j] as a consonant (as in yeux voyez) it alternates orthographically with i in the conjugations of some verbs indicating a [j] sound in most cases when y follows a vowel it modifies the pronunciation of the vowel ay [] oy [wa] uy [i] the letter y has double function (modifying the vowel and [j] or [i]) in the words payer balayer moyen essuyer pays etc. but in some words it has only a single function [j] in bayer mayonnaise coyote modifying the vowel at the end of proper names like chardonnay and fourcroy in french y can have a diaresis (trma) as in mo-de-l'aisne
in the spanish language y was used as a word-initial form of i that was more visible (german has used j in a similar way.) hence el yugo y las flechas was a symbol sharing the initials of isabella i of castille (ysabel) and ferdinand ii of aragon this spelling was reformed by the royal spanish academy and currently is only found in proper names spelled archaically such as ybarra or cyii the symbol of the canal de isabel ii appearing alone as a word the letter y is a grammatical conjunction with the meaning and in spanish and is pronounced /i/ as a consonant y represents [] in spanish the letter is called i/y griega literally meaning greek i after the greek letter ypsilon or ye
in portuguese y (called psilon in brazil both psilon or i grego in portugal) was together with k and w recently re-introduced as the 25th letter and 19th consonant of the portuguese alphabet in consequence of the portuguese language orthographic agreement of 1990 it is mostly used in loanwords from english japanese spanish russian and hebrew loanwords in general primarily gallicisms in both varieties are more common in brazilian portuguese than in european portuguese it was always common for brazilians to stylize tupi-influenced names of their children with the letter (which is present in most romanizations of old tupi) e.g guaracy jandyra mayara though placenames and loanwords derived from indigenous origins had the letter substituted for i over time e.g nictheroy became niteri usual pronunciations are /i/ [j] [] and // (the two latter ones are inexistent in european and brazilian portuguese varieties respectively being both substituted by /i/ in other dialects) the letters i and y are regarded as phonemically not dissimilar though the first corresponds to a vowel and the latter to a consonant and both can correspond to a semivowel depending on its place in a word
