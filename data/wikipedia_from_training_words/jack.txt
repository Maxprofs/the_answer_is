a pigment is a material that changes the color of reflected or transmitted light as the result of wavelength-selective absorption this physical process differs from fluorescence phosphorescence and other forms of luminescence in which a material emits light
many materials selectively absorb certain wavelengths of light materials that humans have chosen and developed for use as pigments usually have special properties that make them ideal for coloring other materials a pigment must have a high tinting strength relative to the materials it colors it must be stable in solid form at ambient temperatures
for industrial applications as well as in the arts permanence and stability are desirable properties pigments that are not permanent are called fugitive fugitive pigments fade over time or with exposure to light while some eventually blacken
pigments are used for coloring paint ink plastic fabric cosmetics food and other materials most pigments used in manufacturing and the visual arts are dry colorants usually ground into a fine powder this powder is added to a binder (or vehicle) a relatively neutral or colorless material that suspends the pigment and gives the paint its adhesion
a distinction is usually made between a pigment which is insoluble in its vehicle (resulting in a suspension) and a dye which either is itself a liquid or is soluble in its vehicle (resulting in a solution) a colorant can act as either a pigment or a dye depending on the vehicle involved in some cases a pigment can be manufactured from a dye by precipitating a soluble dye with a metallic salt the resulting pigment is called a lake pigment the term biological pigment is used for all colored substances independent of their solubility
in 2006 around 7.4 million tons of inorganic organic and special pigments were marketed worldwide asia has the highest rate on a quantity basis followed by europe and north america by 2020 revenues will have risen to approx us$34.2 billion the global demand on pigments was roughly us$ 20.5 billion in 2009 around 1.5-2% up from the previous year it is predicted to increase in a stable growth rate in the coming years the worldwide sales are said to increase up to us$ 24.5 billion in 2015 and reach us$ 27.5 billion in 2018

pigments appear the colors they are because they selectively reflect and absorb certain wavelengths of visible light white light is a roughly equal mixture of the entire spectrum of visible light with a wavelength in a range from about 375 or 400 nanometers to about 760 or 780 nm when this light encounters a pigment parts of the spectrum are absorbed by the chemical bonds of conjugated systems and other components of the pigment some other wavelengths or parts of the spectrum are reflected or scattered most pigments are charge-transfer complexes like transition metal compounds with broad absorption bands that subtract most of the colors of the incident white light the new reflected light spectrum creates the appearance of a color pigments unlike fluorescent or phosphorescent substances can only subtract wavelengths from the source light never add new ones
the appearance of pigments is intimately connected to the color of the source light sunlight has a high color temperature and a fairly uniform spectrum and is considered a standard for white light artificial light sources tend to have great peaks in some parts of their spectrum and deep valleys in others viewed under these conditions pigments will appear different colors
color spaces used to represent colors numerically must specify their light source lab color measurements unless otherwise noted assume that the measurement was taken under a d65 light source or daylight 6500 k which is roughly the color temperature of sunlight
other properties of a color such as its saturation or lightness may be determined by the other substances that accompany pigments binders and fillers added to pure pigment chemicals also have their own reflection and absorption patterns which can affect the final spectrum likewise in pigment/binder mixtures individual rays of light may not encounter pigment molecules and may be reflected as is these stray rays of source light contribute to a slightly less saturated color pure pigment allows very little white light to escape producing a highly saturated color a small quantity of pigment mixed with a lot of white binder however will appear desaturated and pale due to the high quantity of escaping white light
== historyedit ==
naturally occurring pigments such as ochres and iron oxides have been used as colorants since prehistoric times archaeologists have uncovered evidence that early humans used paint for aesthetic purposes such as body decoration pigments and paint grinding equipment believed to be between 350,000 and 400,000 years old have been reported in a cave at twin rivers near lusaka zambia
before the industrial revolution the range of color available for art and decorative uses was technically limited most of the pigments in use were earth and mineral pigments or pigments of biological origin pigments from unusual sources such as botanical materials animal waste insects and mollusks were harvested and traded over long distances some colors were costly or impossible to mix with the range of pigments that were available blue and purple came to be associated with royalty because of their expense
biological pigments were often difficult to acquire and the details of their production were kept secret by the manufacturers tyrian purple is a pigment made from the mucus of one of several species of murex snail production of tyrian purple for use as a fabric dye began as early as 1200 bce by the phoenicians and was continued by the greeks and romans until 1453 ce with the fall of constantinople the pigment was expensive and complex to produce and items colored with it became associated with power and wealth greek historian theopompus writing in the 4th century bce reported that purple for dyes fetched its weight in silver at colophon [in asia minor].
mineral pigments were also traded over long distances the only way to achieve a deep rich blue was by using a semi-precious stone lapis lazuli to produce a pigment known as ultramarine and the best sources of lapis were remote flemish painter jan van eyck working in the 15th century did not ordinarily include blue in his paintings to have one's portrait commissioned and painted with ultramarine blue was considered a great luxury if a patron wanted blue they were obliged to pay extra when van eyck used lapis he never blended it with other colors instead he applied it in pure form almost as a decorative glaze the prohibitive price of lapis lazuli forced artists to seek less expensive replacement pigments both mineral (azurite smalt) and biological (indigo)
spain's conquest of a new world empire in the 16th century introduced new pigments and colors to peoples on both sides of the atlantic carmine a dye and pigment derived from a parasitic insect found in central and south america attained great status and value in europe produced from harvested dried and crushed cochineal insects carmine could be and still is used in fabric dye food dye body paint or in its solid lake form almost any kind of paint or cosmetic
natives of peru had been producing cochineal dyes for textiles since at least 700 ce but europeans had never seen the color before when the spanish invaded the aztec empire in what is now mexico they were quick to exploit the color for new trade opportunities carmine became the region's second most valuable export next to silver pigments produced from the cochineal insect gave the catholic cardinals their vibrant robes and the english redcoats their distinctive uniforms the true source of the pigment an insect was kept secret until the 18th century when biologists discovered the source
while carmine was popular in europe blue remained an exclusive color associated with wealth and status the 17th-century dutch master johannes vermeer often made lavish use of lapis lazuli along with carmine and indian yellow in his vibrant paintings
=== development of synthetic pigmentsedit ===
the earliest known pigments were natural minerals natural iron oxides give a range of colors and are found in many paleolithic and neolithic cave paintings two examples include red ochre anhydrous fe2o3 and the hydrated yellow ochre (fe2o3.h2o) charcoal or carbon black has also been used as a black pigment since prehistoric times
two of the first synthetic pigments were white lead (basic lead carbonate (pbco3)2pb(oh)2) and blue frit (egyptian blue) white lead is made by combining lead with vinegar (acetic acid ch3cooh) in the presence of co2 blue frit is calcium copper silicate and was made from glass colored with a copper ore such as malachite these pigments were used as early as the second millennium bce later premodern additions to the range of synthetic pigments included vermillion verdigris and lead-tin-yellow
the industrial and scientific revolutions brought a huge expansion in the range of synthetic pigments pigments that are manufactured or refined from naturally occurring materials available both for manufacturing and artistic expression because of the expense of lapis lazuli much effort went into finding a less costly blue pigment
prussian blue was the first modern synthetic pigment discovered by accident in 1704 by the early 19th century synthetic and metallic blue pigments had been added to the range of blues including french ultramarine a synthetic form of lapis lazuli and the various forms of cobalt and cerulean blue in the early 20th century organic chemistry added phthalo blue a synthetic organometallic pigment with overwhelming tinting power
discoveries in color science created new industries and drove changes in fashion and taste the discovery in 1856 of mauveine the first aniline dye was a forerunner for the development of hundreds of synthetic dyes and pigments like azo and diazo compounds which are the source of a wide spectrum of colors mauveine was discovered by an 18-year-old chemist named william henry perkin who went on to exploit his discovery in industry and become wealthy his success attracted a generation of followers as young scientists went into organic chemistry to pursue riches within a few years chemists had synthesized a substitute for madder in the production of alizarin crimson by the closing decades of the 19th century textiles paints and other commodities in colors such as red crimson blue and purple had become affordable
development of chemical pigments and dyes helped bring new industrial prosperity to germany and other countries in northern europe but it brought dissolution and decline elsewhere in spain's former new world empire the production of cochineal colors employed thousands of low-paid workers the spanish monopoly on cochineal production had been worth a fortune until the early 19th century when the mexican war of independence and other market changes disrupted production organic chemistry delivered the final blow for the cochineal color industry when chemists created inexpensive substitutes for carmine an industry and a way of life went into steep decline
=== new sources for historic pigmentsedit ===
before the industrial revolution many pigments were known by the location where they were produced pigments based on minerals and clays often bore the name of the city or region where they were mined raw sienna and burnt sienna came from siena italy while raw umber and burnt umber came from umbria these pigments were among the easiest to synthesize and chemists created modern colors based on the originals that were more consistent than colors mined from the original ore bodies but the place names remained
historically and culturally many famous natural pigments have been replaced with synthetic pigments while retaining historic names in some cases the original color name has shifted in meaning as a historic name has been applied to a popular modern color by convention a contemporary mixture of pigments that replaces a historical pigment is indicated by calling the resulting color a hue but manufacturers are not always careful in maintaining this distinction the following examples illustrate the shifting nature of historic pigment names
indian yellow was once produced by collecting the urine of cattle that had been fed only mango leaves dutch and flemish painters of the 17th and 18th centuries favored it for its luminescent qualities and often used it to represent sunlight in the novel girl with a pearl earring vermeer's patron remarks that vermeer used cow piss to paint his wife since mango leaves are nutritionally inadequate for cattle the practice of harvesting indian yellow was eventually declared to be inhumane modern hues of indian yellow are made from synthetic pigments
ultramarine originally the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli has been replaced by an inexpensive modern synthetic pigment french ultramarine manufactured from aluminium silicate with sulfur impurities at the same time royal blue another name once given to tints produced from lapis lazuli has evolved to signify a much lighter and brighter color and is usually mixed from phthalo blue and titanium dioxide or from inexpensive synthetic blue dyes since synthetic ultramarine is chemically identical with lapis lazuli the hue designation is not used french blue yet another historic name for ultramarine was adopted by the textile and apparel industry as a color name in the 1990s and was applied to a shade of blue that has nothing in common with the historic pigment ultramarine
vermilion a toxic mercury compound favored for its deep red-orange color by old master painters such as titian has been replaced in painters palettes by various modern pigments including cadmium reds although genuine vermilion paint can still be purchased for fine arts and art conservation applications few manufacturers make it because of legal liability issues few artists buy it because it has been superseded by modern pigments that are both less expensive and less toxic as well as less reactive with other pigments as a result genuine vermilion is almost unavailable modern vermilion colors are properly designated as vermilion hue to distinguish them from genuine vermilion
== manufacturing and industrial standardsedit ==
before the development of synthetic pigments and the refinement of techniques for extracting mineral pigments batches of color were often inconsistent with the development of a modern color industry manufacturers and professionals have cooperated to create international standards for identifying producing measuring and testing colors
first published in 1905 the munsell color system became the foundation for a series of color models providing objective methods for the measurement of color the munsell system describes a color in three dimensions hue value (lightness) and chroma (color purity) where chroma is the difference from gray at a given hue and value
by the middle years of the 20th century standardized methods for pigment chemistry were available part of an international movement to create such standards in industry the international organization for standardization (iso) develops technical standards for the manufacture of pigments and dyes iso standards define various industrial and chemical properties and how to test for them the principal iso standards that relate to all pigments are as follows
iso-787 general methods of test for pigments and extenders
iso-8780 methods of dispersion for assessment of dispersion characteristics
other iso standards pertain to particular classes or categories of pigments based on their chemical composition such as ultramarine pigments titanium dioxide iron oxide pigments and so forth
many manufacturers of paints inks textiles plastics and colors have voluntarily adopted the colour index international (cii) as a standard for identifying the pigments that they use in manufacturing particular colors first published in 1925 and now published jointly on the web by the society of dyers and colourists (united kingdom) and the american association of textile chemists and colorists (usa) this index is recognized internationally as the authoritative reference on colorants it encompasses more than 27,000 products under more than 13,000 generic color index names
in the cii schema each pigment has a generic index number that identifies it chemically regardless of proprietary and historic names for example phthalocyanine blue bn has been known by a variety of generic and proprietary names since its discovery in the 1930s in much of europe phthalocyanine blue is better known as helio blue or by a proprietary name such as winsor blue an american paint manufacturer grumbacher registered an alternate spelling (thalo blue) as a trademark colour index international resolves all these conflicting historic generic and proprietary names so that manufacturers and consumers can identify the pigment (or dye) used in a particular color product in the cii all phthalocyanine blue pigments are designated by a generic color index number as either pb15 or pb16 short for pigment blue 15 and pigment blue 16 these two numbers reflect slight variations in molecular structure that produce a slightly more greenish or reddish blue
== scientific and technical issuesedit ==
selection of a pigment for a particular application is determined by cost and by the physical properties and attributes of the pigment itself for example a pigment that is used to color glass must have very high heat stability in order to survive the manufacturing process but suspended in the glass vehicle its resistance to alkali or acidic materials is not an issue in artistic paint heat stability is less important while lightfastness and toxicity are greater concerns
the following are some of the attributes of pigments that determine their suitability for particular manufacturing processes and applications
lightfastness and sensitivity for damage from ultra violet light
heat stability
toxicity
tinting strength
staining
dispersion
opacity or transparency
resistance to alkalis and acids
reactions and interactions between pigments

swatches are used to communicate colors accurately for different media like printing computers plastics textiles different type of swatches are used generally the media which offers widest gamut of color shades is widely used across different media
=== printed swatchesedit ===
there are many reference standards providing printed swatches of color shades pantone ral munsell etc are widely used standards of color communication across different media like printing plastics and textiles
=== plastic swatchesedit ===
companies manufacturing color masterbatches and pigments for plastics offer plastic swatches in injection molded color chips these color chips are supplied to the designer or customer to choose and select the color for their specific plastic products
plastic swatches are available in various special effects like pearl metallic fluorescent sparkle mosaic etc however these effects are difficult to replicate on other media like print and computer display wherein they have created plastic swatches on website by 3d modelling to including various special effects
=== computer swatchesedit ===
pure pigments reflect light in a very specific way that cannot be precisely duplicated by the discrete light emitters in a computer display however by making careful measurements of pigments close approximations can be made the munsell color system provides a good conceptual explanation of what is missing munsell devised a system that provides an objective measure of color in three dimensions hue value (or lightness) and chroma computer displays in general are unable to show the true chroma of many pigments but the hue and lightness can be reproduced with relative accuracy however when the gamma of a computer display deviates from the reference value the hue is also systematically biased
the following approximations assume a display device at gamma 2.2 using the srgb color space the further a display device deviates from these standards the less accurate these swatches will be swatches are based on the average measurements of several lots of single-pigment watercolor paints converted from lab color space to srgb color space for viewing on a computer display different brands and lots of the same pigment may vary in color furthermore pigments have inherently complex reflectance spectra that will render their color appearance greatly different depending on the spectrum of the source illumination a property called metamerism averaged measurements of pigment samples will only yield approximations of their true appearance under a specific source of illumination computer display systems use a technique called chromatic adaptation transforms to emulate the correlated color temperature of illumination sources and cannot perfectly reproduce the intricate spectral combinations originally seen in many cases the perceived color of a pigment falls outside of the gamut of computer displays and a method called gamut mapping is used to approximate the true appearance gamut mapping trades off any one of lightness hue or saturation accuracy to render the color on screen depending on the priority chosen in the conversion's icc rendering intent
== biological pigmentsedit ==
in biology a pigment is any colored material of plant or animal cells many biological structures such as skin eyes fur and hair contain pigments (such as melanin) animal skin coloration often comes about through specialized cells called chromatophores which animals such as the octopus and chameleon can control to vary the animal's color many conditions affect the levels or nature of pigments in plant animal some protista or fungus cells for instance the disorder called albinism affects the level of melanin production in animals
pigmentation in organisms serves many biological purposes including camouflage mimicry aposematism (warning) sexual selection and other forms of signalling photosynthesis (in plants) as well as basic physical purposes such as protection from sunburn
pigment color differs from structural color in that pigment color is the same for all viewing angles whereas structural color is the result of selective reflection or iridescence usually because of multilayer structures for example butterfly wings typically contain structural color although many butterflies have cells that contain pigment as well
