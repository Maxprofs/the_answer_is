levels protein structureedit
four distinct levels protein structure
amino acid residuesedit
amino acid consists backbone present amino acid types side chain unique type residue note biochemistry residue refers specific monomer within polymeric chain exception rule proline carbon atom bound four different groups chiral however one isomers occur biological proteins glycine however chiral since side chain hydrogen atom simple mnemonic correct lform corn c atom viewed h front residues read corn clockwise direction
primary structureedit
primary structure protein refers linear sequence amino acids polypeptide chain primary structure held together covalent bonds peptide bonds made process protein biosynthesis translation two ends polypeptide chain referred carboxyl terminus cterminus amino terminus nterminus based nature free group extremity counting residues always starts nterminal end nhgroup end amino group involved peptide bond primary structure protein determined gene corresponding protein specific sequence nucleotides dna transcribed mrna read ribosome process called translation sequence amino acids discovered frederick sanger sequence protein unique protein defines structure function protein sequence protein determined methods edman degradation tandem mass spectrometry often however read directly sequence gene using genetic code know proteins human body composed different arrangements types amino acid residues strictly recommended use words amino acid residues discussing proteins peptide bond formed water molecule lost therefore proteins made amino acid residues posttranslational modification disulfide bond formation phosphorylations glycosylations usually also considered part primary structure cannot read gene example insulin composed amino acids chains one chain amino acids amino acids
secondary structureedit
secondary structure refers highly regular local substructures actual polypeptide backbone chain two main types secondary structure alpha helix beta strand beta sheets suggested linus pauling coworkers secondary structures defined patterns hydrogen bonds mainchain peptide groups regular geometry constrained specific values dihedral angles ramachandran plot alpha helix beta sheet represent way saturating hydrogen bond donors acceptors peptide backbone parts protein ordered form regular structures confused random coil unfolded polypeptide chain lacking fixed threedimensional structure several sequential secondary structures may form supersecondary unit

tertiary structure refers threedimensional structure monomeric multimeric protein molecules alphahelixes beta pleatedsheets folded compact globular structure folding driven nonspecific hydrophobic interactions burial hydrophobic residues water structure stable parts protein domain locked place specific tertiary interactions salt bridges hydrogen bonds tight packing side chains disulfide bonds disulfide bonds extremely rare cytosolic proteins since cytosol intracellular fluid generally reducing environment
quaternary structureedit
quaternary structure threedimensional structure multisubunit protein subunits fit together context quaternary structure stabilized noncovalent interactions disulfide bonds tertiary structure complexes two polypeptides ie multiple subunits called multimers specifically would called dimer contains two subunits trimer contains three subunits tetramer contains four subunits pentamer contains five subunits subunits frequently related one another symmetry operations fold axis dimer multimers made identical subunits referred prefix homo eg homotetramer made different subunits referred prefix hetero example heterotetramer two alpha two beta chains hemoglobin
domains motifs folds protein structureedit
proteins frequently described consisting several structural units units include domains motifs folds despite fact different proteins expressed eukaryotic systems many fewer different domains structural motifs folds
structural domainedit
structural domain element proteins overall structure selfstabilizing often folds independently rest protein chain many domains unique protein products one gene one gene family instead appear variety proteins domains often named singled figure prominently biological function protein belong example calciumbinding domain calmodulin independently stable domains swapped genetic engineering one protein another make chimera proteins
structural sequence motifedit
structural sequence motifs refer short segments protein threedimensional structure amino acid sequence found large number different proteins
supersecondary structureedit
supersecondary structure refers specific combination secondary structure elements betaalphabeta units helixturnhelix motif may also referred structural motifs
protein foldedit
protein fold refers general protein architecture like helix bundle betabarrel rossman fold different folds provided structural classification proteins database related concept protein topology refers arrangement contacts within protein
superdomainedit
superdomain consists two nominally unrelated structural domains inherited single unit occur different proteins example provided protein tyrosine phosphatase domain c domain pair pten several tensin proteins auxilin proteins plants fungi ptpc superdomain evidently came existence prior divergence fungi plants animals therefore likely billion years old

structure classificationedit
protein structures grouped based similarity common evolutionary origin structural classification proteins database cath database provide two different structural classifications proteins shared structure proteins considered evidence evolutionary relatedness proteins used group proteins together protein superfamilies
computational prediction protein structureedit
