a watch is a small timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person it is designed to keep working despite the motions caused by the person's activities a wristwatch is designed to be worn on a wrist attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet a pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket
watches evolved in the 17th century from spring-powered clocks which appeared as early as the 14th century the first watches were strictly mechanical driven by clockwork as technology progressed mechanical devices used to control the speed of the watch were largely superseded by vibrating quartz crystals that produce accurately timed electronic pulses some watches use radio clock technology to regularly correct the time the first digital electronic watch was developed in 1970
most inexpensive and medium-priced watches used mainly for timekeeping are electronic watches with quartz movements expensive collectible watches valued more for their elaborate craftsmanship aesthetic appeal and glamorous design than for simple timekeeping often have purely mechanical movements and are powered by springs even though these movements are generally less accurate and more expensive than electronic ones various extra features called complications such as moon-phase displays and the different types of tourbillon are sometimes included modern watches often display the day date month and year and electronic watches may have many other functions time-related features such as timers chronographs and alarm functions are common some modern designs incorporate calculators gps and bluetooth technology or have heart-rate monitoring capabilities watches incorporating gps receivers use them not only to determine their position they also receive and use time signals from the satellites which make them essentially perfectly accurate timekeepers even over long periods of time
recent developments include smartwatches which are elaborate computer-like electronic devices designed to be worn on a wrist they generally incorporate timekeeping functions but these are only small fractions of what the watch can do
the study of timekeeping is known as horology
== historyedit ==
watches evolved from portable spring-driven clocks which first appeared in 15th century europe watches weren't widely worn in pockets until the 17th century one account says that the word watch came from the old english word woecce which meant watchman because it was used by town watchmen to keep track of their shifts at work another says that the term came from 17th century sailors who used the new mechanisms to time the length of their shipboard watches (duty shifts)
a great leap forward in accuracy occurred in 1657 with the addition of the balance spring to the balance wheel an invention disputed both at the time and ever since between robert hooke and christiaan huygens this innovation increased watches accuracy enormously reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day resulting in the addition of the minute hand to the face from around 1680 in britain and 1700 in france
the increased accuracy of the balance wheel focused attention on errors caused by other parts of the movement igniting a two century wave of watchmaking innovation the first thing to be improved was the escapement the verge escapement was replaced in quality watches by the cylinder escapement invented by thomas tompion in 1695 and further developed by george graham in the 1720s improvements in manufacturing such as the tooth-cutting machine devised by robert hooke allowed some increase in the volume of watch production although finishing and assembling was still done by hand until well into the 19th century
a major cause of error in balance wheel timepieces caused by changes in elasticity of the balance spring from temperature changes was solved by the bimetallic temperature compensated balance wheel invented in 1765 by pierre le roy and improved by thomas earnshaw the lever escapement was the single most important technological breakthrough and was invented by thomas mudge in 1759 and improved by josiah emery in 1785 although it only gradually came into use from about 1800 onwards chiefly in britain
the british had predominated in watch manufacture for much of the 17th and 18th centuries but maintained a system of production that was geared towards high quality products for the elite although there was an attempt to modernise clock manufacture with mass production techniques and the application of duplicating tools and machinery by the british watch company in 1843 it was in the united states that this system took off aaron lufkin dennison started a factory in 1851 in massachusetts that used interchangeable parts and by 1861 it was running a successful enterprise incorporated as the waltham watch company
=== wristwatchedit ===
the concept of the wristwatch goes back to the production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century elizabeth i of england received a wristwatch from robert dudley in 1571 described as an arm watch from the beginning wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century
wristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the 19th century when the importance of synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized the garstin company of london patented a watch wristlet design in 1893 but they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s officers in the british army began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s such as during the anglo-burma war of 1885 during the boer war the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile boer insurgents became paramount and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class the company mappin & webb began production of their successful campaign watch for soldiers during the campaign at the sudan in 1898 and ramped up production for the boer war a few years later
these early models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap but by the early 20th century manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches the swiss company dimier frres & cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903 hans wilsdorf moved to london in 1905 and set up his own business with his brother-in-law alfred davis wilsdorf & davis providing quality timepieces at affordable prices the company later became rolex wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch and contracted the swiss firm aegler to produce a line of wristwatches
the impact of the first world war dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch and opened up a mass market in the postwar era the creeping barrage artillery tactic developed during the war required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage service watches produced during the war were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare with luminous dials and unbreakable glass the british war department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917 by the end of the war almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch and after they were demobilized the fashion soon caught on the british horological journal wrote in 1917 that the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire. by 1930 the ratio of wrist- to pocketwatches was 50 to 1 the first successful self-winding system was invented by john harwood in 1923
the introduction of the quartz watch in 1969 was a revolutionary improvement in watch technology in place of a balance wheel which oscillated at 5 beats per second it used a quartz crystal resonator which vibrated at 8,192 hz driven by a battery powered oscillator circuit since the 1980s more quartz watches than mechanical ones have been marketed
== movementedit ==
a movement of a watch is the mechanism that measures the passage of time and displays the current time (and possibly other information including date month and day) movements may be entirely mechanical entirely electronic (potentially with no moving parts) or they might be a blend of both most watches intended mainly for timekeeping today have electronic movements with mechanical hands on the watch face indicating the time
=== mechanical movementsedit ===
compared to electronic movements mechanical watches are less accurate often with errors of seconds per day and they are sensitive to position temperature and magnetism they are also costly to produce require regular maintenance and adjustments and are more prone to failures nevertheless the craftsmanship of mechanical watches still attracts interest from part of the watch-buying public especially among the watch collectors skeleton watches are designed to leave the mechanism visible for aesthetic purposes
a mechanical movement uses an escapement mechanism to control and limit the unwinding and winding parts of a spring converting what would otherwise be a simple unwinding into a controlled and periodic energy release a mechanical movement also uses a balance wheel together with the balance spring (also known as a hairspring) to control motion of the gear system of the watch in a manner analogous to the pendulum of a pendulum clock the tourbillon an optional part for mechanical movements is a rotating frame for the escapement which is used to cancel out or reduce the effects of gravitational bias to the timekeeping due to the complexity of designing a tourbillon they are very expensive and only found in prestigious watches
the pin-lever escapement (called the roskopf movement after its inventor georges frederic roskopf) which is a cheaper version of the fully levered movement was manufactured in huge quantities by many swiss manufacturers as well as by timex until it was replaced by quartz movements
tuning-fork watches use a type of electromechanical movement introduced by bulova in 1960 they use a tuning fork with a precise frequency (most often 360 hertz) to drive a mechanical watch the task of converting electronically pulsed fork vibration into rotary movements is done via two tiny jeweled fingers called pawls tuning-fork watches were rendered obsolete when electronic quartz watches were developed quartz watches were cheaper to produce besides being more accurate
traditional mechanical watch movements use a spiral spring called a mainspring as a power source in manual watches the spring must be rewound periodically by the user by turning the watch crown antique pocketwatches were wound by inserting a separate key into a hole in the back of the watch and turning it most modern watches are designed to run 40 hours on a winding and thus must be wound daily but some run for several days and a few have 192-hour mainsprings and are wound weekly
==== automatic watchesedit ====
a self-winding or automatic watch is one that rewinds the mainspring of a mechanical movement by the natural motions of the wearer's body the first self-winding mechanism was invented for pocket watches in 1770 by abraham-louis perrelet but the first self-winding or automatic wristwatch was the invention of a british watch repairer named john harwood in 1923 this type of watch winds itself without requiring any special action by the wearer it uses an eccentric weight called a winding rotor which rotates with the movement of the wearer's wrist the back-and-forth motion of the winding rotor couples to a ratchet to wind the mainspring automatically self-winding watches usually can also be wound manually to keep them running when not worn or if the wearer's wrist motions are inadequate to keep the watch wound
in april 2014 the swatch group launched the sistem51 wristwatch it has a purely mechanical movement consisting of only 51 parts including a novel self-winding mechanism with a transparent oscillating weight so far it is the only mechanical movement manufactured entirely on a fully automated assembly line the low parts count and the automated assembly make it an inexpensive mechanical swiss watch which can be considered a successor to roskopf movements although of higher quality
=== electronic movementsedit ===
electronic movements also known as quartz movements have few or no moving parts except a quartz crystal which is made to vibrate by the piezoelectric effect a varying electric voltage is applied to the crystal which responds by changing its shape so in combination with some electronic components it functions as an oscillator it resonates at a specific highly stable frequency which is used to accurately pace a timekeeping mechanism most quartz movements are primarily electronic but are geared to drive mechanical hands on the face of the watch to provide a traditional analog display of the time a feature most consumers still prefer
in 1959 seiko placed an order with epson (a daughter company of seiko and the brain behind the quartz revolution) to start developing a quartz wristwatch the project was codenamed 59a by the 1964 tokyo summer olympics seiko had a working prototype of a portable quartz watch which was used as the time measurements throughout the event
the first prototypes of an electronic quartz wristwatch (not just portable quartz watches as the seiko timekeeping devices at the tokyo olympics in 1964) were made by the ceh research laboratory in neuchtel switzerland from 1965 through 1967 pioneering development work was done on a miniaturized 8192 hz quartz oscillator a thermo-compensation module and an inhouse-made dedicated integrated circuit (unlike the hybrid circuits used in the later seiko astron wristwatch) as a result the beta 1 prototype set new timekeeping performance records at the international chronometric competition held at the observatory of neuchtel in 1967 in 1970 18 manufacturers exhibited production versions of the beta 21 wristwatch including the omega electroquartz as well as patek philippe rolex oysterquartz and piaget
the first quartz watch to enter production was the seiko 35 sq astron which hit the shelves on 25 december 1969 swiftly followed by the swiss beta 21 and then a year later the prototype of one of the world's most accurate wristwatches to date the omega marine chronometer thanks to the technology having been developed by the swiss seiko could not patent the whole movement of the quartz wristwatch thus allowing other manufacturers to participate in the rapid growth and development of the quartz watch market this ended in less than a decade almost 100 years of dominance by the mechanical wristwatch legacy modern quartz movements are produced in very large quantities and even the cheapest wristwatches typically have quartz movements whereas mechanical movements can typically be off by several seconds a day an inexpensive quartz movement in a child's wristwatch may still be accurate to within half a second per day ten times more accurate than a mechanical movement
after a consolidation of the mechanical watch industry in switzerland during the 1970s mass production of quartz wristwatches took off under the leadership of the swatch group of companies a swiss conglomerate with vertical control of the production of swiss watches and related products for quartz wristwatches subsidiaries of swatch manufacture watch batteries (renata) oscillators (oscilloquartz now micro crystal ag) and integrated circuits (ebauches electronic sa renamed em microelectronic-marin) the launch of the new swatch brand in 1983 was marked by bold new styling design and marketing today the swatch group maintains its position as the world's largest watch company
seiko's efforts to combine the quartz and mechanical movements bore fruit after 20 years of research leading to the introduction of the seiko spring drive first in a limited domestic market production in 1999 and to the world in september 2005 the spring drive keeps time within quartz standards without the use of a battery using a traditional mechanical gear train powered by a spring without the need for a balance wheel either
radio time signal watches are a type of electronic quartz watch which synchronizes (time transfers) its time with an external time source such as in atomic clocks time signals from gps navigation satellites the german dcf77 signal in europe wwvb in the us and others movements of this type may among others synchronize the time of day and the date the leap-year status and the state of daylight saving time (on or off) however other than the radio receiver these watches are normal quartz watches in all other aspects
electronic watches require electricity as a power source and some mechanical movements and hybrid electronic-mechanical movements also require electricity usually the electricity is provided by a replaceable battery the first use of electrical power in watches was as a substitute for the mainspring to remove the need for winding the first electrically powered watch the hamilton electric 500 was released in 1957 by the hamilton watch company of lancaster pennsylvania
watch batteries (strictly speaking cells as a battery is composed of multiple cells) are specially designed for their purpose they are very small and provide tiny amounts of power continuously for very long periods (several years or more) in most cases replacing the battery requires a trip to a watch-repair shop or watch dealer this is especially true for watches that are water-resistant as special tools and procedures are required for the watch to remain water-resistant after battery replacement silver-oxide and lithium batteries are popular today mercury batteries formerly quite common are no longer used for environmental reasons cheap batteries may be alkaline of the same size as silver-oxide cells but providing shorter life rechargeable batteries are used in some solar-powered watches
some electronic watches are powered by the movement of the wearer for instance seiko's kinetic-powered quartz watches use the motion of the wearer's arm turning a rotating weight which causes a tiny generator to supply power to charge a rechargeable battery that runs the watch the concept is similar to that of self-winding spring movements except that electrical power is generated instead of mechanical spring tension
solar powered watches are powered by light a photovoltaic cell on the face (dial) of the watch converts light to electricity which is used to charge a rechargeable battery or capacitor the movement of the watch draws its power from the rechargeable battery or capacitor as long as the watch is regularly exposed to fairly strong light (such as sunlight) it never needs battery replacement some models need only a few minutes of sunlight to provide weeks of energy (as in the citizen eco-drive) some of the early solar watches of the 1970s had innovative and unique designs to accommodate the array of solar cells needed to power them (synchronar nepro sicura and some models by cristalonic alba seiko and citizen) as the decades progressed and the efficiency of the solar cells increased while the power requirements of the movement and display decreased solar watches began to be designed to look like other conventional watches
a rarely used power source is the temperature difference between the wearer's arm and the surrounding environment (as applied in the citizen eco-drive thermo)
== displayedit ==
=== analogedit ===
traditionally watches have displayed the time in analog form with a numbered dial upon which are mounted at least a rotating hour hand and a longer rotating minute hand many watches also incorporate a third hand that shows the current second of the current minute watches powered by quartz usually have a second hand that snaps every second to the next marker watches powered by a mechanical movement appears to have a gliding second hand although it is actually not gliding the hand merely moves in smaller steps typically 1/5 of a second corresponding to the beat (half period) of the balance wheel in some escapements (for example the duplex escapement) the hand advances every two beats (full period) of the balance wheel typically 1/2 second in those watches or even every four beats (two periods 1 second) in the double duplex escapement a truly gliding second hand is achieved with the tri-synchro regulator of spring drive watches all of the hands are normally mechanical physically rotating on the dial although a few watches have been produced with hands that are simulated by a liquid-crystal display
analog display of the time is nearly universal in watches sold as jewelry or collectibles and in these watches the range of different styles of hands numbers and other aspects of the analog dial is very broad in watches sold for timekeeping analog display remains very popular as many people find it easier to read than digital display but in timekeeping watches the emphasis is on clarity and accurate reading of the time under all conditions (clearly marked digits easily visible hands large watch faces etc.) they are specifically designed for the left wrist with the stem (the knob used for changing the time) on the right side of the watch this makes it easy to change the time without removing the watch from the wrist this is the case if one is right-handed and the watch is worn on the left wrist (as is traditionally done) if one is left-handed and wears the watch on the right wrist one has to remove the watch from the wrist to reset the time or to wind the watch
analog watches as well as clocks are often marketed showing a display time of approximately 1:50 or 10:10 this creates a visually pleasing smile-like face on upper half of the watch in addition to enclosing the manufacturer's name digital displays often show a time of 12:08 where the increase in the number of active segments or pixels gives a positive feeling
==== tactileedit ====
tissot a swiss luxury watchmaker makes the silen-t wristwatch with a touch-sensitive face that vibrates to help the user to tell time eyes-free the bezel of the watch features raised bumps at each hour maker after briefly touching the face of the watch the wearer runs a finger around the bezel clockwise when the finger reaches the bump indicating the hour the watch vibrates continuously and when the finger reaches the bump indicating the minute the watch vibrates intermittently
eone timepieces washington d.c.-based company launched its first tactile analog wristwatch the bradley on 11 july 2013 on the kickstarter website the device is primarily designed for sight-impaired users who can use the watch's two ball bearings to determine the time but it is also suitable for general use the watch features raised marks at each hour and two moving magnetically attached ball bearings one ball bearing on the edge of the watch indicates the hour while the other on the face indicates the minute
=== digitaledit ===
a digital display simply shows the time as a number e.g. 12:08 instead of a short hand pointing towards the number 12 and a long hand 8/60 of the way round the dial the digits are usually shown as a seven-segment display
the first digital mechanical pocket watches appeared in the late 19th century in the 1920s the first digital mechanical wristwatches appeared
the first digital electronic watch a pulsar led prototype in 1970 was developed jointly by hamilton watch company and electro-data founded by george h thiess john bergey the head of hamilton's pulsar division said that he was inspired to make a digital timepiece by the then-futuristic digital clock that hamilton themselves made for the 1968 science fiction film 2001 a space odyssey on 4 april 1972 the pulsar was finally ready made in 18-carat gold and sold for $2,100 it had a red light-emitting diode (led) display
digital led watches were very expensive and out of reach to the common consumer until 1975 when texas instruments started to mass-produce led watches inside a plastic case these watches which first retailed for only $20 reduced to $10 in 1976 saw pulsar lose $6 million and the pulsar brand sold to seiko
an early led watch that was rather problematic was the black watch made and sold by british company sinclair research in 1975 this was only sold for a few years as production problems and returned (faulty) product forced the company to cease production
most watches with led displays required that the user press a button to see the time displayed for a few seconds because leds used so much power that they could not be kept operating continuously usually the led display color would be red watches with led displays were popular for a few years but soon the led displays were superseded by liquid crystal displays (lcds) which used less battery power and were much more convenient in use with the display always visible and no need to push a button before seeing the time only in darkness you had to press a button to light the display with a tiny light bulb later illuminating leds
the first lcd watch with a six-digit lcd was the 1973 seiko 06lc although various forms of early lcd watches with a four-digit display were marketed as early as 1972 including the 1972 gruen teletime lcd watch and the cox electronic systems quarza in switzerland ebauches electronic sa presented a prototype eight-digit lcd wristwatch showing time and date at the muba fair basle in march 1973 using a twisted nematic lcd manufactured by brown boveri & cie switzerland which became the supplier of lcds to casio for the casiotron watch in 1974
a problem with liquid crystal displays is that they use polarized light if for example the user is wearing polarized sunglasses the watch may be difficult to read because the plane of polarization of the display is roughly perpendicular to that of the glasses if the light that illuminates the display is polarized for example if it comes from a blue sky the display may be difficult or impossible to read
from the 1980s onward digital watch technology vastly improved in 1982 seiko produced the seiko tv watch that had a television screen built in and casio produced a digital watch with a thermometer as well as another that could translate 1,500 japanese words into english in 1985 casio produced the cfx-400 scientific calculator watch in 1987 casio produced a watch that could dial your telephone number and citizen revealed one that would react to your voice in 1995 timex released a watch which allowed the wearer to download and store data from a computer to their wrist some watches such as the timex datalink usb feature dot matrix displays since their apex during the late 1980s to mid-1990s high technology fad digital watches have mostly become simpler less expensive time pieces with little variety between models
=== illuminatededit ===
many watches have displays that are illuminated so they can be used in darkness various methods have been used to achieve this
mechanical watches often have luminous paint on their hands and hour marks in the mid-20th century radioactive material was often incorporated in the paint so it would continue to glow without any exposure to light radium was often used but produced small amounts of radiation outside the watch that might have been hazardous tritium was used as a replacement since the radiation it produces has such low energy that it cannot penetrate a watch glass however tritium is expensive it has to be made in a nuclear reactor and it has a half-life of only about 12 years so the paint remains luminous for only a few years nowadays tritium is used in specialized watches e.g. for military purposes (see tritium illumination) for other purposes luminous paint is sometimes used on analog displays but no radioactive material is contained in it this means that the display glows soon after being exposed to light and quickly fades
watches that incorporate batteries often have electric illumination of their displays however lights consume far more power than electronic watch movements to conserve the battery the light is activated only when the user presses a button usually the light remains lit for a few seconds after the button is released which allows the user to move the hand out of the way
in some early digital watches led displays were used which could be read as easily in darkness as in daylight the user had to press a button to light up the leds which meant that the watch could not be read without the button being pressed even in full daylight
in some cheaper types of watches small incandescent lamps or leds illuminate the display which is not intrinsically luminous these tend to produce very non-uniform illumination incandescent lamps are very wasteful of electricity other watches use electroluminescent material to produce uniform illumination of the background of the display against which the hands or digits can be seen
== talking watchesedit ==
talking watches are also available intended for the blind or visually impaired they speak the time out loud at the press of a button this has the disadvantage of disturbing others nearby or at least alerting everyone that the wearer is checking the time tactile watches are preferred to avoid this awkwardness but talking watches are preferred for those who are not confident in their ability to read a tactile watch reliably
== handednessedit ==
wristwatches with analog displays generally have a small knob called the crown that can be used to adjust the time and in mechanical watches wind the spring almost always the crown is located on the right-hand side of the watch this makes it inconvenient to use if the watch is being worn on the right wrist usually therefore watches are worn on the left wrist even if the wearer is left-handed
in exceptional cases the crown is on the left side of the watch this is for example to prevent it from digging into the wrists of golf players
digital watches generally have push-buttons that can be used to make adjustments these are usually equally easy to use on either wrist
== functionsedit ==
all watches provide the time of day giving at least the hour and minute and usually the second most also provide the current date and often the day of the week as well however many watches also provide a great deal of information beyond the basics of time and date some watches include alarms other elaborate and more expensive watches both pocket and wrist models also incorporate striking mechanisms or repeater functions so that the wearer could learn the time by the sound emanating from the watch this announcement or striking feature is an essential characteristic of true clocks and distinguishes such watches from ordinary timepieces this feature is available on most digital watches
a complicated watch has one or more functions beyond the basic function of displaying the time and the date such a functionality is called a complication two popular complications are the chronograph complication which is the ability of the watch movement to function as a stopwatch and the moonphase complication which is a display of the lunar phase other more expensive complications include tourbillon perpetual calendar minute repeater and equation of time a truly complicated watch has many of these complications at once (see calibre 89 from patek philippe for instance) some watches can both indicate the direction of mecca and have alarms that can be set for all daily prayer requirements among watch enthusiasts complicated watches are especially collectible some watches include a second 12-hour or 24-hour display for utc or gmt
the similar-sounding terms chronograph and chronometer are often confused although they mean altogether different things a chronograph is a watch with an added duration timer often a stopwatch complication (as explained above) while a chronometer watch is a timepiece that has met an industry standard test for performance under pre-defined conditions a chronometer is a high quality mechanical or a thermo-compensated movement that has been tested and certified to operate within a certain standard of accuracy by the cosc (contrle officiel suisse des chronomtres) the concepts are different but not mutually exclusive so a watch can be a chronograph a chronometer both or neither
many computerized wristwatches have been developed but none have had long-term sales success because they have awkward user interfaces due to the tiny screens and buttons and a short battery life as miniaturized electronics became cheaper watches have been developed containing calculators tonometers barometers altimeters a compass using both hands to show the n/s direction video games digital cameras keydrives gps receivers and cellular phones a few astronomical watches show phase of the moon and other celestial phenomena in the early 1980s seiko marketed a watch with a television in it such watches have also had the reputation as unsightly and thus mainly geek toys several companies have however attempted to develop a computer contained in a wristwatch (see also wearable computer)
electronic sports watches combining timekeeping with gps and/or activity tracking address the general fitness market and have the potential for commercial success (garmin forerunner garmin vivofit epson announced model of swatch touch series)
braille watches have analog displays with raised bumps around the face to allow blind users to tell the time their digital equivalents use synthesised speech to speak the time on command
== usesedit ==
=== fashionedit ===
wristwatches and antique pocket watches are often appreciated as jewelry or as collectible works of art rather than just as timepieces this has created several different markets for wristwatches ranging from very inexpensive but accurate watches (intended for no other purpose than telling the correct time) to extremely expensive watches that serve mainly as personal adornment or as examples of high achievement in miniaturization and precision mechanical engineering
traditionally men's dress watches appropriate for informal (business) semi-formal and formal attire are gold thin simple and plain but increasingly rugged complicated or sports watches are considered by some to be acceptable for such attire some dress watches have a cabochon on the crown and many women's dress watches have faceted gemstones on the face bezel or bracelet some are made entirely of faceted sapphire (corundum)
many fashion and department stores offer a variety of less-expensive trendy costume watches (usually for women) many of which are similar in quality to basic quartz timepieces but which feature bolder designs in the 1980s the swiss swatch company hired graphic designers to redesign a new annual collection of non-repairable watches
trade in counterfeit watches which mimic expensive brand-name watches constitutes an estimated us$1 billion market per year
=== spaceedit ===
zero gravity environment and other extreme conditions encountered by astronauts in space requires the use of specially tested watches
the first ever watch to be sent and tested successfully in space was a russian watch pobeda from the petrodvorets watch factory it was sent on a single orbit flight on space ship sputnik 4 on march 9 1961 the russian pobeda watch was on the wrist of chernuchka a dog that successfully did exactly the same trip as yuri gagarin with exactly the same rocket and equipment just a month before gagarin's flight
on 12 april 1961 yuri gagarin wore a shturmanskie (a transliteration of which actually means navigators) wristwatch during his historic first flight into space the shturmanskie was manufactured at the first moscow factory since 1964 the watches of the first moscow factory have been marked by the trademark  transliterated as poljot which means flight in russian and is a tribute to the many space trips its watches have accomplished in the late 1970s poljot launched a new chrono movement the 3133 with a 23 jewel movement and manual winding (43 hours) it was a modified russian version of the swiss valjoux 7734 of the early 1970s poljot 3133 were taken into space by astronauts from russia france germany and ukraine on the arm of valeriy polyakov a poljot 3133 chronograph movement-based watch set a space record for the longest space flight in history
through the 1960s a large range of watches were tested for durability and precision under extreme temperature changes and vibrations the omega speedmaster professional was selected by nasa the u.s space agency heuer became the first swiss watch in space thanks to a heuer stopwatch worn by john glenn in 1962 when he piloted the friendship 7 on the first manned u.s orbital mission the breitling navitimer cosmonaute was designed with a 24-hour analog dial to avoid confusion between am and pm which are meaningless in space it was first worn in space by u.s astronaut scott carpenter on 24 may 1962 in the aurora 7 mercury capsule

=== scuba divingedit ===
watches may be crafted to become water resistant these watches are sometimes called diving watches when they are suitable for scuba diving or saturation diving the international organization for standardization issued a standard for water resistant watches which also prohibits the term waterproof to be used with watches which many countries have adopted
water resistance is achieved by the gaskets which forms a watertight seal used in conjunction with a sealant applied on the case to help keep water out the material of the case must also be tested in order to pass as water resistant
none of the tests defined by iso 2281 for the water resistant mark are suitable to qualify a watch for scuba diving such watches are designed for everyday life and must be water resistant during exercises such as swimming they can be worn in different temperature and pressure conditions but are under no circumstances designed for scuba diving
the standards for diving watches are regulated by the iso 6425 international standard the watches are tested in static or still water under 125% of the rated (water)pressure thus a watch with a 200-metre rating will be water resistant if it is stationary and under 250 metres of static water the testing of the water resistance is fundamentally different from non-dive watches because every watch has to be fully tested besides water resistance standards to a minimum of 100 metre depth rating iso 6425 also provides eight minimum requirements for mechanical diver's watches for scuba diving (quartz and digital watches have slightly differing readability requirements) for diver's watches for mixed-gas saturation diving two additional requirements have to be met
watches are classified by their degree of water resistance which roughly translates to the following (1 metre = 3.281 feet)
some watches use bar instead of meters which may then be multiplied by 10 and then subtract 10 to be approximately equal to the rating based on metres therefore a 5 bar watch is equivalent to a 40-metre watch some watches are rated in atmospheres (atm) which are roughly equivalent to bar
=== using a watch and the sun as a compassedit ===
there is a traditional method by which an analog watch can be used to locate north and south the sun appears to move in the sky over a 24-hour period while the hour hand of a 12-hour clock face takes twelve hours to complete one rotation in the northern hemisphere if the watch is rotated so that the hour hand points toward the sun the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate south for this method to work in the southern hemisphere the 12 is pointed toward the sun and the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate north during daylight saving time the same method can be employed using 1 o'clock instead of 12 this method is accurate enough to be useful only at fairly high latitudes see main article
