== service of processedit ==
at common law notice is the fundamental principle in service of process in this case the service of process puts the defendant on notice of the allegations contained within the complaint or other such pleading since notice is fundamental a court may rule a pleading defective if it does not put the defendant on notice
in a civil case personal jurisdiction over a defendant is obtained by service of a summons service can be accomplished by personal delivery of the summons or subpoena to the person or an authorized agent of the person service may also be made by substituted means for example in many jurisdictions service of a summons can be made on a person of suitable age and discretion at the residence or place of business of the defendant jurisdiction over corporations can often be obtained through a government body authorized to receive such process
== due process issues (united states)edit ==
in the united states the right to receive notice before the government deprives an individual of a protected interest is guaranteed along with the opportunity to be heard by the due process clauses in the fifth and fourteenth amendments the sixth amendment also specifically guarantees the right of a criminal defendant to be notified of the charges and their grounds
if a court bases personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state or foreign defendant on a long-arm statute the court must carefully select a means of notifying the defendant to comply with the notice requirement of due process sometimes this is done by serving agents of the defendant located within the state because out-of-state defendants can't always be located easily some state or local laws may allow for service by publication an example of this would be printing a notice of the lawsuit in a newspaper published where the defendant is believed to reside because the failure of a defendant to appear in court results in a default judgment against him such measures must be sufficiently calculated to give actual notice to the defendant to satisfy due process
in mullane v central hanover bank & trust co. the core case setting forth constitutional notice requirements the u.s supreme court held that notice must be reasonably calculated under all the circumstances to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. moreover defendants must be notified by the best practical means available
