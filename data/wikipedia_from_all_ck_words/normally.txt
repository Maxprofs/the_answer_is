as early as 487 the area between the river somme and the river loire came under the control of the frankish lord clovis
the vikings started to raid the seine valley during the middle of the 9th century after attacking and destroying monasteries including one at jumiges they took advantage of the power vacuum created by the disintegration of charlemagne's empire to take northern france the fiefdom of normandy was created for the norwegian viking leader hrolf ragnvaldsson or rollo (also known as robert of normandy) rollo had besieged paris but in 911 entered vassalage to the king of the west franks charles the simple through the treaty of saint-clair-sur-epte in exchange for his homage and fealty rollo legally gained the territory which he and his viking allies had previously conquered the name normandy reflects rollo's viking (i.e northman") origins
the descendants of rollo and his followers adopted the local gallo-romance language and intermarried with the area's original inhabitants they became the normans a norman-speaking mixture of scandinavians hiberno-norse orcadians anglo-danish saxons and indigenous franks and gauls
rollo's descendant william duke of normandy became king of england in 1066 in the norman conquest culminating at the battle of hastings while retaining the fiefdom of normandy for himself and his descendants

=== modern historyedit ===
although agriculture remained important industries such as weaving metallurgy sugar refining ceramics and shipbuilding were introduced and developed
in the 1780s the economic crisis and the crisis of the ancien rgime struck normandy as well as other parts of the nation leading to the french revolution bad harvests technical progress and the effects of the eden agreement signed in 1786 affected employment and the economy of the province normans laboured under a heavy fiscal burden
in 1790 the five departments of normandy replaced the former province
11 july 1793 the norman charlotte corday assassinated marat
the normans reacted little to the many political upheavals which characterised the 19th century overall they warily accepted the changes of rgime (first french empire bourbon restoration july monarchy french second republic second french empire french third republic)
there was an economic revival (mechanization of textile manufacture first trains...) after the french revolutionary wars and the napoleonic wars (17921815)
and new economic activity stimulated the coasts seaside tourism the 19th century marks the birth of the first beach resorts
during the second world war following the armistice of 22 june 1940 continental normandy was part of the german occupied zone of france the channel islands were occupied by german forces between 30 june 1940 and 9 may 1945 the town of dieppe was the site of the unsuccessful dieppe raid by canadian and british armed forces
the allies in this case involving britain the u.s and canada coordinated a massive build-up of troops and supplies to support a large-scale invasion of normandy in the d-day landings on 6 june 1944 under the code name operation overlord the germans were dug into fortified emplacements above the beaches caen cherbourg carentan falaise and other norman towns endured many casualties in the battle of normandy which continued until the closing of the so-called falaise gap between chambois and mont ormel the liberation of le havre followed
this was a significant turning point in the war and led to the restoration of the french republic the remainder of normandy was liberated only on 9 may 1945 at the end of the war when the occupation of the channel islands effectively ended
== geographyedit ==
the historical duchy of normandy was a formerly independent duchy occupying the lower seine area the pays de caux and the region to the west through the pays d'auge as far as the cotentin peninsula
western normandy belongs to the armorican massif whereas the major part of the region belongs to the paris basin france's oldest rocks crop out in jobourg in the cotentin peninsula the region is bordered along the northern coasts by the english channel there are granite cliffs in the west and limestone cliffs in the east there are also long stretches of beach in the centre of the region the bocage typical of the western areas caused problems for the invading forces in the battle of normandy a notable feature of the landscape is created by the meanders of the seine as it approaches its estuary
the highest point is the signal d'couves (417m) in the massif armoricain
normandy is sparsely forested 12.8% of the territory is wooded compared to a french average of 23.6% although the proportion varies between the departments eure has most cover (21%) while manche has least (4%) a characteristic shared with the islands

although the british surrendered claims to mainland normandy france and other french possessions in 1801 the monarch of the united kingdom retains the title duke of normandy in respect to the channel islands the channel islands (except for chausey) remain crown dependencies of the british crown in the present era thus the loyal toast in the channel islands is la reine notre duc ("the queen our duke") the british monarch is understood to not be the duke with regards to mainland normandy described herein by virtue of the treaty of paris of 1259 the surrender of french possessions in 1801 and the belief that the rights of succession to that title are subject to salic law which excludes inheritance through female heirs

=== paintingedit ===
normandy has a rich tradition of painting and gave to france some of its most important artists
in the 17th century some major french painters were normans like nicolas poussin born in les andelys and jean jouvenet
romanticism drew painters to the channel coasts of normandy richard parkes bonington and j m w turner crossed the channel from great britain attracted by the light and landscapes thodore gricault a native of rouen was a notable figure in the romantic movement its famous radeau de la mduse being considered come the breakthrough of pictorial romanticism in france when it was officially presented at the 1819 salon the competing realist tendency was represented by jean-franois millet a native of la hague the landscape painter eugne boudin born in honfleur was a determining influence on the impressionnists and was highly considered by monet
breaking away from the more formalised and classical themes of the early part of the 19th century impressionist painters preferred to paint outdoors in natural light and to concentrate on landscapes towns and scenes of daily life leader of the movement and father of modern painting claude monet is perhaps one of the best known impressionists and a major character in normandy's artistic heritage his house and gardens at giverny are one of the region's major tourist sites much visited for their beauty and their water lilies as well as for their importance to monet's artistic inspiration normandy was at the heart of his creation from the paintings of rouen's cathedral to the famous depictions of the cliffs at etretat the beach and port at fcamp and the sunrise at le havre it was impression sunrise monet's painting of le havre that led to the movement being dubbed impressionism after monet all the main avant-garde painters of the 1870s and 1880s came to normandy to paint its landscapes and its changing lights concentrating along the seine valley and the norman coast
landscapes and scenes of daily life were also immortalised on canvas by artists such as william turner gustave courbet the honfleur born eugne boudin camille pissarro alfred sisley auguste renoir gustave caillebotte paul gauguin georges seurat paul signac pierre bonnard georges braque and pablo picasso while monet's work adorns galleries and collections all over the world a remarkable quantity of impressionist works can be found in galleries throughout normandy such as the museum of fine arts in rouen the muse eugne boudin in honfleur or the andr malraux museum in le havre

=== architectureedit ===
architecturally norman cathedrals abbeys (such as the abbey of bec) and castles characterise the former duchy in a way that mirrors the similar pattern of norman architecture in england following the norman conquest of 1066
domestic architecture in upper normandy is typified by half-timbered buildings that also recall vernacular english architecture although the farm enclosures of the more harshly landscaped pays de caux are a more idiosyncratic response to socio-economic and climatic imperatives much urban architectural heritage was destroyed during the battle of normandy in 1944 post-war urban reconstruction such as in le havre and saint-l could be said to demonstrate both the virtues and vices of modernist and brutalist trends of the 1950s and 1960s le havre the city rebuilt by auguste perret was added to unescos world heritage list in 2005
vernacular architecture in lower normandy takes its form from granite the predominant local building material the channel islands also share this influence chausey was for many years a source of quarried granite including that used for the construction of mont saint-michel
the south part of bagnoles-de-l'orne is filled with bourgeois villas in belle poque style with polychrome faades bow windows and unique roofing this area built between 1886 and 1914 has an authentic bagnolese style and is typical of high-society country vacation of the time the chapel of saint germanus (chapelle saint-germain) at querqueville with its trefoil floorplan incorporates elements of one of the earliest surviving places of christian worship in the cotentin perhaps second only to the gallo-roman baptistry at port-bail it is dedicated to germanus of normandy
=== religionedit ===
since the 1905 french law on the separation of the churches and the state there is no established church in mainland normandy in the channel islands the church of england is the established church
christian missionaries implanted monastic communities in the territory in the 5th and 6th centuries some of these missionaries came from across the channel the influence of celtic christianity can still be found in the cotentin by the terms of the treaty of saint-clair-sur-epte rollo a viking pagan accepted christianity and was baptised the duchy of normandy was therefore formally a christian state from its foundation the cathedrals of normandy have exerted influence down the centuries in matters of both faith and politics king henry ii of england did penance at the cathedral of avranches on 21 may 1172 and was absolved from the censures incurred by the assassination of thomas becket mont saint-michel is a historic pilgrimage site
normandy does not have one generally agreed patron saint although this title has been ascribed to saint michael and to saint ouen many saints have been revered in normandy down the centuries including
aubert who's remembered as the founder of mont saint-michel
marcouf and laud who are important saints in normandy
helier and samson of dol who are evangelizers of the channel islands
thomas becket an anglo-norman whose parents were from rouen who was the object of a considerable cult in mainland normandy following his martyrdom
