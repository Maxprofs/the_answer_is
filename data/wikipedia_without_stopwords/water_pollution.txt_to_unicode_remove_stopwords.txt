water pollution contamination water bodies eg lakes rivers oceans aquifers groundwater form environmental degradation occurs pollutants directly indirectly discharged water bodies without adequate treatment remove harmful compounds
water pollution affects entire biosphere plants organisms living bodies water almost cases effect damaging individual species population also natural biological communities
introduction
water pollution major global problem requires ongoing evaluation revision water resource policy levels international individual aquifers wells suggested water pollution leading worldwide cause deaths diseases accounts deaths people daily estimated people india die water pollution related illness every day percent water cities china polluted half billion chinese access safe drinking water addition acute problems water pollution developing countries developed countries also continue struggle pollution problems example recent national report water quality united states percent assessed stream miles assessed lake acres percent assessed bays estuarine square miles classified polluted head chinas national development agency said one quarter length chinas seven main rivers poisoned water harmed skin

categories
although interrelated surface water groundwater often studied managed separate resources surface water seeps soil becomes groundwater conversely groundwater also feed surface water sources sources surface water pollution generally grouped two categories based origin
point sources
point source water pollution refers contaminants enter waterway single identifiable source pipe ditch examples sources category include discharges sewage treatment plant factory city storm drain us clean water act cwa defines point source regulatory enforcement purposes cwa definition point source amended include municipal storm sewer systems well industrial storm water construction sites
nonpoint sources
nonpoint source pollution refers diffuse contamination originate single discrete source nps pollution often cumulative effect small amounts contaminants gathered large area common example leaching nitrogen compounds fertilized agricultural lands nutrient runoff storm water sheet flow agricultural field forest also cited examples nps pollution
contaminated storm water washed parking lots roads highways called urban runoff sometimes included category nps pollution however runoff typically channeled storm drain systems discharged pipes local surface waters becomes point source
groundwater pollution

causes
specific contaminants leading pollution water include wide spectrum chemicals pathogens physical changes elevated temperature discoloration many chemicals substances regulated may naturally occurring calcium sodium iron manganese etc concentration often key determining natural component water contaminant high concentrations naturally occurring substances negative impacts aquatic flora fauna
oxygendepleting substances may natural materials plant matter eg leaves grass well manmade chemicals natural anthropogenic substances may cause turbidity cloudiness blocks light disrupts plant growth clogs gills fish species
many chemical substances toxic pathogens produce waterborne diseases either human animal hosts alteration waters physical chemistry includes acidity change ph electrical conductivity temperature eutrophication eutrophication increase concentration chemical nutrients ecosystem extent increases primary productivity ecosystem depending degree eutrophication subsequent negative environmental effects anoxia oxygen depletion severe reductions water quality may occur affecting fish animal populations
pathogens
diseasecausing microorganisms referred pathogens although vast majority bacteria either harmless beneficial pathogenic bacteria cause disease coliform bacteria actual cause disease commonly used bacterial indicator water pollution microorganisms sometimes found surface waters caused human health problems include
burkholderia pseudomallei
cryptosporidium parvum
giardia lamblia
salmonella
norovirus viruses
parasitic worms including schistosoma type
high levels pathogens may result onsite sanitation systems septic tanks pit latrines inadequately treated sewage discharges caused sewage plant designed less secondary treatment typical lessdeveloped countries developed countries older cities aging infrastructure may leaky sewage collection systems pipes pumps valves cause sanitary sewer overflows cities also combined sewers may discharge untreated sewage rain storms
