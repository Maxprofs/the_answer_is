grandparents are the parents of a person's father or mother paternal or maternal every sexually-reproducing creature who is not a genetic chimera has a maximum of four genetic grandparents eight genetic great-grandparents sixteen genetic great-great-grandparents etc. although the numbers will be lower in cases of pedigree collapse in the history of modern humanity around 30,000 years ago the number of modern humans who lived to be grandparents increased exponentially it is not known for certain what spurred this increase in longevity but it is generally believed that a key consequence of three generations being alive together was the preservation of information which could otherwise have been lost an example of this important information might have been where to find water in times of drought
in cases where parents are unwilling or unable to provide adequate care for their children (e.g. death of the parents) grandparents often take on the role of primary caregivers even when this is not the case and particularly in traditional cultures grandparents often have a direct and clear role in relation to the raising care and nurture of children grandparents are second-degree relatives and share 25% genetic overlap
a step-grandparent can be the parent's step-parent or the step-parent's parent or the step-parent's step-parent (though technically this might be called a step-step-grandparent) the various words for grandparents at times may also be used to refer to any elderly person especially the terms gramps granny grandfather grandmother and even more types that most families make up themselves like coolma for younger step-grandparents

the parents of a grandparent or the grandparents of a parent are called all the same names (grandfather/-mother grandpa/-ma granddad/-ma etc.) with the prefix great- added one for each additional generation one's great-grandparent's parents would be great-great-grandparents
to avoid a proliferation of greats when discussing genealogical trees one may also use ordinals instead of multiple greats thus a great-great-grandfather would be the second great-grandfather and a great-great-great-grandfather would be a third great-grandfather and so on this system is used by some genealogical websites such as geni one may also use cardinal numbers for numbering greats for example great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother becomes six-ex-great-grandma
individuals who share the same great-grandparents but are not siblings or first cousins are called second cousins to each other as second cousins are the grandchildren of one's grandparent's siblings
