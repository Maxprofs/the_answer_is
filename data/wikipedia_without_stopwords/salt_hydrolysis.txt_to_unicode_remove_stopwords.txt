dissolution gases liquids solids liquid solvent process original states become solutes dissolved components forming solution gas liquid solid original solvent solid solutions result dissolution one solid another occur eg metal alloys formation governed described relevant phase diagram case crystalline solid dissolving liquid crystalline structure must disintegrated separate atoms ions molecules released liquids gases molecules must able form noncovalent intermolecular interactions solvent solution form
free energy overall isolated process dissolution must negative occur component free energies contributing include describing disintegration associations holding original solute components together original associations bulk solvent old new associations undissolved dissolved materials
dissolution fundamental importance chemical processes natural unnatural decomposition dying organism return chemical constituents biosphere laboratory testing new manmade soluble drugs catalysts etc dissolution testing widely used industry including pharmaceutical industry prepare formulate chemical agents consistent quality dissolve optimally target millieus designed
dissolution class compound
gases
gaseous elements compounds dissolve liquids dependent interaction bonds liquid solvent
liquids
gaseous elements compounds may also dissolve another liquid depending compatibility chemical physical bonds substance solvent hydrogen bonds play important role aqueous dissolution
ionic compounds
ionic compounds dissolution takes place ionic lattice breaks separate ions solvated commonly occurs polar solvents water ammonia
nacls naaq claq
colloidal dispersed system small dispersed particles ionic lattice exist equilibrium saturated solution ions ie

solubility ionic salts water generally determined degree solvation ions water molecules coordination complexes occur water donating spare electrons oxygen atom ion behavior system characterised activity coefficients components solubility product defined
ability ion preferentially dissolve result unequal activities classified potential determining ion turn results remaining particle possessing either net positivenegative surface charge
polar compounds
polar solid compounds amorphous crystalline crystalline solids dissolve breakdown crystal lattice due polarity nonpolarity mix solvent
polymers
solubility polymers depends chemical bonds present backbone chain compatibility solvent hildebrand solubility parameter commonly used evaluate polymer solubility closer value parameters likely dissolution occur
rate dissolution
rate dissolution quantifies speed dissolution process depends chemical natures solvent solute temperature possibly small degree pressure degree undersaturation presence means mixing dissolution interfacial surface area presence inhibitors eg substances adsorbed surface
