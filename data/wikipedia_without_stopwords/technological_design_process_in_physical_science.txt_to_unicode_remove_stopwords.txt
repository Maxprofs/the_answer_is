theory technological evolution
mankind transition view distant past present far future masefield books technology richta defines material entity created application mental physical effort nature order achieve value evolves three stages tools machine automation evolution says follows two trends
development
pretechnological period animal species remain today aside avian primate species nonrational period early prehistoric man
emergence technology made possible development rational faculty paved way first stage tool tool provides mechanical advantage accomplishing physical task arrow plow hammer augments physical labor efficiently achieve objective later animalpowered tools plow horse increased productivity food production tenfold technology huntergatherers tools allow one things impossible accomplish ones body alone seeing minute visual detail microscope manipulating heavy objects pulley cart carrying volumes water bucket
second technological stage creation machine machine powered machine precise tool substitutes element human physical effort requires control function machines became widespread industrial revolution though windmills type machine much older
examples include cars trains computers lights machines allow humans tremendously exceed limitations bodies putting machine farm tractor increased food productivity least tenfold technology plow horse
third final stage technological evolution automation automation machine removes element human control automatic algorithm examples machines exhibit characteristic digital watches automatic telephone switches pacemakers computer programs
important understand three stages outline introduction fundamental types technology three continue widely used today spear plow pen optical microscope examples tools
theoretical implications
process technological evolution culminates ability achieve material values technologically possible desirable mental effort
economic implication idea intellectual labour become increasingly important relative physical labour contracts agreements around information become increasingly common marketplace expansion creation new kinds institutes works information example universities book stores patenttrading companies etc considered indication civilization technological evolution
highlights importance underlining debate intellectual property conjunction decentralized distribution systems todays internet price information distribution going towards zero ever efficient tools distribute information invented growing amounts information distributed increasingly larger customer base times goes growing disintermediation said markets growing concerns protection intellectual property rights clear form markets information take evolution information age
