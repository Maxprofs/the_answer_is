historically misterlike sir or my lordwas applied only to those above one's own status in the peerage this understanding is now obsolete as it was gradually expanded as a mark of respect to those of equal status and then to all gentlemen it is now used indiscriminately
in past centuries mr was used with a first name to distinguish among family members who might otherwise be confused in conversation mr doe would be the eldest present younger brothers or cousins were then referred to as mr richard doe and mr william doe and so on such usage survived longer in family-owned business or when domestic servants were referring to adult male family members with the same surname mr robert and mr richard will be out this evening but mr edward is dining in, but such usage today is rare in american culture but still quite common in others as a sign of respect when first names are being used the last name is not known or where english is not the mother tongue
