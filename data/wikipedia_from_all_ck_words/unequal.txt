== history ==
=== founding and first years (19851993) ===
rare evolved from ashby computers & graphics ltd. better known by the trade name ultimate play the game and founded by former arcade game developers tim and chris stamper the stampers later claimed that dissatisfied with their games for 8-bit personal home computers such as the zx spectrum as early as 1983 they became interested in the development of nintendo entertainment system (nes) games the nes was more sophisticated than the spectrum had a worldwide market and its cartridges had no load times and were difficult to pirate the stampers sold off part of the ultimate play the game label to u.s gold and formed in 1985 a sub-division inside ashby computers and graphics ltd named rare ltd having convinced nintendo to allow them to develop games for their video game console rare released their first title slalom a skiing game that was originally released for the nintendo vs system in 1986 and later for the nes in 1987
throughout the following four years the company went on to produce over 40 nes games as well as several additional game boy conversions including wizards & warriors r.c pro-am captain skyhawk snake rattle n roll and battletoads according to ste pickford who was part of the team at rare throughout the late 80s and into the early 90s they just wanted to make as many games as they could in their window of opportunity when the super nintendo entertainment system was conceived rare limited their releases to some battletoads games and decided to invest their significant nes profit in purchasing expensive silicon graphics workstations this move made rare the most technologically advanced developer in the uk and situated them fairly high internationally
=== partnership with nintendo (19942001) ===
their progress with the 3d graphics on the sgi systems impressed nintendo's genyo takeda and in 1994 nintendo bought a 49% stake in the company turning rare into a nintendo second-party developer in this period rare started selling their games under the trademark name rareware and the slogan rare designs on the future the company was considered one of nintendo's key developers and had enough recognition that nintendo offered them their catalogue of characters to create a 3d cgi game the stampers asked for donkey kong the resulting game donkey kong country was a critical success and sold over eight million copies worldwide making it the second best-selling game in the snes library the game received several game of the year honours and was followed by two sequels and several hand-held spin-offs prior to the release of the nintendo 64 rare also developed a cgi arcade fighting game killer instinct on their own custom-built hardware
rare gained more international recognition with the release of goldeneye 007 a nintendo 64 first-person shooter based on the film of the same name that is often credited for having revolutionised the genre the title received very high critical praise and sold more than eight million units worldwide it also received numerous awards and rare won the bafta award for best uk developer rare's other subsequent acclaimed nintendo 64 games include banjo-kazooie released in 1998 followed by donkey kong 64 and jet force gemini in 1999 around the same time numerous employees left the company and formed new studios the most notable of these studios was free radical design which was composed of several members of the goldeneye 007 team free radical design developed the successful timesplitters series of first-person shooters though the company was acquired by crytek in 2009 and renamed crytek uk

rare has a different philosophy we don't really have much contact with other game development companies and we just do things the way they've evolved we try to employ people who are great games players and games enthusiasts and they're really interested in seeing the other games we're developing in the company so it's really a group of games enthusiasts all working together to produce the best games they can that's rare
