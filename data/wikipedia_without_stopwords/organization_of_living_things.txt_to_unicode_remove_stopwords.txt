sociology
german theorist niklas luhmann develops systems theory approach society demonstrates ways systems work relation environment drawing humberto maturana francis varelas idea autopoiesis hegelian dialectics luhmann argues systems selfreferential autopoietic systems produce reproduce organization without getting input cartesian subject systems maintain distinction environment unity difference displaces modern subject point reference instead places communication index schematically system represents conceptual realm meaningful world place identity past actuality whereas environment signifies noise meaninglessness difference future possibilities luhmanns social systems closed systems except system needs information environment thus system select meaninglessness noise environment encode meaningful complex system although luhmann maintains unity difference system environment closing system allow innovation rupture order fact encoding information system reduces complexity environment
