a leg is a weight bearing and locomotive structure usually having a columnar shape during locomotion legs function as extensible struts the combination of movements at all joints can be modeled as a single linear element capable of changing length and rotating about an omnidirectional hip joint
as an anatomical animal structure it is used for locomotion the distal end is often modified to distribute force (such as a foot) most animals have an even number of legs
as a component of furniture it is used for the economy of materials needed to provide the support for the useful surface the table top or chair seat
== terminology ==
uniped 1 leg such as clams
biped 2 legs such as humans and birds
triped 3 legs which does not occur naturally in healthy animals
quadruped 4 legs such as dogs and horses
many taxa are characterized by the number of legs
tetrapods have four legs
arthropoda 4 6 (insecta) 8 12 or 14 legs some arthropods have more than a dozen legs a few species possess over 100 despite what their names might suggest centipedes ("hundred feet") may have fewer than 20 or more than 300 legs and millipedes ("thousand feet") have fewer than 1,000 legs but up to 750
== components ==
a leg is a structure of gross anatomy meaning that it is large enough to be seen unaided the components depend on the animal in humans and other mammals a leg includes the bones muscles tendons ligaments blood vessels nerves and skin in insects the leg includes most of these things except that insects have an exoskeleton that replaces the function of both the bones and the skin
sometimes the end of the leg or foot is considered part of the leg other times it is considered separate similarly the hip joint or other place where the leg attaches to the main body may be considered separate or part of the leg
== tetrapod legs ==
in tetrapod anatomy leg is used to refer to the entire limb in human medicine the precise definition refers only to the segment between the knee and the ankle this lower segment is also called the shank and the front (anterior) of the segment is called the shin or pretibia
in bipedal tetrapods the two lower limbs are referred to as the legs and the two upper limbs as arms or wings as the case may be
human leg
== arthropod leg ==
arthropod leg
== robotic leg ==
a robotic leg is moved by an actuator which is a type of motor for moving or controlling a mechanism or system it is operated by a source of energy usually in the form of an electric current hydraulic fluid pressure or pneumatic pressure and converts that energy into some kind of motion
