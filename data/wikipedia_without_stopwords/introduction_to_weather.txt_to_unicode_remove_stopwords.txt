effects climate
cirrus clouds cover earth net heating effect thin translucent clouds efficiently absorb outgoing infrared radiation marginally reflecting incoming sunlight cirrus clouds m ft thick reflect around incoming sunlight prevent almost outgoing infrared radiation escaping thus raising temperature atmosphere beneath clouds average c fa process known greenhouse effect averaged worldwide cloud formation results temperature loss c f earths surface mainly result stratocumulus clouds
result warming effects relatively thin cirrus clouds implicated potential partial cause global warming scientists speculated global warming could cause high thin cloud cover increase thereby increasing temperatures humidity turn would increase cirrus cloud cover effectively creating positive feedback circuit prediction hypothesis cirrus would move higher temperatures rose increasing volume air underneath clouds amount infrared radiation reflected back earth addition hypothesis suggests increase temperature would tend increase size ice crystals cirrus cloud possibly causing reflection solar radiation reflection earths infrared radiation balance
similar hypothesis put forth richard lindzen iris hypothesis increase tropical sea surface temperatures results less cirrus clouds thus infrared radiation emitted space
