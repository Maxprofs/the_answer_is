tourism is travel for pleasure also the theory and practice of touring the business of attracting accommodating and entertaining tourists and the business of operating tours tourism may be international or within the traveler's country the world tourism organization defines tourism more generally in terms which go beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only  as people traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure business and other purposes
tourism can be domestic or international and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments today tourism is a major source of income for many countries and affects the economy of both the source and host countries in some cases being of vital importance
tourism suffered as a result of a strong economic slowdown of the late-2000s recession between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009 and the outbreak of the h1n1 influenza virus but slowly recovered international tourism receipts (the travel item in the balance of payments) grew to us$1.03 trillion (740 billion) in 2011 corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% from 2010 international tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012 the same year in which china became the largest spender in international tourism globally with us$102 billion surpassing germany and united states china and emerging markets such as russia and brazil had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade
== etymology ==
the word tourist was used by 1772 and tourism by 1811
william f theobald (1994) suggested that etymologically the word tour is derived from the latin tornare and the greek tornos meaning a lathe or circle movement around a central point or axis this meaning has changed in modern english to represent one's turn the suffix ism is defined as an action or process typical behaviour or quality while the suffix ist denotes one who performs a given action when the word tour and the suffixes ism and ist are combined they suggest the action of moving in a circle describing a circle implies returning to one's starting point so a tour is a round-trip journey i.e the act of leaving and ultimately returning to the original starting point therefore one who takes such a journey can be called a tourist.
today three schools discuss the roots of tourism the french school led by a houlot argues that the term tourism comes from the old aramaic tur which was used for the exploration and movement of people in the bible this word was used for the first time when moses began his expedition to the lands of canan another school of thought the onomastic school considers the origin of the concept not from a linguistic perspective but rather links it to the last name of the french aristocrat della tour according to this school after carlos v signed a treaty with england in 1516 in celebration of this event the future king gave the della tour family exclusive rights to conduct commercial transport and related businesses a third school focuses on the anglo-saxon world and scrutinises theobalds thesis surmising that the roots of the word tourism lie in the ancient anglo-saxon term torn these scholars have found evidence that the term was coined in the 12th century by farmers to denote travel with an intention to return over the centuries the meaning of the word has shifted by the middle of the 18th century english noblemen used the term turn to refer to trips undertaken for education and cultural exploration in reality the purpose of the noblemens trips to the different parts of the kingdom was to acquire knowledge that was later useful for governing
== significance of tourism ==

== history ==
=== antiquity ===
travel outside a person's local area for leisure was largely confined to wealthy classes who at times travelled to distant parts of the world to see great buildings works of art learn new languages experience new cultures and to taste different cuisines as early as shulgi however kings praised themselves for protecting roads and building waystations for travelers during the roman republic medicinal spas and coastal resorts such as baiae were popular among the rich pausanias (geographer) wrote his description of greece in the 2nd century ad in ancient china nobles sometimes made a point of visiting mount tai and on occasion all five sacred mountains
=== middle ages ===
by the middle ages christianity buddhism and islam all had traditions of pilgrimage that motivated even the lower classes to undertake distant journeys for health or spiritual improvement seeing the sights along the way the islamic hajj is still central to its faith and chaucer's canterbury tales and wu cheng'en's journey to the west remain classics of english and chinese literature
the 10th- to 13th-century song dynasty also saw secular travel writers such as su shi (11th century) and fan chengda (12th century) become popular in china under the ming xu xiake continued the practice in medieval italy francesco petrarch also wrote an allegorical account of his 1336 ascent of mount ventoux that praised the act of traveling and criticized frigida incuriositas ("cold lack curiosity") the burgundian poet michault taillevent later composed his own horrified recollections of a 1430 trip through the jura mountains
=== grand tour ===
modern tourism can be traced to what was known as the grand tour which was a traditional trip around europe (especially germany and italy) undertaken by mainly upper-class european young men of means mainly from western and northern european countries the custom flourished from about 1660 until the advent of large-scale rail transit in the 1840s and was associated with a standard itinerary it served as an educational opportunity and rite of passage though primarily associated with the british nobility and wealthy landed gentry similar trips were made by wealthy young men of protestant northern european nations on the continent and from the second half of the 18th century some south american us and other overseas youth joined in the tradition was extended to include more of the middle class after rail and steamship travel made the journey less of a burden and thomas cook made the cook's tour a byword
the grand tour became a real status symbol for upper class students in the 18th and 19th centuries in this period johann joachim winckelmann's theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the european academic world artists writers and travellers (such as goethe) affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which italy france and greece provide excellent examples for these reasons the grand tour's main destinations were to those centres where upper-class students could find rare examples of classic art and history
the new york times recently described the grand tour in this way
three hundred years ago wealthy young englishmen began taking a post-oxbridge trek through france and italy in search of art culture and the roots of western civilization with nearly unlimited funds aristocratic connections and months (or years) to roam they commissioned paintings perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the continent
the primary value of the grand tour it was believed laid in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the renaissance and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the european continent

the british origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names in nice france one of the first and best-established holiday resorts on the french riviera the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the promenade des anglais in many other historic resorts in continental europe old well-established palace hotels have names like the hotel bristol hotel carlton or hotel majestic reflecting the dominance of english customers
a pioneer of the travel agency business thomas cook's idea to offer excursions came to him while waiting for the stagecoach on the london road at kibworth with the opening of the extended midland counties railway he arranged to take a group of 540 temperance campaigners from leicester campbell street station to a rally in loughborough eleven miles away on 5 july 1841 thomas cook arranged for the rail company to charge one shilling per person that included rail tickets and food for this train journey cook was paid a share of the fares actually charged to the passengers as the railway tickets being legal contracts between company and passenger could not have been issued at his own price this was the first privately chartered excursion train to be advertised to the general public cook himself acknowledging that there had been previous unadvertised private excursion trains during the following three summers he planned and conducted outings for temperance societies and sunday-school children in 1844 the midland counties railway company agreed to make a permanent arrangement with him provided he found the passengers this success led him to start his own business running rail excursions for pleasure taking a percentage of the railway tickets
four years later he planned his first excursion abroad when he took a group from leicester to calais to coincide with the paris exhibition the following year he started his grand circular tours of europe during the 1860s he took parties to switzerland italy egypt and the united states cook established inclusive independent travel whereby the traveller went independently but his agency charged for travel food and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route such was his success that the scottish railway companies withdrew their support between 1862 and 1863 to try the excursion business for themselves
=== cruise shipping ===
leisure cruise ships were introduced by the peninsular & oriental steam navigation company (p&o) in 1844 sailing from southampton to destinations such as gibraltar malta and athens in 1891 german businessman albert ballin sailed the ship augusta victoria from hamburg into the mediterranean sea in 1900 one of the first purpose-built cruise ship was prinzessin victoria luise built in hamburg cruising is a popular form of water tourism

=== winter tourism ===
st moritz switzerland became the cradle of the developing winter tourism in the 1860s hotel manager johannes badrutt invited some summer guests from england to return in the winter to see the snowy landscape thereby inaugurating a popular trend it was however only in the 1970s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the swiss ski resorts even in winter up to one third of all guests (depending on the location) consist of non-skiers
major ski resorts are located mostly in the various european countries (e.g andorra austria bulgaria bosnia-herzegovina croatia czech republic cyprus finland france germany iceland italy norway latvia lithuania poland serbia sweden slovakia slovenia spain switzerland turkey) canada the united states (e.g colorado california utah montana wyoming new york new jersey michigan vermont new hampshire) lebanon new zealand japan south korea chile and argentina
=== mass tourism ===

== recent developments ==
there has been an up-trend in tourism over the last few decades especially in europe where international travel for short breaks is common tourists have a wide range of budgets and tastes and a wide variety of resorts and hotels have developed to cater for them for example some people prefer simple beach vacations while others want more specialised holidays quieter resorts family-oriented holidays or niche market-targeted destination hotels
the developments in technology and transport infrastructure such as jumbo jets low-cost airlines and more accessible airports have made many types of tourism more affordable the who estimated in 2009 that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time there have also been changes in lifestyle for example some retirement-age people sustain year round tourism this is facilitated by internet sales of tourist services some sites have now started to offer dynamic packaging in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailor-made package requested by the customer upon impulse
there have been a few setbacks in tourism such as the september 11 attacks and terrorist threats to tourist destinations such as in bali and several european cities also on 26 december 2004 a tsunami caused by the 2004 indian ocean earthquake hit the asian countries on the indian ocean including the maldives thousands of lives were lost including many tourists this together with the vast clean-up operations stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time
individual low-price or even zero-price overnight stays have become more popular in the 2000s especially with a strong growth in the hostel market and services like couchsurfing and airbnb being established
=== sustainable tourism ===
sustainable tourism is envisaged as leading to management of all resources in such a way that economic social and aesthetic needs can be fulfilled while maintaining cultural integrity essential ecological processes biological diversity and life support systems. (world tourism organization)
sustainable development implies meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. (world commission on environment and development 1987)
sustainable tourism can be seen as having regard to ecological and socio-cultural carrying capacities and includes involving the community of the destination in tourism development planning it also involves integrating tourism to match current economic and growth policies so as to mitigate some of the negative economic and social impacts of mass tourism murphy (1985) advocates the use of an ecological approach to consider both plants and people when implementing the sustainable tourism development process this is in contrast to the boosterism and economic approaches to tourism planning neither of which consider the detrimental ecological or sociological impacts of tourism development to a destination
however butler questions the exposition of the term sustainable in the context of tourism citing its ambiguity and stating that the emerging sustainable development philosophy of the 1990s can be viewed as an extension of the broader realization that a preoccupation with economic growth without regard to its social and environmental consequences is self-defeating in the long term. thus sustainable tourism development is seldom considered as an autonomous function of economic regeneration as separate from general economic growth
=== ecotourism ===
ecotourism also known as ecological tourism is responsible travel to fragile pristine and usually protected areas that strives to be low-impact and (often) small-scale it helps educate the traveler provides funds for conservation directly benefits the economic development and political empowerment of local communities and fosters respect for different cultures and for human rights.take only memories and leave only footprints is a very common slogan in protected areas tourist destinations are shifting to low carbon emissions following the trend of visitors more focused in being environmentally responsible adopting a sustainable behavior
=== pro-poor tourism ===
pro-poor tourism which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development the issue has been addressed through small-scale projects in local communities and through attempts by ministries of tourism to attract large numbers of tourists research by the overseas development institute suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists money to reach the poorest as only 25% or less (far less in some cases) ever reaches the poor successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountain-climbing in tanzania and cultural tourism in luang prabang laos
=== recession tourism ===
recession tourism is a travel trend which evolved by way of the world economic crisis recession tourism is defined by low-cost high-value experiences taking place of once-popular generic retreats various recession tourism hotspots have seen business boom during the recession thanks to comparatively low costs of living and a slow world job market suggesting travelers are elongating trips where their money travels further this concept is not widely used in tourism research it is related to the short-lived phenomenon that is more widely known as staycation
=== medical tourism ===
when there is a significant price difference between countries for a given medical procedure particularly in southeast asia india eastern europe and where there are different regulatory regimes in relation to particular medical procedures (e.g dentistry) traveling to take advantage of the price or regulatory differences is often referred to as medical tourism

=== creative tourism ===
creative tourism has existed as a form of cultural tourism since the early beginnings of tourism itself its european roots date back to the time of the grand tour which saw the sons of aristocratic families traveling for the purpose of mostly interactive educational experiences more recently creative tourism has been given its own name by crispin raymond and greg richards who as members of the association for tourism and leisure education (atlas) have directed a number of projects for the european commission including cultural and crafts tourism known as sustainable tourism they have defined creative tourism as tourism related to the active participation of travellers in the culture of the host community through interactive workshops and informal learning experiences
meanwhile the concept of creative tourism has been picked up by high-profile organizations such as unesco who through the creative cities network have endorsed creative tourism as an engaged authentic experience that promotes an active understanding of the specific cultural features of a place
more recently creative tourism has gained popularity as a form of cultural tourism drawing on active participation by travelers in the culture of the host communities they visit several countries offer examples of this type of tourism development including the united kingdom austria france the bahamas jamaica spain italy and new zealand
the growing interest of tourists in this new way to discover a culture regards particularly the operators and branding managers attentive to the possibility of attracting a quality tourism highlighting the intangible heritage (craft workshops cooking classes etc.) and optimizing the use of existing infrastructure (for example through the rent of halls and auditorium)
=== experiential tourism ===
experiential travel (or immersion travel") is one of the major market trends in the modern tourism industry it is an approach to travelling which focuses on experiencing a country city or particular place by connecting to its history people food and culture
the term experiential travel is already mentioned in publications from 1985 - however it was discovered as a meaningful market trend much later
=== dark tourism ===
one emerging area of special interest has been identified by lennon and foley (2000) as dark tourism this type of tourism involves visits to dark sites such as battlegrounds scenes of horrific crimes or acts of genocide for example concentration camps dark tourism remains a small niche market driven by varied motivations such as mourning remembrance education macabre curiosity or even entertainment its early origins are rooted in fairgrounds and medieval fairs
philip stone argues that dark tourism is a way of imagining the own death through the real death of others erik h cohen introduces the term populo sites to evidence the educational caracther of dark tourism populo sites transmits the story of vicitimized population to visitors based on a study at yad vashem the shoah (holocaust) memorial museum in jerusalem a new termin populois proposed to describe dark tourism sites at a population and spiritual center of the people to whom a tragedy befell learning about the shoah in jerusalem offers a different but equally authentic encounter with the subject as visits to sites in europe it is argued that a dichotomy between authentic sites at the location of a tragedy and created sites elsewhere is insufficient participants evaluations of seminars for european teachers at yad vashem indicate that the location is an important aspect of a meaningful encounter with the subject implications for other cases of dark tourism at in populo locations are discussed in this vein peter tarlow defines dark tourism as the tendency to visit places where tragedies or historically noteworthy death happened which continues to impressing our lives this issue cannot be understood without the figure of trauma following this maximiliano korstanje explains that tourism serves as an scape-goat mechanism used in order for society does not collapse this is the reason why tourists look for something special something new beyond their nearest residential home the quest for otherness leads not only to maximize pleasure but also provides a pedagogical message to the us in context of disasters and tragedies dark tourism may revitalize the lost trust giving a positive value that helps community in the process of recovery tourism is in fact an instrument of resiliency that paves the ways for the society to be united
=== social tourism ===
social tourism is the extension of the benefits of tourism to disadvantaged people who otherwise could not afford to travel for their education of recreation it includes youth hostels and low-priced holiday accommodation run by church and voluntary organisations trade unions or in communist times publicly owned enterprises in may 1959 at the second congress of social tourism in austria walter hunziker proposed the following definition social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by low income groups and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services
=== doom tourism ===
also known as tourism of doom, or last chance tourism this emerging trend involves traveling to places that are environmentally or otherwise threatened (such as the ice caps of mount kilimanjaro the melting glaciers of patagonia or the coral of the great barrier reef) before it is too late identified by travel trade magazine travel age west editor-in-chief kenneth shapiro in 2007 and later explored in the new york times this type of tourism is believed to be on the rise some see the trend as related to sustainable tourism or ecotourism due to the fact that a number of these tourist destinations are considered threatened by environmental factors such as global warming overpopulation or climate change others worry that travel to many of these threatened locations increases an individuals carbon footprint and only hastens problems threatened locations are already facing
== growth ==
the world tourism organization (unwto) forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 4% with the advent of e-commerce tourism products have become one of the most traded items on the internet tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries although tourism providers (hotels airlines etc.) including small-scale operators can sell their services directly this has put pressure on intermediaries from both on-line and traditional shops
it has been suggested there is a strong correlation between tourism expenditure per capita and the degree to which countries play in the global context not only as a result of the important economic contribution of the tourism industry but also as an indicator of the degree of confidence with which global citizens leverage the resources of the globe for the benefit of their local economies this is why any projections of growth in tourism may serve as an indication of the relative influence that each country will exercise in the future
=== space tourism ===
there has been a limited amount of orbital space tourism with only the russian space agency providing transport to date a 2010 report into space tourism anticipated that it could become a billion dollar market by 2030
=== sports tourism ===
since the late 1980s sports tourism has become increasingly popular events such as rugby olympics commonwealth games asian games and football world cups have enabled specialist travel companies to gain official ticket allocation and then sell them in packages that include flights hotels and excursions
the focus on sport and spreading knowledge on the subject especially more so recently lead to the increase in the sport tourism most notably the international event such as the olympics caused a shift in focus in the audience who now realize the variety of sports that exist in the world in the united states one of the most popular sports that usually are focused on was football this popularity was increased through major events like the world cups in asian countries the numerous football events also increased the popularity of football but it was the olympics that brought together the different sports that lead to the increase in sport tourism the drastic interest increase in sports in general and not just one sport caught the attention of travel companies who then began to sell flights in packages due to the low number of people who actually purchase these packages than predicted the cost of these packages plummeted initially as the number start to rise slightly the packages increased to regain the lost profits with the certain economic state the number of purchases decreased once again the fluctuation in the number of packages sold was solely dependent on the economic situation therefore most travel companies were forced to set aside the plan to execute the marketing of any new package features
=== latest trends ===
as a result of the late-2000s recession international arrivals suffered a strong slowdown beginning in june 2008 growth from 2007 to 2008 was only 3.7% during the first eight months of 2008 this slowdown on international tourism demand was also reflected in the air transport industry with a negative growth in september 2008 and a 3.3% growth in passenger traffic through september the hotel industry also reported a slowdown with room occupancy declining in 2009 worldwide tourism arrivals decreased by 3.8% by the first quarter of 2009 real travel demand in the united states had fallen 6% over six quarters while this is considerably milder than what occurred after the 9/11 attacks the decline was at twice the rate as real gdp has fallen
however evidence suggests that tourism as a global phenomenon shows no signs of substantially abating in the long term it has been suggested that travel is necessary in order to maintain relationships as social life is increasingly networked and conducted at a distance for many people vacations and travel are increasingly being viewed as a necessity rather than a luxury and this is reflected in tourist numbers recovering some 6.6% globally over 2009 with growth up to 8% in emerging economies
