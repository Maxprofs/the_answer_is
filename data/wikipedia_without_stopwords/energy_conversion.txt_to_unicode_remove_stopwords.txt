entropy limitations conversion thermal energy typesedit
conversions thermal energy thus raising temperature forms energy may occur essentially efficiency many types friction conversion among nonthermal forms energy may occur fairly high efficiency though always energy dissipated thermally due friction similar processes sometimes efficiency close potential energy converted kinetic energy object falls vacuum object orbits nearer farther another object space
hand conversion thermal energy forms thus reducing temperature system strict limitations often keeping efficiency much less even energy allowed escape system thermal energy already partly spread among many available states collection microscopic particles constituting system enormous numbers possible combinations momentum position combinations said form phase space circumstances measure called entropy eveningout energy distributions dictates future states isolated system must least equal evenness energy distribution words way concentrate energy without spreading energy somewhere else
