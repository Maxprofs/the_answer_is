description
climate becomes colder high elevations due way sun heats surface earth practically heat surface earth comes sun form solar energy suns radiation absorbed land sea warmed warm land loses heat convection within atmosphere longwave radiation back space radiation move freely gases composed diatomic molecules atmospheres oxygen nitrogen readily absorbed reradiated triatomic molecules carbon dioxide water vapor heat reradiated heat would lost space instead reflected back towards earth thus troposphere whole acts blanket earth blanket effect known greenhouse effect higher altitude less blanket keep heat thus higher elevations mountains colder surrounding lowlands
rate temperature drops elevation called environmental lapse rate constant fluctuate throughout day seasonally also regionally normal lapse rate c per m f per ft therefore moving metres ft mountain roughly equivalent moving kilometres miles latitude towards pole relationship approximate however since local factors proximity oceans drastically modify climate altitude increases main form precipitation becomes snow winds increase temperature continues drop tropopause metres ft decrease however higher highest summit
distribution
although climate classification covers small portion earths surface alpine climates widely distributed altitude alpine climate tree line occurs varies dramatically latitude example n sweden alpine climate occurs low metres ft mount kilimanjaro africa alpine tree line occurs metres ft
