eruption column consists hot volcanic ash emitted explosive volcanic eruption ash forms column rising many kilometres air peak volcano explosive eruptions eruption column may rise km penetrating stratosphere stratospheric injection aerosols volcanoes major cause shortterm climate change
common occurrence explosive eruptions column collapse occur case eruption column dense lifted high air air convection instead falls flanks volcano form pyroclastic flow surge occasions ash isnt dense enough fall may create pyrocumulonimbus
formation
eruption columns form explosive volcanic activity high concentration volatile materials rising magma causes disrupted fine volcanic ash coarser tephra ash tephra ejected speeds several hundred metres per second rise rapidly heights several kilometres lifted enormous convection currents
eruption columns may transient formed discrete explosion sustained produced continuous eruption closely spaced discrete explosions
structure
solid liquid material eruption column lifted processes vary material ascends
base plume material forced upwards vent pressure expanding gas mainly steam gas expands pressure rock rapidly reduces approaches surface region called gas thrust region typically reaches one two kilometres vent
convective thrust region covers height plume gas thrust region turbulent surrounding air becomes mixed heated air expands reducing density rising rising air carries solid liquid material eruption entrained upwards
plume rises less dense surrounding air eventually reach altitude hot rising air density surrounding cooler air neutral buoyancy region erupted material longer rise convection solely upward momentum called umbrella region usually marked column spreading sideways eruptive material surrounding cool air density base umbrella region top marked maximum height momentum carries material upward speeds low negligible region often distorted stratospheric winds
column heights
column stop rising attains altitude longer less dense surrounding air several factors control height eruption column reach
intrinsic factors include diameter erupting vent gas content magma velocity ejected extrinsic factors important winds sometimes limiting height column local thermal temperature gradient also playing role atmospheric temperature troposphere normally decreases kkm small changes gradient large effect final column height theoretically maximum achievable column height thought km mi practice column heights ranging km mi seen
eruption columns km mi high break tropopause inject ash aerosols stratosphere ash aerosols troposphere quickly removed rain precipitation material injected stratosphere much slowly dispersed absence weather systems substantial amounts stratospheric injection global effects mount pinatubo erupted global temperatures dropped c largest eruptions thought cause drops several degrees potentially cause known mass extinctions
eruption column heights useful way measuring eruption intensity since given atmospheric temperature column height proportional fourth root mass eruption rate consequently given similar conditions double column height requires eruption ejecting times much material per second column height eruptions observed estimated mapping maximum distance pyroclasts different sizes carried ventthe higher column ejected material particular mass therefore size carried
