an extract is a substance made by extracting a part of a raw material often by using a solvent such as ethanol or water extracts may be sold as tinctures or in powder form
the aromatic principles of many spices nuts herbs fruits etc. and some flowers are marketed as extracts among the best known of true extracts being almond cinnamon cloves ginger lemon nutmeg orange peppermint pistachio rose spearmint vanilla violet and wintergreen
== extraction techniques ==
the majority of natural essences are obtained by extracting the essential oil from the blossoms fruit roots etc. or the whole plants through four techniques
expression when the oil is very plentiful and easily obtained as in lemon peel
absorption is generally accomplished by steeping in alcohol as vanilla beans
maceration is used to create smaller bits of the whole as in making peppermint extract etc
distillation is used with maceration but in many cases it requires expert chemical knowledge and the erection of costly stills
the distinctive flavors of nearly all fruits in the popular acceptance of the word are desirable adjuncts to many food preparations but only a few are practical sources of sufficiently concentrated flavor extract the most important among those that lend themselves to pure extract manufacture include lemons oranges and vanilla beans
== chemical-created essence ==
the majority of concentrated fruit flavors such as banana cherry peach pineapple raspberry and strawberry are produced by combining a variety of esters with special oils the desired colors are generally obtained by the use of dyes among the esters most generally employed are ethyl acetate and ethyl butyrate the chief factors in the production of artificial banana pineapple and strawberry extract are amyl acetate and amyl butyrate
artificial extracts generally do not possess the delicacy of natural fruit flavor but usually taste sufficiently similar to be useful when true essences are unobtainable or too expensive
