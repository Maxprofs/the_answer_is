in the other collegiate universities including the university of lancaster university of york university of kent university of st andrews and university of durham the colleges only provide accommodation and pastoral care
a university college is an independent institution which prepares students to sit as external candidates at other universities or has the authority to run courses that lead to the degrees of those universities it may also be an independent higher education institution with the power to award degrees but does not have university status although it is usually working towards it
historically some universities originated as university colleges for example the university of reading was an external college of the university of oxford as university college reading the university is now faculty based
=== united statesedit ===
in the united states there are over 7,021 colleges and universities a college in the us formally denotes a constituent part of a university but in popular usage the word college is the generic term for any post-secondary undergraduate education americans go to college after high school regardless of whether the specific institution is formally a college or a university some students choose to dual-enroll by taking college classes while still in high school the word and its derivatives are the standard terms used to describe the institutions and experiences associated with american post-secondary undergraduate education
students must pay for college before taking classes some borrow the money via loans and some students fund their educations with cash scholarships or grants or some combination of any two or more of those payment methods in 2011 the state or federal government subsidized $8,000 to $100,000 for each undergraduate degree for state-owned schools (called public universities) the subsidy was given to the college with the student benefiting from lower tuition the state subsidized on average 50% of public university tuition
colleges vary in terms of size degree and length of stay two-year colleges also known as junior or community colleges usually offer an associate's degree and four-year colleges usually offer a bachelor's degree often these are entirely undergraduate institutions although some have graduate school programs
four-year institutions in the u.s that emphasize a liberal arts curriculum are known as liberal arts colleges until the 20th century liberal arts law medicine theology and divinity were about the only form of higher education available in the united states these schools have traditionally emphasized instruction at the undergraduate level although advanced research may still occur at these institutions
while there is no national standard in the united states the term university primarily designates institutions that provide undergraduate and graduate education a university typically has as its core and its largest internal division an undergraduate college teaching a liberal arts curriculum also culminating in a bachelor's degree what often distinguishes a university is having in addition one or more graduate schools engaged in both teaching graduate classes and in research often these would be called a school of law or school of medicine (but may also be called a college of law or a faculty of law) an exception is vincennes university indiana which is styled and chartered as a university even though almost all of its academic programs lead only to two-year associate degrees some institutions such as dartmouth college and the college of william & mary have retained the term college in their names for historical reasons in one unique case boston college and boston university both located in boston massachusetts are completely separate institutions
usage of the terms varies among the states in 1996 for example georgia changed all of its four-year institutions previously designated as colleges to universities and all of its vocational technology schools to technical colleges
the terms university and college do not exhaust all possible titles for an american institution of higher education other options include institute (massachusetts institute of technology) academy (united states military academy) union (cooper union) conservatory (new england conservatory) and school (juilliard school) in colloquial use they are still referred to as college when referring to their undergraduate studies
the term college is also as in the united kingdom used for a constituent semi-autonomous part of a larger university but generally organized on academic rather than residential lines for example at many institutions the undergraduate portion of the university can be briefly referred to as the college (such as the college of the university of chicago harvard college at harvard or columbia college at columbia) while at others such as the university of california berkeley each of the faculties may be called a college (the college of engineering the college of nursing and so forth) there exist other variants for historical reasons for example duke university which was called trinity college until the 1920s still calls its main undergraduate subdivision trinity college of arts and sciences some american universities such as princeton rice and yale do have residential colleges along the lines of oxford or cambridge but the name was clearly adopted in homage to the british system unlike the oxbridge colleges these residential colleges are not autonomous legal entities nor are they typically much involved in education itself being primarily concerned with room board and social life at the university of michigan university of california san diego and the university of california santa cruz however each of the residential colleges does teach its own core writing courses and has its own distinctive set of graduation requirements
origin of the u.s usage
the founders of the first institutions of higher education in the united states were graduates of the university of oxford and the university of cambridge the small institutions they founded would not have seemed to them like universities they were tiny and did not offer the higher degrees in medicine and theology furthermore they were not composed of several small colleges instead the new institutions felt like the oxford and cambridge colleges they were used to small communities housing and feeding their students with instruction from residential tutors (as in the united kingdom described above) when the first students graduated these colleges assumed the right to confer degrees upon them usually with authorityfor example the college of william & mary has a royal charter from the british monarchy allowing it to confer degrees while dartmouth college has a charter permitting it to award degrees as are usually granted in either of the universities or any other college in our realm of great britain.
the leaders of harvard college (which granted america's first degrees in 1642) might have thought of their college as the first of many residential colleges that would grow up into a new cambridge university however over time few new colleges were founded there and harvard grew and added higher faculties eventually it changed its title to university but the term college had stuck and colleges have arisen across the united states
in u.s usage the word college embodies not only a particular type of school but has historically been used to refer to the general concept of higher education when it is not necessary to specify a school as in going to college or college savings accounts offered by banks
in a survey of more than 2,000 college students in 33 states and 156 different campuses the u.s public interest research group found the average student spends as much as $1,200 each year on textbooks and supplies alone by comparison the group says that's the equivalent of 39 percent of tuition and fees at a community college and 14 percent of tuition and fees at a four-year public university
morrill land-grant act
in addition to private colleges and universities the u.s also has a system of government funded public universities many were founded under the morrill land-grant colleges act of 1862 when the morrill act was established the original colleges on the east coast primarily those of the ivy league and several religious based colleges were the only form of higher education available and were often confined only to the children of the elite a movement had arisen to bring a form of more practical higher education to the masses as ...many politicians and educators wanted to make it possible for all young americans to receive some sort of advanced education. the morrill act ...made it possible for the new western states to establish colleges for the citizens. its goal was to make higher education more easily accessible to the citizenry of the country specifically to improve agricultural systems by providing training and scholarship in the production and sales of agricultural products and to provide formal education in ...agriculture home economics mechanical arts and other professions that seemed practical at the time.
the act was eventually extended to allow all states that had remained with the union during the american civil war and eventually all states to establish such institutions most of the colleges established under the morrill act have since become full universities and some are among the elite of the world
benefits of college
