snapping (or clicking) one's fingers is the act of creating a snapping or clicking sound with one's fingers primarily this is done by building tension between the thumb and another (middle index or ring) finger and then moving the other finger forcefully downward so it hits the palm of the same hand at a high speed alternatively one can press the middle finger and thumb together and then fling the index finger into them

there are three components to the snapping finger sound (1) the friction or sliding sound between the second (middle) finger and the thumb (2) the impact sound from the second finger colliding with a groove created by contacting the third (ring) finger with the palm and (3) the pop sound from the rapid compression and subsequent decompression of air the third pop sound is the most audible of the three components and because it is caused by a compression of air between the fast moving second finger and the groove between the palm and third finger the second finger must hit both the palm and a small portion of the top of the third finger in order to get the full snap sound if the second finger only hits the palm only the first two components will be heard and there will be a significant reduction in the total snap sound this usually happens because the third finger is simply not in contact with the palm but it can also happen if the third finger doesn't align properly with the striking point of the second finger in this case no part of the second finger lands anywhere on top of the third finger and ends up only hitting the palm
== in cultureedit ==
in ancient greece snapping of fingers was used by musicians and dancers as a way to keep the rhythm and it was known with the words  (apolekeo)  (apokrotema) (from the verb  - apokroteo to snap the fingers") and  (epiptaisma) finger snapping is still common in modern greece
finger snapping may be used as a substitute for hand clapping the university of michigan men's glee club has a long tradition of doing this the club's history states the reason behind this (as legend goes) is you can't clap and hold a beer [at the same time] another possible reason is that snapping is less disruptive than clapping during speeches and announcements.
snapping one's fingers abruptly and repetitively often in conjunction with one or more spoken exclamations is commonly employed in getting someone else's attention
== in musicedit ==
in sumatran culture finger snapping along with chest slapping is a common form of music
in western music involving snapping of fingers the sound of the snap is usually on 2 and 4 (the offbeat like the clap)
the sounds of a fingersnap also are sampled and used in many disparate genres of music used mostly as percussion the works of angelo badalamenti exhibit this in the soundtracks to e.g. twin peaks lost highway as does the theme song from the television series the addams family& the andy griffith show theme song
