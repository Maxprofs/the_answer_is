== history ==
=== origins ===
20th century fox had been involved in television production as early as the 1950s producing several syndicated programs during this era in november 1956 the studio purchased a 50% interest in the nta film network an early syndicator of films and television programs following the demise of the dumont television network in august of that year after becoming mired in severe financial problems nta was launched as a new fourth network 20th century fox would also produce original content for the nta network the film network effort would fail after a few years but 20th century fox continued to dabble in television through its production arm tcf television productions producing series (such as perry mason) for the three major broadcast television networks (abc nbc and cbs)
=== 1980s establishment of the network ===
==== foundations ====
the fox network's foundations were laid in march 1985 through news corporation's $250 million purchase of a 50% interest in tcf holdings the parent company of the 20th century fox film studio in may 1985 news corporation a media company owned by australian publishing magnate rupert murdoch that had mainly served as a newspaper publisher at the time of the tcf holdings deal agreed to pay $2.55 billion to acquire independent television stations in six major u.s cities from the john kluge-run broadcasting company metromedia wnew-tv (channel 5) in new york city wttg (channel 5) in washington d.c. kttv (channel 11) in los angeles kriv (channel 26) in houston wfld-tv (channel 32) in chicago and krld-tv (channel 33) in dallas a seventh station abc affiliate wcvb-tv (channel 5) in boston was part of the original transaction but was spun off to the hearst broadcasting subsidiary of the hearst corporation in a separate concurrent deal as part of a right of first refusal related to that station's 1982 sale to metromedia (two years later news corporation acquired wxne-tv (channel 25) in that market from the christian broadcasting network and changed its call letters to wfxt)
==== beginning of the network ====
in october 1985 20th century fox announced its intentions to form a fourth television network that would compete with abc cbs and nbc the plans were to use the combination of the fox studios and the former metromedia stations to both produce and distribute programming organizational plans for the network were held off until the metromedia acquisitions cleared regulatory hurdles then in december 1985 rupert murdoch agreed to pay $325 million to acquire the remaining equity in tcf holdings from his original partner marvin davis the purchase of the metromedia stations was approved by the federal communications commission (fcc) in march 1986 the call letters of the new york city and dallas outlets were subsequently changed respectively to wnyw and kdaf these first six stations then broadcasting to a combined reach of 22% of the nation's households became known as the fox television stations group except for kdaf (which was sold to renaissance broadcasting in 1995 and became a wb affiliate at the same time) all of the original owned-and-operated stations ("o&os") are still part of the fox network today like the core o&o group fox's affiliate body initially consisted of independent stations (a few of which had maintained affiliations with abc nbc cbs and/or dumont earlier in their existences) the local charter affiliate was in most cases that market's top-rated independent however fox opted to affiliate with a second-tier independent station in markets where a more established independent declined the affiliation (such as denver phoenix and st louis) largely because of both these factors fox in a situation very similar to what dumont had experienced four decades before had little choice but to affiliate with uhf stations in all except a few (mainly larger) markets where the network gained clearance
the fox broadcasting company launched at 11:00 p.m eastern and pacific time on october 9 1986 its inaugural program was a late-night talk show the late show which was hosted by comedienne joan rivers after a strong start the late show quickly eroded in the ratings it was never able to overtake nbc stalwart the tonight show whose then-host johnny carson upset over her becoming his late-night competitor banned rivers (a frequent tonight guest and substitute host) from appearing on his show (rivers would not appear on tonight again until february 2014 seven months before her death when jimmy fallon took over as its host) by early 1987 rivers (and her then-husband edgar rosenberg the show's original executive producer) quit the late show after disagreements with the network over the show's creative direction the program then began to be hosted by a succession of guest hosts after that point some stations that affiliated with fox in the weeks before the april 1987 launch of its prime time lineup (such as wcgv-tv (channel 24) in milwaukee and wdrb-tv (channel 41) in louisville) signed affiliation agreements with the network on the condition that they would not have to carry the late show due to the program's weak ratings
the network expanded its programming into prime time on april 5 1987 inaugurating its sunday night lineup with the premieres of the sitcom married with children and the sketch comedy series the tracey ullman show fox added one new show per week over the next several weeks with the drama 21 jump street and comedies mr president and duet completing its sunday schedule on july 11 the network rolled out its saturday night schedule with the premiere of the supernatural drama series werewolf which began with a two-hour pilot movie event three other series were added to the saturday lineup over the next three weeks comedies the new adventures of beans baxter karen's song and down and out in beverly hills (the latter being an adaptation of the film of the same name) both karen's song and down and out in beverly hills were canceled by the start of the 198788 television season the network's first fall launch and were replaced by the sitcoms second chance and women in prison
in regards to its late night lineup fox had already decided to cancel the late show and had a replacement series in development the wilton north report when the former series began a ratings resurgence under its final guest host comedian arsenio hall wilton north lasted just a few weeks however and the network was unable to reach a deal with hall to return as host when it hurriedly revived the late show in early 1988 the late show went back to featuring guest hosts eventually selecting ross shafer as its permanent host only for it to be canceled for good by october 1988 while hall signed a deal with paramount television to develop his own syndicated late night talk show the arsenio hall show although it had modest successes in married with children and the tracy ullman show several affiliates were disappointed with fox's largely underperforming programming lineup during the network's first three years kmsp-tv (channel 9) in minneapolis-st paul and kptv (channel 12) in portland oregon both owned at the time by chris-craft television disaffiliated from fox in 1988 (with kitn (channel 29 now wftc) and kpdx (channel 49) respectively replacing those stations as fox affiliates) citing that the network's weaker program offerings were hampering viewership of their stronger syndicated slate
the network added a third night of programming on mondays at the start of the 198990 television season a season that heralded the start of a turnaround for fox that season saw the debut of a midseason replacement series the simpsons an animated series that originated as a series of shorts on the tracey ullman show ranked at a three-way tie for 29th place in the nielsen ratings it became a breakout hit and was the first fox series to break the top 30 that year fox also first introduced the documentary series cops and crime-focused magazine program america's most wanted (the latter of which debuted as a half-hour series as part of the network's mainly comedy-based sunday lineup for its first season before expanding to an hour and moving to fridays for the 199091 season) both series which would become staples on the network for just over two decades would eventually be paired to form the nuclei of fox's saturday night schedule beginning in the 199495 season meanwhile married with children which broke ground from other family sitcoms of the period as it centered on a dysfunctional lower-middle-class family whose patriarch often openly loathed his failures and being saddled with a wife and two children saw viewer interest substantially increase beginning in its third season after in an ironic twist michigan homemaker terry rakolta lodged a boycott to force fox to cancel the series after objecting to risque humor and sexual content featured in a 1989 episode married...'s newfound success led it to become the network's longest-running live-action sitcom airing for 11 seasons
=== 1990s rise into mainstream success and beginnings of rivalry with the big three ===
fox survived where dumont and other attempts to start a fourth network had failed because it programmed just under the number of hours defined by the fcc to legally be considered a network this allowed fox to make revenue in ways forbidden to the established networks (for instance it did not have to adhere to the financial interest and syndication rules that were in effect at the time) since during its first years it was considered to be merely a large group of stations by comparison dumont was saddled by numerous regulatory barriers that hampered its potential to grow most notably a ban on acquiring additional stations during an era when the fcc had much tighter ownership limits for television stations (limiting broadcasters to a maximum of five stations nationwide) than it did when fox launched since its minority owner paramount pictures owned two television stations (one of which had already disaffiliated from the network) combined with the three television stations owned by network parent dumont laboratories this put dumont at the legal limit at the time in addition murdoch was more than willing to open his wallet to get and keep programming and talent dumont in contrast operated on a shoestring budget and was unable to keep the programs and stars it had most of the other startup networks that launched in later years (such as the wb upn and the cw) followed fox's model as well clarke ingram who maintains a memorial website to the failed dumont television network has suggested that fox is a revival or at least a linear descendant of dumont since metromedia (originally known as metropolitan broadcasting at its founding) was spun off from dumont and that company's television stations formed the nucleus of the fox network wnyw (originally known as wabd) and wttg were two of the three original owned-and-operated stations of the dumont network and remains based out of a facility in manhattan which was formerly the base of dumont's operations the dumont tele-centre the current day fox television center
although fox was growing rapidly as a network and had established itself as a presence it was still not considered a major competitor to the established big three broadcast networks abc cbs and nbc from its launch fox had the advantage of offering programs intended to appeal toward a younger demographic adults between 18 and 49 years of age and were edgier in content whereas some programs that were carried by the big three networks attracted an older-skewing audience until the early 1990s when fox expanded its programming to additional nights and outside of prime time most fox stations were still essentially formatted as independent stations filling their schedules with mainly first-run and acquired programming and during prime time running either syndicated programs or more commonly movies on nights when the network did not provide programming few fox stations carried local newscasts during its early years unlike the owned-and-operated stations and affiliates of its established rivals with those that did mainly being based in larger markets (including some of the network's o&os) and carried only newscasts following the network's prime time lineup
as fox gradually headed towards carrying a full week's worth of programming in prime time through the addition of programming on thursday and friday nights at the start of the 199091 season the network's added offerings included the scheduling of the simpsons opposite veteran nbc sitcom the cosby show as part of fox's initial thursday night lineup that fall (along with future hit beverly hills 90210 which would become the network's longest-running drama airing for ten seasons) after only a half-season of success on sunday nights the show performed well in its new thursday slot spending four seasons there and helping to launch martin another fox comedy that became a hit when it debuted in september 1992 the simpsons returned to sunday nights in the fall of 1994 and has remained there ever since
the sketch comedy series in living color which debuted in april 1990 created many memorable characters and launched the careers of future movie stars jim carrey jamie foxx damon wayans keenen ivory wayans and jennifer lopez (the latter of whom was a member of the show's dance troupe the fly girls") the series also gained international prominence after fox aired a special live episode in january 1992 as an alternative to the halftime show during super bowl xxvi which was broadcast on cbs marking the start of fox's rivalry with the big three networks while popularizing the counterprogramming strategy against the super bowl telecast the early and mid-1990s saw the debuts of several soap opera-style prime time dramas aimed at younger audiences that became quick hits which in addition to beverly hills 90210 included its adult-focused spin-off melrose place (which initially had a mediocre ratings performance before viewership rose significantly midway through its first season following heather locklear's addition to the cast) and family drama party of five the early and mid-1990s also saw the network launch several series aimed at a black audience which in addition to martin included the sitcom living single and police procedural new york undercover
==== luring the nfl and affiliation switches ====
fox would become a viable competitor to the big three when the network lured the partial broadcast television rights to the national football league away from cbs on december 18 1993 fox signed a contract with the nfl to televise regular season and playoff games from the national football conference (which had been airing its games on cbs since 1955 fifteen years before the formation of the nfc and the american football conference through the merger of the american football league and the nfl) starting with the 1994 season the initial four-year contract which fox bid $1.58 billion to obtain (considerably more than the $290 million that cbs reportedly offered to retain the conference rights) also included the exclusive u.s television rights to super bowl xxxi in 1997 the network also lured pat summerall john madden dick stockton matt millen james brown and terry bradshaw (as well as many behind-the-scenes production personnel) from cbs sports to staff its nfl coverage
shortly afterward news corporation began striking affiliation deals with and later purchased more television station groups on may 23 1994 fox agreed to purchase a 20% stake in new world communications a television and film production company controlled by investor ronald perelman that had just recently entered into broadcasting through its 1993 purchase of seven stations owned by sci television as a result of fox acquiring a 20% minority interest in the company new world signed an agreement to switch the affiliations of twelve stations (eight cbs affiliates three abc affiliates two of which were subsequently placed in a blind trust and then sold directly to fox due to conflicts with fcc ownership rules and one nbc affiliate) that it had either already owned outright or was in the process of acquiring from citicasters and argyle communications at the time to fox starting in september 1994 and continuing as existing affiliation contracts with their existing major network partners expired
that summer sf broadcasting a joint venture between fox and savoy pictures that was founded in march 1994 purchased four stations from burnham broadcasting (three nbc affiliates and one abc affiliate) through a separate agreement those stations would also switch to fox between september 1995 and january 1996 as existing affiliation agreements lapsed these two deals were not the first instances in which a longtime big three station affiliated with fox the network scored its first major coup when it moved its miami affiliation from charter affiliate wcix (channel 6 which became a cbs owned-and-operated station now wfor-tv on channel 4) to nbc affiliate wsvn (channel 7) in january 1989 the result of a three-station affiliation swap spurred by nbc's purchase of longtime cbs affiliate wtvj (channel 4 now on channel 6) through the expansion of its news programming and a refocused emphasis on crime stories and sensationalistic reporting under news director joel cheatwood that switch helped ascend the perennial third-place wsvn into a strong competitor in the miami market
the nfc contract in fact was the impetus for the affiliation deal with new world and sf broadcasting's purchase of the burnham stations as fox sought to improve local coverage of its new nfl package by aligning the network with stations that had more established histories and advertiser value than its charter affiliates the deals spurred a series of affiliation realignments between all four u.s television networks involving individual stations and various broadcasting groups such as those between cbs and group w (whose corporate parent later bought the network in august 1995) and abc and the e w scripps company (which owned several fox affiliates that switched to either abc or nbc as a result of the new world deal) affecting 30 television markets between september 1994 and september 1996 the two deals also had the side benefit of increasing local news programming on the new fox affiliates mirroring the programming format adopted by wsvn upon that station's switch to the network (as well as expanding the number of news-producing stations in fox's portfolio beyond mainly charter stations in certain large and mid-sized markets)
with significant market share for the first time ever and the rights to the nfl fox firmly established itself as the nation's fourth major network fox television stations would acquire new world outright on july 17 1996 in a $2.48 billion stock purchase making the latter's twelve fox affiliates owned-and-operated stations of the network the deal was completed on january 22 1997 later in august 2000 fox bought several stations owned by chris-craft industries and its subsidiaries bhc communications and united television for $5.5 billion (most of these stations were upn affiliates although its minneapolis station kmsp-tv would rejoin fox in september 2002 as an owned-and-operated station) these purchases for a time made fox television stations the largest owner of television stations in the u.s (a title that has since been assumed by the sinclair broadcast group one of the network's largest affiliate groups)
==== evolving programming ====
fox completed its prime time expansion to all seven nights on january 19 1993 with the launch of two additional nights of programming on tuesdays and wednesdays (the method of gradually adding nights to the programming schedule that began with the network's april 1987 prime time launch was replicated by the wb and upn when those networks debuted in january 1995) september 1993 saw the heavy promotion and debut of a short-lived western series that incorporated science-fiction elements the adventures of brisco county jr however it was the supernatural investigative drama that debuted immediately following it on friday nights the x-files that would find long-lasting success and would become fox's first series to crack nielsen's year-end top 20 most-watched network programs after several other failed attempts at late night programming following the cancellation of the late show (most notably the quick failure of the chevy chase show in 1993) fox finally found success in the time period with the debut of madtv on october 14 1995 the sketch comedy series became a solid competitor to nbc's saturday night live for over a decade and was the network's most successful late night program as well as one of its most successful saturday night shows running for 14 seasons until its cancellation in 2009
an attempt to make a larger effort to program saturday nights by moving married with children from its longtime sunday slot and adding a new but short-lived sitcom (love and marriage) to the night at the beginning of the 199697 season backfired with the public as it resulted in a brief cancellation of america's most wanted that was criticized by law enforcement and public officials and was roundly rejected by viewers which brought swift cancellation to the newer series married quickly returned to sundays (before moving again to mondays two months later) both it and martin would end their runs at the end of that season the saturday schedule was revised in november 1996 to feature one new and one encore episode of cops and the revived america's most wanted america fights back cops and amw remained the anchors of fox's saturday lineup making it the most stable night in american broadcast television for over 14 years both shows eventually became among the seldom few first-run programs on saturday evenings across the four major networks after decreasing prime time viewership as more people opted to engage in leisure activities away from home rather than watch television on that night of the week led abc nbc and cbs to largely abandon first-run series on saturdays (outside of newsmagazines sports and burned off prime time shows that failed on other nights) in favor of reruns and movies by the mid-2000s america's most wanted ended its 22-year run on fox in june 2011 and was subsequently picked up by lifetime (before being cancelled for good in 2013) cops in turn would move its first-run episodes to spike in 2013 after 23 seasons (ending its original run on fox as the network's longest-running prime time program) leaving sports and repeats of reality and drama series as the only programs airing on fox on saturday evenings
by the 199798 season fox had three shows in the nielsen top 20 the x-files (which ranked 11th) king of the hill (which ranked 15th) and the simpsons (which ranked 18th) building around its flagship animated comedy the simpsons fox would experience relative success with animated series in prime time beginning with the debut of the mike judge-produced king of the hill in 1997 family guy (the first of three adult-oriented animated series from seth macfarlane to air on the network) and futurama (from simpsons creator matt groening) would make their debuts in 1999 however they were respectively canceled in 2002 and 2003 due to strong dvd sales and highly rated cable reruns on cartoon network's adult swim fox later decided to order new episodes of family guy which began airing in 2005 futurama would be revived with four direct-to-dvd films between 2007 and 2009 and would return as a first-run series on comedy central where it ran from 2010 to 2013 less successful efforts included the critic starring saturday night live alumnus jon lovitz (which fox picked up in 1994 after it was cancelled by abc only for the series to be cancelled again after its second season) and the pjs (which moved to the wb in 2000 after fox cancelled that series after its second season) other notable shows that debuted in the late 1990s included the quirky david e kelley-produced live-action dramedy ally mcbeal and period comedy that 70s show the latter of which became fox's second-longest-running live-action sitcom airing for eight seasons
throughout the 1990s and into the next decade fox launched a slate of cable channels beginning with the 1994 debuts of general entertainment network fx and movie channel fxm movies from fox (now fx movie channel) followed by the debut of fox news channel in august 1996 its sports operations expanded with the acquisition of controlling interests in several regional sports networks (including the prime network and sportschannel) between 1996 and 2000 to form fox sports net (which launched in november 1996) its 2000 purchase of speedvision (later speed channel which was replaced in the united states by fox sports 1 in august 2013 however it continues to exist in other north american and caribbean countries as fox sports racing) and the launches of fox sports world (later fox soccer which was replaced by fxx in september 2013) and fox sports en espanol (now fox deportes) in the early 2000s
=== 2000s rise to ratings leadership new programming breakthroughs and fierce rivalry with cbs ===
by 2000 many staple fox shows of the 1990s had ended their runs during the late 1990s and carrying over into the early 2000s fox put much of its efforts into producing reality fare many of which were considered to be sensationalistic and controversial in nature such as who wants to marry a multi-millionaire? temptation island married by america and joe millionaire (which became the first fox program ever to crack the nielsen top 10) as well as video clip shows such as world's wildest police videos and when animals attack after shedding most of these programs fox gradually filled its lineup with acclaimed dramas such as 24 the o.c. house and bones and comedies such as the bernie mac show malcolm in the middle and arrested development
as the decade wore on fox began surpassing abc and nbc in the ratings first in age demographics then in overall viewership and placed second behind a resurgent cbs in total viewership beginning in 2002 fox hit a major milestone in 2005 when it emerged as the most-watched u.s broadcast network in the lucrative 18-49 demographic for the first time largely boosted by the strength of the reality singing competition series american idol considered to be the biggest american television hit of the 2000s as well as the first fox show to lead the nielsen seasonal ratings idol had peak audiences of up to 38 million viewers during the 20022003 season finale and double-season average audiences of around 31 million viewers in 2006 and 2007 subsequently idol leapfrogged over fox's big three competition to become the highest-rated u.s television program overall starting with the 200304 season idol emerged as the first reality singing competition series in the country ever to reach first place in the seasonal ratings and remains the most recent american television program to date to lead the national prime time ratings whilst attracting at least 30 million viewers for at least one television season house which aired after idol on tuesday nights and had a successful run of summer repeats in 2005 positioned itself as fox's first prime time drama series (and the network's third program overall) to reach the nielsen top 10 in 2006
since 2004 cbs and fox which ranked as the two most-watched broadcast networks in the u.s during the 2000s have tended to equal one another in demographic ratings among general viewership with both networks winning certain demographics by narrow margins however while fox has the youngest-skewing viewer base cbs is consistently regarded to have the oldest audience demographics among the major broadcast networks fox hit a milestone in february 2005 by scoring its first-ever sweeps victory in total viewership and demographic ratings boosted largely by its broadcast of super bowl xxxix and the strengths of american idol 24 house and the o.c during the 20042005 season fox ranked in first place among all broadcast networks in the 1849 adult demographic for the first time in its history another milestone came by the conclusion of the 200708 season on may 21 2008 shortly after the widely acclaimed seventh season finale of american idol when fox became the highest-rated television network in the united states overall for the first time attributed to the strengths of super bowl xlii idol and house during that season it also dominated the 18-49 demographic for the fourth consecutive season by the largest margin ever since the introduction of people meter technology for television audience measurement by nielsen during the 198586 season and eventually became the only non-big three network to earn first place overall since then
near the end of the 2000s fox launched a few series that proved to be powerful hits in different respects in 2008 the supernatural mystery series fringe debuted to high ratings and critical acclaim during its first season on tuesdays though its viewership declined through its run the series developed a large loyal fanbase that had turned the show into a cult favorite in 2009 glee premiered to average ratings when its pilot aired as a special preview episode in may but earned positive reviews from critics the musical dramedy's ratings increased during its first season and was met with such media attention that it had formed a large loyal international fanbase the cast of the series has been acknowledged by notable luminaries such as the president of the united states barack obama and oprah winfrey who have each asked the cast to perform live for various national events
=== 2010s network's ratings collapse and revamp in network programming ===
at the close of the 2000s and the start of the 2010s new comedies raising hope and new girl gave fox its first live-action comedy successes in years the second season of glee delivered that series highest ratings during the 201011 season with viewership peaking during its super bowl lead-out episode in february 2011 at the same time fox's live telecast of the super bowl xlv helped the network emerge as the first u.s television network to earn an average single-night prime time audience of at least 100 million viewers
american idol lost its first place standing among all network prime time programs during the 201112 finale (falling to second that season behind nbc sunday night football) ending the longest streak at #1 for a prime time broadcast network series in american television history through its eight-year ratings domination in both the adults 18-49 demographic and total viewership idol also remained in the nielsen top 10 for eleven years from 2003 to 2013 and became the highest-rated non-sports prime time television program as well as the highest-rated reality series in the u.s from 2003 to 2012 these records marked the longest nielsen ratings streaks of any fox program in these categories the 2012 season finale of american idol additionally helped fox win in the 18-49 demographic for the eighth consecutive season the longest such streak according to nielsen measurement records
fox suffered a collapse in viewership during the 201213 season american idol and glee suffered steep ratings declines while the network as a whole fell to third place (suffering an overall decrease by 22%) in total viewership and to second place in the 18-49 demographic (where it remains as of 2014) by the end of the season the decline in ratings continued into the 201314 season with fox placing fourth among the major networks in total viewership for the first time since 2001 subsequently on january 13 2014 fox announced it would abandon its use of the standard concept of greenlighting shows through the initial order of pilot episodes during the designated pilot season (running from january through april) instead opting to pick up shows directly to series
fox scored renewed ratings successes with its live telecast of super bowl xlviii in february 2014 and the lead-out programs that followed the event new girl and brooklyn nine-nine super bowl xlviii became the second highest-rated u.s television program to date with peak ratings of up to 167 million viewers during several portions of the fox telecast later in may 2014 kevin reilly announced that he would resign as chairman of fox entertainment on july 15 2014 corporate parent 21st century fox announced that it would merge the operations of the network and 20th century fox television into the newly created fox television group with 20th century fox television co-chairpersons dana walden and gary newman appointed to head the division
the 201415 season saw hits in the freshmen dramas gotham (based on the batman mythos) and the lee daniels-produced empire ratings for empire in particular increased week-to-week throughout its first season becoming the network's first successful american idol lead-out since house as well as the first american television program to consistently increase its episode-to-episode viewership during its first five weeks since the 1992 feat set by abc's roseanne empire ended its inaugural season as the first u.s television show ever to increase its episodic viewership on a consistent basis throughout the course of a single season as well as fox's fourth program overall (and the first since the 2013 finale of american idol) to enter the nielsen top 10 by the end of the 201415 season

typically every sunday night during prime time (unless preempted usually by sports telecasts) fox airs a lineup incorporating original adult animation series this block of adult cartoons became a staple of the network airing under the brand animation domination from may 1 2005 to september 14 2014 when the network rebranded the block as sunday funday as a result of the re-incorporation of live-action comedy series on the sunday night lineup after ten years (aside from occasional burn-offs of series aired on other nights during the 7:00 p.m eastern/pacific hour) although animated series remain an integral part of that night's schedule
the first programs to air as part of the animation domination lineup were american dad (which also had its beginnings in the lineup and moved to tbs in october 2014) family guy (which returned to the network after a four-year cancellation when animation domination began) the simpsons (the longest-running cartoon on fox predating the lineup by 16 years) and king of the hill (which also predated the lineup by eight years) animated shows currently airing as part of the lineup include family guy the simpsons and bob's burgers in addition to king of the hill series that have previously aired on the lineup have included sit down shut up allen gregory napoleon dynamite and the cleveland show
an extension of the sunday prime-time block called animation domination high-def launched on saturday late nights in july 2013 (marking the return of first-run programming in that time period since the 2010 cancellation of the wanda sykes show) with adhd shorts axe cop and high school usa due to low ratings fox announced on april 17 2014 that it would discontinue animation domination high-def although the block was slated to end on june 28 2014 it continues to air on fox as of october 2015 with reruns of its existing programs
=== children's programming ===
fox began airing children's programming on september 8 1990 with the debut of the fox children's network (rebranded as the fox kids network in 1991 and then to simply fox kids in 1998) a programming block that aired on saturday mornings and weekday afternoons programming within the fox kids block consisted mainly of animated series although it also featured some live-action series as part of the lineup shows featured in the block included bobby's world x-men spider man the tick and goosebumps it also aired select shows from warner bros animation including the popular animated series tiny toon adventures animaniacs and batman the animated series (warner bros pulled batman and animaniacs from the fox kids lineup in september 1995 moving both shows as well as tiny toons which had already ended its run to the newly launched kids wb block on the wb) fox kids most successful series however was mighty morphin power rangers (from eventual sister company and fox kids co-parent saban entertainment) which debuted in 1993 and became the block's flagship program until it moved to abc and toon disney in 2002
in october 2001 fox sold its children's division saban entertainment and fox family worldwide (the parent subsidiary of cable network fox family channel now abc family) to the walt disney company for $5.3 billion the network relegated the fox kids block to saturdays in january 2002 (turning over the two-hour timeslot held by the weekday block over to its owned-and-operated and affiliated stations rather than retaining the slots and filling them with adult-oriented daytime shows) then on september 14 2002 as part of a time-lease agreement with 4kids entertainment to program the remaining four-hour saturday morning lineup fox kids was replaced by a new children's program block called foxbox (which was renamed 4kids tv in february 2005)
fox discontinued the 4kids tv block on december 27 2008 due to conflicts between the network and 4kids entertainment that were later settled regarding 4kids failure to pay fox for the programming lease rights and the network's inability to fulfill a promise guaranteeing clearance on 90% of its stations and get other stations to carry the block in certain markets where a fox station declined it (an issue that plagued fox's children's program blocks since the start of its affiliation deal with new world communications) fox had earlier announced on november 23 that it would no longer carry children's programming in the time period citing stiff competition from cable channels aimed at the demographic the network instead turned two of the four vacant saturday morning hours over to its affiliates to allow them to air local newscasts or educational programs purchased from the syndication market while it retained the remaining two hours to run a network-managed paid programming block weekend marketplace which debuted on january 3 2009
on september 14 2014 xploration station a two-hour syndicated block produced by steve rotfeld productions began airing on fox stations owned by several affiliate groups including fox television stations and tribune broadcasting the block which complies with guidelines defined by the children's television act features programs focused on the stem fields stations can choose to either carry xploration station or continue to air weekend marketplace (as the sinclair broadcast group chose to do since it already carries syndicated e/i programming purchased by the company across its fox affiliates although sinclair plans to add the block on most of its fox affiliates in september 2016)
=== news ===
unlike abc cbs and nbc fox does not currently air national news programs (morning evening or overnight) or newsmagazines choosing to focus solely on its prime time schedule sports and other ancillary network programming the absence of a national news program on the fox network is despite the fact that its parent company 21st century fox owns fox news channel which launched in august 1996 and is currently available on virtually all pay television providers within the united states fox news is not structured as a news division of the fox network and operates as a technically separate entity within 21st century fox through the company's fox news group subsidiary however it does produce some content that is carried by the broadcast network which is usually separate from the news coverage aired by the cable channel in particular fnc anchor shepard smith anchors most prime time news presentations on the fox network especially during political news events (which are anchored by bret baier on fox news channel)
specifically the fox network airs coverage of the state of the union address presidential debates national election coverage as well as live breaking news coverage currently branded as a fox news special report (formerly branded as fox news alerts or sometimes fox news red alerts") carriage of such special coverage of a breaking news story may vary from station to station and is often limited to events that occur during the network's usual prime time block (for example unlike the big three fox does not often provide coverage of major political convention speeches which usually occur during the 10:00 p.m (eastern time) hour during which most of its affiliates air local newscasts however the majority of fox's owned-and-operated stations and affiliate groups do carry weekday breaking news briefs) the political discussion show fox news sunday also airs on the fox network on sunday mornings and is rebroadcast later in the day on fnc fox also operates an affiliate news service called fox newsedge which launched with fox news channel in 1996 and provides national and international news reports and feature stories for fox stations to use in their own local newscasts
fox first tried its hand at a national news program in prime time with the hour-long weekly newsmagazine the reporters which was produced by the same team behind the fox television stations-distributed syndicated tabloid program a current affair the program ran from 1988 to 1990 when it was cancelled due to low ratings from 1987 until about 1990 fox also aired news capsules that aired within its prime time schedule branded as fox news extra which were produced at new york city o&o wnyw (cora-ann mihalik who anchored the newsbriefs had at the time also co-anchored wnyw's weeknight 7:00 and 10:00 p.m newscasts) another failed attempt occurred in 1993 when fox launched front page (which included among its five hosts ron reagan and josh mankiewicz) in an attempt to capture a younger demographic for a newsmagazine program
the network tried its hand at a newsmagazine again in 1998 with fox files hosted by fox news channel anchors catherine crier and jon scott as well as a team of correspondents it lasted a little over a year before being cancelled its most recent attempt at a newsmagazine series occurred during the 200203 sweeps period with the pulse hosted by fox news channel anchor shepard smith
fox also attempted national morning programs only the first of which aired on the network itself its first venture at such a program was fox after breakfast an hour-long morning news and lifestyle show hosted by tom bergeron and laurie hibberd that ran on the network from 1996 to 1998 (fox aired the program at 9:00 a.m as opposed to the 7:00 to 9:00 a.m time slot that nbc cbs and abc air their national morning shows in order to accommodate local morning newscasts that ran in the latter slot on some of its stations) the program originated as breakfast time in 1995 on sister cable channel fx fox tried again in 2002 with good day live a heavily entertainment-focused syndicated offshoot of good day l.a. a news/entertainment/lifestyle program that debuted in 1993 on los angeles owned-and-operated station kttv the national version of the program was cancelled in 2005 on january 22 2007 fox premiered the morning show with mike and juliet on its owned-and-operated stations hosted by mike jerrick and juliet huddy (then-anchors of fox news channel's dayside) the show was lighter in format and more entertainment-oriented though its focus often changed when a major news story occurred in february 2007 the program was syndicated to other stations including many affiliated with abc nbc and cbs in markets where it was not carried by a fox or mynetworktv affiliate the morning show was cancelled in june 2009
=== sports ===
when the network launched fox management having seen the critical role that sports programming soccer events in particular had played in the growth of the british satellite service bskyb believed that sports and specifically professional football would be the engine that would make fox a major network the quickest in 1987 after abc initially hedged on renewing its contract to broadcast monday night football fox made an offer to the national football league to acquire the rights for the same amount that abc had been paying about $13 million per game at the time however partly due to the fact that fox had not yet established itself as a major network the nfl chose to renew its contract with abc (where monday night football remained until its move to sister cable channel espn in september 2006)
six years later when the league entered contract negotiations with its television partners fox placed a $1.58 billion bid to obtain broadcast rights to the national football conference covering four seasons of games beginning with the 1994 nfl season the nfl selected the fox bid on december 18 1993 stripping cbs of football telecasts for the first time since 1955 the event placed fox on par with the big three television networks and ushered in an era of growth for the nfl fox's acquisition of the nfl rights also quickly led toward the network reaching an affiliation deal with new world communications to change the affiliations of twelve of its stations to fox (see above) the rights gave fox many new viewers and a platform for advertising its other programs
with a sports division now established with the arrival of the nfl fox acquired broadcast television rights to the national hockey league (199499) major league baseball (since 1996) and nascar auto racing (since 2001 initially as part of a deal that also involved nbc and tnt) from 2007 to 2010 fox aired college football games that were part of the bowl championship series except for the rose bowl whose rights remained with abc the package also included the bcs national championship game with the exception of the 2010 event (as that game was played at the rose bowl stadium)
in august 2011 fox and mixed martial arts promotion ultimate fighting championship (ufc) reached a multi-year agreement which included the rights to broadcast four live events in prime time or late night annually marking the first time that the ufc aired its events on broadcast television its first ufc on fox event velasquez vs dos santos aired on november 12 2011
== stations ==
as of march 2015 fox has 18 owned-and-operated stations and current and pending affiliation agreements with 219 additional television stations encompassing 48 states the district of columbia and three u.s possessions through its fox television stations subsidiary fox has the most owned-and-operated stations of the major american commercial broadcast networks the network has a national reach of 95.15% of all households in the united states (or 297,314,557 americans with at least one television set) currently new jersey and delaware are the only u.s states where fox does not have a locally licensed affiliate (the former is served by new york city o&o wnyw and philadelphia o&o wtxf while the latter is served by wtxf and salisbury maryland affiliate wboc-dt2)
fox largely discontinued analog broadcasts on june 12 2009 as part of the transition to digital television as a newer broadcast network fox still has a number of low-power affiliates that broadcast in analog covering markets like youngstown ohio (wyfx-ld) in some markets including both of the ones mentioned these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed television station fox also maintains a sizeable number of subchannel-only affiliations in cities located outside of the 50 largest nielsen-designated markets that do not have enough full-power stations to support a standalone affiliation and/or have a low-power station as the only other option as an affiliate the largest subchannel-only fox affiliate by market size is wggb-dt2 in springfield massachusetts
currently outside of fox's core o&o group tribune broadcasting is fox's largest affiliate group in terms of overall market reach with fourteen stations (including some former fox o&os that were spun off in 2008 to local tv which tribune later acquired in 2013 to finance former fox parent news corporation's purchase of the wall street journal) the sinclair broadcast group is the largest operator of fox stations by numerical total owning or providing services to 26 fox-affiliated stations
fox previously distributed its programming in markets that did not have enough stations to support an affiliate via foxnet a cable channel acting as an alternate national feed for small and certain mid-sized u.s markets (generally those within the bottom 110 nielsen media markets) that launched in 1991 and operated until its shutdown on september 12 2006 the channel featured a master schedule of programs acquired from the syndication market and some brokered programming to fill time slots not occupied by fox network programming the concept behind foxnet served as the basis for the wb 100+ station group (launched in september 1998 as the cable-only feed of the wb) and the cw plus (the immediate successor of the wb 100+ which launched in september 2006 as a cable-only/digital multicast feed of the cw) which both allow the customization of localized branding (which foxnet did not allow its cable partners to do) in addition to allowing affiliates to sell local advertising
== differences between fox and the big three networks ==
=== network programming ===
fox's programming schedule differs from the big three networks in several significant ways the network airs its prime time programming for only two hours on monday through saturday evenings and three hours on sundays compared to the three hours on monday through saturdays (from 8:00 to 11:00 p.m.) and four hours on sunday nights (from 7:00 to 11:00 p.m eastern and pacific time) programmed by the three longer-established networks abc cbs and nbc this scheduling is termed as common prime, referring to the programming of prime time content across all of the conventional broadcast networks during the early- and mid-evening hours while the 10:00 p.m (eastern) hour is programmed only by the three older networks
fox has traditionally avoided programming the 10:00 p.m hour choosing to cede the time period to its local affiliates for them to program many of which air local newscasts during that hour however some exceptions do exist for select special film presentations which by virtue of their running time (depending on whether the film's original length combined with commercial breaks that would be included in the television cut would exceed a traditional two-hour broadcast timeslot) must spill over into the 10:00 p.m hour and overruns from live sports telecasts scheduled to air during prime time however the network did regularly schedule programming in the 10:00 p.m hour on sunday nights from september 1989 to september 1993 (when that specific time period was turned back over to its affiliates) although it never added programming at that hour on any other night fox's original reason for the reduced number of prime time hours was to avoid fulfilling fcc requirements in effect at the time to be considered a network and to be free of resulting regulations although these rules have since been relaxed
despite being a major network in addition to not carrying national morning and evening newscasts fox also does not air any network daytime programming (such as soap operas game shows or talk shows) because of this the network's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates handle the responsibility of programming daytime hours with syndicated and/or locally produced programming (corporate sister 20th television distributes several syndicated daytime programs carried by many fox stations such as divorce court and the wendy williams show fox television stations also test markets certain series from 20th television and other syndicators such as warner bros television distribution that are proposed for national distribution on some of its stations) the network also does not carry network-supplied children's programming on saturday mornings or late-night programming on monday through friday nights local affiliates either produce their own programming and/or run syndicated programs during these time periods because of the erratic scheduling of the network's sports programming many fox stations choose to run a mix of syndicated programming infomercials and especially movies to fill weekend afternoon timeslots when a sports event is not scheduled to air
in addition from the network's inception fox has produced two versions of its program promotions for distribution to the network's stations a standard version incorporating airtimes based on their broadcast in the eastern/central or pacific/mountain time zones depending on the feed used by the station (as those seen during network commercial breaks) and versions with clean end tags to allow stations to include local airtime and station information through graphical insertion and verbal continuity by station promotional announcers during the program logo graphic or prime time menu this practice which differs from that long used by abc nbc and cbs which only allow their stations to insert logos within their network promotions was also later adopted by the wb and upn (and their successors the cw and to a lesser extent mynetworktv) for use by their affiliated stations
=== news programming ===
within fox's station body the quantity of locally produced news programming varies considerably compared to the owned-and-operated and affiliated stations of abc nbc and cbs (which typically carry at least 4 hours of local newscasts on weekdays and one hour on weekends which are usually spread across morning midday early and/or late evening timeslots) at minimum most fox stations run a late-evening newscast following the network's prime time lineup (at 10:00 p.m in the eastern and pacific and 9:00 p.m in the central and mountain time zones) which typically run 30 minutes to one hour in length besides the fact that the network's stations have more latitude to air an earlier late-evening newscast since fox does not program that hour this stems from the fact that several of its charter stations were already airing prime time newscasts as independent stations prior to the network's launch (such as new york city o&o wnyw which debuted its 10:00 p.m newscast in march 1967) most fox stations also carry a weekday morning newscast of one to three hours in length at 7:00 a.m. as a local alternative to the national morning news programs provided by the big three networks (though mainly in the case of fox stations that have a news operation and in a few cases via simulcasts with abc- nbc- and cbs-affiliated stations that operate a fox affiliate this is often part of a morning news block that runs for four to six hours on average)
fox has fewer stations that have an independent news operation than those of abc nbc and cbs as of october 2015 70 of fox's 236 stations (including all 18 owned-and-operated stations) maintain in-house news departments (compared to roughly - of the stations of each of the three other major broadcast networks whose newscasts are either produced in-house or in conjunction with another station) wjw (channel 8) in cleveland (which was owned by the network from 1997 to 2008) and wxin (channel 59) in indianapolis have the highest weekly total of news programming hours among fox's stations at 65 hours
most fox stations that run a news operation utilize a newscast-intensive scheduling format that is very similar to an abc- nbc- or cbs-affiliated station which in many cases may incorporate midday and/or early-evening newscasts the latter of which is often extended by a half-hour to compete with the national evening newscasts provided by the big three networks some fox stations except for those owned by fox television stations (excluding wfld in chicago the largest fox station and only o&o of the network without an early-evening newscast) and most owned by tribune broadcasting air their early-evening newscasts only on monday through friday nights due to frequent sports event overruns into that daypart on weekends the first fox station to adopt such a scheduling format was wsvn in miami upon affiliating with the network in january 1989 wsvn retained its existing morning midday and early evening newscasts while moving its late newscast from 11:00 to 10:00 p.m and expanding it to one hour (the station later relaunched an 11:00 p.m newscast in 1995) and expanding its weekday morning newscast by two hours this type of format was later adopted by the former major network stations that switched to fox between 1994 and 1996 especially those affected by new world and burnham broadcasting affiliation deals many fox stations with upstart news departments often do not run a full slate of newscasts initially usually carrying only a prime time newscast at first before gradually adding other newscasts over time
in several markets (largely those ranked outside of the 50 largest nielsen-designated television markets) production of the local fox affiliate's newscasts is outsourced to an nbc abc or cbs station either due to insufficient funds or studio space for a news department or in most cases as a byproduct of the station being operated through a legal duopoly or a management agreement with a major network affiliate (such as with esteem broadcasting-owned wemt (channel 39) in greeneville tennessee which has its newscasts produced by nbc affiliate wcyb-tv (channel 5) through a local marketing agreement with bonten media group) fox affiliates that outsource their news production to a major-network affiliate often carry a lesser amount of news programming than is possible with an affiliate with a standalone news department due to the contracting station's preference to avoid having the fox station's newscasts compete against their own in common timeslots (differing from outsourcing agreements between two same-market abc cbs or nbc affiliates in certain areas in which both stations may simulcast newscasts in the same timeslots) the lone exceptions to this rule currently are el paso texas affiliate kfox-tv (channel 14) and wxin which respectively began producing newscasts for their cbs-affiliated duopoly partners using resources from their existing news departments in september 2014 (when new sister stations kfox and kdbc-tv (channel 4) consolidated their operations into a single facility) and january 2015 (when wxin sister wttv (channel 4) affiliated with cbs) with the fox stations maintaining the same amount of news programming that they did beforehand
wpgh-tv (channel 53) in pittsburgh is the largest fox station by nielsen market ranking (at #23) that outsources its news programming nbc affiliate wpxi (channel 11 owned by cox media group) has produced the station's 10:00 p.m newscast since 2006 when wpgh shut down its news department following the closure of owner sinclair broadcast group's news central division a few fox affiliates only air syndicated programming in time periods where newscasts would air on other major network stations the largest fox station by market size that does not carry news programming is wsyt (channel 68) in syracuse new york (which discontinued a 10:00 p.m newscast produced by cbs affiliate wtvh (channel 5) in 2006) krbk (channel 49) in springfield missouri is the largest fox station without full-scale newscasts (since the program debuted in 2013 it carries only a ten-minute newscast on weeknights which was originally bookended by fox and mynetworktv's respective prime time lineups until the latter service moved its affiliation to former fox station kozl-tv in september 2014)
== related services ==
=== video-on-demand services ===
fox maintains several video on demand venues for viewers to watch the network's programming including a traditional vod service called fox on demand which is carried on most traditional cable and telco providers fox parent 21st century fox is also a part-owner of the streaming video service hulu and offers most of the network's programming through hulu's website and mobile app along with traditional streaming via the network's full episode portal on fox.com
the most recent episodes of the network's shows are usually made available on the fox on demand television service the day after their original broadcast in addition fast forwarding capabilities are disabled while viewing content (a commonality for video-on-demand television services provided by the u.s broadcast networks) and the program's original advertisements that aired during the initial broadcast are included for a week after becoming available on the service before being replaced by direct response advertising thereafter due to restrictions put in place by the network in january 2012 to encourage live or same-week dvr viewing via traditional and cable on demand methods hulu and fox.com both impose an eight-day delay for most viewers to access the most recent episode of any fox program restricting day-after-air streaming of its shows on both services to subscribers of certain pay television providers (such as dish network and verizon fios) using an isp account through agreements made with fox however hulu offers newer episodes of fox programs the day after their original broadcast to subscribers of its hulu plus service requiring only a user-determined login
=== fox hd ===
fox began broadcasting its programming in 720p high definition on september 12 2004 with that day's slate of nfc football games during week one of the 2004 nfl season the network does not display a on-screen logo graphic on the bottom-right corner of the screen outside of a ten-second sweep of a fox hd promotional logo (which until the end of 2010 also featured a sponsor tag for directv) instead a trigger in fox's program delivery system at each station displays the logo bug of an owned-and-operated or affiliate station in the right-hand corner of the 16:9 screen frame which disappears during commercial breaks (the station logo bug will still be triggered even if fox programming is pre-empted locally due to breaking news severe weather coverage or special programming though some stations such as wggb-dt2 in springfield massachusetts do not display a logo or substitute only the fox logo alone) however network or affiliate bugs are not displayed during fox sports programming during some high-profile or live programs such as american idol and so you think you can dance however fox forgoes the affiliate's logo and displays its network logo instead mainly for promotional consideration due to fair use of clips from each series by other media outlets (such as news programs talk shows and review and satirical programs that rely on clip content) until 2014 the bug was placed in the 4:3 safe area the sunday political talk program fox news sunday displays the fox hd logo at all times for both that reason and because of many stations airing the program on tape delay later in the morning
on some fox programs a hashtag rests above the affiliate's logo (for example #newgirl or #bones) to provide viewers reference to the network's official twitter search tag to find or start discussions during the program being broadcast in april 2012 additional tags relating to plot points in a given episode (for instance the #saturdaynightgleever tag for an april 2012 episode of glee of that same title) began to also be promoted in this space to both add additional trending topics and spread out more conversations on twitter in cases where the fox bug appears instead of the station's logo bug the twitter hashtag is directly above the fox logo in the safe area
during the transitional period from analog to digital television fox was the only commercial television network in the u.s to air programs in widescreen that were not available in hd (which were identified as being presented in fox high resolution widescreen from 2001 to 2006) prior to the launch of its hd feed some sitcoms and drama series were presented in widescreen standard-definition with reality talk and game shows (american idol being the first major exception as it began to be presented in high definition in 2008) later being presented only in widescreen enhanced definition the children's sports program this week in baseball began airing in widescreen in 2009 while fox news sunday converted to hd when fox news channel began operating from its new high-definition facilities in november 2008 (prior to fox news channel's conversion to a unified widescreen presentation on both its high-definition and standard-definition feeds in september 2010 it was the final fox news program to structure its graphics and camera positions for the 4:3 safe area) madtv was produced to air only in 4:3 until september 2008 likely due to a combination of stations tape delaying the program and therefore being unable to offer it via the live network feed in 16:9 and the show's producers not making the switch to the format the final fox show to convert to hd was family guy beginning with its september 26 2010 episode all programming provided by fox except for the weekend marketplace block is now broadcast in widescreen and in high definition as of 2013
fox is unique among u.s broadcasters as it distributes its hd feed over satellite to the network's affiliates as an mpeg transport stream intended to be delivered bit-for-bit for broadcast transmission during network programming hours local commercials are inserted over the feed using a transport stream splicer affiliates of most other networks decode compressed satellite network video feeds and then re-encode them for final over-the-air transmission
after fox began broadcasting its sports programming with graphics optimized for 16:9 displays rather than the 4:3 safe area in late july 2010 the network has asked cable and satellite providers to comply and use the #10 active format description flag it now disseminates over fox programming which displays content natively broadcast in 16:9 in a letterboxed format suitable for 4:3 television screens to allow any optimized graphical elements to be displayed in full subsequently a number of fox o&os and affiliates also began disseminating the afd #10 flag over local news and syndicated programs that the stations broadcast in hd and have incorporated graphical elements seen during local programs and on-air promos (as well as logo bugs) optimized for the letterboxed presentation
== branding ==
=== station standardization ===
during the early 1990s fox began having its stations use a branding structure using a combination of the fox name and the station's channel number often followed by the licensed call letters (for instance wnyw in new york city wttg in washington d.c and waga-tv in atlanta georgia are all branded as fox 5") by the mid-to-late 1990s stations minimized their call letters to be just barely readable while still in compliance with fcc identification requirements this marked the start of the trend for other networks to apply such naming schemes especially at cbs which uses the cbs mandate on most of its owned-and-operated stations
the branding scheme has varied in some markets with some fox stations using a city or regional name within the branding instead of the channel number (for example chicago owned-and-operated station wfld branded as fox chicago from 1997 to 2012 and philadelphia o&o wtxf-tv branded as fox philadelphia from 1995 to 2003) a few of the network's stations also minimized use of the fox name opting to use their call letters or a more generic branding (wsvn in miami which has branded as wsvn 7 for general use and (channel) 7 news for its newscasts since it joined the network in january 1989 khon-tv (channel 2) in honolulu which changed its general branding from fox 2 to khon 2 in 2003 wdrb in louisville kentucky which dropped its fox 41 brand in favor of branding by its call letters in september 2011 and kvrr (channel 15) in fargo north dakota which dropped the generic fox branding it used in part due to its network of repeater stations throughout eastern north dakota in favor of branding by its calls in may 2015) similarly most of the stations that switched to fox as a result of its 1994 affiliation deal with new world communications retained their big three-era branding for general and/or news purposes (with a few exceptions such as wjw in cleveland which dropped its cbs-era tv8 and newscenter 8 brands in 1995 in favor of fox is ei8ht as a general brand and ei8ht is news as the title for its newscasts) before conforming to fox's station branding conventions when fox television stations acquired new world in 1997
a particularly unique situation was with ktvu (channel 2) in oakland-san francisco which as a fox affiliate under longtime owner cox enterprises retained its perennial channel 2 brand (with limited references as fox channel 2 by the early 1990s) in 1996 the station rebranded as ktvu fox 2 for general purposes (adding the fox logo on the underside of the top line of its heritage circle laser 2 logo as well) while retaining (ktvu) channel 2 news as the branding for its newscasts fox television stations (which traded wfxt in boston and whbq-tv (channel 13) in memphis station to cox in 2014 in exchange for ktvu and sister station kicu-tv) instituted the ktvu fox 2 branding full-time in february 2015 retaining the circle laser 2 both within the group's standardized boxkite logo and in an alternate version (which would become the primary logo through its de-emphasis of the o&o standardization later that year) placed next to a prominent fox wordmark
starting in 2006 more standardization of the o&os began to take place both on-air and online all of the network's o&os began adopting an on-air look more closely aligned with the fox news channel which included a standardized red white and blue boxkite-style logo augmented by red pillars (which rotated on-air particularly in the logo bugs seen during newscasts) after news corporation's acquisition of the social networking site myspace (which it sold in june 2011 to a consortium that included singer justin timberlake among its backers) some fox o&os launched websites with identical layouts and similar url domains under the myfox scheme (such as myfoxdc.com for wttg) on-air usage of the fnc-inspired logos was reduced in august 2012 (when a new standardized graphics package was implemented with wordmark bugs being used during newscasts and other programming) while several of the o&os ceased using the myfox domains in 2015
=== logos ===
the first official logo introduced by fox when the network inaugurated its programming in october 1986 was a three-square design containing the letters fbc (for fox broadcasting company") which was used during the network's first six months in existence and was primarily featured as a network identification slide at the beginning of the late show with joan rivers on april 5 1987 when the network inaugurated its prime time programming a more familiar logo based on 20th century fox's signature logo design was introduced featuring just the capitalized fox name alongside the familiar trademark searchlights and double-pane platform (fox's owned-and-operated stations used a variant for station identifications from 1987 to 1989 which incorporated both an o and searchlight in negative space the latter of which intersected the x and panes within the otherwise translucent yellow/gold logo until as late as the mid-1990s some fox affiliates that did not license the regulation network logo used those that imitated the 20th century fox-inspired design in their station logos)
in september 1993 the familiar logo was given a more hip makeover with the fox wordmark overhauled into its current proprietary logotype and the angle changed removing the tilting (the 1987 logo remained in use during the 199394 season in print advertisements featured in tv guide and other television listings magazines) starting with the introduction of this logo the network began displaying an on-screen bug within its programs on the lower right-hand corner of the screen (initially for one minute at the start of each program segment or act eventually being displayed throughout the program outside of commercial breaks before reverting to the former display format regularly upon the 2009 digital transition) the o character also underwent a makeover acquiring its trademark pillar-like bowl which has since become a major focal point for the logo and fox advertising in lieu of the searchlight motif
another revised logo was introduced for the 199596 television season removing the searchlights but retaining the two lower panes and adding a third pane atop the logotype a variant of the original 1993 design was implemented in 1996 excluding the panes underneath the network name but restoring the searchlights placed behind the f and x in the fox wordmark
the current version of the logo was introduced in 1999 removing the searchlights completely and switching the logo exclusively to a wordmark design despite this the searchlight theme remains an integral part of 21st century fox's branding efforts they are still incorporated into fox news channel's logo and the universal station logo introduced in 2006 by fox's owned-and-operated stations which were retained by the seven former o&os that fox television stations sold in 2008 to local tv and had spread to several fox stations owned by tribune broadcasting (including those it acquired through the company's 2013 merger with local tv the logo introduced by the o&os was modified for tribune's fox affiliates in 2012 to feature only one searchlight as part of the company's graphical standardizations for those stations) and certain other fox affiliates not owned or operated by either company the 199699 searchlight logo is still used within the logos of a small number of fox affiliates the searchlights continued to be featured in the logo of sister channel fx until a rebranding effort in 2008
== controversy ==
=== indecency ===
controversy surrounded the network in 2002 and 2003 over obscenities expressed respectively by cher and nicole richie aired live during fox's broadcast of the billboard music awards on its affiliates in the eastern and central time zones despite the use of five-second audio delays the indecent material was edited out when the program was broadcast in other time zones from the mountain time zone westward both of the obscene instances were condemned by the parents television council and named by them among the worst instances on television from 2001 to 2004 ptc members filed tens of thousands of complaints to the federal communications commission regarding the broadcasts a subsequent apology made by fox representatives was labeled a sham by ptc president l brent bozell iii who argued that the network could have easily used an audio delay to edit out the obscene language as the fcc was investigating the broadcasts in 2004 fox announced that it would begin extending live broadcast delays to five minutes from its standard five or ten seconds to more easily be able to edit out obscenities uttered over the air in june 2007 in the case federal communications commission v fox television stations the u.s second circuit court of appeals ruled that the fcc could not issue indecency fines against fox because it does not have the authority to fine broadcasters for fleeting expletives such as in the case of the billboard awards the fcc eventually decided to appeal the second circuit court's finding the u.s supreme court granted certiorari and oral arguments in fcc v fox et al. began november 4 2008
the parents television council has also criticized many popular fox shows for perceived indecent content such as american dad arrested development the simpsons family guy hell's kitchen married with children prison break and that 70s show the council sometimes has gone even as far as to file complaints with the federal communications commission regarding indecent content within fox programming having done so for that 70s show and married by america having successfully been able to get the fcc to fine the network nearly $1 million for its airing of the latter program that fine was reduced to $91,000 in january 2009 after an appeal of the fine by fox was granted as a result of its earlier discovery that the fcc originally claimed to have received 159 complaints regarding the content in married by america it later admitted to only receiving 90 which came from only 23 people a study of the complaints by blogger jeff jarvis deduced that all but two were virtually identical to each other meaning that the $1.2 million judgment was based on original complaints written by a total of only three people
in addition as of 2004 fox programming has been chosen by the ptc for its weekly worst tv show of the week feature more often than programming from any other broadcast network
