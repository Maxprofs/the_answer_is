religious conversion is the adoption of a set of beliefs identified with one particular religious denomination to the exclusion of others thus religious conversion would describe the abandoning of adherence to one denomination and affiliating with another this might be from one to another denomination within the same religion for example christian baptist to methodist or catholic muslim shi'a to sunni in some cases religious conversion marks a transformation of religious identity and is symbolized by special rituals
people convert to a different religion for various reasons including active conversion by free choice due to a change in beliefs secondary conversion deathbed conversion conversion for convenience and marital conversion and forced conversion such as conversion by violence or charity
conversion or reaffiliation for convenience is an insincere act sometimes for relatively trivial reasons such as a parent converting to enable a child to be admitted to a good school associated with a religion or a person adopting a religion more in keeping with the social class he or she aspires to when people marry one spouse may convert to the religion of the other
forced conversion is adoption of a different religion under duress the convert may secretly retain the previous beliefs and continue covertly with the practices of the original religion while outwardly maintaining the forms of the new religion over generations a family forced against their will to convert may wholeheartedly adopt the new religion
proselytism is the act of attempting to convert by persuasion another individual from a different religion or belief system (see proselyte)
apostate is a term used by members of a religion or denomination to refer to someone who has left that religion or denomination

==== procedureedit ====
jewish law has a number of requirements of potential converts they should desire conversion to judaism for its own sake and for no other motives a male convert needs to undergo a ritual circumcision conducted according to jewish law (if already circumcised a needle is used to draw a symbolic drop of blood while the appropriate blessings are said) and there has to be a commitment to observe jewish law a convert must join the jewish community and reject the previous theology he or she had prior to the conversion ritual immersion in a small pool of water known as a mikvah is required
==== historyedit ====
in hellenistic and roman times some pharisees were eager proselytizers and had at least some success throughout the empire
some jews are also descended from converts to judaism outside the mediterranean world it is known that some khazars edomites and ethiopians as well as many arabs particularly in yemen the word proselyte originally meant a greek who had converted to judaism as late as the 6th century the eastern roman empire and caliph umar ibn khattab were issuing decrees against conversion to judaism implying that this was still occurring
=== christianityedit ===
conversion to christianity is the religious conversion of a previously non-christian person to some form of christianity the exact requirements vary between different churches and denominations however all schools of thought in christianity agree that baptism is a compulsory prerequisite baptism mentioned in the bible jesus christ was baptized at the beginning of his ministry and prior to that event john the baptist had been baptizing jewish believers as a sign of repentance though not of conversion per se as an example to us these events suggest that baptism is an outward symbol of an inward change following the awakening at antioch (acts ch.8 ff see also acts 2:38) pagans and infidels were required to undergo christian baptism to be ultimately accepted in the kingdom of god compare christian baptism with jewish immersion by mikvah prior to that awakening all converts to christianity were ethnic and religious jews
converting to catholicism involves religious education followed by initial participation in the sacraments which are baptism confession penance and communion in general conversion to christian faith primarily involves repentance for sin and a decision to live a life that is holy and acceptable to god through faith in the atoning death and resurrection of jesus christ all of this is essentially done through a voluntary exercise of the will of the individual concerned true conversion to christianity is thus a personal internal matter and can never be forced
christians consider that conversion requires internalization of the new belief system it implies a new reference point for the convert's self-identity and is a matter of belief and social structureof both faith and affiliation this typically entails the sincere avowal of a new belief system but may also present itself in other ways such as adoption into an identity group or spiritual lineage
==== baptismedit ====
catholics and orthodox denominations encourage infant baptism before children are aware of their status in roman catholicism and certain high church forms of protestantism baptized children are expected to participate in confirmation classes as pre-teens in eastern orthodoxy the equivalent of confirmation chrismation is administered to all converts adult and infant alike immediately after baptism
methods of baptism include immersion sprinkling (aspersion) and pouring (affusion) baptism received by adults or younger people who have reached the age of accountability where they can make a personal religious decision is referred to as believer's baptism among conservative or evangelical protestant groups it is intended as a public statement of a person's prior decision to become a christian some christian groups such as catholics churches of christ and christadelphians believe baptism is essential to salvation
==== accepting christ and renouncing sinedit ====
conversion derives from the latin conversin-em literally meaning turning round and figuratively meaning a change in character change of heart metanoia and regeneration are among the synonyms for conversion conversion is therefore more than a mere change in religious identity but a change in nature (regeneration) evidenced by a change in values jesus demands metnoia (conversion) to become a good tree that bears good fruit (matthew 7:1718 [luke 6:43])
according to christianity a convert renounces sin as worthless and treasures instead the supreme worth of christ in jesus sacrificial death and resurrection christian conversion is a deeply personal matter it entails changes in thinking priorities and commitments a whole new direction in one's life
because conversion is a change in values that embraces god and rejects sin it includes a personal commitment to a life of holiness as described by paul of tarsus and exemplified by jesus in some protestant traditions this is called accepting christ as one's savior and following him as lord. in another variation the 1910 catholic dictionary defines conversion as one who turns or changes from a state of sin to repentance from a lax to a more earnest and serious way of life from unbelief to faith from heresy to the true faith. the eastern orthodox understanding of conversion is illustrated in the rite of baptism in which the convert faces west while publicly renouncing and symbolically spitting upon satan and then turns to the east to worship christ as king and god
==== responsibilitiesedit ====
in the new testament jesus commanded his disciples in the great commission to go and make disciples of all nations ([matthew 28:19] [mark 16:15]) evangelizationsharing the gospel message or good news in deed and word is an expectation of christians
==== reaffiliationedit ====
transferring from one christian denomination to another may consist of a relatively simple transfer of membership especially if moving from one trinitarian denomination to another and if the person has received water baptism in the name of the trinity if not then the person may be required to be baptized or rebaptized before acceptance by the new church some denominations such as those in the anabaptist tradition require previously baptized christians to be re-baptized the eastern orthodox church treats a transfer from another denomination of christianity to orthodoxy (conceived of as the one true church) as a category of conversion and repentance though re-baptism is not always required
the process of conversion to christianity varies somewhat among christian denominations most protestants believe in conversion by faith to attain salvation according to this understanding a person professes faith in jesus christ as god their lord and savior repentance for sin and a holy living are expected of those professing faith in jesus christ while an individual may make such a decision privately usually it entails being baptized and becoming a member of a denomination or church in these traditions a person is considered to become a christian by publicly acknowledging the foundational christian doctrines that jesus christ died was buried and was resurrected for the remission of sins
==== comparison between protestantsedit ====
this table summarizes three protestant beliefs
=== latter day saint movementedit ===
much of the theology of latter day saint baptism was established during the early latter day saint movement founded by joseph smith according to this theology baptism must be by immersion for the remission of sins (meaning that through baptism past sins are forgiven) and occurs after one has shown faith and repentance mormon baptism does not purport to remit any sins other than personal ones as adherents do not believe in original sin latter day saints baptisms also occur only after an age of accountability which is defined as the age of eight years the theology thus rejects infant baptism
in addition latter day saint theology requires that baptism may only be performed with one who has been called and ordained by god with priesthood authority because the churches of the latter day saint movement operate under a lay priesthood children raised in a mormon family are usually baptized by a father or close male friend or family member who has achieved the office of priest which is conferred upon worthy male members at least 16 years old in the lds church
baptism is seen as symbolic both of jesus death burial and resurrection and is also symbolic of the baptized individual putting off of the natural or sinful man and becoming spiritually reborn as a disciple of jesus
membership into a latter day saint church is granted only by baptism whether or not a person has been raised in the church latter day saint churches do not recognize baptisms of other faiths as valid because they believe baptisms must be performed under the church's unique authority thus all who come into one of the latter day saint faiths as converts are baptized even if they have previously received baptism in another faith
when performing a baptism latter day saints say the following prayer before performing the ordinance
having been commissioned of jesus christ i baptize you in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost amen
baptisms inside and outside the temples are usually done in a baptistry although they can be performed in any body of water in which the person may be completely immersed the person administering the baptism must recite the prayer exactly and immerse every part limb hair and clothing of the person being baptized if there are any mistakes or if any part of the person being baptized is not fully immersed the baptism must be redone in addition to the baptizer two priesthood holders witness the baptism to ensure that it is performed properly
following baptism latter day saints receive the gift of the holy ghost by the laying on of hands of a melchizedek priesthood holder
latter day saints hold that one may be baptized after death through the vicarious act of a living individual and holders of the melchezidek priesthood practice baptism for the dead as a missionary ritual this doctrine answers the question of the righteous non-believer and the unevangelized by providing a post-mortem means of repentance and salvation
=== islamedit ===
there are five pillars or foundations of islam but the primary and most important is to believe that there is only one god and creator referred to as allah (the word for the name of god in arabic) and that the islamic prophet muhammad is his final messenger the time of a person's conversion is counted from the moment he or she sincerely makes this declaration of faith called the shahadah
islam teaches that everyone is muslim at birth because every child that is born has a natural inclination to goodness and to worship the one true god alone but the parents or society can cause him/her to deviate from the straight path when someone accepts islam he/she is considered to revert to the original condition while conversion to islam is among its most supported tenets conversion from islam to another religion is considered to be the sin of apostasy in several muslim majority countries apostasy is subject to the death penalty or heavy punishments though the qur'an states (al-ma'idah 5:32) that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely and whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely in islam circumcision is a sunnah custom not mentioned in the qur'an the majority clerical opinion holds that circumcision is not a condition for entering islam the shafi`i and hanbali schools regard it as obligatory while the maliki and hanafi schools regard it as only recommended however it is not a precondition for the acceptance of a person's islamic practices nor does is choice to forgo circumcision considered a sin it is not one of the five pillars of islam or the six fundamentals of belief
according to abul a'la maududi people should accept islam through their own free choice not through compulsion even though maududi believes in the superiority of islam he insists that if persons elect not to embrace islam muslims must avoid placing political or social pressure on them to convert
=== bah faithedit ===
in sharing their faith with others bah's are cautioned to obtain a hearing meaning to make sure the person they are proposing to teach is open to hearing what they have to say bah pioneers rather than attempting to supplant the cultural underpinnings of the people in their adopted communities are encouraged to integrate into the society and apply bah principles in living and working with their neighbors
bah's recognize the divine origins of all revealed religion and believe that these religions occurred sequentially as part of a divine plan (see progressive revelation) with each new revelation superseding and fulfilling that of its predecessors bah's regard their own faith as the most recent (but not the last) and believe its teachings which are centered around the principle of the oneness of humanity are most suited to meeting the needs of a global community
in most countries conversion is a simple matter of filling out a card stating a declaration of belief this includes acknowledgement of bah'u'llah the founder of the faith as the messenger of god for this age awareness and acceptance of his teachings and intention to be obedient to the institutions and laws he established
conversion to the bah faith carries with it an explicit belief in the common foundation of all revealed religion a commitment to the unity of mankind and active service to the community at large especially in areas that will foster unity and concord since the bah faith has no clergy converts to this faith are encouraged to be active in all aspects of community life even a recent convert may be elected to serve on a local spiritual assembly the guiding bah institution at the community level
== indian religionsedit ==
=== hinduismedit ===
since 1800 ce religious conversion from and to hinduism has been a controversial subject within hinduism some have suggested that the concept of missionary conversion either way is contrary to the precepts of hinduism religious leaders of some of hinduism sects such as brahmo samaj have seen hinduism as a non-missionary religion yet welcomed new members while other leaders of hinduism's diverse schools have stated that with the arrival of missionary islam and christianity in india this there is no such thing as proselytism in hinduism view must be re-examined
hinduism is a diverse system of thought with beliefs spanning monotheism polytheism panentheism pantheism pandeism monism and atheism among others hinduism has no traditional ecclesiastical order no centralized religious authorities no universally accepted governing body no prophet(s) no binding holy book nor any mandatory prayer attendance requirements hinduism has been described as a way of life in its diffuse and open structure numerous schools and sects of hinduism have developed and spun off in india with help from its ascetic scholars since the vedic age the six astika and two nastika schools of hindu philosophy in its history did not develop a missionary or proselytization methodology and they co-existed with each other most hindu sub-schools and sects do not actively seek converts individuals have had a choice to enter leave or change their god(s) spiritual convictions accept or discard any rituals and practices and pursue spiritual knowledge and liberation (moksha) in different ways however various schools of hinduism do have some core common beliefs such as the belief that all living beings have atman (soul) a belief in karma theory spirituality ahimsa (non-violence) as the greatest dharma or virtue and others
religious conversion to hinduism has a long history outside india merchants and traders of india particularly from indian peninsula carried their religious ideas which led to religious conversions to hinduism in indonesia vietnam cambodia and burma some sects of hindus particularly of the bhakti schools began seeking or accepting converts in early to mid 20th century for example arya samaj saiva siddhanta church baps and the international society for krishna consciousness accept those who have a desire to follow their sects of hinduism and each has their own religious conversion procedure
in recent decades mainstream hinduism schools have attempted to systematize ways to accept religious converts with an increase in inter-religious mixed marriages the steps involved in becoming a hindu have variously included a period where the interested person gets an informal ardha-hindu name and studies ancient literature on spiritual path and practices (english translations of upanishads agamas epics ethics in sutras festivals yoga) if after a period of study the individual still wants to convert a namakarana samskaras ceremony is held where the individual adopts a traditional hindu name the initiation ceremony may also include yajna (i.e. fire ritual with sanskrit hymns) under guidance of a local hindu priest some of these places are mathas and asramas (hermitage monastery) where one or more gurus (spiritual guide) conduct the conversion and offer spiritual discussions some schools encourage the new convert to learn and participate in community activities such as festivals (diwali etc) read and discuss ancient literature learn and engage in rites of passages (ceremonies of birth first feeding first learning day age of majority wedding cremation and others)
=== sikhismedit ===
sikhism is not known to openly proselytize but accepts converts
=== jainismedit ===
jainism accepts anyone who wants to embrace the religion there is no specific ritual for becoming a jain one does not need to ask any authorities for admission one becomes a jain on one's own by observing the five vows (vratas) the five main vows as mentioned in the ancient jain texts like tattvarthasutra are
ahimsa- not to injure any living being by actions and thoughts
satya- not to lie or speak words that hurt others
asteya- not to take anything if not given
brahmacharya- chastity for householders / celibacy in action words & thoughts for monks and nuns
aparigraha (non-possession)- non-attachment to possessions
following the five vows is the main requirement in jainism all other aspects such as visiting temples are secondary jain monks and nuns are required to observe these five vows strictly
=== buddhismedit ===
persons newly adhering to buddhism traditionally take refuge (express faith in the three jewelsbuddha dharma and sangha) before a monk nun or similar representative but cultural or secular buddhists often hold multiple religious identities combining the religion with some east asian religions in different countries and ethnics such as
throughout the timeline of buddhism conversions of entire countries and regions to buddhism were frequent as buddhism spread throughout asia for example in the 11th century in burma king anoratha converted his entire country to theravada buddhism at the end of the 12th century jayavarman vii set the stage for conversion of the khmer people to theravada buddhism mass conversions of areas and communities to buddhism occur up to the present day for example in the dalit buddhist movement in india there have been organized mass conversions
exceptions to encouraging conversion may occur in some buddhist movements in tibetan buddhism for example the current dalai lama discourages active attempts to win converts
== other religions and sectsedit ==
in the second half of the 20th century the rapid growth of new religious movements (nrms) led some psychologists and other scholars to propose that these groups were using brainwashing or mind control techniques to gain converts this theory was publicized by the popular news media but disputed by other scholars including some sociologists of religion
in the 1960s sociologist john lofland lived with unification church missionary young oon kim and a small group of american church members in california and studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win converts to their church lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members often family relationships lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled the world savers a field study of cult processes and in 1966 in book form by prentice-hall as doomsday cult a study of conversion proselytization and maintenance of faith it is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of religious conversion and one of the first modern sociological studies of a new religious movement
the church of scientology attempts to gain converts by offering free stress tests it has also used the celebrity status of some of its members (most famously the american actor tom cruise) to attract converts the church of scientology requires that all converts sign a legal waiver which covers their relationship with the church of scientology before engaging in scientology services
research in the united states and the netherlands has shown a positive correlation between areas lacking mainstream churches and the percentage of people who are a member of a new religious movement this applies also for the presence of new age centres
on the other end of the scale are religions that do not accept any converts or do so very rarely often these are relatively small close-knit minority religions that are ethnically based such as the yazidis druze and mandaeans zoroastrianism classically does not accept converts but this issue has become controversial in the 20th century due to the rapid decline in membership chinese traditional religion lacks clear criteria for membership and hence for conversion the shakers and some indian eunuch brotherhoods do not allow procreation so that every member is a convert
== international lawedit ==
the united nations universal declaration of human rights defines religious conversion as a human right everyone has the right to freedom of thought conscience and religion this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief (article 18) despite this un-declared human right some groups forbid or restrict religious conversion (see below)
based on the declaration the united nations commission on human rights (unchr) drafted the international covenant on civil and political rights a legally binding treaty it states that everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought conscience and religion this right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice (article 18.1) no one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice (article 18.2)
the unchr issued a general comment on this article in 1993 the committee observes that the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views [...] article 18.2 bars coercion that would impair the right to have or adopt a religion or belief including the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers to adhere to their religious beliefs and congregations to recant their religion or belief or to convert. (ccpr/c/21/rev.1/add.4 general comment no 22. emphasis added)
some countries distinguish voluntary motivated conversion from organized proselytism attempting to restrict the latter the boundary between them is not easily defined what one person considers legitimate evangelizing or witness-bearing another may consider intrusive and improper illustrating the problems that can arise from such subjective viewpoints is this extract from an article by dr c davis published in cleveland state university's journal of law and health according to the union of american hebrew congregations jews for jesus and hebrew christians constitute two of the most dangerous cults and its members are appropriate candidates for deprogramming anti-cult evangelicals  protest that aggressiveness and proselytizing  are basic to authentic christianity, and that jews for jesus and campus crusade for christ are not to be labeled as cults furthermore certain hassidic groups who physically attacked a meeting of the hebrew christian cult have themselves been labeled a cult and equated with the followers of reverend moon by none other than the president of the central conference of american rabbis.
since the collapse of the former soviet union the russian orthodox church has enjoyed a revival however it takes exception to what it considers illegitimate proselytizing by the roman catholic church the salvation army jehovah's witnesses and other religious movements in what it refers to as its canonical territory
greece has a long history of conflict mostly with jehovah's witnesses but also with some pentecostals over its laws on proselytism this situation stems from a law passed in the 1930s by the dictator ioannis metaxas a jehovah's witness minos kokkinakis won the equivalent of $14,400 in damages from the greek state after being arrested for trying to preach his faith from door to door in another case larissis v greece a member of the pentecostal church also won a case in the european court of human rights
some islamic countries with islamic law outlaw and carry strict sentences for proselytizing several islamic countries under islamic lawsaudi arabia yemen afghanistan pakistan egypt iran and maldivesoutlaw apostasy and carry imprisonment or the death penalty for those leaving islam and those enticing muslims to leave islam also induced religious conversions in the indian states orissa has resulted in communal riots
