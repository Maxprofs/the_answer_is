mechanical wavesedit
seismology several types surface waves encountered surface waves mechanical sense commonly known either love waves l waves rayleigh waves seismic wave wave travels earth often result earthquake explosion love waves transverse motion movement perpendicular direction travel like light waves whereas rayleigh waves longitudinal movement parallel direction travel like sound waves transverse motion seismic waves studied seismologists measured seismograph seismometer surface waves span wide frequency range period waves damaging usually seconds longer surface waves travel around globe many times largest earthquakes surface waves caused p waves waves come surface
term surface wave describe waves ocean even approximated airy functions properly called creeping waves examples waves surface water air ocean surface waves ripples sand interface water air another example internal waves transmitted along interface two water masses different densities

radio propagationedit
lower frequencies mhz travel efficiently ground waves strongly diffracted around obstacles due long wavelengths allowing follow earths curvature earth one refractive index atmosphere another thus constituting interface supports surface wave transmission ground waves propagate vertical polarization magnetic field horizontal electric field close vertical vlf ionosphere earths surface act waveguide
conductivity surface affects propagation ground waves conductive surfaces sea water providing better propagation increasing conductivity surface results less dissipation refractive indices subject spatial temporal changes since ground perfect electrical conductor ground waves attenuated follow earths surface wavefronts initially vertical ground acting lossy dielectric causes wave tilt forward travels directs energy earth dissipated signal decreases exponentially
longdistance low frequency lf longwave radio communication khz khz result groundwave propagation mediumwave radio transmissions frequencies khz khz including broadcast band travel groundwaves longer distances night skywaves ground losses become lower lower frequencies greatly increasing coverage stations using lower end band vlf lf frequencies mostly used military communications especially ships submarines lower frequency better waves penetrate sea water even extremely low frequency waves khz used communicate deeply submerged submarines
surface waves used overthehorizon radar operates mainly frequencies mhz sea sufficiently high conductivity convey surface waves reasonable distance km overhorizon radar also uses skywave propagation much greater distances development radio surface waves used extensively early commercial professional radio services relied exclusively long wave low frequencies groundwave propagation prevent interference services amateur experimental transmitters restricted higher hf frequencies felt useless since groundwave range limited upon discovery propagation modes possible medium wave short wave frequencies advantages hf commercial military purposes became apparent amateur experimentation confined authorized frequencies range
