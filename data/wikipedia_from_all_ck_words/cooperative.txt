a co-operative ("co-op or cooperative coop") is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise cooperatives include non-profit community organizations and businesses that are owned and managed by the people who use their services (a consumer cooperative) or by the people who work there (a worker cooperative) or by the people who live there (a housing cooperative) hybrids such as worker cooperatives that are also consumer cooperatives or credit unions multi-stakeholder cooperatives such as those that bring together civil society and local actors to deliver community needs and second and third tier cooperatives whose members are other cooperatives
in short a co-op is defined as a jointly owned enterprise engaging in the production or distribution of goods or the supplying of services operated by its members for their mutual benefit typically organized by consumers or farmers. co-operatives frequently have social goals which they aim to accomplish by investing a proportion of trading profits back into their communities as an example of this in 2013 retail co-operatives in the uk invested 6.9% of their pre-tax profits in the communities in which they trade as compared with 2.4% for other rival supermarkets
the international co-operative alliance was the first international association formed by the cooperative movement it includes the world council of credit unions a second organization was formed later in germany the international raiffeisen union in the united states the national cooperative business association (ncba) serves as the sector's oldest national membership association it is dedicated to ensuring that cooperative businesses have the same opportunities as other businesses operating in the country and that consumers have access to cooperatives in the marketplace a u.s national cooperative bank was formed in the 1970s by 2004 a new association focused on worker co-ops was founded the united states federation of worker cooperatives
in 2012 the turnover of the largest 300 co-operatives in the world reached $2.2 trillion which if they were a country would make them the seventh largest
== originsedit ==
cooperation dates back as far as human beings have been organizing for mutual benefit tribes were organized as cooperative structures allocating jobs and resources among each other only trading with the external communities in alpine environments trade could only be maintained in organized cooperatives to achieve a useful condition of artificial roads such as viamala in 1472 pre-industrial europe is home to the first cooperatives from an industrial context
in 1761 the fenwick weavers society was formed in fenwick east ayrshire scotland to sell discounted oatmeal to local workers its services expanded to include assistance with savings and loans emigration and education in 1810 welsh social reformer robert owen from newtown in mid-wales and his partners purchased new lanark mill from owen's father-in-law david dale and proceeded to introduce better labour standards including discounted retail shops where profits were passed on to his employees owen left new lanark to pursue other forms of cooperative organization and develop co-op ideas through writing and lecture cooperative communities were set up in glasgow indiana and hampshire although ultimately unsuccessful in 1828 william king set up a newspaper the cooperator to promote owen's thinking having already set up a co-operative store in brighton.
the rochdale society of equitable pioneers founded in 1844 is usually considered the first successful cooperative enterprise used as a model for modern co-ops following the rochdale principles a group of 28 weavers and other artisans in rochdale england set up the society to open their own store selling food items they could not otherwise afford within ten years there were over 1,000 cooperative societies in the united kingdom
other events such as the founding of a friendly society by the tolpuddle martyrs in 1832 were key occasions in the creation of organized labor and consumer movements
== social economyedit ==
co-operatives traditionally combine social benefit interests with capitalistic property-right interests co-operatives achieve a mix of social and capital purposes by democratically governing distribution questions by and between equal controlling members democratic oversight of decisions to equitably distribute assets and other benefits means capital ownership is arranged in a way for social benefit inside the organization external societal benefit is also encouraged by incorporating the operating-principle of cooperation between co-operatives in the final year of the 20th century cooperatives banded together to establish a number of social enterprise agencies which have moved to adopt the multi-stakeholder cooperative model in the years 19942009 the eu and its member nations gradually revised national accounting systems to make visible the increasing contribution of social economy organizations
== organizational and ideological rootsedit ==
the roots of the cooperative movement can be traced to multiple influences and extend worldwide in the anglosphere post-feudal forms of cooperation between workers and owners that are expressed today as profit-sharing and surplus sharing arrangements existed as far back as 1795 the key ideological influence on the anglosphere branch of the cooperative movement however was a rejection of the charity principles that underpinned welfare reforms when the british government radically revised its poor laws in 1834 as both state and church institutions began to routinely distinguish between the deserving and undeserving poor a movement of friendly societies grew throughout the british empire based on the principle of mutuality committed to self-help in the welfare of working people
friendly societies established forums through which one member one vote was practiced in organisation decision-making the principles challenged the idea that a person should be an owner of property before being granted a political voice throughout the second half of the nineteenth century (and then repeatedly every 20 years or so) there has been a surge in the number of cooperative organisations both in commercial practice and civil society operating to advance democracy and universal suffrage as a political principle friendly societies and consumer cooperatives became the dominant form of organization amongst working people in anglosphere industrial societies prior to the rise of trade unions and industrial factories weinbren reports that by the end of the 19th century over 80% of british working age men and 90% of australian working age men were members of one or more friendly society
from the mid-nineteenth century mutual organisations embraced these ideas in economic enterprises firstly amongst tradespeople and later in cooperative stores educational institutes financial institutions and industrial enterprises the common thread (enacted in different ways and subject to the constraints of various systems of national law) is the principle that an enterprise or association should be owned and controlled by the people it serves and share any surpluses on the basis of each member's cooperative contribution (as a producer labourer or consumer) rather than their capacity to invest financial capital
the cooperative movement has been fueled globally by ideas of economic democracy economic democracy is a socioeconomic philosophy that suggests an expansion of decision-making power from a small minority of corporate shareholders to a larger majority of public stakeholders there are many different approaches to thinking about and building economic democracy anarchists are committed to libertarian socialism and have focused on local organization including locally managed cooperatives linked through confederations of unions cooperatives and communities marxists who as socialists have likewise held and worked for the goal of democratizing productive and reproductive relationships often placed a greater strategic emphasis on confronting the larger scales of human organization as they viewed the capitalist class to be politically militarily and culturally mobilized for the purpose of maintaining an exploitable working class they fought in the early 20th century to appropriate from the capitalist class the society's collective political capacity in the form of the state either through democratic socialism or through what came to be known as leninism though they regard the state as an unnecessarily oppressive institution marxists considered appropriating national and international-scale capitalist institutions and resources (such as the state) to be an important first pillar in creating conditions favorable to solidaristic economies with the declining influence of the ussr after the 1960s socialist strategies pluralized though economic democratizers have not as yet established a fundamental challenge to the hegemony of global neoliberal capitalism

some members to have a greater share of the control or
some investors to have a return on their capital that exceeds fixed interest
neither of which may be allowed under local laws for cooperatives cooperatives often share their earnings with the membership as dividends which are divided among the members according to their participation in the enterprise such as patronage instead of according to the value of their capital shareholdings (as is done by a joint stock company)

capital and the debt trap reports that [c]ooperatives tend to have a longer life than other types of enterprise and thus a higher level of entrepreneurial sustainability in [one study] the rate of survival of cooperatives after three years was 75 percent whereas it was only 48 percent for all enterprises  [and] after ten years 44 percent of cooperatives were still in operation whereas the ratio was only 20 percent for all enterprises (p 109) cooperative banks build up counter-cyclical buffers that function well in case of a crisis, and are less likely to lead members and clients towards a debt trap (p 216) this is explained by their more democratic governance that reduces perverse incentives and subsequent contributions to economic bubbles

like other business creation support schemes bec's enable budding entrepreneurs to experiment with their business idea while benefiting from a secure income the innovation becs introduce is that once the business is established the entrepreneur is not forced to leave and set up independently but can stay and become a full member of the cooperative the micro-enterprises then combine to form one multi-activity enterprise whose members provide a mutually supportive environment for each other
becs thus provide budding business people with an easy transition from inactivity to self-employment but in a collective framework they open up new horizons for people who have ambition but who lack the skills or confidence needed to set off entirely on their own or who simply want to carry on an independent economic activity but within a supportive group context

members of a building cooperative (in britain known as a self-build housing cooperative) pool resources to build housing normally using a high proportion of their own labor when the building is finished each member is the sole owner of a homestead and the cooperative may be dissolved
this collective effort was at the origin of many of britain's building societies which however developed into permanent mutual savings and loan organisations a term which persisted in some of their names (such as the former leeds permanent) nowadays such self-building may be financed using a step-by-step mortgage which is released in stages as the building is completed.the term may also refer to worker cooperatives in the building trade

=== credit unions cooperative banking and co-operative insuranceedit ===
credit unions are cooperative financial institutions that are owned and controlled by their members credit unions provide the same financial services as banks but are considered not-for-profit organizations and adhere to cooperative principles
credit unions originated in mid-19th century germany through the efforts of pioneers franz herman schulze'delitzch and friedrich wilhelm raiffeisen the concept of financial cooperatives crossed the atlantic at the turn of the 20th century when the caisse populaire movement was started by alphonse desjardins in quebec canada in 1900 from his home in lvis he opened north america's first credit union marking the beginning of the mouvement desjardins eight years later desjardins provided guidance for the first credit union in the united states where there are now about 7,950 active status federally insured credit unions with almost 90 million members and more than $679 billion on deposit

=== federal or secondary cooperativesedit ===
in some cases cooperative societies find it advantageous to form cooperative federations in which all of the members are themselves cooperatives historically these have predominantly come in the form of cooperative wholesale societies and cooperative unions cooperative federations are a means through which cooperative societies can fulfill the sixth rochdale principle cooperation among cooperatives with the ica noting that cooperatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the cooperative movement by working together through local national regional and international structures.
==== cooperative wholesale societyedit ====
according to cooperative economist charles gide the aim of a cooperative wholesale society is to arrange bulk purchases and if possible organise production. the best historical example of this was the english cws and the scottish cws which were the forerunners to the modern co-operative group today its national buying programme the co-operative retail trading group performs a similar function
==== cooperative unionedit ====
a second common form of cooperative federation is a cooperative union whose objective (according to gide) is to develop the spirit of solidarity among societies and in a word to exercise the functions of a government whose authority it is needless to say is purely moral. co-operatives uk and the international cooperative alliance are examples of such arrangements
==== cooperative political movementsedit ====
in some countries with a strong cooperative sector such as the uk cooperatives may find it advantageous to form political groupings to represent their interests the british cooperative party the canadian cooperative commonwealth federation and united farmers of alberta are prime examples of such arrangements
the british cooperative movement formed the cooperative party in the early 20th century to represent members of consumers cooperatives in parliament which was the first of its kind the cooperative party now has a permanent electoral pact with the labour party meaning someone cannot be a member if they support a party other than labour an alternative grouping the conservative co-operative movement is open to people of all parties or none plaid cymru also run a credit union that is constituted as a co-operative called the plaid cymru credit union. uk cooperatives retain a strong market share in food retail insurance banking funeral services and the travel industry in many parts of the country although this is still significicantly lower than other business models
== women in cooperativesedit ==
since cooperatives are based on values like self-help democracy equality equity and solidarity they can play a particularly strong role in empowering women especially in developing countries cooperatives allow women who might have been isolated and working individually to band together and create economies of scale as well as increase their own bargaining power in the market in statements in advance of international women's day in early 2013 president of the international cooperative alliance dame pauline green said cooperative businesses have done so much to help women onto the ladder of economic activity with that comes community respect political legitimacy and influence.
however despite the supposed democratic structure of cooperatives and the values and benefits shared by members due to gender norms on the traditional role of women and other instilled cultural practices that sidestep attempted legal protections women suffer a disproportionately low representation in cooperative membership around the world representation of women through active membership (showing up to meetings and voting) as well as in leadership and managerial positions is even lower
== cooperatives in popular cultureedit ==
as of 2012 the number of memberships in cooperatives reached one billion and so the organizational structure and movement has seeped into popular culture
