seismometers are instruments that measure motion of the ground including those of seismic waves generated by earthquakes volcanic eruptions and other seismic sources records of seismic waves allow seismologists to map the interior of the earth and locate and measure the size of these different sources
the word derives from the greek  seisms a shaking or quake from the verb  se to shake and  mtron measure and was coined by david milne-home in 1841 to describe an instrument designed by scottish physicist james david forbes
seismograph is another greek term from seisms and  grph to draw it is often used to mean seismometer though it is more applicable to the older instruments in which the measuring and recording of ground motion were combined than to modern systems in which these functions are separated both types provide a continuous record of ground motion this distinguishes them from seismoscopes which merely indicate that motion has occurred perhaps with some simple measure of how large it was
the concerning technical discipline is called seismometry a branch of seismology
== basic principlesedit ==
a simple seismometer that is sensitive to up-down motions of the earth can be understood by visualizing a weight hanging on a spring the spring and weight are suspended from a frame that moves along with the earths surface as the earth moves the relative motion between the weight and the earth provides a measure of the vertical ground motion if a recording system is installed such as a rotating drum attached to the frame and a pen attached to the mass this relative motion between the weight and earth can be recorded to produce a history of ground motion called a seismogram
any movement of the ground moves the frame the mass tends not to move because of its inertia and by measuring the movement between the frame and the mass the motion of the ground can be determined
early seismometers used optical levers or mechanical linkages to amplify the small motions involved recording on soot-covered paper or photographic paper modern instruments use electronics in some systems the mass is held nearly motionless relative to the frame by an electronic negative feedback loop the motion of the mass relative to the frame is measured and the feedback loop applies a magnetic or electrostatic force to keep the mass nearly motionless the voltage needed to produce this force is the output of the seismometer which is recorded digitally in other systems the weight is allowed to move and its motion produces a voltage in a coil attached to the mass and moving through the magnetic field of a magnet attached to the frame this design is often used in the geophones used in seismic surveys for oil and gas
professional seismic observatories usually have instruments measuring three axes north-south east-west and the vertical if only one axis can be measured this is usually the vertical because it is less noisy and gives better records of some seismic waves
the foundation of a seismic station is critical a professional station is sometimes mounted on bedrock the best mountings may be in deep boreholes which avoid thermal effects ground noise and tilting from weather and tides other instruments are often mounted in insulated enclosures on small buried piers of unreinforced concrete reinforcing rods and aggregates would distort the pier as the temperature changes a site is always surveyed for ground noise with a temporary installation before pouring the pier and laying conduit originally european seismographs were placed in a particular area after a destructive earthquake today they are spread to provide appropriate coverage (in the case of weak-motion seismology) or concentrated in high-risk regions (strong-motion seismology)
== historyedit ==
=== ancient eraedit ===
in ad 132 zhang heng of china's han dynasty invented the first seismoscope (by the definition above) which was called houfeng didong yi (translated as instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the earth") the description we have from the history of the later han dynasty says that it was a large bronze vessel about 2 meters in diameter at eight points around the top were dragon's heads holding bronze balls when there was an earthquake one of the mouths would open and drop its ball into a bronze toad at the base making a sound and supposedly showing the direction of the earthquake on at least one occasion probably at the time of a large earthquake in gansu in ad 143 the seismoscope indicated an earthquake even though one was not felt the available text says that inside the vessel was a central column that could move along eight tracks this is thought to refer to a pendulum though it is not known exactly how this was linked to a mechanism that would open only one dragon's mouth the first ever earthquake recorded by this seismoscope was supposedly somewhere in the east days later a rider from the east reported this earthquake
=== modern designsedit ===
the principle can be shown by an early special purpose seismometer this consisted of a large stationary pendulum with a stylus on the bottom as the earth starts to move the heavy mass of the pendulum has the inertia to stay still in the non-earth frame of reference the result is that the stylus scratches a pattern corresponding with the earth's movement this type of strong motion seismometer recorded upon a smoked glass (glass with carbon soot) while not sensitive enough to detect distant earthquakes this instrument could indicate the direction of the pressure waves and thus help find the epicenter of a local earthquake such instruments were useful in the analysis of the 1906 san francisco earthquake further re-analysis was performed in the 1980s using these early recordings enabling a more precise determination of the initial fault break location in marin county and its subsequent progression mostly to the south
after 1880 most seismometers were descended from those developed by the team of john milne james alfred ewing and thomas gray who worked in japan from 1880 to 1895 these seismometers used damped horizontal pendulums after world war ii these were adapted into the widely used press-ewing seismometer
later professional suites of instruments for the world-wide standard seismographic network had one set of instruments tuned to oscillate at fifteen seconds and the other at ninety seconds each set measuring in three directions amateurs or observatories with limited means tuned their smaller less sensitive instruments to ten seconds the basic damped horizontal pendulum seismometer swings like the gate of a fence a heavy weight is mounted on the point of a long (from 10 cm to several meters) triangle hinged at its vertical edge as the ground moves the weight stays unmoving swinging the gate on the hinge
the advantage of a horizontal pendulum is that it achieves very low frequencies of oscillation in a compact instrument the gate is slightly tilted so the weight tends to slowly return to a central position the pendulum is adjusted (before the damping is installed) to oscillate once per three seconds or once per thirty seconds the general-purpose instruments of small stations or amateurs usually oscillate once per ten seconds a pan of oil is placed under the arm and a small sheet of metal mounted on the underside of the arm drags in the oil to damp oscillations the level of oil position on the arm and angle and size of sheet is adjusted until the damping is critical, that is almost having oscillation the hinge is very low friction often torsion wires so the only friction is the internal friction of the wire small seismographs with low proof masses are placed in a vacuum to reduce disturbances from air currents
zollner described torsionally suspended horizontal pendulums as early as 1869 but developed them for gravimetry rather than seismometry
early seismometers had an arrangement of levers on jeweled bearings to scratch smoked glass or paper later mirrors reflected a light beam to a direct-recording plate or roll of photographic paper briefly some designs returned to mechanical movements to save money in mid-twentieth-century systems the light was reflected to a pair of differential electronic photosensors called a photomultiplier the voltage generated in the photomultiplier was used to drive galvanometers which had a small mirror mounted on the axis the moving reflected light beam would strike the surface of the turning drum which was covered with photo-sensitive paper the expense of developing photo sensitive paper caused many seismic observatories to switch to ink or thermal-sensitive paper
== modern instrumentsedit ==
modern instruments use electronic sensors amplifiers and recording devices most are broadband covering a wide range of frequencies some seismometers can measure motions with frequencies from 500 hz to 0.00118 hz (1/500 = 0.002 seconds per cycle to 1/0.00118 = 850 seconds per cycle) the mechanical suspension for horizontal instruments remains the garden-gate described above vertical instruments use some kind of constant-force suspension such as the lacoste suspension the lacoste suspension uses a zero-length spring to provide a long period (high sensitivity) some modern instruments use a triaxial design in which three identical motion sensors are set at the same angle to the vertical but 120 degrees apart on the horizontal vertical and horizontal motions can be computed from the outputs of the three sensors
seismometers unavoidably introduce some distortion into the signals they measure but professionally designed systems have carefully characterized frequency transforms
modern sensitivities come in three broad ranges geophones 50 to 750 v/m local geologic seismographs about 1,500 v/m and teleseismographs used for world survey about 20,000 v/m instruments come in three main varieties short period long period and broadband the short and long period measure velocity and are very sensitive however they clip the signal or go off-scale for ground motion that is strong enough to be felt by people a 24-bit analog-to-digital conversion channel is commonplace practical devices are linear to roughly one part per million
delivered seismometers come with two styles of output analog and digital analog seismographs require analog recording equipment possibly including an analog-to-digital converter the output of a digital seismograph can be simply input to a computer it presents the data in a standard digital format (often se2 over ethernet)
=== teleseismometersedit ===
the modern broadband seismograph can record a very broad range of frequencies it consists of a small proof mass confined by electrical forces driven by sophisticated electronics as the earth moves the electronics attempt to hold the mass steady through a feedback circuit the amount of force necessary to achieve this is then recorded
in most designs the electronics holds a mass motionless relative to the frame this device is called a force balance accelerometer it measures acceleration instead of velocity of ground movement basically the distance between the mass and some part of the frame is measured very precisely by a linear variable differential transformer some instruments use a linear variable differential capacitor
that measurement is then amplified by electronic amplifiers attached to parts of an electronic negative feedback loop one of the amplified currents from the negative feedback loop drives a coil very like a loudspeaker except that the coil is attached to the mass and the magnet is mounted on the frame the result is that the mass stays nearly motionless
most instruments measure directly the ground motion using the distance sensor the voltage generated in a sense coil on the mass by the magnet directly measures the instantaneous velocity of the ground the current to the drive coil provides a sensitive accurate measurement of the force between the mass and frame thus measuring directly the ground's acceleration (using f=ma where f=force m=mass a=acceleration)
one of the continuing problems with sensitive vertical seismographs is the buoyancy of their masses the uneven changes in pressure caused by wind blowing on an open window can easily change the density of the air in a room enough to cause a vertical seismograph to show spurious signals therefore most professional seismographs are sealed in rigid gas-tight enclosures for example this is why a common streckeisen model has a thick glass base that must be glued to its pier without bubbles in the glue
it might seem logical to make the heavy magnet serve as a mass but that subjects the seismograph to errors when the earth's magnetic field moves this is also why seismograph's moving parts are constructed from a material that interacts minimally with magnetic fields a seismograph is also sensitive to changes in temperature so many instruments are constructed from low expansion materials such as nonmagnetic invar
the hinges on a seismograph are usually patented and by the time the patent has expired the design has been improved the most successful public domain designs use thin foil hinges in a clamp
another issue is that the transfer function of a seismograph must be accurately characterized so that its frequency response is known this is often the crucial difference between professional and amateur instruments most instruments are characterized on a variable frequency shaking table
=== strong-motion seismometersedit ===
another type of seismometer is a digital strong-motion seismometer or accelerograph the data from such an instrument is essential to understand how an earthquake affects manmade structures
a strong-motion seismometer measures acceleration this can be mathematically integrated later to give velocity and position strong-motion seismometers are not as sensitive to ground motions as teleseismic instruments but they stay on scale during the strongest seismic shaking
=== other formsedit ===
accelerographs and geophones are often heavy cylindrical magnets with a spring-mounted coil inside as case moves the coil tends to stay stationary so the magnetic field cuts the wires inducing current in the output wires they receive frequencies from several hundred hertz down to 1 hz some have electronic damping a low-budget way to get some of the performance of the closed-loop wide-band geologic seismographs
strain-beam accelerometers constructed as integrated circuits are too insensitive for geologic seismographs (2002) but are widely used in geophones
some other sensitive designs measure the current generated by the flow of a non-corrosive ionic fluid through an electret sponge or a conductive fluid through a magnetic field
=== interconnected seismometersedit ===
seismometers spaced in an array can also be used to precisely locate in three dimensions the source of an earthquake using the time it takes for seismic waves to propagate away from the hypocenter the initiating point of fault rupture (see also earthquake location) interconnected seismometers are also used to detect underground nuclear test explosions these seismometer are often used as part of a large scale multimillion-dollar governmental or scientific project but some organizations such as the quake-catcher network can use residential size detectors built into computers to detect earthquakes as well
in reflection seismology an array of seismometers image sub-surface features the data are reduced to images using algorithms similar to tomography the data reduction methods resemble those of computer-aided tomographic medical imaging x-ray machines (cat-scans) or imaging sonars
a world-wide array of seismometers can actually image the interior of the earth in wave-speed and transmissivity this type of system uses events such as earthquakes impact events or nuclear explosions as wave sources the first efforts at this method used manual data reduction from paper seismograph charts modern digital seismograph records are better adapted to direct computer use with inexpensive seismometer designs and internet access amateurs and small institutions have even formed a public seismograph network.
seismographic systems used for petroleum or other mineral exploration historically used an explosive and a wireline of geophones unrolled behind a truck now most short-range systems use thumpers that hit the ground and some small commercial systems have such good digital signal processing that a few sledgehammer strikes provide enough signal for short-distance refractive surveys exotic cross or two-dimensional arrays of geophones are sometimes used to perform three-dimensional reflective imaging of subsurface features basic linear refractive geomapping software (once a black art) is available off-the-shelf running on laptop computers using strings as small as three geophones some systems now come in an 18 (0.5 m) plastic field case with a computer display and printer in the cover
small seismic imaging systems are now sufficiently inexpensive to be used by civil engineers to survey foundation sites locate bedrock and find subsurface water
== recordingedit ==
today the most common recorder is a computer with an analog-to-digital converter a disk drive and an internet connection for amateurs a pc with a sound card and associated software is adequate most systems record continuously but some record only when a signal is detected as shown by a short-term increase in the variation of the signal compared to its long-term average (which can vary slowly because of changes in seismic noise)
prior to the availability of digital processing of seismic data in the late 1970s the records were done in a few different forms on different types of media a helicorder drum was a device used to record data into photographic paper or in the form of paper and ink a develocorder was a machine that record data from up to 20 channels into a 16-mm film the recorded film can be viewed by a machine the reading and measuring from these types of media can be done by hand after the digital processing has been used the archives of the seismic data were recorded in magnetic tapes due to the deterioration of older magnetic tape medias large number of waveforms from the archives are not recoverable
