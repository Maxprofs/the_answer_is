physics law conservation energy states total energy isolated system remains constantit said conserved time energy neither created destroyed transforms one form another instance chemical energy converted kinetic energy explosion stick dynamite
consequence law conservation energy perpetual motion machine first kind cannot exist say system without external energy supply deliver unlimited amount energy surroundings
history
ancient philosophers far back thales miletus c bce inklings conservation underlying substance everything made however particular reason identify know today massenergy example thales thought water empedocles bce wrote universal system composed four roots earth air water fire nothing comes perishes instead elements suffer continual rearrangement
galileo published analysis several situationsincluding celebrated interrupted pendulumwhich described modern language conservatively converting potential energy kinetic energy back
gottfried wilhelm leibniz first attempted mathematical formulation kind energy connected motion kinetic energy leibniz noticed many mechanical systems several masses mi velocity vi
conserved long masses interact called quantity vis viva living force system principle represents accurate statement approximate conservation kinetic energy situations friction many physicists time held conservation momentum holds even systems friction defined momentum
conserved vis viva later shown quantities conserved simultaneously given proper conditions elastic collision
largely engineers john smeaton peter ewart carl holtzmann gustaveadolphe hirn marc seguin objected conservation momentum alone adequate practical calculation made use leibnizs principle principle also championed chemists william hyde wollaston academics john playfair quick point kinetic energy clearly conserved obvious modern analysis based second law thermodynamics th th centuries fate lost energy still unknown gradually came suspected heat inevitably generated motion friction another form vis viva antoine lavoisier pierresimon laplace reviewed two competing theories vis viva caloric theory count rumfords observations heat generation boring cannons added weight view mechanical motion could converted heat importantly conversion quantitative could predicted allowing universal conversion constant kinetic energy heat vis viva started known energy term first used sense thomas young

mechanical equivalent heat
key stage development modern conservation principle demonstration mechanical equivalent heat caloric theory maintained heat could neither created destroyed whereas conservation energy entails contrary principle heat mechanical work interchangeable
middle eighteenth century mikhail lomonosov russian scientist postulated corpusculokinetic theory heat rejected idea caloric results empirical studies lomonosov came conclusion heat transferred particles caloric fluid
count rumford benjamin thompson performed measurements frictional heat generated boring cannons developed idea heat form kinetic energy measurements refuted caloric theory imprecise enough leave room doubt
mechanical equivalence principle first stated modern form german surgeon julius robert von mayer mayer reached conclusion voyage dutch east indies found patients blood deeper red consuming less oxygen therefore less energy maintain body temperature hotter climate discovered heat mechanical work forms energy improving knowledge physics published monograph stated quantitative relationship
meanwhile james prescott joule independently discovered mechanical equivalent series experiments famous called joule apparatus descending weight attached string caused paddle immersed water rotate showed gravitational potential energy lost weight descending equal internal energy gained water friction paddle
period similar work carried engineer ludwig colding though little known outside native denmark
joules mayers work suffered resistance neglect joules eventually drew wider recognition
william robert grove postulated relationship mechanics heat light electricity magnetism treating manifestations single force energy modern terms grove published theories book correlation physical forces drawing earlier work joule sadi carnot mile clapeyron hermann von helmholtz arrived conclusions similar groves published theories book ber die erhaltung der kraft conservation force general modern acceptance principle stems publication
william rankine first used phrase law conservation energy principle
peter guthrie tait claimed principle originated sir isaac newton based creative reading propositions philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica regarded example whig history
massenergy equivalence
matter composed things atoms electrons neutrons protons intrinsic rest mass limited range recognized experience nineteenth century found rest mass conserved einsteins theory special relativity showed corresponds equivalent amount rest energy means converted equivalent amounts nonmaterial forms energy example kinetic energy potential energy electromagnetic radiant energy happens recognized twentieth century experience rest mass conserved unlike total mass total energy forms energy contribute total mass total energy
example electron positron rest mass perish together converting combined rest energy photons electromagnetic radiant energy rest mass occurs within isolated system release photons energy external surroundings neither total mass total energy system change produced electromagnetic radiant energy contributes much inertia weight system rest mass electron positron demise likewise nonmaterial forms energy perish matter rest mass
thus conservation energy total including material rest energy conservation mass total rest still holds equivalent law nineteenth century appeared two seeminglydistinct laws
conservation energy beta decay
discovery electrons emitted beta decay continuous rather discrete spectrum appeared contradict conservation energy thencurrent assumption beta decay simple emission electron nucleus problem eventually resolved enrico fermi proposed correct description betadecay emission electron antineutrino carries away apparently missing energy
first law thermodynamics

equivalently
quantity energy added system heating process quantity energy lost system due work done system surroundings change internal energy system
heat work terms used indicate describe increment energy interpreted somewhat differently increment internal energy see inexact differential work heat refer kinds process add subtract energy system internal energy property particular state system unchanging thermodynamic equilibrium thus term heat energy means amount energy added result heating rather referring particular form energy likewise term work energy means amount energy lost result work thus one state amount internal energy possessed thermodynamic system one knows presently given state one cannot tell knowledge given present state much energy past flowed system result heated cooled result work performed system
entropy function state system tells limitations possibility conversion heat work

added mass internal energy per unit mass added mass measured surroundings process
noethers theorem
conservation energy common feature many physical theories mathematical point view understood consequence noethers theorem developed emmy noether first published theorem states every continuous symmetry physical theory associated conserved quantity theorys symmetry time invariance conserved quantity called energy energy conservation law consequence shift symmetry time energy conservation implied empirical fact laws physics change time philosophically stated nothing depends time per se words physical system invariant continuous symmetry time translation energy canonical conjugate quantity time conserved conversely systems invariant shifts time example systems time dependent potential energy exhibit conservation energy unless consider exchange energy another external system theory enlarged system becomes time invariant since timevarying system embedded within larger timeinvariant system exception universe conservation always recovered suitable redefinition energy extending scope system conservation energy finite systems valid physical theories special relativity quantum theory including qed flat spacetime
relativity
discovery special relativity henri poincare albert einstein energy proposed one component energymomentum vector four components one energy three momentum vector separately conserved across time closed system seen given inertial reference frame also conserved vector length minkowski norm rest mass single particles invariant mass systems particles momenta energy separately summed length calculatedsee article invariant mass
relativistic energy single massive particle contains term related rest mass addition kinetic energy motion limit zero kinetic energy equivalently rest frame massive particle else center momentum frame objects systems retain kinetic energy total energy particle object including internal kinetic energy systems related rest mass invariant mass via famous equation
thus rule conservation energy time special relativity continues hold long reference frame observer unchanged applies total energy systems although different observers disagree energy value also conserved invariant observers invariant mass minimal system mass energy seen observer defined energymomentum relation
general relativity conservation energymomentum expressed aid stressenergymomentum pseudotensor theory general relativity leaves open question whether conservation energy entire universe
quantum theory
quantum mechanics energy quantum system described selfadjoint hermitian operator called hamiltonian acts hilbert space space wave functions system hamiltonian time independent operator emergence probability measurement result change time evolution system thus expectation value energy also time independent local energy conservation quantum field theory ensured quantum noethers theorem energymomentum tensor operator note due lack universal time operator quantum theory uncertainty relations time energy fundamental contrast positionmomentum uncertainty principle merely holds specific cases see uncertainty principle energy fixed time principle exactly measured without tradeoff precision forced timeenergy uncertainty relations thus conservation energy time well defined concept even quantum mechanics
