chemistry saturation latin word saturare meaning fill diverse meanings based reaching maximum capacity
physical chemistry saturation point solution substance dissolve substance additional amounts appear separate phase precipitate solid effervescence inclusion gaseous point maximum concentration saturation point depends temperature pressure solution well chemical nature substances involved used process recrystallisation purify chemical dissolved point saturation hot solvent solvent cools solubility decreases excess solute precipitates impurities present much lower concentration saturate solvent remain dissolved liquid change conditions eg cooling means concentration actually higher saturation point solution become supersaturated
physical chemistry referring surface processes saturation denotes degree binding site fully occupied example base saturation refers fraction exchangeable cations base cations similarly environmental soil science nitrogen saturation means ecosystem soil cannot store nitrogen
organic chemistry saturated compound double triple bonds case saturated ethane carbon centre four single bonds characteristic saturated hydrocarbons alkanes contrast ethylene ch carbon centre engaged two single one double bond
thus like alkenes ethylene unsaturated degree unsaturation specifies amount hydrogen compound bind term applied similarly fatty acid constituents fats either saturated unsaturated depending whether constituent fatty acids contain carboncarbon double bonds unsaturated used carbon structure contains double occasionally triple bonds many vegetable oils contain fatty acids one monounsaturated polyunsaturated double bonds bromine number index unsaturation
organometallic chemistry unsaturated complex fewer valence electrons thus susceptible oxidative addition coordination additional ligand unsaturation characteristic many catalysts usually requirement substrate activation contrast coordinatively saturated complex resists undergoing substitution oxidative addition reactions
biochemistry term saturation refers fraction total protein binding sites occupied given time
