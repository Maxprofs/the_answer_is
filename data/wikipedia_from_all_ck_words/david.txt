david (/devd/ hebrew  modern david tiberian dw iso 259-3 dawid arabic dwd syriac dawid ancient greek  latin david strong's daveed) was according to the books of samuel the second king of the united kingdom of israel and according to the new testament an ancestor of jesus his life is conventionally dated to c 1040 970 bce his reign over judah c 1010970 bce
the books of samuel 1 kings and 1 chronicles are the only old testament sources of information on david although the tel dan stele (dated c 850835 bce) contains the phrase (bytdwd) read as house of david which many scholars confirm to be a likely plausible match to the existence in the mid-9th century bce of a judean royal dynasty called the house of david
depicted as a valorous warrior of great renown and a poet and musician credited for composing much of the psalms contained in the book of psalms king david is widely viewed as a righteous and effective king in battle and civil justice he is described as a man after god's own heart in 1 samuel 13:14 and acts 13:22
david is an important figure to members of the jewish christian and islamic faiths biblical tradition maintains the messiah's direct descent from the line of david in islam david is considered a prophet
== biblical narrative ==
=== saul rejected ===
according to the biblical narrative israel is at first ruled by judges but the people demand a monarchy so the current judge the prophet samuel reluctantly appoints saul to be the first king of israel although successful at first saul eventually loses favor with god by disobeying directives conveyed through samuel samuel tells saul that god has rejected him as king and will give the kingdom instead to a man after [my] own heart who is better than you.
samuel goes to bethlehem on the pretext of performing a sacrifice in fact intending to appoint saul's successor from among the sons of jesse of bethlehem samuel examine seven of jesse's sons but says to him the lord has not chosen these, and inquires if jesse has any other sons jesse's youngest son david is sent for where he is tending the flocks when samuel sees david the lord says rise and anoint him this is the one.
=== at saul's court ===
the bible presents two accounts of how david came to become part of sauls household in 1 samuel 16:14-23 saul takes david into his service as his armor-bearer in 1 samuel 17 david is officially presented to saul as the hero who killed goliath according to french scholar andre lemaire this may represent an amalgamation of different traditions concerning the early relationship between david and saul
saul is tormented by an evil spirit from the lord which afflicts him with episodes of deep melancholy which only music can ease david is recommended as a skilled musician and summoned to the court saul makes david one of his armor-bearers a high honor from then on whenever the evil spirit from god comes upon saul david plays music and the evil spirit leaves him
=== david and goliath ===
according to 1 samuel 17 the men of israel under king saul faced the philistines near the valley of elah the two armies are encamped within sight of each other for several days but battle has not been joined instead the philistine's champion the giant goliath issues daily challenges to single combat david arrives in camp sent by his father to bring provisions to his brothers with the army he hears goliath's challenge and comments that the uncircumcised philistine should not insult the army of the living god brought to the king he expresses confidence that he can defeat goliath just as he has a lion and a bear that threatened the flock
before the ordeal david picks five smooth stones from a nearby brook to use as ammunition during the duel he avoids goliath's thrown spear and easily kills him with his sling afterword removing the giant's head with his own sword as the philistines flee in terror saul inquires about the name of the young champion's father and david tells him that he is the son of jesse in 2 samuel 22 david credits god for delivering him from the hand of the philistines and saving him from the snares of death, in his psalm davids song of praise.
2 samuel 21:19 states that goliath was killed by elhanan son of jair from bethlehem (1 chronicles 20:5 retells this story using goliath's brother) most likely storytellers displaced the deed from the otherwise obscure elhanan onto the more famous character david.
=== david and jonathan ===
saul makes david a commander over his armies and offers him his daughter michal in marriage for a bride price of 100 philistine foreskins intending that david will die in trying to remove them instead he brings back 200 foreskins saying god was with me david is increasingly successful and increasingly popular and saul begins to see him as a threat saul repeatedly tries to arrange for david's death but the plots only endear david further to the people and especially to his friend saul's son jonathan (1 samuel 18:1 2 samuel 1:2526) jonathan warns david of his father's plots david flees into the wilderness at the head of a band of followers
during this time as a fugitive from king saul david becomes a vassal of the philistine king achish of gath for which achish gives him the border town of ziklag despite being in the employ of their enemy david maintains good relations with the israelites by defending them from the amalekites when achish marches against the israelites his nobles question david's loyalty pointing out that if david turns on them during the battle he could win back saul's favor so he is excused from the battle and left behind to guard the camp
=== proclaimed king ===
jonathan and saul are killed in battle with the philistines at mount gilboa david travels to hebron where he is anointed king in the north saul's son ish-bosheth is anointed king by abner war ensues until ish-bosheth is murdered the assassins bring his head to david hoping for a reward but david executes them for their crime with the death of saul's son the elders of israel come to hebron and david is anointed king over a united israel
=== jerusalem and the davidic covenant ===
david conquers the jebusite fortress of jerusalem and makes it his capital he brings the ark of the covenant to jerusalem intending to build a temple however the prophet nathan forbids him to build a temple because he has shed too much blood but prophesies that the temple would be built by one of his sons nathan also prophecies that god has made a covenant with the house of david your throne shall be established forever. david wins more victories over the philistines and the moabites and hadadezer of zobah pays tribute
=== bathsheba and uriah the hittite ===
with his army in the field under the command of his general joab david remains in the capital and occupies himself by seducing bathsheba the wife of one of his officers uriah the hittite and she becomes pregnant david then sends a letter to joab with instructions that his reply be carried by uriah when uriah arrives at the capital david detains him assuming that he will take the opportunity to sleep with his wife but uriah refuses do so while his men are sleeping in the field so david sends him back to the front with a second message instructing joab to arrange for uriah to die in battle with uriah disposed of david marries the widow who bears their child but the narrative comments but the thing that david had done displeased the lord.
the prophet nathan confronts david and prophecies the punishment that shall fall upon him the sword shall never depart from your house apparently meaning that he will always be troubled by war the son born to you will die, and that god will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you and he will sleep with your wives in broad daylight.
when their child falls ill david desperately prays for his recovery with such disturbing expressions grief that when the child dies the servants are at first afraid to tell him out of concern for his sanity but upon learning his son has died david promptly recovers himself explaining while the child was still alive i fasted and wept i thought who knows the lord may be gracious to me and let the child live. but now that he is dead why should i fast can i bring him back again i will go to him but he will not return to me. (2 samuel 12:2223)
=== david's son absalom rebels ===
david's son absalom stole the hearts of the people and rebelled david flees jerusalem leaving his servant hushai behind in absalom's court as a double agent ahitophel formerly david's chief advisor advises absalom to strike before david has time to gather his forces hushai persuades absalom to wait and build up his own forces before facing his formidable father when ahitophel sees his council rejected he correctly surmises the cause is lost and hangs himself absalom has a tent pitched on the palace roof in which he takes his father's consorts thus fulfilling nathan's prophecy the rebellion ends at the battle of the wood of ephraim absalom's forces are routed leaving him behind with his flowing locks tangled in the branches of a terebinth tree where he is found and killed by davids general joab when the news of the victory is brought to david he is grief-stricken and laments o my son absalom my son my son absalom would i had died instead of you o absalom my son my son! joab reprimands him for his excesive show of grief in the face of victory
=== death ===
with david old and bedridden adonijah his eldest surviving son and natural heir declares himself king bathsheba david's favorite wife and nathan the prophet go to david and obtain his agreement that bathsheba's son solomon should become king david counsels solomon to begin his reign with a massacre naming numerous men to be purged including his long-time general joab who had offended him years previously
=== family ===
according to tradition david was born in bethlehem in the territory of the tribe of judah his grandfather was obed whose mother was the moabite ruth and whose grandmother was the former prostitute rahab david's father was jesse his mother is not named in the bible but the talmud identifies her as nitzevet daughter of adael david had six older brothers and two sisters zeruiah and abigail
david cemented his relations with various political and national groups through marriage he had eight wives michal the second daughter of king saul ahinoam the jezreelite abigail the carmelite previously wife of nabal maachah daughter of talmai king of geshur haggith abital eglah and bathsheba
the book of chronicles lists his sons by various wives and concubines in hebron david had six sons amnon by ahinoam daniel by abigail absalom by maachah adonijah by haggith shephatiah by abital and ithream by eglah by bathsheba his sons were shammua shobab nathan and solomon david's sons born in jerusalem by other wives included ibhar elishua eliphelet nogah nepheg japhia elishama and eliada jerimoth who is not mentioned in any of the genealogies is mentioned as another of his sons in 2 chronicles 11:18 david also had at least one daughter tamar by maachah
given that nathan prophesies in punishment for his sin with bathsheba that the lord will take his wives and give them to his neighbor solomon may not have been david's son at all but later editors may have amended the story to emphasize nathan's other statement that the sword shall never depart from your house
== historicity ==
=== archaeology ===
two archaeological finds the tel dan stele and the mesha stele have direct bearing on the question of the existence of a historical david the first of these is an aramean victory stele (inscribed stone) discovered in 1993 at tel dan and dated c 850835 bce it contains the phrase (bytdwd) which has been interpreted as house of david the mesha stele from moab dating from approximately the same period may also contain the name david in line 12 where the interpretation is uncertain and in line 31 where one destroyed letter must be supplied but apparently no other letter produces a word that makes sense in the context
the evidence from surface surveys indicates that judah at the time of david was a small tribal kingdom the bronze and iron age remains of the city of david the original urban core of jerusalem identified with the reigns of david and solomon were investigated extensively in the 1970s and 1980s under the direction of yigal shiloh of the hebrew university who failed to discover significant evidence of occupation during the 10th century bce in 2005 eilat mazar reported the discovery of a large stone structure which she claimed was david's palace but the site is contaminated and cannot be accurately dated
in december 2014 archaeologists from mississippi state university announced the discovery of six bullae which suggests that some type of government activity was being conducted in the 10th century and thus support the existence of david although the bullae do not mention david or jerusalem or judah or israel and there is no way of knowing who produced them or for what purpose
in 2015 a 10-year-old russian volunteer at jerusalems temple mount sifting project found a seal from the time of king david in the 10th century bce
=== academic views on the biblical account ===
the biblical account about david comes from the books of samuel and the books of chronicles chronicles merely retells samuel from a different theological vantage point and contains little (if any) information not available there and the biblical evidence for david is therefore dependent almost exclusively on the material contained in the chapters from 1 samuel 16 to 1 kings 2
since martin noth put forward his analysis of the deuteronomistic history biblical scholars have accepted that these two books form part of a continuous history of israel compiled no earlier than the late 7th century bce but incorporating earlier works and fragments samuel's account of david seems to have undergone two separate acts of editorial slanting the original writers show a strong bias against saul and in favour of david and solomon many years later the deuteronomists edited the material in a manner that conveyed their religious message inserting reports and anecdotes that strengthened their monotheistic doctrine some of the materials in samuel i and iinotably the boundary allotment and administrative listsare believed to be very early since they correspond closely to what we know of the territorial conditions of the late davidic-early solomonic period
beyond this the full range of possible interpretations is available the late john bright in his history of israel takes samuel at face value donald b redford however thinks all reconstructions from biblical sources for the united monarchy period are examples of academic wishful thinking thomas l thompson rejects the historicity of the biblical narrative the history of palestine and of its peoples is very different from the bible's narratives whatever political claims to the contrary may be an independent history of judea during the iron i and iron ii periods has little room for historicizing readings of the stories of i-ii samuel and i kings. amihai mazar however concludes that based on recent archeological findings like those in city of david khirbet qeiyafa tel dan tel rehov khirbet en-nahas and others the deconstruction of united monarchy and the devaluation of judah as a state in 9th century is unacceptable interpretation of available historic data according to mazar based on archeological evidences united monarchy can be described as a state in development
some studies of david have been written baruch halpern has pictured david as a lifelong vassal of achish the philistine king of gath israel finkelstein and neil asher silberman have identified as the oldest and most reliable section of samuel those chapters which describe david as the charismatic leader of a band of outlaws who captures jerusalem and makes it his capital steven mckenzie associate professor of the hebrew bible at rhodes college and author of king david a biography states the belief that david actually came from a wealthy family was ambitious and ruthless and a tyrant who murdered his opponents including his own sons
critical bible scholarship holds that the biblical account of david's rise to power is a political apologyan answer to contemporary charges against him of his involvement in murders and regicide
israel finkelstein and neil asher silberman reject the idea that david ruled over a united monarchy suggesting instead that he ruled only as a chieftain over the southern kingdom of judah much smaller than the northern kingdom of israel at that time they posit that israel and judah were still polytheistic in the time of david and solomon and that much later seventh century redactors sought to portray a past golden age of a united monotheistic monarchy in order to serve contemporary needs they note a lack of archeological evidence for david's military campaigns and a relative underdevelopment of jerusalem the capital of judah compared to a more developed and urbanized samaria capital of israel
jacob l wright associate professor of hebrew bible at emory university has written that the most popular legends about david including his killing of goliath his affair with bathsheba and his ruling of a united kingdom of israel rather than just judah are the creation of those who lived generations after him in particular those living in the late persian or hellenistic period
=== physical descriptions ===
1 samuel 16:12 says and he sent and brought him in now he was ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he. 1 samuel 17:4143 says and the philistine moved forward and came near to david with his shield-bearer in front of him and when the philistine looked and saw david he disdained him for he was but a youth ruddy and handsome in appearance.
the hebrew word for ruddy used in the above passages is admoni () from the root adm ( see also adam and edom) admoni reddish-brown was the ideal colour for men and indicates david's heroic nature
== abrahamic religious traditions ==
=== david as psalmist ===
while almost half of the psalms are headed a psalm of david (though the phrase can also be translated as to david or for david") and tradition identifies several with specific events in davids life (e.g. psalms 3 7 18 34 51 52 54 56 57 59 60 63 and 142) the headings are late additions and no psalm can be attributed to david with certainty
psalm 34 is attributed to david on the occasion of his escape from the abimelech (king) achish by pretending to be insane according to the narrative in 1 samuel 21 instead of killing the man who had exacted so many casualties from him abimelech allows david to depart exclaiming am i so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me must this man come into my house?
=== judaism ===
david is an important figure in judaism historically david's reign represented the formation of a coherent jewish kingdom centered in jerusalem david is an important figure within the context of jewish belief in the messiah in the hebrew bible it is written that a human descendant of david will occupy the throne of a restored kingdom and usher in a messianic age
david is also viewed as a tragic figure his acquisition of bathsheba and the loss of his son are viewed as his central tragedies
many legends have grown around the figure of david according to one rabbinic tradition david was raised as the son of his father jesse and spent his early years herding his father's sheep in the wilderness while his brothers were in school only at his anointing by samuelwhen the oil from samuel's flask turned to diamonds and pearlswas his true identity as jesse's son revealed
david's adultery with bathsheba was only an opportunity to demonstrate the power of repentance and the talmud states that it was not adultery at all quoting a jewish practice of divorce on the eve of battle furthermore according to talmudic sources the death of uriah was not to be considered murder on the basis that uriah had committed a capital offence by refusing to obey a direct command from the king however in tractate sanhedrin david expressed remorse over his transgressions and sought forgiveness god ultimately forgave david and bathsheba but would not remove their sins from scripture
according to midrashim adam gave up 70 years of his life for the life of david also according to the talmud yerushalmi david was born and died on the jewish holiday of shavuot (feast of weeks) his piety was said to be so great that his prayers could bring down things from heaven
=== christianity ===
the concept of the messiah is important in christianity originally an earthly king ruling by divine appointment ("the anointed one as the title messiah had it) the son of david became in the last two pre-christian centuries the apocalyptic and heavenly one who would deliver israel and usher in a new kingdom this was the background to the concept of messiahship in early christianity which interpreted the career of jesus by means of the titles and functions assigned to david in the mysticism of the zion cult in which he served as priest-king and in which he was the mediator between god and man the early church believed that the life of david [foreshadowed] the life of christ bethlehem is the birthplace of both the shepherd life of david points out christ the good shepherd the five stones chosen to slay goliath are typical of the five wounds the betrayal by his trusted counsellor achitophel and the passage over the cedron remind us of christ's sacred passion many of the davidic psalms as we learn from the new testament are clearly typical of the future messiah. in the middle ages charlemagne thought of himself and was viewed by his court scholars as a new david [this was] not in itself a new idea but [one whose] content and significance were greatly enlarged by him the linking of david to earthly kingship was reflected in later medieval cathedral windows all over europe through the device of the tree of jesse its branches demonstrating how divine kingship descended from jesse through his son david to jesus
western rite churches (lutheran roman catholic) celebrate his feast day on 29 december eastern-rite on 19 december the eastern orthodox church and eastern catholic churches celebrate the feast day of the holy righteous prophet and king david on the sunday of the holy forefathers (two sundays before the great feast of the nativity of the lord) when he is commemorated together with other ancestors of jesus he is also commemorated on the sunday after the nativity together with joseph and james the brother of the lord
==== latter day saints ====
in the latter day saint movement the book of mormon offers a negative commentary on david's practice of polygamy in the book of jacob the nephite nation begins to practice polygamy justifying it by the example of david and solomon in response the prophet jacob denounces both david's taking of many wives and the nephites taking of multiple wives though he stops short of denouncing polygamy altogether
editions of the doctrine and covenants utilized by the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints the largest latter day saint denomination state that of david's sexual relationships only his relationship with bathsheba was a sin however in consequence of this sin and the further sin of killing uriah david had fallen from exaltation and would not be married to any of his wives in the next life
the foundation for apologetic information & research argues that there is no contradiction between the book of mormon and doctrine and covenants because the lord authorized david to have some wives but not many wives they see a parallel between jacob 2:24 and deuteronomy 17:17 which some rabbis interpreted as a limit of four wives per husband when david took bathsheba he crossed the line into having many wives which he was not authorized to do jacob's denunciation then becomes not a complete denunciation of david's polygamy but a denunciation of unauthorized indulgence in polygamy
the community of christ the second-largest latter day saint faction does not accept the validity of 132nd section of the lds doctrine and covenants nor does the church of christ (temple lot) the church of jesus christ (cutlerite) and many other smaller factions although the church of jesus christ of latter day saints (strangite) accepted the validity of polygamy as an institution they do not accept doctrine and covenants 132 nor do they believe that joseph smith instituted or taught it (they believe that james strang was responsible for that when he released his book of the law of the lord in 1850)
=== islam ===
david (arabic  dwd) is a highly important figure in islam as one of the major prophets sent by god to guide the israelites david is mentioned several times in the qur'an often with his son solomon the actual arabic equivalent to the hebrew davd is dawd in the qur'an david killed goliath (2:251) goliath was a powerful king who used to invade random kingdoms and villages goliath was spreading evil and corruption when david killed goliath god granted him kingship and wisdom and enforces it (38:20) david is made god's vicegerent on earth (38:26) and god further gives david sound judgment (21:78 37:2124 26) as well as the psalms which are regarded as books of divine wisdom (4:163 17:55) the birds and mountains unite with david in uttering praise to god (21:79 34:10 38:18) while god made iron soft for david (34:10) god also instructed david in the art of fashioning chain-mail out of iron (21:80) an indication of the first use of wrought iron this knowledge gave david a major advantage over his bronze and cast iron-armed opponents not to mention the cultural and economic impact together with solomon david gives judgment in a case of damage to the fields (21:78) and david judges in the matter between two disputants in his prayer chamber (38:2123) since there is no mention in the qur'an of the wrong david did to uriah nor is there any reference to bathsheba muslims reject this narrative
muslim tradition and the hadith stress david's zeal in daily prayer as well as in fasting qur'an commentators historians and compilers of the numerous stories of the prophets elaborate upon david's concise qur'anic narratives and specifically mention david's gift in singing his psalms as well as his musical and vocal talents his voice is described as having had a captivating power weaving its influence not only over man but over all beasts and nature who would unite with him to praise god
=== baha'i faith ===
in the baha'i faith david is described as a reflection of god and one among a long line of prophets who came in the shadow of the dispensation of moses to develop and consolidate the process he set in motion the kitb-i-qn describes david as being among the more exalted manifestations who have appeared during the intervening period between the revelations of moses and muhammad ever altered the law of the qiblih
== legacy ==
in european christian culture of the middle ages david was made a member of the nine worthies a group of heroes encapsulating all the ideal qualities of chivalry his life was thus proposed as a valuable subject for study by those aspiring to chivalric status this aspect of david in the nine worthies was popularised firstly through literature and was thereafter adopted as a frequent subject for painters and sculptors
david was considered as a model ruler and a symbol of the god-ordained monarchy throughout medieval western europe and eastern christendom david was perceived as the biblical predecessor to christian roman and byzantine emperors and the name new david was used as an honorific reference to these rulers the georgian bagratids and the solomonic dynasty of ethiopia claimed a direct biological descent from him likewise the frankish carolingian dynasty frequently connected themselves to david charlemagne himself occasionally used the name of david as his pseudonym
