explanationedit
specular reflection phenomenon see illuminated shiny surface observe highlight bright spot certain viewing directions specular reflection distinct diffuse reflection incoming light reflected broad range directions example distinction specular diffuse reflection would glossy matte paints matte paints almost exclusively diffuse reflection glossy paints specular diffuse reflection surface built nonabsorbing powder plaster nearly perfect diffuser whereas polished metallic objects specularly reflect light efficiently reflecting material mirrors usually aluminum silver
even surface exhibits specular reflection diffuse reflection light necessarily reflected light may absorbed materials additionally depending type material behind surface light may transmitted surface interfaces materials fraction light reflected increases increasing angle incidence light propagating material higher index refraction material whose surface strikes total internal reflection may occur angle incidence greater certain critical angle specular reflection dielectric water affect polarization brewsters angle reflected light completely linearly polarized parallel interface

direction reflectionedit

scalar obtained dot product different authors may define incident reflection directions different signs assuming euclidean vectors represented column form equation equivalently expressed matrixvector multiplication
socalled householder transformation matrix defined
