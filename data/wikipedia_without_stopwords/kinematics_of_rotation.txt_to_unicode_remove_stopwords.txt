turn subdivided many different ways half turns quarter turns centiturns milliturns binary angles points etc
subdivision turnsedit
turn divided centiturns milliturns milliturn corresponding angle also written protractor divided centiturns normally called percentage protractor
binary fractions turn also used sailors traditionally divided turn compass points binary degree also known binary radian brad turn binary degree used computing angle represented maximum possible precision single byte measures angle used computing may based dividing one whole turn n equal parts values n
notion turn commonly used planar rotations two special rotations acquired appellations rotation commonly referred halfturn radians rotation referred quarterturn halfturn sometimes referred reflection point since identical transformations twodimensions
historyedit
word turn originates via latin french greek word tornos lathe
david gregory used pi rho denote perimeter circle ie circumference divided radius however earlier william oughtred used delta pi ratio diameter perimeter first use symbol present meaning perimeter divided diameter welsh mathematician william jones euler adopted symbol meaning leading widespread use
percentage protractors existed since terms centiturns milliturns introduced much later sir fred hoyle
german standard din proposed unit symbol pla latin plenus angulus full angle turns since hp gii hp prime support unit symbol tr turns
mathematical constantsedit
one turn equal radians
tau proposaledit
robert palais proposed using number radians turn fundamental circle constant instead amounts number radians half turn order make mathematics simpler intuitive using pi three legs symbol denote constant
michael hartl proposed use greek letter tau instead two reasons first radian angle measure one turn circle allows fractions turn expressed turn second visually resembles whose association circle constant unavoidable hartls tau manifesto gives many examples formulas simpler tau used instead pi
examples useedit
angular unit turn revolution particularly useful large angles connection electromagnetic coils rotating objects see also winding number
angular speed rotating machinery automobile engines commonly measured revolutions per minute rpm
turn used complex dynamics measure external internal angles sum external angles polygon equals one turn angle doubling map used
pie charts illustrate proportions whole fractions turn one percent shown angle one centiturn
