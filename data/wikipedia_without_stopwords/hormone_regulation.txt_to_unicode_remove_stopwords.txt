tyrosine sulfation
tyrosine sulfation posttranslational modification tyrosine residue protein sulfated tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase tpst typically golgi apparatus secreted proteins extracellular parts membrane proteins pass golgi apparatus may sulfated sulfation first discovered bettelheim bovine fibrinopeptide b later found present animals plants prokaryotes yeasts sulfation sites tyrosine residues exposed surface protein typically surrounded acidic residues detailed description characteristics sulfation site available prosite prosite pattern ps two types tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases tpst tpst identified
function
sulfation plays role strengthening proteinprotein interactions types human proteins known undergo tyrosine sulfation include adhesion molecules gproteincoupled receptors coagulation factors serine protease inhibitors extracellular matrix proteins hormones tyrosine osulfate stable molecule excreted urine animals enzymatic mechanism tyrosine sulfate desulfation known exist knockout tpst genes mice may observed tyrosine sulfation effects growth mice body weight fecundity postnatal viability
regulation
