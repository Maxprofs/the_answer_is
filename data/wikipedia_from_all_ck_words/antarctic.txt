the antarctic (us english /ntrktk/ uk english /ntrktk/ or /ntrtk/ and /ntrtk/ or /nrtk/) is a arctic called polar region specifically the region around the earth's south pole opposite the arctic region around the north pole the antarctic comprises the continent of antarctica and the ice shelves waters and island territories in the southern ocean situated south of the antarctic convergence the region covers some 20% of the southern hemisphere of which 5.5% (14 million km2) is the surface area of the continent itself
== geography ==
the maritime part of the region constitutes the area of application of the international convention for the conservation of antarctic marine living resources (ccamlr) where for technical reasons the convention uses an approximation of the convergence line by means of a line joining specified points along parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude the implementation of the convention is managed through an international commission headquartered in hobart australia by an efficient system of annual fishing quotas licenses and international inspectors on the fishing vessels as well as satellite surveillance
most of the antarctic region is situated south of 60s latitude parallel and is governed in accordance with the international legal regime of the antarctic treaty system the treaty area covers the continent itself and its immediately adjacent islands as well as the archipelagos of the south orkney islands south shetland islands peter i island scott island and balleny islands
the islands situated between 60s latitude parallel to the south and the antarctic convergence to the north and their respective 200-nautical-mile (370 km) exclusive economic zones fall under the national jurisdiction of the countries that possess them south georgia and the south sandwich islands (united kingdom also an eu overseas territory) bouvet island (norway) and heard and mcdonald islands (australia)
kerguelen islands (france also an eu overseas territory) are situated in the antarctic convergence area while the falkland islands isla de los estados hornos island with cape horn diego ramrez islands campbell island macquarie island amsterdam and saint paul islands crozet islands prince edward islands and gough island and tristan da cunha group remain north of the convergence and thus outside the antarctic region
== wildlife ==
a variety of animals live in antarctica for at least some of the year including
seals
penguin
south georgia pipits
albatrosses
antarctic petrels
whales
fish such as antarctic icefish antarctic toothfish
squid including the colossal squid
antarctic krill
most of the antarctic continent is permanently covered by ice and snow less than 1% of the land is exposed there are only two species of flowering plant antarctic hair grass and antarctic pearlwort but a range of mosses liverworts lichens and macrofungi
== people ==
the first antarctic land discovered was the island of south georgia visited by the english merchant anthony de la roch in 1675 although myths and speculation about a terra australis ("southern land") date back to antiquity the first confirmed sighting of the continent of antarctica is commonly accepted to have occurred in 1820 by the russian expedition of fabian gottlieb von bellingshausen and mikhail lazarev on vostok and mirny the first human born in the antarctic was solveig gunbjrg jacobsen born on 8 october 1913 in grytviken south georgia
the antarctic region had no indigenous population when first discovered and its present inhabitants comprise a few thousand transient scientific and other personnel working on tours of duty at the several dozen research stations maintained by various countries however the region is visited by more than 40,000 tourists annually the most popular destinations being the antarctic peninsula area (especially the south shetland islands) and south georgia island
in december 2009 the growth of tourism with consequences for both the ecology and the safety of the travellers in its great and remote wilderness was noted at a conference in new zealand by experts from signatories to the antarctic treaty the definitive results of the conference would be presented at the antarctic treaty states meeting in uruguay in may 2010
== conservation ==
the antarctic hosts the world largest protected area comprising 1.07 million km2 the south georgia and the south sandwich islands marine protection area created in 2012
== time zones ==
because antarctica surrounds the south pole it is theoretically located in all time zones for practical purposes time zones are usually based on territorial claims or the time zone of a station's owner country or supply base
