one half is the irreducible fraction resulting from dividing one by two (12) or the fraction resulting from dividing any number by its double multiplication by one half is equivalent to division by two or halving conversely division by one half is equivalent to multiplication by two or doubling one half appears often in mathematical equations recipes measurements etc half can also be said to be one part of something divided into two equal parts
for instance the area s of a triangle is computed
s = 12 base perpendicular height
one half also figures in the formula for calculating figurate numbers such as triangular numbers and pentagonal numbers
12 n [(s - 2) n - (4 - s)]
and in the formula for computing magic constants for magic squares
m2(n) = 12 [n (n2 + 1 )]
the riemann hypothesis states that every nontrivial complex root of the riemann zeta function has a real part equal to 12
one half has two different decimal expansions the familiar 0.5 and the recurring 0.49999999 it has a similar pair of expansions in any even base it is a common trap to believe these expressions represent distinct numbers see the proof that 0.999 equals 1 for detailed discussion of a related case
== particularities in writing and language ==
12 is also one of the few fractions to usually have a key of its own on typewriters (see fractions) it also has its own point in some early extensions of ascii at 171 and in unicode it has its own code point at u+00bd (decimal 189) in the c1 controls and latin-1 supplement block and a cross-reference in the number forms block which contains some other fractions
one half is also one of the few fractions which is commonly expressed in natural languages by suppletion rather than regular derivation compare english one half with regular formations like one sixth from six
