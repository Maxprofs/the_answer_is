term harmonic strictest sense member harmonic series term employed various disciplines including music acoustics electronic power transmission radio technology etc typically applied considering frequencies repeating signals sinusoidal waves happen relate wholenumbered multiples case harmonic signal whose frequency wholenumbered multiple frequency given signal example alternating current cycles per second fifthharmonic distortion would produce unwanted additional signal cycles per second exactly five times original frequency
harmonic wave component frequency signal integer multiple fundamental frequency ie fundamental frequency f harmonics frequencies f f f etc harmonics property periodic fundamental frequency therefore sum harmonics also periodic frequency multiples fundamental frequency successive harmonics found repeatedly adding fundamental frequency example fundamental frequency first harmonic hz frequencies next harmonics hz nd harmonic hz rd harmonic hz th harmonic etc
characteristics
acoustic instruments emit complex tones containing many individual partials component simple tones sinusoidal waves untrained human ear typically perceive partials separate phenomena rather musical note perceived one sound quality timbre sound result relative strengths individual partials
many acoustic oscillators human voice bowed violin string produce complex tones less periodic thus composed partials near matches integer multiples fundamental frequency therefore resemble ideal harmonics called harmonic partials simply harmonics convenience although strictly accurate call partial harmonic first real second ideal oscillators produce harmonic partials behave somewhat like dimensional resonators often long thin guitar string column air open ends modern orchestral transverse flute wind instruments whose air column open one end trumpets clarinets also produce partials resembling harmonics however produce partials matching odd harmonics least theory reality acoustic instruments none behaves perfectly somewhat simplified theoretical models would predict
partials whose frequencies integer multiples fundamental referred inharmonic partials
acoustic instruments emit mix harmonic inharmonic partials still produce effect ear definite fundamental pitch pianos strings plucked pizzicato vibraphones marimbas certain puresounding bells chimes antique singing bowls known producing multiple harmonic partials multiphonics
oscillators cymbals drum heads percussion instruments naturally produce abundance inharmonic partials imply particular pitch therefore cannot used melodically harmonically way instruments
harmonics overtones
overtone frequency higher fundamental tight relation overtones harmonics music often leads used synonymously strictly musical context counted differently leading possible confusion chart demonstrates counted
many musical instruments possible play upper harmonics without fundamental note present simple case eg recorder effect making note go pitch octave complex cases many pitch variations obtained cases also changes timbre note part normal method obtaining higher notes wind instruments called overblowing extended technique playing multiphonics also produces harmonics string instruments possible produce pure sounding notes called harmonics flageolets string players eerie quality well high pitch harmonics may used check unison tuning strings tuned unison example lightly fingering node found halfway highest string cello produces pitch lightly fingering node way second highest string human voice see overtone singing uses harmonics
true electronically produced periodic tones eg square waves nonsinusoidal waves harmonics whole number multiples fundamental frequency practical instruments characteristic example higher harmonics piano notes true harmonics overtones sharp ie higher frequency given pure harmonic series especially true instruments stringed brasswoodwind ones eg xylophone drums bells etc overtones simple whole number ratio fundamental frequency

artificial harmonics
although harmonics often used open strings occasionally score call artificial harmonic produced playing overtone stopped string performance technique accomplished using two fingers fingerboard first shorten string desired fundamental second touching node corresponding appropriate harmonic
information
harmonics may either used considered basis intonation systems
composer arnold dreyblatt able bring different harmonics single string modified double bass slightly altering unique bowing technique halfway hitting bowing strings
composer lawrence ball uses harmonics generate music electronically
