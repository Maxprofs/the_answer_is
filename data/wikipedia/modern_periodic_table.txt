in the history of the periodic table dbereiner's triads were an early attempt at sorting in an orderly fashion the most important of all the chemical elements by certain physical properties in 1829 the german chemist johann wolfgang dbereiner noted that there were triads of elements that showed similar chemical properties he also noted that other properties of the elements followed trends in which the value of the middle element of the triad was in between those of the end members for example the atomic weight of the central element of the triad was the arithmetic mean of the atomic weights of the other two members the modern periodic table has these triads of elements in adjacent spaces (either consecutive periods (rows) in a group (column) or consecutive groups in a period)
