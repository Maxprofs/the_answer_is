== name and origin ==
the romans gave this month the latin name aprilis but the derivation of this name is uncertain the traditional etymology is from the verb aperire to open in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to open which is supported by comparison with the modern greek use of (anoixis) (opening) for spring since some of the roman months were named in honor of divinities and as april was sacred to the goddess venus her veneralia being held on the first day it has been suggested that aprilis was originally her month aphrilis from her equivalent greek goddess name aphrodite (aphros) or from the etruscan name apru jacob grimm suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero aper or aprus
april was the second month of the earliest roman calendar before ianuarius and februarius were added by king numa pompilius about 700 bc it became the fourth month of the calendar year (the year when twelve months are displayed in order) during the time of the decemvirs about 450 bc when it also was given 29 days the 30th day was added during the reform of the calendar undertaken by julius caesar in the mid-40s bc which produced the julian calendar
the anglo-saxons called april oster-monath or eostur-monath the venerable bede says in the reckoning of time that this month eostur is the root of the word easter he further states that the month was named after a goddess eostre whose feast was in that month it is also attested by einhard in his work vita karoli magni
st george's day is the twenty-third of the month and st mark's eve with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church falls on the twenty-fourth
in china the symbolic ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood took place in their third month which frequently corresponds to april in finnish april is huhtikuu meaning slash-and-burn moon when gymnosperms for beat and burn clearing of farmland were felled
