absolute magnitude is the measure of intrinsic brightness of a celestial object it is the hypothetical apparent magnitude of an object at a standard distance of exactly 10.0 parsecs (32.6 light years) from the observer assuming no astronomical extinction of starlight this places the objects on a common basis and allows the true energy output of astronomical objects to be compared without the distortion introduced by distance as with all astronomical magnitudes the absolute magnitude can be specified for different wavelength intervals for stars the most commonly quoted absolute magnitude is the absolute visual magnitude which uses only the visual (v) band of the spectrum (ubv system) also commonly used is the absolute bolometric magnitude which is the total luminosity expressed in magnitude units that takes into account energy radiated at all wavelengths whether visible or not
the absolute magnitude is similar to visual magnitude (correctly called apparent magnitude) where a difference of 5 in absolute magnitude corresponds to a factor of 100 in brightness whereas for apparent magnitude a difference of one in magnitude corresponds to a factor of two in apparent brightness in terms of absolute magnitude the brighter the object the smaller its magnitude and so on into the negative range with increasing brightness similarly for apparent magnitude but the range devised by the greeks that used the naked eye assigned magnitude one for the brightest stars and magnitude six for the dimmest for absolute magnitude a difference of 1.0 in magnitude corresponds to a ratio of 2.512 100.4 of absolute brightness the milky way for example has an absolute magnitude of about 20.5 so a quasar with an absolute magnitude of 25.5 is 100 times brighter than the milky way if this particular quasar and the milky way could be seen side by side at the same distance of one parsec and the milky way's stars reduced to a single point the quasar would be 5 magnitudes (or 100 times) brighter than the milky way similarly canopus has an absolute visual magnitude of about 5.5 whereas ross 248 has an absolute visual magnitude of +14.8 for a difference of about 20 magnitudes i.e. canopus would be seen as about 20 magnitudes brighter stated another way canopus emits more than 100 million (108) times more visual power than ross 248
== stars and galaxies (m) ==
in stellar and galactic astronomy the standard distance is 10 parsecs (about 32.616 light years 308.57 petameters or 308.57 trillion kilometres) a star at 10 parsecs has a parallax of 0.1 (100 milli arc seconds) galaxies (and other extended objects) are much larger than 10 parsecs their light is radiated over an extended patch of sky and their overall brightness cannot be directly observed from relatively short distances but the same convention is used a galaxy's magnitude is defined by measuring all the light radiated over the entire object treating that integrated brightness as the brightness of a single point-like or star-like source and computing the magnitude of that point-like source as it would appear if observed at the standard 10 parsecs distance consequently the absolute magnitude of any object equals the apparent magnitude it would have if it were 10 parsecs away
the measurement of absolute magnitude is made with an instrument called a bolometer when using an absolute magnitude one must specify the type of electromagnetic radiation being measured when referring to total energy output the proper term is bolometric magnitude the bolometric magnitude usually is computed from the visual magnitude plus a bolometric correction  this correction is needed because very hot stars radiate mostly ultraviolet radiation whereas very cool stars radiate mostly infrared radiation (see planck's law)
many stars visible to the naked eye have such a low absolute magnitude that they would appear bright enough to cast shadows if they were at 10 parsecs from the earth rigel (7.0) deneb (7.2) naos (6.0) and betelgeuse (5.6) for comparison sirius has an absolute magnitude of 1.4 which is brighter than the sun whose absolute visual magnitude is 4.83 (it actually serves as a reference point) the sun's absolute bolometric magnitude is set arbitrarily usually at 4.75 absolute magnitudes of stars generally range from 10 to +17 the absolute magnitudes of galaxies can be much lower (brighter) for example the giant elliptical galaxy m87 has an absolute magnitude of 22 (i.e as bright as about 60,000 stars of magnitude 10)
=== computation ===
for a negligible extinction one can compute the absolute magnitude of an object given its apparent magnitude and luminosity distance 
where is the star's actual distance in parsecs (1 parsec is 206,265 astronomical units approximately 3.2616 light-years) for very large distances the cosmological redshift complicates the relation between absolute and apparent magnitude because the radiation observed was shifted into the red range of the spectrum to compare the magnitudes of very distant objects with those of local objects a k correction might have to be applied to the magnitudes of the distant objects
for nearby astronomical objects (such as stars in the milky way) luminosity distance dl is almost identical to the real distance to the object because spacetime within the milky way is almost euclidean for much more distant objects the euclidean approximation is not valid and general relativity must be taken into account when calculating the luminosity distance of an object
in the euclidean approximation for nearby objects the absolute magnitude of a star can be calculated from its apparent magnitude and the star's parallax in arcseconds
you can also compute the absolute magnitude of an object given its apparent magnitude and distance modulus 
==== examples ====
rigel has a visual magnitude of and distance about 860 light-years
vega has a parallax of 0.129 and an apparent magnitude of +0.03
alpha centauri a has a parallax of 0.742 and an apparent magnitude of 0.01
the black eye galaxy has a visual magnitude of mv=+9.36 and a distance modulus of 31.06
=== apparent magnitude ===
given the absolute magnitude  for objects within the milky way you can also calculate the apparent magnitude from any distance (in parsecs)
for objects at very great distances (outside the milky way) the luminosity distance dl must be used instead of d (in parsecs)
given the absolute magnitude  you can also compute apparent magnitude from its parallax 
also calculating absolute magnitude from distance modulus 
=== bolometric magnitude ===
bolometric magnitude corresponds to luminosity expressed in magnitude units that is after taking into account all electromagnetic wavelengths including those unobserved due to instrumental pass-band the earth's atmospheric absorption and extinction by interstellar dust in the case of stars with few observations it usually must be computed assuming an effective temperature
classically the difference in bolometric magnitude is related to the luminosity ratio according to
which makes by inversion
where
is the sun's (sol) luminosity (bolometric luminosity)
is the star's luminosity (bolometric luminosity)
is the bolometric magnitude of the sun
is the bolometric magnitude of the star
in august 2015 the international astronomical union passed resolution b2 defining the zero points of the absolute and apparent bolometric magnitude scales in si units for power (watts) and irradiance () respectively although bolometric magnitudes had been used by astronomers for many decades there had been systematic differences in the absolute magnitude-luminosity scales presented in various astronomical references and no international standardization this led to systematic differences in bolometric corrections scales which when combined with incorrect assumed absolute bolometric magnitudes for the sun could lead to systematic errors in estimated stellar luminosities (and stellar properties calculated which rely on stellar luminosity like radii ages etc.)
iau 2015 resolution b2 defines an absolute bolometric magnitude scale where corresponds to luminosity 70283012800000000003.01281028 watts with the zero point luminosity set such that the sun (with nominal luminosity 70263828000000000003.8281026 watts) corresponds to absolute bolometric magnitude  placing a radiation source (e.g star) at the standard distance of 10 [parsecs]] it follows that the zero point of the apparent bolometric magnitude scale corresponds to irradiance = 69922518021001999992.518021002108  using the iau 2015 scale the nominal total solar irradiance ("solar constant") measured at 1 astronomical unit () corresponds to an apparent bolometric magnitude of the sun of 
following iau 2015 resolution b2 system the relation between a star's absolute bolometric magnitude and its luminosity is no longer directly tied to the sun's (variable) luminosity
where
is the star's luminosity (bolometric luminosity) in watts
is the zero point luminosity 70283012800000000003.01281028 watts
is the bolometric magnitude of the star
the new iau absolute magnitude scale permanently disconnects the scale from the variable sun however on this si power scale the nominal solar luminosity corresponds closely to = 4.74 a value that was commonly adopted by astronomers before the 2015 iau resolution
the luminosity of the star in watts can be calculated as a function of its absolute bolometric magnitude as
using the variables as defined previously
== solar system bodies (h) ==
for planets and asteroids a definition of absolute magnitude that is more meaningful for nonstellar objects is used
in this case the absolute magnitude (h) is defined as the apparent magnitude that the object would have if it were one astronomical unit (au) from both the sun and the observer because the object is illuminated by the sun absolute magnitude is a function of phase angle and this relationship is referred to as the phase curve
to convert a stellar or galactic absolute magnitude into a planetary one subtract 31.57 a comet's nuclear magnitude (m2) is a different scale and can not be used for a size comparison with an asteroid's (h) magnitude
=== apparent magnitude ===
the absolute magnitude can be used to help calculate the apparent magnitude of a body under different conditions
where is 1 au is the phase angle the angle between the sunbody and bodyobserver lines by the law of cosines we have
is the phase integral (integration of reflected light a number in the 0 to 1 range)
example ideal diffuse reflecting sphere a reasonable first approximation for planetary bodies
a full-phase diffuse sphere reflects 2/3 as much light as a diffuse disc of the same diameter
distances
is the distance between the observer and the body
is the distance between the sun and the body
is the distance between the observer and the sun
note because solar system bodies are never perfect diffuse reflectors astronomers use empirically derived relationships to predict apparent magnitudes when accuracy is required
==== example ====
moon
= +0.25
= = 1 au
= 384.5 mm = 2.57 mau
how bright is the moon from earth
full moon = 0 ( 2/3)
(actual 12.7) a full moon reflects 30% more light at full phase than a perfect diffuse reflector predicts
quarter moon = 90 (if diffuse reflector)
(actually approximately 11.0) the diffuse reflector formula does for smaller phases
== meteors ==
for a meteor the standard distance for measurement of magnitudes is at an altitude of 100 km (62 mi) at the observer's zenith
