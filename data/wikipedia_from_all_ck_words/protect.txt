in logic necessity and sufficiency are implicational relationships between statements the assertion that one statement is a necessary and sufficient condition of another means that the former statement is true if and only if the latter is true that is the two statements must be either simultaneously true or simultaneously false in ordinary english necessary and sufficient indicate relations between conditions or states of affairs not statements being a male sibling is a necessary and sufficient condition for being a brother fred's being a male sibling is necessary and sufficient for the truth of the statement that fred is a brother

a true necessary condition in a conditional statement makes the statement true (see truth table immediately below) in formal terms a consequent n is a necessary condition for an antecedent s in the conditional statement n if s  n is implied by s  or n s in common words we would also say n is weaker than s  or s cannot occur without n  for example it is necessary to be named to be called socrates
a true sufficient condition in a conditional statement ties the statement's truth to its consequent in formal terms an antecedent s is a sufficient condition for a consequent n in the conditional statement if s then n  s implies n  or s n in common words we would also say s is stronger than n  or s guarantees n  for example socrates suffices for a name
a necessary and sufficient condition requires both of these implications (s n and n s) to hold using the previous statement this is expressed as s is necessary and sufficient for n  s if and only if n  or s n
== necessity ==
the assertion that q is necessary for p is colloquially equivalent to p cannot be true unless q is true, or if q is false then p is false. by contraposition this is the same thing as whenever p is true so is q  the logical relation between them is expressed as if p then q  and denoted p q  (p implies q) and may also be expressed as any of q if p  q whenever p  and q when p. one often finds in mathematical prose for instance several necessary conditions that taken together constitute a sufficient condition as shown in example 5
example 1 for it to be true that john is a bachelor, it is necessary that it be also true that he is
unmarried
male
adult
since to state john is a bachelor implies john has each of those three additional predicates
example 2 for the whole numbers greater than two being odd is necessary to being prime since two is the only whole number that is both even and prime
example 3 consider thunder the sound caused by lightning we say that thunder is necessary for lightning since lightning never occurs without thunder whenever there's lightning there's thunder the thunder does not cause the lightning (since lightning causes thunder) but because lightning always comes with thunder we say that thunder is necessary for lightning (that is in its formal sense necessity doesn't imply causality.)
example 4 being at least 30 years old is necessary for serving in the u.s senate if you are under 30 years old then it is impossible for you to be a senator that is if you are a senator it follows that you are at least 30 years old
example 5 in algebra for some set s together with an operation to form a group it is necessary that be associative it is also necessary that s include a special element e such that for every x in s it is the case that e x and x e both equal x it is also necessary that for every x in s there exist a corresponding element x  such that both x x  and x  x equal the special element e none of these three necessary conditions by itself is sufficient but the conjunction of the three is
== sufficiency ==
to say that p is sufficient for q is to say that in and of itself knowing p to be true is adequate grounds to conclude that q is true (however knowing p not to be true does not in and of itself provide adequate grounds to conclude that q is not true.) the logical relation is expressed as if p then q  or p q, and may also be expressed as p implies q. several sufficient conditions may taken together constitute a single necessary condition as illustrated in example 5
example 1 stating that john is a bachelor implies that john is male so knowing that it is true that john is a bachelor is sufficient to know that he is a male
example 2 a number's being divisible by 4 is sufficient (but not necessary) for its being even but being divisible by 2 is both sufficient and necessary
example 3 an occurrence of thunder is a sufficient condition for the occurrence of lightning in the sense that hearing thunder and unambiguously recognizing it as such justifies concluding that there has been a lightning bolt
example 4 a u.s president's signing a bill that congress passed is sufficient to make the bill law note that the case whereby the president did not sign the bill e.g through exercising a presidential veto does not mean that the bill has not become law (it could still have become law through a congressional override)
example 5 that the center of a playing card should be marked with a single large spade () is sufficient for the card to be an ace three other sufficient conditions are that the center of the card be marked with a diamond () heart () or club () respectively none of these conditions is necessary to the card's being an ace but their disjunction is since no card can be an ace without fulfilling at least (in fact exactly) one of the conditions
== relationship between necessity and sufficiency ==
a condition can be either necessary or sufficient without being the other for instance being a mammal (n) is necessary but not sufficient to being human (s) and that a number is rational (s) is sufficient but not necessary to s being a real number (n) (since there are real numbers that are not rational)
a condition can be both necessary and sufficient for example at present today is the fourth of july is a necessary and sufficient condition for today is independence day in the united states. similarly a necessary and sufficient condition for invertibility of a matrix m is that m has a nonzero determinant
mathematically speaking necessity and sufficiency are dual to one another for any statements s and n the assertion that n is necessary for s  is equivalent to the assertion that s is sufficient for n. another facet of this duality is that as illustrated above conjunctions (using and") of necessary conditions may achieve sufficiency while disjunctions (using or") of sufficient conditions may achieve necessity for a third facet identify every mathematical predicate n with the set t(n) of objects events or statements for which n holds true then asserting the necessity of n for s is equivalent to claiming that t(n) is a superset of t(s) while asserting the sufficiency of s for n is equivalent to claiming that t(s) is a subset of t(n)
== simultaneous necessity and sufficiency ==
to say that p is necessary and sufficient for q is to say two things that p is necessary for q and that p is sufficient for q of course it may instead be understood to say a different two things namely that each of p and q is necessary for the other and it may be understood in a third equivalent way as saying that each is sufficient for the other one may summarize anyand thus allof these cases by the statement p if and only if q, which is denoted by p q
for example in graph theory a graph g is called bipartite if it is possible to assign to each of its vertices the color black or white in such a way that every edge of g has one endpoint of each color and for any graph to be bipartite it is a necessary and sufficient condition that it contain no odd-length cycles thus discovering whether a graph has any odd cycles tells one whether it is bipartite and vice versa a philosopher might characterize this state of affairs thus although the concepts of bipartiteness and absence of odd cycles differ in intension they have identical extension
if p is necessary and sufficient for q then q is necessary and sufficient for p because necessity of one for the other is equivalent to sufficiency of the other for the first one both of these statements (that one of p or q is necessary and sufficient for the other) are equivalent to both of the statements p is true if and only if q is true and q is true if and only if p is true
