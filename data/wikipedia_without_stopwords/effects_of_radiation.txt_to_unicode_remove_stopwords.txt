simplest terms radiobiology also known radiation biology field clinical basic medical sciences involves study action ionizing radiation living things
health effects
ionizing radiation generally harmful potentially lethal living things health benefits radiation therapy treatment cancer thyrotoxicosis common impact induction cancer latent period years decades exposure high doses cause visually dramatic radiation burns andor rapid fatality acute radiation syndrome controlled doses used medical imaging radiotherapy scientists suspect low doses may mild hormetic effect improve health
effects ionizing radiation human health stochastic meaning probability occurrence increases dose severity independent dose radiationinduced cancer teratogenesis cognitive decline heart disease examples stochastic effects conditions radiation burns acute radiation syndrome chronic radiation syndrome radiationinduced thyroiditis deterministic meaning reliably occur threshold dose severity increases dose deterministic effects necessarily less serious stochastic effects either ultimately lead temporary nuisance fatality
effects include radiationinduced lung injury cataracts infertility
quantitative data effects ionizing radiation human health relatively limited compared medical conditions low number cases date stochastic nature effects stochastic effects measured large epidemiological studies enough data collected remove confounding factors smoking habits lifestyle factors richest source highquality data comes study japanese atomic bomb survivors vitro animal experiments informative radioresistance varies greatly across species

exposure pathways
external
external exposure exposure occurs radioactive source radiation source outside remains outside organism exposed examples external exposure include
person places sealed radioactive source pocket
space traveller irradiated cosmic rays
person treated cancer either teletherapy brachytherapy brachytherapy source inside person still considered external exposure result committed dose
nuclear worker whose hands dirtied radioactive dust assuming hands cleaned radioactive material absorbed inhaled ingested skin contamination considered external exposure
external exposure relatively easy estimate irradiated organism become radioactive except case radiation intense neutron beam causes activation
internal
internal exposure occurs radioactive material enters organism radioactive atoms become incorporated organism occur inhalation ingestion injection series examples internal exposure
exposure caused potassium present within normal person
exposure ingestion soluble radioactive substance sr cows milk
person treated cancer means radiopharmaceutical radioisotope used drug usually liquid pill review topic published radioactive material becomes intimately mixed affected object often difficult decontaminate object person case internal exposure occurring insoluble materials fission products within uranium dioxide matrix might never able truly become part organism normal consider particles lungs digestive tract form internal contamination results internal exposure
boron neutron capture therapy bnct involves injecting boron tagged chemical preferentially binds tumor cells neutrons nuclear reactor shaped neutron moderator neutron energy spectrum suitable bnct treatment tumor selectively bombarded neutrons neutrons quickly slow body become low energy thermal neutrons thermal neutrons captured injected boron forming excited boron breaks lithium helium alpha particle produce closely spaced ionizing radiationthis concept described binary system using two separate components therapy cancer component relatively harmless cells combined together treatment produce highly cytocidal cytotoxic effect lethal within limited range micrometers approximately one cell diameter clinical trials promising results currently carried finland japan
radioactive compounds enter human body effects different resulting exposure external radiation source especially case alpha radiation normally penetrate skin exposure much damaging ingestion inhalation radiation exposure normally expressed committed dose
history
although radiation discovered late th century dangers radioactivity radiation immediately recognized acute effects radiation first observed use xrays wilhelm rntgen intentionally subjected fingers xrays published observations concerning burns developed though misattributed ozone free radical produced air xrays free radicals produced within body understood important injuries healed later
field medical sciences radiobiology originated leopold freunds demonstration therapeutic treatment hairy mole using new type electromagnetic radiation called xrays discovered year previously german physicist wilhelm rntgen irradiating frogs insects xrays early ivan romanovich tarkhanov concluded newly discovered rays photograph also affect living function time pierre marie curie discovered radioactive polonium radium later used treat cancer
genetic effects radiation including effects cancer risk recognized much later hermann joseph muller published research showing genetic effects awarded nobel prize findings
biological effects radiation known many physicians corporations begun marketing radioactive substances patent medicine radioactive quackery examples radium enema treatments radiumcontaining waters drunk tonics marie curie spoke sort treatment warning effects radiation human body well understood curie later died aplastic anemia caused radiation poisoning eben byers famous american socialite died multiple cancers acute radiation syndrome consuming large quantities radium several years death drew public attention dangers radiation number cases bone necrosis death enthusiasts radiumcontaining medical products nearly vanished market
united states experience socalled radium girls thousands radiumdial painters contracted oral cancers cases acute radiation syndrome popularized warnings occupational health associated radiation hazards robley d evans mit developed first standard permissible body burden radium key step establishment nuclear medicine field study development nuclear reactors nuclear weapons heightened scientific attention given study manner radiation effects
