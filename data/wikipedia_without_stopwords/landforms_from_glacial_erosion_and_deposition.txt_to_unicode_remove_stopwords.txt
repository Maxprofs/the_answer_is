erosional landforms
glaciers expanded due accumulating weight snow ice crush abrade scoured surface rocks bedrock resulting erosional landforms include striations cirques glacial horns artes trim lines ushaped valleys roches moutonnes overdeepenings hanging valleys
cirque starting location mountain glaciers
cirque stairway sequence cirques
ushaped valley ushaped valleys created mountain glaciers filled ocean water create inlet valleys called fjords
arte spiky high land two glaciers glacial action erodes spillway col forms
depositional landforms
later glaciers retreated leaving behind freight crushed rock sand glacial drift created characteristic depositional landforms examples include glacial moraines eskers kames drumlins ribbed moraines also landforms left behind retreating glaciers stone walls new england contain many glacial erratics rocks dragged glacier many miles bedrock origin
esker built bed subglacial stream
kame irregularly shaped mound
