f (named ef /f/) is the sixth letter in the modern english alphabet and the iso basic latin alphabet
== history ==
the origin of f is the semitic letter vv (or waw) that represented a sound like /v/ or /w/ graphically it originally probably depicted either a hook or a club it may have been based on a comparable egyptian hieroglyph such as that which represented the word mace (transliterated as (dj))
the phoenician form of the letter was adopted into greek as a vowel upsilon (which resembled its descendant y but was also the ancestor of the roman letters u v and w') and with another form as a consonant digamma which resembled f but indicated the pronunciation /w/ as in phoenician (after /w/ disappeared from greek digamma was used only as a numeral.)
in etruscan f probably represented /w/ as in greek and the etruscans formed the digraph fh to represent /f/ when the romans adopted the alphabet they used v (from greek upsilon) to stand for /w/ as well as /u/ leaving f available for /f/ (at that time the greek letter phi  represented an aspirated voiceless bilabial plosive /p/ though in modern greek it approximates the sound of /f/.) and so out of the various vav variants in the mediterranean world the letter f entered the roman alphabet attached to a sound which its antecedents in greek and etruscan did not have the roman alphabet forms the basis of the alphabet used today for english and many other languages
the lowercase  f  is not related to the visually similar long s   (or medial s) the use of the long s largely died out by the beginning of the 19th century mostly to prevent confusion with  f  when using a short mid-bar (see more at s)
