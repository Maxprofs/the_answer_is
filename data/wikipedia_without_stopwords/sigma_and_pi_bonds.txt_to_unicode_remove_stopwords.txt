chemistry pi bonds bonds covalent chemical bonds two lobes one involved atomic orbital overlap two lobes involved atomic orbital atomic orbitals zero shared nodal plane passing two bonded nuclei plane also nodal plane molecular orbital pi bond
greek letter name refers p orbitals since orbital symmetry pi bond p orbital seen bond axis p orbitals often engage sort bonding d orbitals also engage pi bonding form part basis metalmetal multiple bonding
pi bonds usually weaker sigma bonds cc double bond bond energy less twice cc single bond bond energy leads conclusion p orbital overlap form molecular orbitals weaker bond orbitals overlap form molecular orbitals perspective quantum mechanics bonds weakness explained significantly less overlap component porbitals due parallel orientation contrasted sigma bonds form bonding orbitals directly nuclei bonding atoms resulting greater overlap strong sigma bond
pi bonds result overlap atomic orbitals contact two areas overlap pibonds diffuse bonds sigma bonds electrons pi bonds sometimes referred pi electrons molecular fragments joined pi bond cannot rotate bond without breaking pi bond rotation involves destroying parallel orientation constituent p orbitals
homonuclear diatomic molecules bonding molecular orbitals one nodal plane passing bonded atoms nodal planes bonded atoms corresponding antibonding pistar molecular orbital defined presence additional nodal plane two bonded atoms
multiple bondsedit
typical double bond consists one sigma bond one pi bond example cc double bond ethylene typical triple bond example acetylene consists one sigma bond two pi bonds two mutually perpendicular planes containing bond axis two pi bonds maximum exist given pair atoms quadruple bonds extremely rare formed transition metal atoms consist one sigma bond two pi bonds one delta bond
pi bond weaker sigma bond combination pi sigma bond stronger either bond enhanced strength multiple bond versus single sigma bond indicated many ways obviously contraction bond lengths example organic chemistry carboncarbon bond lengths pm ethane pm ethylene pm acetylene bonds make total bond shorter stronger
