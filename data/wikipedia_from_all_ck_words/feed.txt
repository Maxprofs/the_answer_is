carbon fiberreinforced polymer carbon fiberreinforced plastic or carbon fiberreinforced thermoplastic (cfrp crp cfrtp or often simply carbon fiber or even carbon) is an extremely strong and light fiber-reinforced plastic which contains carbon fibers the spelling fibre is common in british commonwealth countries
cfrps can be expensive to produce but are commonly used wherever high strength-to-weight ratio and rigidity are required such as aerospace automotive and civil engineering sports goods and an increasing number of other consumer and technical applications
the binding polymer is often a thermoset resin such as epoxy but other thermoset or thermoplastic polymers such as polyester vinyl ester or nylon are sometimes used the composite may contain other fibers such as an aramid (e.g kevlar twaron) aluminium ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (uhmwpe) or glass fibers as well as carbon fiber the properties of the final cfrp product can also be affected by the type of additives introduced to the binding matrix (the resin) the most frequent additive is silica but other additives such as rubber and carbon nanotubes can be used the material is also referred to as graphite-reinforced polymer or graphite fiber-reinforced polymer (gfrp is less common as it clashes with glass-(fiber)-reinforced polymer) in product advertisements it is sometimes referred to simply as graphite fiber for short
== propertiesedit ==
carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers are composite materials in this case the composite consists of two parts a matrix and a reinforcement in cfrp the reinforcement is carbon fiber which provides the strength the matrix is usually a polymer resin such as epoxy to bind the reinforcements together because cfrp consists of two distinct elements the material properties depend on these two elements
the reinforcement will give the cfrp its strength and rigidity measured by stress and elastic modulus respectively unlike isotropic materials like steel and aluminum cfrp has directional strength properties the properties of cfrp depend on the layouts of the carbon fiber and the proportion of the carbon fibers relative to the polymer the two different equations governing the net elastic modulus of composite materials using the properties of the carbon fibers and the polymer matrix can also be applied to carbon fiber reinforced plastics the following equation
is valid for composite materials with the fibers oriented in the direction of the applied load is the total composite modulus and are the volume fractions of the matrix and fiber respectively in the composite and and are the elastic moduli of the matrix and fibers respectively the other extreme case of the elastic modulus of the composite with the fibers oriented transverse to the applied load can be found using the following equation
the fracture toughness of carbon fiber reinforced plastics is governed by the following mechanisms 1) debonding between the carbon fiber and polymer matrix 2) fiber pull-out and 3) delamination between the cfrp sheets typical epoxy-based cfrps exhibit virtually no plasticity with less than 0.5% strain to failure although cfrps with epoxy have high strength and elastic modulus the brittle fracture mechanics present unique challenges to engineers in failure detection since failure occurs catastrophically as such recent efforts to toughen cfrps include modifying the existing epoxy material and finding alternative polymer matrix one such material with high promise is peek which exhibits an order of magnitude greater toughness with similar elastic modulus and strength however peek is much more difficult to process and more expensive
despite its high initial strength-to-weight ratio a design limitation of cfrp is its lack of a definable fatigue endurance limit this means theoretically that stress cycle failure cannot be ruled out while steel and many other structural metals and alloys do have estimable fatigue endurance limits the complex failure modes of composites mean that the fatigue failure properties of cfrp are difficult to predict and design for as a result when using cfrp for critical cyclic-loading applications engineers may need to design in considerable strength safety margins to provide suitable component reliability over its service life
environmental effects such as temperature and humidity can have profound effects on the polymer-based composites including most cfrps while cfrps demonstrate excellent corrosion resistance the effect of moisture at wide ranges of temperatures can lead to degradation of the mechanical properties of cfrps particularly at the matrix-fiber interface while the carbon fibers themselves are not affected by the moisture diffusing into the material the moisture plasticizes the polymer matrix the epoxy matrix used for engine fan blades are designed to be impervious against jet fuel lubrication and rain water and external paint on the composites parts are applied to minimize damage from ultraviolet light
the carbon fibers can cause galvanic corrosion when crp parts are attached to aluminum
== manufactureedit ==
the primary element of cfrp is a carbon filament this is produced from a precursor polymer such as polyacrylonitrile (pan) rayon or petroleum pitch for synthetic polymers such as pan or rayon the precursor is first spun into filament yarns using chemical and mechanical processes to initially align the polymer atoms in a way to enhance the final physical properties of the completed carbon fiber precursor compositions and mechanical processes used during spinning filament yarns may vary among manufacturers after drawing or spinning the polymer filament yarns are then heated to drive off non-carbon atoms (carbonization) producing the final carbon fiber the carbon fibers filament yarns may be further treated to improve handling qualities then wound on to bobbins from these fibers a unidirectional sheet is created these sheets are layered onto each other in a quasi-isotropic layup e.g 0 +60 or 60 relative to each other
from the elementary fiber a bidirectional woven sheet can be created i.e a twill with a 2/2 weave the process by which most carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer is made varies depending on the piece being created the finish (outside gloss) required and how many of this particular piece are going to be produced in addition the choice of matrix can have a profound effect on the properties of the finished composite
many carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer parts are created with a single layer of carbon fabric that is backed with fiberglass a tool called a chopper gun is used to quickly create these composite parts once a thin shell is created out of carbon fiber the chopper gun cuts rolls of fiberglass into short lengths and sprays resin at the same time so that the fiberglass and resin are mixed on the spot the resin is either external mix wherein the hardener and resin are sprayed separately or internal mixed which requires cleaning after every use manufacturing methods may include the following
=== moldingedit ===
one method of producing cfrp parts is by layering sheets of carbon fiber cloth into a mold in the shape of the final product the alignment and weave of the cloth fibers is chosen to optimize the strength and stiffness properties of the resulting material the mold is then filled with epoxy and is heated or air-cured the resulting part is very corrosion-resistant stiff and strong for its weight parts used in less critical areas are manufactured by draping cloth over a mold with epoxy either preimpregnated into the fibers (also known as pre-preg) or painted over it high-performance parts using single molds are often vacuum-bagged and/or autoclave-cured because even small air bubbles in the material will reduce strength an alternative to the autoclave method is to use internal pressure via inflatable air bladders or eps foam inside the non-cured laid-up carbon fiber
=== vacuum baggingedit ===
for simple pieces of which relatively few copies are needed (12 per day) a vacuum bag can be used a fiberglass carbon fiber or aluminum mold is polished and waxed and has a release agent applied before the fabric and resin are applied and the vacuum is pulled and set aside to allow the piece to cure (harden) there are three ways to apply the resin to the fabric in a vacuum mold
the first method is manual and called a wet layup where the two-part resin is mixed and applied before being laid in the mold and placed in the bag the other one is done by infusion where the dry fabric and mold are placed inside the bag while the vacuum pulls the resin through a small tube into the bag then through a tube with holes or something similar to evenly spread the resin throughout the fabric wire loom works perfectly for a tube that requires holes inside the bag both of these methods of applying resin require hand work to spread the resin evenly for a glossy finish with very small pin-holes
a third method of constructing composite materials is known as a dry layup here the carbon fiber material is already impregnated with resin (pre-preg) and is applied to the mold in a similar fashion to adhesive film the assembly is then placed in a vacuum to cure the dry layup method has the least amount of resin waste and can achieve lighter constructions than wet layup also because larger amounts of resin are more difficult to bleed out with wet layup methods pre-preg parts generally have fewer pinholes pinhole elimination with minimal resin amounts generally require the use of autoclave pressures to purge the residual gases out
=== compression moldingedit ===
a quicker method uses a compression mold this is a two-piece (male and female) mold usually made out of aluminum or steel that is pressed together with the fabric and resin between the two the benefit is the speed of the entire process some car manufacturers such as bmw claimed to be able to cycle a new part every 80 seconds however this technique has a very high initial cost since the molds require cnc machining of very high precision
=== filament windingedit ===
for difficult or convoluted shapes a filament winder can be used to make cfrp parts by winding filaments around a mandrel or a core
== applicationsedit ==
applications for cfrp include the following
=== aerospace engineeringedit ===
the airbus a350 xwb is built of 52% cfrp including wing spars and fuselage components taking the lead from the boeing 787 dreamliner for the aircraft with the highest weight ratio for cfrp which was held at 50% this along with the airbus a400m is one of the first commercial aircraft to have the wing spars made from composites although the a400m isn't the first military aircraft to have structural composite components furthermore the airbus a380 is one of the first commercial airliner to have a central wing box made of cfrp it is the first to have a smoothly contoured wing cross section instead of the wings being partitioned span-wise into sections this flowing continuous cross section optimises aerodynamic efficiency moreover the trailing edge along with the rear bulkhead and empennage and un-pressurized fuselage are made of cfrp however many delays have pushed order delivery dates back because of problems with the manufacturing of these parts many aircraft that use cfrp have experienced delays with delivery dates due to the relatively new processes used to make cfrp components whereas metallic structures have been studied and metallics have been used for years upon airframes and the processes are firmly fixed in place
in 1968 a hyfil carbon-fiber fan assembly was in service on the rolls-royce conways of the vickers vc10s operated by boac
specialist aircraft designer and manufacturer scaled composites have made extensive use of cfrp throughout their design range including the first private manned spacecraft spaceship one cfrp is widely used in micro air vehicles (mavs) because of its high strength to weight ratio
ultralight aircraft (see ssdr) such as the e-go rely heavily on cfrp in order to meet the category weight compliance requirement of less than 115 kg (254 lb) without pilot or fuel
=== automotive engineeringedit ===
carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer is used extensively in high-end automobile racing the high cost of carbon fiber is mitigated by the material's unsurpassed strength-to-weight ratio and low weight is essential for high-performance automobile racing race-car manufacturers have also developed methods to give carbon fiber pieces strength in a certain direction making it strong in a load-bearing direction but weak in directions where little or no load would be placed on the member conversely manufacturers developed omnidirectional carbon fiber weaves that apply strength in all directions this type of carbon fiber assembly is most widely used in the safety cell monocoque chassis assembly of high-performance race-cars
many supercars over the past few decades have incorporated cfrp extensively in their manufacture using it for their monocoque chassis as well as other components as far back as 1971 the citron sm offered optional lightweight carbon fiber wheels
until recently the material has had limited use in mass-produced cars because of the expense involved in terms of materials equipment and the relatively limited pool of individuals with expertise in working with it recently several mainstream vehicle manufacturers have started to use cfrp in everyday road cars
use of the material has been more readily adopted by low-volume manufacturers who used it primarily for creating body-panels for some of their high-end cars due to its increased strength and decreased weight compared with the glass-reinforced polymer they used for the majority of their products
use of carbon fiber in a vehicle can appreciably reduce the weight and hence the size of its frame this will also facilitate designers and engineers creativity and allow more in-cabin space for commuters the new bmw i3 is made with a carbon fiber that not only reduces weight in the car but reduces the amount of water and electricity used to make it
=== civil engineeringedit ===
carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (cfrp) has become a notable material in structural engineering applications studied in an academic context as to its potential benefits in construction it has also proved itself cost-effective in a number of field applications strengthening concrete masonry steel cast iron and timber structures its use in industry can be either for retrofitting to strengthen an existing structure or as an alternative reinforcing (or pre-stressing) material instead of steel from the outset of a project
retrofitting has become the increasingly dominant use of the material in civil engineering and applications include increasing the load capacity of old structures (such as bridges) that were designed to tolerate far lower service loads than they are experiencing today seismic retrofitting and repair of damaged structures retrofitting is popular in many instances as the cost of replacing the deficient structure can greatly exceed its strengthening using cfrp
applied to reinforced concrete structures for flexure cfrp typically has a large impact on strength (doubling or more the strength of the section is not uncommon) but only a moderate increase in stiffness (perhaps a 10% increase) this is because the material used in this application is typically very strong (e.g. 3000 mpa ultimate tensile strength more than 10 times mild steel) but not particularly stiff (150 to 250 gpa a little less than steel is typical) as a consequence only small cross-sectional areas of the material are used small areas of very high strength but moderate stiffness material will significantly increase strength but not stiffness
cfrp can also be applied to enhance shear strength of reinforced concrete by wrapping fabrics or fibers around the section to be strengthened wrapping around sections (such as bridge or building columns) can also enhance the ductility of the section greatly increasing the resistance to collapse under earthquake loading such seismic retrofit is the major application in earthquake-prone areas since it is much more economic than alternative methods
if a column is circular (or nearly so) an increase in axial capacity is also achieved by wrapping in this application the confinement of the cfrp wrap enhances the compressive strength of the concrete however although large increases are achieved in the ultimate collapse load the concrete will crack at only slightly enhanced load meaning that this application is only occasionally used
specialist ultra-high modulus cfrp (with tensile modulus of 420 gpa or more) is one of the few practical methods of strengthening cast-iron beams in typical use it is bonded to the tensile flange of the section both increasing the stiffness of the section and lowering the neutral axis thus greatly reducing the maximum tensile stress in the cast iron
when used as a replacement for steel cfrp bars could be used to reinforce concrete structures however this application is not common
cfrp could be used as pre-stressing materials due to their high strength the advantages of cfrp over steel as a pre-stressing material namely its light weight and corrosion resistance should enable the material to be used for niche applications such as in offshore environments however there are practical difficulties in anchorage of carbon fiber strands and applications of this are rare
in the united states pre-stressed concrete cylinder pipes (pccp) account for a vast majority of water transmission mains due to their large diameters failures of pccp are usually catastrophic and affect large populations approximately 19,000 miles of pccp have been installed between 1940 and 2006 corrosion in the form of hydrogen embrittlement has been blamed for the gradual deterioration of the pre-stressing wires in many pccp lines over the past decade cfrps have been utilized to internally line pccp resulting in a fully structural strengthening system inside a pccp line the cfrp liner acts as a barrier that controls the level of strain experienced by the steel cylinder in the host pipe the composite liner enables the steel cylinder to perform within its elastic range to ensure the pipeline's long-term performance is maintained cfrp liner designs are based on strain compatibility between the liner and host pipe
cfrp is a more costly material than its counterparts in the construction industry glass fiber-reinforced polymer (gfrp) and aramid fiber-reinforced polymer (afrp) though cfrp is in general regarded as having superior properties
much research continues to be done on using cfrp both for retrofitting and as an alternative to steel as a reinforcing or pre-stressing material cost remains an issue and long-term durability questions still remain some are concerned about the brittle nature of cfrp in contrast to the ductility of steel though design codes have been drawn up by institutions such as the american concrete institute there remains some hesitation among the engineering community about implementing these alternative materials in part this is due to a lack of standardization and the proprietary nature of the fiber and resin combinations on the market
=== carbon fiber microelectrodesedit ===
carbon fibers are used for fabrication of carbon-fiber microelectrodes in this application typically a single carbon fiber with diameter of 57 m is sealed in a glass capillary at the tip the capillary is either sealed with epoxy and polished to make carbon-fiber disk microelectrode or the fiber is cut to a length of 75150 m to make carbon-fiber cylinder electrode carbon-fiber microelectrodes are used either in amperometry or fast-scan cyclic voltammetry for detection of biochemical signaling
=== sports goodsedit ===
cfrp is now widely used in sports equipment for the same strength a cfrp bicycle frame weighs less than one of steel aluminum or titanium the type and orientation of the carbon-fiber weave can be designed to maximize stiffness and minimize the chance of failure the variety of shapes it can be built into has further increased stiffness and also allowed aerodynamic tube sections cfrp frames forks including suspension fork crowns and steerers handlebars seatposts and crank arms are becoming more common on medium as well as higher-priced bicycles cfrp wheels while expensive are also becoming popular the higher yield strength of the cfrp rims compared to aluminium reduces the need to re-true a wheel and the reduced mass of the rim also reduces the moment of inertia of the wheel since it is a rotating component rarely the spokes of the wheel can be made from cfrp but most carbon wheelsets still use traditional stainless steel spokes some other less common uses of cfrp on bicycles include derailleur parts brake and shifter levers and lever bodies cassette sprocket carriers suspension linkages disc brake rotors pedals shoe soles and saddle rails
cfrp is used in squash tennis and badminton racquets sport kite spars high quality arrow shafts hockey sticks fishing rods surfboards and rowing shells amputee athletes such as oscar pistorius use carbon fiber blades for running it is used as a shank plate in some basketball sneakers to keep the foot stable usually running the length of the shoe just above the sole and left exposed in some areas usually in the arch
in 2006 cricket bats with a thin carbon-fiber layer on the back were introduced and used in competitive matches by high-profile players including ricky ponting and michael hussey the carbon fiber was claimed merely to increase the durability of the bats but was banned from all first-class matches by the icc in 2007
although lighter and stiffer than items made of traditional metals cfrp may under some circumstances show significant rates of cracking and failure this can occur as because of impact or if components are over-torqued or improperly installed but it is possible for broken carbon frames to be repaired
=== other applicationsedit ===
the fire resistance of polymers and thermo-set composites is significantly improved if a thin layer of carbon fibers is moulded near the surface because a dense compact layer of carbon fibers efficiently reflects heat
cfrp is also finding application in an increasing number of high-end products that require stiffness and low weight these include
laptop cases by an increasing number of manufacturers
audio components such as turntables and loudspeakers
musical instruments including violin bows guitar pick-guards drum shells bagpipe chanters and entire musical instruments such as luis and clark's carbon fiber cellos violas and violins and blackbird guitars acoustic guitars and ukuleles
kite systems use carbon fiber reinforced rods to obtain shapes and performances previously not possible
firearms use it to replace certain metal wood and fiberglass components but many of the internal parts are still limited to metal alloys as current reinforced plastics are unsuitable
high-performance radio-controlled vehicle and aircraft components such as helicopter rotor blades
tripod legs tent poles fishing rods billiards cues walking sticks
many other light and durable consumer items such as the handles of high-end knives
poles for high reach e.g poles used by window cleaners and water fed poles
in dentistry carbon fiber posts are used in restoring root canal treated teeth
== disposal and recyclingedit ==
carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (cfrps) have a long service lifetime when protected from the sun when it is time to decommission cfrps they cannot be melted down in air like many metals when free of vinyl (pvc or polyvinyl chloride) and other halogenated polymers cfrps can be thermally decomposed via thermal depolymerization in an oxygen-free environment this can be accomplished in a refinery in a one-step process capture and reuse of the carbon and monomers is then possible cfrps can also be milled or shredded at low temperature to reclaim the carbon fiber however this process shortens the fibers dramatically just as with downcycled paper the shortened fibers cause the recycled material to be weaker than the original material there are still many industrial applications that do not need the strength of full-length carbon fiber reinforcement for example chopped reclaimed carbon fiber can be used in consumer electronics such as laptops it provides excellent reinforcement of the polymers used even if it lacks the strength-to-weight ratio of an aerospace component
== carbon nano-tube reinforced polymer (cnrp)edit ==
in 2009 zyvex technologies introduced carbon nanotube-reinforced epoxy and carbon prepregs carbon nanotube reinforced polymer (cnrp) is several times stronger and tougher than cfrp and was used in the lockheed martin f-35 lightning ii as a structural material for aircraft cnrp still uses carbon fiber as the primary reinforcement but the binding matrix is a carbon nano-tube filled epoxy
