united nations general assembly adopted five declarations legal principles encourage exercising international laws well unified communication countries five declarations principles
declaration legal principles governing activities states exploration uses outer space
space exploration done good intentions equally open states comply international law one nation may claim ownership outer space celestial body activities carried space must abide international law nations undergoing said activities must accept responsibility governmental nongovernmental agency involved objects launched space subject nation belonging including people objects parts components discovered outside jurisdiction nation returned upon identification nation launches object space responsible damages occur internationally

principles relating remote sensing earth outer space
fifteen principles stated category basic understanding comes descriptions given united nations office outer space affairs
term remote sensing means sensing earths surface space making use properties electromagnetic waves emitted reflected diffracted sensed objects purpose improving natural resources management land use protection environment
b term primary data means raw data acquired remote sensors borne space object transmitted delivered ground space telemetry form electromagnetic signals photographic film magnetic tape means
c term processed data means products resulting processing primary data needed make data usable
d term analysed information means information resulting interpretation processed data inputs data knowledge sources
e term remote sensing activities means operation remote sensing space systems primary data collection storage stations activities processing interpreting disseminating processed data
principles relevant use nuclear power sources outer space
states launching space objects nuclear power sources board shall endeavour protect individuals populations biosphere radiological hazards design use space objects nuclear power sources board shall ensure high degree confidence hazards foreseeable operational accidental circumstances kept acceptable levels
declaration international cooperation exploration use outer space benefit interest states taking particular account needs developing countries
states free determine aspects participation international cooperation exploration use outer space equitable mutually acceptable basis states particularly relevant space capabilities programmes exploration use outer space contribute promoting fostering international cooperation equitable mutually acceptable basis context particular attention given benefit interests developing countries countries incipient space programmes stemming international cooperation conducted countries advanced space capabilities international cooperation conducted modes considered effective appropriate countries concerned including inter alia governmental nongovernmental commercial noncommercial global multilateral regional bilateral international cooperation among countries levels development
consensus
united nations committee peaceful uses outer space scientific technical legal subcommittees operate basis consensus ie delegations member states must agree matter treaty language included final version treaty new items committeesubcommittees agendas one reason un space treaties lack definitions unclear respects easier achieve consensus language terms vague recent years legal subcommittee unable achieve consensus discussion new comprehensive space agreement idea though proposed member states also unlikely subcommittee able agree amend outer space treaty foreseeable future many space faring nations seem believe discussing new space agreement amendment outer space treaty would futile time consuming entrenched differences regarding resource appropriation property rights issues relating commercial activity make consensus unlikely
iss agreement
addition international treaties negotiated united nations nations participating international space station entered agreement among governments canada member states european space agency japan russian federation united states america concerning cooperation civil international space station space station agreement agreement provides among things nasa lead agency coordinating member states contributions activities space station nation jurisdiction modules agreement also provides protection intellectual property procedures criminal prosecution agreement may well serve model future agreements regarding international cooperation facilities moon mars first offworld colonies scientificindustrial bases likely established
national law
space law also encompasses national laws many countries passed national space legislation recent years outer space treaty requires parties authorize supervise national space activities including activities nongovernmental entities commercial nonprofit organizations outer space treaty also incorporates un charter reference requires parties ensure activities conducted accordance forms international law customary international law custom practice states
advent commercial space activities beyond scope satellite communications industry development many commercial spaceports leading many countries consider regulate private space activities challenge regulate activities manner hinder preclude investment still ensuring commercial activities comply international law developing nations concerned spacefaring nations monopolize space resources however may resolved simply extending united nations convention law sea outer space
may united states congress passed space resource exploration utilization act
geostationary orbit allocation
satellites geostationary orbit must occupy single ring equator approximately km space requirement space satellites apart means limited number orbital slots available thus limited number satellites placed geostationary orbit led conflict different countries wishing access orbital slots countries longitude differing latitudes disputes addressed itu allocation mechanism countries located earths equator also asserted legal claim control use space territory notably many countries located earths equator created bogota declaration asserted legal claim control use space territory
future
field law still infancy era rapid change development arguably resources space infinite commercial space transportation becomes widely available substantially lower launch costs countries able directly reap benefits space resources situation seems likely consensus much easier achieve respect commercial development human settlement outer space high costs factor preventing economic exploitation space argued space considered pristine environment worthy protection conservation legal regime space protect used resource earths needs debate also focused whether space continue legally defined part common heritage man therefore unavailable national claims whether legal definition changed allow private property space
