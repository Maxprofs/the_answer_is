extortion (also called shakedown outwrestling and exaction) is a criminal offense of obtaining money property or services from a person entity individual or institution through coercion it is sometimes euphemistically referred to as a protection racket since the racketeers often phrase their demands as payment for protection from (real or hypothetical) threats from unspecified other parties extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime groups the actual obtainment of money or property is not required to commit the offense making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force but additionally in its formal definition means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant
extortion is distinguished from robbery in robbery whether armed or not the offender takes property from the victim by the immediate use of force or fear that force will be immediately used (as in the classic line your money or your life.") extortion which is not limited to the taking of property involves the verbal or written instillation of fear that something will happen to the victim if they do not comply with the extortionist's will another key distinction is that extortion always involves a verbal or written threat whereas robbery does not in united states federal law extortion can be committed with or without the use of force and with or without the use of a weapon
in blackmail which always involves extortion the extortionist threatens to reveal information about a victim or their family members that is potentially embarrassing socially damaging or incriminating unless a demand for money property or services is met
the term extortion is often used metaphorically to refer to usury or to price-gouging though neither is legally considered extortion it is also often used loosely to refer to everyday situations where one person feels indebted against their will to another in order to receive an essential service or avoid legal consequences
