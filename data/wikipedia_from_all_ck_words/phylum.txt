in biology a phylum (/falm/ plural phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class traditionally in botany the term division was used instead of phylum although from 1993 the international code of nomenclature for algae fungi and plants accepted the designation phylum the kingdom animalia contains approximately 35 phyla plantae contains 12 and fungi contains 7 current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla which are contained in larger clades like ecdysozoa and embryophyta
== general description and familiar examplesedit ==
the definitions of zoological phyla have changed importantly from their origins in the six linnaean classes and the four embranchements of georges cuvier haeckel introduced the term phylum based on the greek word phylon in plant taxonomy eichler (1883) classified plants into five groups named divisions
informally phyla can be thought of as grouping organisms based on general specialization of body plan at its most basic a phylum can be defined in two ways as a group of organisms with a certain degree of morphological or developmental similarity (the phenetic definition) or a group of organisms with a certain degree of evolutionary relatedness (the phylogenetic definition) attempting to define a level of the linnean hierarchy without referring to (evolutionary) relatedness is unsatisfactory but a phenetic definition is useful when addressing questions of a morphological naturesuch as how successful different body plans were
=== definition based on genetic relationedit ===
the most important objective measure in the above definitions is the certain degree"how unrelated do organisms need to be to be members of different phyla the minimal requirement is that all organisms in a phylum should be clearly more closely related to one another than to any other group even this is problematic because the requirement depends on knowledge of organisms relationships as more data become available particularly from molecular studies we are better able to judge the relationships between groups so phyla can be merged or split if it becomes apparent that they are related to one another or not for example the bearded worms were described as a new phylum (the pogonophora) in the middle of the 20th century but molecular work almost half a century later found them to be a group of annelids so the phyla were merged (the bearded worms are now an annelid family) on the other hand the highly parasitic phylum mesozoa was divided into two phyla orthonectida and rhombozoa when it was discovered the orthonectida are probably deuterostomes and the rhombozoa protostomes
this changeability of phyla has led some biologists to call for the concept of a phylum to be abandoned in favour of cladistics a method in which groups are placed on a family tree without any formal ranking of group size
=== definition based on body planedit ===
a definition of a phylum based on body plan has been proposed by paleontologists graham budd and sren jensen (as haeckel had done a century earlier) the definition was posited because extinct organisms are hardest to classify they can be offshoots that diverged from a phylum's line before the characters that define the modern phylum were all acquired by budd and jensen's definition a phylum is defined by a set of characters shared by all its living representatives
this approach brings some small problemsfor instance ancestral characters common to most members of a phylum may have been lost by some members also this definition is based on an arbitrary point of time the present however as it is character based it is easy to apply to the fossil record a greater problem is that it relies on a subjective decision about which groups of organisms should be considered as phyla
the approach is useful because it makes it easy to classify extinct organisms as stem groups to the phyla with which they bear the most resemblance based only on the taxonomically important similarities however proving that a fossil belongs to the crown group of a phylum is difficult as it must display a character unique to a sub-set of the crown group furthermore organisms in the stem group of a phylum can possess the body plan of the phylum without all the characteristics necessary to fall within it this weakens the idea that each of the phyla represents a distinct body plan
a classification using this definition may be strongly affected by the chance survival of rare groups which can make a phylum much more diverse than it would be otherwise representatives of many modern phyla did not appear until long after the cambrian

=== animal phylaedit ===
=== land plant phyla (divisions)edit ===
the ten divisions into which the living embryophytes (land plants) are often placed are shown in the table below to these may be added two algal divisions chlorophyta and charophyta which are included with land plants in the clade viridiplantae (see also current definitions of plantae) the definition and classification of plants at this level varies from source to source and has changed progressively in recent years thus some sources place horsetails in division arthrophyta and ferns in division pteridophyta while others place them both in pteridophyta as shown below the division pinophyta may be used for all gymnosperms (i.e including cycads ginkgos and gnetophytes) or for conifers alone as below
since the first publication of the apg system in 1998 which proposed a classification of angiosperms up to the level of orders many sources have preferred to treat ranks higher than orders as informal clades where formal ranks have been provided the traditional divisions listed below have been reduced to a very much lower level e.g subclasses
