varve annual layer sediment sedimentary rock
word varve derives swedish word varv whose meanings connotations include revolution layers circle term first appeared hvarfig lera varved clay first map produced geological survey sweden initially varve referred separate components annual layers glacial lake sediments geological congress swedish geologist gerard de geer proposed new formal definition varve means whole annual sedimentary layer recently introduced terms annually laminated synonymous varve
many rhythmites geological record varves one important illuminating studies past climate change varves amongst smallestscale events recognised stratigraphy
annual layer highly visible particles washed layer spring greater flow strength much coarser deposited later year forms pair layersone coarse one finefor annual cycle varves form fresh brackish water high levels salt normal sea water coagulate clay coarse grains since saline waters leave coarse particles year nearly impossible distinguish individual layers salt waters indeed clay flocculation occurs high ionic strength due collapse clay electrical double layer edl decreases electrostatic repulsion negatively charged clay particles
history varve researchedit
although term varve introduced late nineteenth century concept annual rhythm deposition least two centuries old hitchcock suspected laminated sediment north america could seasonal warren upham postulated lightdark laminated couplets represented single years deposition despite earlier forays chief pioneer populariser varve research gerard de geer working geological survey sweden de geer noticed close visual similarity laminated sediments mapping treerings prompted suggest coarsefine couplets frequently found sediments glacial lakes annual layers
first varve chronology constructed de geer stockholm late th century work soon followed network sites along east coast sweden established varved sediments exposed sites formed glaciolacustrine glacimarine conditions baltic basin last ice sheet retreated northwards de geer discovered possible compare varve sequences across long distances matching variations varve thickness distinct marker laminae however discovery led de geer many coworkers making incorrect correlations called teleconnections continents process criticised varve pioneers like ernst antevs
geochronological institute special laboratory dedicated varve research established de geer coworkers students made trips countries continents investigate varved sediments ernst antevs studied sites long island usa lake timiskaming hudson bay canada created north american varve chronology carl caldenius visited patagonia tierra del fuego erik norin visited central asia stage geologists investigating varve sequences including matti sauramo constructed varve chronology last deglaciation finland

although varves considered likely give similar information dendrochronology considered uncertain use longterm timescale however missing varves lake suigetsu sequence identified lake suigetsu project overlapping multiple cores improved varve counting techniques extending timescale years
formationedit
varves form variety marine lacustrine depositional environments seasonal variation clastic biological chemical sedimentary processes
classic varve archetype light dark coloured couplet deposited glacial lake light layer usually comprises coarser laminaset silt fine sand deposited higher energy conditions meltwater introduces sediment load lake water winter months meltwater associated suspended sediment input reduced often lake surface freezes fine claysize sediment deposited forming dark coloured laminaset
addition seasonal variation sedimentary processes deposition varve formation requires absence bioturbation consequently varves commonly form anoxic conditions
wellknown marine example varve sediments found santa barbara basin california
