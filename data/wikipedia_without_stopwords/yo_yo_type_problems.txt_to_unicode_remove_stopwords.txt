prokaryotesedit
prokaryotes bacteria archaea typically single circular chromosome many variations exist chromosomes bacteria range size base pairs endosymbiotic bacteria candidatus hodgkinia cicadicola candidatus tremblaya princeps base pairs soildwelling bacterium sorangium cellulosum spirochaetes genus borrelia notable exception arrangement bacteria borrelia burgdorferi cause lyme disease containing single linear chromosome
structure sequencesedit
prokaryotic chromosomes less sequencebased structure eukaryotes bacteria typically single point origin replication replication starts whereas archaea contain multiple replication origins genes prokaryotes often organized operons usually contain introns unlike eukaryotes
dna packagingedit
prokaryotes possess nuclei instead dna organized structure called nucleoid nucleoid distinct structure occupies defined region bacterial cell structure however dynamic maintained remodeled actions range histonelike proteins associate bacterial chromosome archaea dna chromosomes even organized dna packaged within structures similar eukaryotic nucleosomes
bacterial chromosomes tend tethered plasma membrane bacteria molecular biology application allows isolation plasmid dna centrifugation lysed bacteria pelleting membranes attached dna
prokaryotic chromosomes plasmids like eukaryotic dna generally supercoiled dna must first released relaxed state access transcription regulation replication
eukaryotesedit
eukaryotes nuclear chromosomes packaged proteins condensed structure called chromatin allows long dna molecules fit cell nucleus structure chromosomes chromatin varies cell cycle chromosomes even condensed chromatin essential unit cellular division chromosomes must replicated divided passed successfully daughter cells ensure genetic diversity survival progeny chromosomes may exist either duplicated unduplicated unduplicated chromosomes single linear strands whereas duplicated chromosomes contain two identical copies called chromatids sister chromatids joined centromere
eukaryotes cells nuclei found plants yeast animals possess multiple large linear chromosomes contained cells nucleus chromosome one centromere one two arms projecting centromere although circumstances arms visible addition eukaryotes small circular mitochondrial genome eukaryotes may additional small circular linear cytoplasmic chromosomes
nuclear chromosomes eukaryotes uncondensed dna exists semiordered structure wrapped around histones structural proteins forming composite material called chromatin
chromatinedit
chromatin complex dna protein found eukaryotic nucleus packages chromosomes structure chromatin varies significantly different stages cell cycle according requirements dna
interphase chromatinedit
interphase period cell cycle cell dividing two types chromatin distinguished
euchromatin consists dna active eg expressed protein
heterochromatin consists mostly inactive dna seems serve structural purposes chromosomal stages heterochromatin distinguished two types
constitutive heterochromatin never expressed located around centromere usually contains repetitive sequences
facultative heterochromatin sometimes expressed
metaphase chromatin divisionedit
early stages mitosis meiosis cell division chromatin strands become condensed cease function accessible genetic material transcription stops become compact transportable form compact form makes individual chromosomes visible form classic four arm structure pair sister chromatids attached centromere shorter arms called p arms french petit small longer arms called q arms q follows p latin alphabet qg grande alternatively sometimes said q short queue meaning tail french natural context individual chromosomes visible optical microscope
mitosis microtubules grow centrosomes located opposite ends cell also attach centromere specialized structures called kinetochores one present sister chromatid special dna base sequence region kinetochores provides along special proteins longerlasting attachment region microtubules pull chromatids apart toward centrosomes daughter cell inherits one set chromatids cells divided chromatids uncoiled dna transcribed spite appearance chromosomes structurally highly condensed enables giant dna structures contained within cell nucleus fig
human chromosomesedit
chromosomes humans divided two types autosomes sex chromosomes certain genetic traits linked persons sex passed sex chromosomes autosomes contain rest genetic hereditary information act way cell division human cells pairs chromosomes pairs autosomes one pair sex chromosomes giving total per cell addition human cells many hundreds copies mitochondrial genome sequencing human genome provided great deal information chromosomes table compiling statistics chromosomes based sanger institutes human genome information vertebrate genome annotation vega database number genes estimate part based gene predictions total chromosome length estimate well based estimated size unsequenced heterochromatin regions
number chromosomes various organismsedit
eukaryotesedit
tables give total number chromosomes including sex chromosomes cell nucleus example human cells diploid different types autosome present two copies two sex chromosomes gives chromosomes total organisms two copies chromosome types bread wheat hexaploid six copies seven different chromosome types chromosomes total
normal members particular eukaryotic species number nuclear chromosomes see table eukaryotic chromosomes ie mitochondrial plasmidlike small chromosomes much variable number may thousands copies per cell
asexually reproducing species one set chromosomes body cells however asexual species either haploid diploid
sexually reproducing species somatic cells body cells diploid n two sets chromosomes pairs humans one set chromosomes parent one set mother one father gametes reproductive cells haploid n one set chromosomes gametes produced meiosis diploid germ line cell meiosis matching chromosomes father mother exchange small parts crossover thus create new chromosomes inherited solely either parent male female gamete merge fertilization new diploid organism formed
animal plant species polyploid xn two sets homologous chromosomes plants important agriculture tobacco wheat often polyploid compared ancestral species wheat haploid number seven chromosomes still seen cultivars well wild progenitors morecommon pasta bread wheats polyploid tetraploid hexaploid chromosomes compared diploid chromosomes wild wheat
prokaryotesedit
prokaryote species generally one copy major chromosome cells easily survive multiple copies example buchnera symbiont aphids multiple copies chromosome ranging copies per cell however large bacteria epulopiscium fishelsoni copies chromosome present plasmids plasmidlike small chromosomes eukaryotes highly variable copy number number plasmids cell almost entirely determined rate division plasmid fast division causes high copy number
karyotypeedit
general karyotype characteristic chromosome complement eukaryote species preparation study karyotypes part cytogenetics
although replication transcription dna highly standardized eukaryotes cannot said karyotypes often highly variable may variation species chromosome number detailed organization cases significant variation within species often
variation two sexes
variation germline soma gametes rest body
variation members population due balanced genetic polymorphism
geographical variation races
mosaics otherwise abnormal individuals
also variation karyotype may occur development fertilised egg
technique determining karyotype usually called karyotyping cells locked partway division metaphase vitro reaction vial colchicine cells stained photographed arranged karyogram set chromosomes arranged autosomes order length sex chromosomes xy end fig
like many sexually reproducing species humans special gonosomes sex chromosomes contrast autosomes xx females xy males
historical noteedit
investigation human karyotype took many years settle basic question many chromosomes normal diploid human cell contain hans von winiwarter reported chromosomes spermatogonia oogonia concluding xxxo sex determination mechanism painter certain whether diploid number man first favouring revised opinion later correctly insisted humans xxxy system
new techniques needed definitively solve problem
using cells culture
arresting mitosis metaphase solution colchicine
pretreating cells hypotonic solution m kcl swells spreads chromosomes
squashing preparation slide forcing chromosomes single plane
cutting photomicrograph arranging result indisputable karyogram
took human diploid number confirmed considering techniques winiwarter painter results quite remarkable chimpanzees closest living relatives modern humans chromosomes well great apes humans two chromosomes fused form chromosome
