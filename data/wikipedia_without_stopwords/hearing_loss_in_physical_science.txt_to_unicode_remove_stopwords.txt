pathophysiology
neurobiological perspective three reasons could cause person hearing loss either something wrong mechanical portion process meaning conductive portions ear external middle ear something wrong sensory portion process inner ear cochlea related structures something wrong neural portion process meaning nerves brain
process understanding sound travels brain imperative understanding two reasons would cause person develops hearing loss process follows sound waves transmitted outer ear sound waves conducted ear canal bringing sound waves eardrum vibrate vibrations passed tiny ear bones middle cause fluid move inner ear fluid moves hair cells movement hair cells cause vibrations converted nerve impulses nerve impulses taken brain auditory nerve auditory nerve takes impulses medulla oblongata brainstem send impulses midbrain finally goes auditory cortex temporal lobe interpreted sound
process complex involves several steps depend previous step order vibrations nerve impulses passed anything goes wrong either mechanical neural portion process could result sound processed brain hence leading hearing loss
lesions auditory association cortex produced physical trauma result deafness problems auditory perception place lesion occurs auditory cortex plays important role type hearing deficit occur person study conducted clarke et al tested three subjects ability identify produced environmental sound source sound whether source moving three subjects trauma different parts auditory cortex patient demonstrated different set auditory deficits suggesting different parts auditory cortex controlled different parts hearing process means lesion one part auditory cortex could result one two deficits would take larger lesions right parts produce deafness

health care
communication barriers deaf hearing people affect family relationships work school also significant effect deaf individuals health care result poor communication health care professional hearing impaired patient many patients report properly informed disease prognosis lack poor communication could also lead issues misdiagnosis poor assessments mistreatment even possibly harm patients poor communication setting often result health care providers misconception people hearing impaired type hearing loss require type communication methods reality many different types range hearing loss order communicate effectively health care provider needs understand individual hearing loss unique needs affects individuals educated communicate communication methods work better depending individuals severity hearing loss example assuming every hearing impaired patient knows american sign language would incorrect different types sign language varying signs meanings patient could educated use cued speech entirely different asl therefore order communicate effectively health care provider needs understand individual unique needs communicating
although specific laws rules govern communication health care professionals people deaf always followed due health care professionals insufficient knowledge communication techniques lack knowledge lead make assumptions communicating someone deaf turn cause use unsuitable form communication acts countries americans disabilities act ada state health care providers required provide reasonable communication accommodations caring patients deaf accommodations could include qualified sign language interpreters cdis technology internet interpretation services qualified sign language interpreter enhance communication deaf individual health care professional interpreting health professionals verbal communication also nonverbal expressions perceptions body language certified deaf interpreter cdi sign language interpreter also member deaf community accompany sign language interpreter useful communication deaf individuals also language cognitive deficits cdi transform health care professional communicates basic simple language method takes much longer however also effective techniques internet interpretation services convenient less costly potentially pose significant risks involve use sign language interpreter video device rather directly room often inaccurate form communication interpreter may licensed often unfamiliar patient signs lack knowledge medical terminology
aside utilizing interpreters healthcare professionals improve communication hearing impaired patients educating common misconceptions proper practices depending patients needs example common misconception exaggerating words speaking loudly help patient understand clearly however many individuals hearing loss depend lipreading identify words exaggerated pronunciation raised voice distort lips making even difficult understand another common mistake health care professionals make use single words rather full sentences although language kept simple short keeping context important certain homophonous words difficult distinguish lipreading health care professionals improve communication patients eliminating background noise positioning way face clearly visible patient suitably lit healthcare professional know use body language facial expressions properly communicate different feelings
