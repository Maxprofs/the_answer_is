from each according to his ability to each according to his needs (french de chacun selon ses facults chacun selon ses besoins german jeder nach seinen fhigkeiten jedem nach seinen bedrfnissen) is a slogan first used by louis blanc in 1851 (although an earlier version of the saying appeared in tienne-gabriel morelly's the code of nature) and popularised by karl marx in his 1875 critique of the gotha program the principle refers to free access and distribution of goods and services in the marxist view such an arrangement will be made possible by the abundance of goods and services that a developed communist system will produce the idea is that with the full development of socialism and unfettered productive forces there will be enough to satisfy everyone's needs
== origin of the phrase ==
the complete paragraph containing marx's statement of the creed in the critique of the gotha program is as follows
in a higher phase of communist society after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor has vanished after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantlyonly then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners from each according to his ability to each according to his needs
although marx is popularly thought of as the originator of the phrase the slogan was common to the socialist movement and was first used by louis blanc in 1851 the origin of this phrasing has also been attributed to the french utopian tienne-gabriel morelly who proposed in his 1755 code of nature sacred and fundamental laws that would tear out the roots of vice and of all the evils of a society including
i nothing in society will belong to anyone either as a personal possession or as capital goods except the things for which the person has immediate use for either his needs his pleasures or his daily work
ii every citizen will be a public man sustained by supported by and occupied at the public expense
iii every citizen will make his particular contribution to the activities of the community according to his capacity his talent and his age it is on this basis that his duties will be determined in conformity with the distributive laws
some scholars trace the origin of the phrase to the new testament in acts of the apostles the lifestyle of the community of believers in jerusalem is described as communal (without individual possession) and uses the phrase distribution was made unto every man according as he had need
acts 4:3235 32 and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common 33 and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all 34 neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold 35 and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need
== debates on the idea ==
marx delineated the specific conditions under which such a creed would be applicablea society where technology and social organization had substantially eliminated the need for physical labor in the production of things where labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want marx explained his belief that in such a society each person would be motivated to work for the good of society despite the absence of a social mechanism compelling them to work because work would have become a pleasurable and creative activity marx intended the initial part of his slogan from each according to his ability to suggest not merely that each person should work as hard as they can but that each person should best develop their particular talents
claiming themselves to be at a lower stage of communism (i.e socialism in line with marx's terminology) the soviet union adapted the formula as from each according to his ability to each according to his work (labour investment)
while liberation theology has sought to interpret the christian call for justice in a way that is in harmony with this marxist dictum some christians have noted that jesus teaching in the parable of the talents (matthew 25:1430) gives only half an affirmation to the dictum to the first half
