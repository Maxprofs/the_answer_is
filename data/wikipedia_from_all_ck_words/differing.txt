== definition ==
in the absence of agreement about its meaning the term social is used in many different senses and regarded as a fuzzy concept referring among other things to
attitudes orientations or behaviors which take the interests intentions or needs of other people into account (in contrast to anti-social behaviour) has played some role in defining the idea or the principle for instance terms like social realism social justice social constructivism social psychology social anarchism and social capital imply that there is some social process involved or considered a process that is not there in regular non-social realism justice constructivism psychology anarchism or capital
the adjective social is also used often in political discourse although its meaning in a context depends heavily on who is using it in left-wing circles it is often used to imply a liberal characteristic while in right-wing circles it is generally used to imply a conservative characteristic it should also be noted that overall this adjective is used much more often by those on the political left than by those on the political right for these reasons those seeking to avoid association with the left-right political debates often seek to label their work with phrases that do not include the word social an example is quasi-empiricism in mathematics which is sometimes labelled social constructivism by those who see it as an unwarranted intrusion of social considerations in mathematical practice
== social theorists ==
in the view of karl marx human beings are intrinsically necessarily and by definition social beings who beyond being gregarious creatures cannot survive and meet their needs other than through social co-operation and association their social characteristics are therefore to a large extent an objectively given fact stamped on them from birth and affirmed by socialization processes and according to marx in producing and reproducing their material life people must necessarily enter into relations of production which are independent of their will
by contrast the sociologist max weber for example defines human action as social if by virtue of the subjective meanings attached to the action by individuals it takes account of the behavior of others and is thereby oriented in its course
== social in socialism ==
the term socialism used from the 1830s onwards in france and the united kingdom was directly related to what was called the social question in essence early socialists contended that the emergence of competitive market societies did not create liberty equality and fraternity for all citizens requiring the intervention of politics and social reform to tackle social problems injustices and grievances (a topic on which jean-jacques rousseau discourses at length in his classic work the social contract) originally the term socialist was often used interchangeably with co-operative mutualist associationist and collectivist in reference to the organization of economic enterprise socialists advocated in contrast to the private enterprise and corporate organizational structures inherent to capitalism
the modern concept of socialism evolved in response to the development of industrial capitalism the social in modern socialism came to refer to the specific perspective and understanding socialists had of the development of material economic forces and determinants of human behavior in society specifically it denoted the perspective that human behavior is largely determined by a person's immediate social environment that modes of social organization were not supernatural or metaphysical constructs but products of the social system and social environment which were in turn products of the level of technology/mode of production (the material world) and were therefore constantly changing social and economic systems were thus not the product of innate human nature but of the underlying form of economic organization and level of technology in a given society implying that human social relations and incentive-structures would also change as social relations and social organization changes in response to improvements in technology and evolving material forces (relations of production) this perspective formed the bulk of the foundation for karl marx's materialist conception of history
== modern uses ==
in contemporary society social often refers to the redistributive policies of the government which aim to apply resources in the public interest for example social security policy concerns then include the problems of social exclusion and social cohesion here social contrasts with private and to the distinction between the public and the private (or privatised) spheres where ownership relations define access to resources and attention
the social domain is often also contrasted with that of physical nature but in sociobiology analogies are drawn between humans and other living species in order to explain social behavior in terms of biological factors the term social is also added in various other academic sub-disciplines such as social geography social psychology social anthropology social philosophy social ontology social statistics and social choice theory in mathematics
