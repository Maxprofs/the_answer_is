nonstandard nucleosides also found rna dna usually arise modification standard nucleosides within dna molecule primary initial rna transcript transfer rna trna molecules contain particularly large number modified nucleosides
topologyedit
doublestranded nucleic acids made complementary sequences extensive watsoncrick base pairing results highly repeated quite uniform doublehelical threedimensional structure contrast singlestranded rna dna molecules constrained regular double helix adopt highly complex threedimensional structures based short stretches intramolecular basepaired sequences include watsoncrick noncanonical base pairs well wide range complex tertiary interactions
nucleic acid molecules usually unbranched may occur linear circular molecules example bacterial chromosomes plasmids mitochondrial dna chloroplast dna usually circular doublestranded dna molecules chromosomes eukaryotic nucleus usually linear doublestranded dna molecules rna molecules linear singlestranded molecules circular branched molecules result rna splicing reactions
nucleic acid sequencesedit
