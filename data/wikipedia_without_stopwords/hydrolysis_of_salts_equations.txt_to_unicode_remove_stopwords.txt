chemistry salt ionic compound results neutralization reaction acid base salts composed related numbers cations positively charged ions anions negative ions product electrically neutral without net charge component ions inorganic chloride cl organic acetate chco monatomic fluoride f polyatomic sulfate
several varieties salts salts hydrolyze produce hydroxide ions dissolved water basic salts whilst hydrolyze produce hydronium ions water acidic salts neutral salts neither acid basic salts zwitterions contain anionic centre cationic centre molecule considered salts examples zwitterions include amino acids many metabolites peptides proteins
usually nondissolved salts standard temperature pressure solid exceptions see molten salts ionic liquids
molten salts solutions containing dissolved salts eg sodium chloride water called electrolytes able conduct electricity observed cytoplasm cells blood urine plant saps mineral waters mixtures many different ions solution usually form defined salts evaporation water therefore salt content given respective ions
propertiesedit
coloredit
salts appear clear transparent sodium chloride opaque even metallic lustrous iron disulfide many cases apparent opacity transparency related difference size individual monocrystals since light reflects grain boundaries boundaries crystallites larger crystals tend transparent polycrystalline aggregates look like white powders
salts exist many different colors example
yellow sodium chromate
orange potassium dichromate
red cobalt nitrate
mauve cobalt chloride hexahydrate
blue copper sulfate pentahydrate ferric hexacyanoferrate
purple potassium permanganate
green nickel chloride hexahydrate
colorless sodium chloride magnesium sulfate heptahydratemay appear white powdered small pieces
minerals inorganic pigments well many synthetic organic dyes salts color specific salt due electronic structure dorbitals transition elements conjugated organic dye framework
tasteedit
different salts elicit five basic tastes eg salty sodium chloride sweet lead diacetate cause lead poisoning ingested sour potassium bitartrate bitter magnesium sulfate umami savory monosodium glutamate
odoredit
salts strong acids strong bases strong salts nonvolatile odorless whereas salts either weak acids weak bases weak salts may smell conjugate acid eg acetates like acetic acid vinegar cyanides like hydrogen cyanide almonds conjugate base eg ammonium salts like ammonia component ions slow partial decomposition usually accelerated presence water since hydrolysis half reversible reaction equation formation weak salts
solubilityedit
many ionic compounds dissolved water similar solvents exact combination ions involved makes compound unique solubility solvent solubility dependent well ion interacts solvent certain patterns example salts sodium potassium ammonium soluble water nitrates many sulfates barium sulfate calcium sulfate sparingly soluble lead sulfate exceptions however ions bind tightly form highly stable lattices less soluble harder structures break apart compounds dissolve example carbonate salts soluble water lead carbonate barium carbonate soluble carbonate salts sodium carbonate potassium carbonate ammonium carbonate
conductivityedit
solid salts conduct electricity however liquid salts moreover solutions salts also conduct electricity
nomenclatureedit
name salt starts name cation eg sodium ammonium followed name anion eg chloride acetate salts often referred name cation eg sodium salt ammonium salt name anion eg chloride salt acetate salt
