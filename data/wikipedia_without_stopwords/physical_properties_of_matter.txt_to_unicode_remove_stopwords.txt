point threephase coexistence termed triple point onecomponent system since gibbs phase rule condition achieved single point phase diagram f tricritical points observed one needs mixture components shown three minimum number components points appear case one may twodimensional region threephase coexistence f thus point region corresponds triple point region terminate two critical lines phase coexistence two critical lines may terminate single tricritical point point therefore twice critical since belong two critical branches indeed critical behavior different conventional critical point upper critical dimension lowered d d classical exponents turn apply real systems three dimensions systems whose spatial dimension lower
seems convenient experimentally consider mixtures four components one thermodynamic variable usually pressure volume kept fixed situation reduces one described mixtures three components
historically long time unclear whether superconductor undergoes first secondorder phase transition question finally settled ginzburglandau parameter distinguishes typei typeii superconductors see also large enough vortex fluctuations become important drive transition second order tricritical point lies roughly ie slightly value typei goes typeii superconductor prediction confirmed monte carlo computer simulations
