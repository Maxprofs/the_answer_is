incandescence is the emission of electromagnetic radiation (including visible light) from a hot body as a result of its temperature the term derives from the latin verb incandescere to glow white
incandescence is a special case of thermal radiation incandescence usually refers specifically to visible light while thermal radiation refers also to infrared or any other electromagnetic radiation
for a detailed discussion of the intensity and spectrum (color) of incandescence see the article thermal radiation
== observation and useedit ==
in practice virtually all solid or liquid substances start to glow around 798 k (525 c) (977 degrees f) with a mildly dull red color when no chemical reactions take place that produce light as a result of an exothermic process this limit is called the draper point the incandescence does not vanish below that temperature but it is too weak in the visible spectrum to be perceivable
at higher temperatures the substance becomes brighter and its color changes from red towards white and finally blue
incandescence is exploited in incandescent light bulbs in which a filament is heated to a temperature at which a fraction of the radiation falls in the visible spectrum the majority of the radiation however is emitted in the infrared part of the spectrum rendering incandescent lights relatively inefficient as a light source if the filament could be made hotter efficiency would increase however there are currently no materials able to withstand such temperatures which would be appropriate for use in lamps
more efficient light sources such as fluorescent lamps and leds do not function by incandescence
sunlight is the incandescence of the white hot surface of the sun
== figurative useedit ==
the word incandescent is also used figuratively to describe a person who is so angry that they are imagined to glow or burn red hot or white hot
