a head is the part of an organism which usually comprises the eyes ears nose and mouth each of which aid in various sensory functions such as sight hearing smell and taste some very simple animals may not have a head but many bilaterally symmetric forms do heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as cephalization in bilaterally symmetrical animals nervous tissues concentrate at the anterior region forming structures responsible for information processing through biological evolution sense organs and feeding structures also concentrate into the anterior region these collectively form the head
== human head ==
the human head is an anatomical unit that consists of the skull hyoid bone and cervical vertebrae the term skull collectively denotes the mandible (lower jaw bone) and the cranium (upper portion of the skull that houses the brain) the skull can also be described as being composed of the cranium which encloses the cranial cavity and the facial skeleton (includes the mandible) there are eight bones in the cranium and fourteen in the facial skeleton
sculptures of human heads are generally based on a skeletal structure that consists of a cranium jawbone and cheekbone though the number of muscles making up the face is generally consistent between sculptures the shape of the muscles varies widely based on the function development and expressions reflected on the faces of the subjects
proponents of identism believe that the mind is identical to the brain philosopher john searle asserts his identist beliefs stating the brain is the only thing in the human head similarly dr henry bennet-clark has stated that the head encloses billions of miniagents and microagents (with no single boss)
== other animals ==
=== vertebrates ===
evolution of the head in the vertebrates has occurred by the fusion of a fixed number of anterior segments in the same manner as in other heteronomously segmented animals in some cases segments or a portion of the segments disappear the head segments also lose most of its systems except for the nervous system with the progressive development of cephalization the head incorporates more and more of the adjacent segments into its structure so that in general it may be said that the higher the degree of cepahalization the greater is the number of segments composing the head
=== arthropods ===
in some arthropods especially trilobites (pictured at right) the cephalon or cephalic region is the region of the head which is a collective of fused segments
==== insects ====
a typical insect head is composed of eyes antennae and components of mouth as these components differ substantially from insect to insect they form important identification links eyes in the head found in several types of insects are in the form of a pair of compound eyes with multiple faces in many other types of insects the compound eyes are seen in a single facet or group of single facets in some case the eyes may be seen as marks on the dorsal or located near or toward the head two or three ocelli (single faceted organs)
antennae on the insect's head is found in the form of segmented attachments in pairs that are usually located between the eyes these are in varying shapes and sizes in the form of filaments or in different enlarged or clubbed form
insects have mouth parts in various shapes depending on their feeding habits labrum is the upper lip which is in the front area of the head and is the most exterior part a pair of mandible is found on backside of the labrum flanking the side of the mouth succeeded by a pair of maxillae each of which is known as maxilliary palp at the back side of the mouth is the labium or lower lip there is also an extra mouth part in some insects which is termed as hypopharynx which is usually located between the maxillac
==== vertebrates v invertebrate chordates ====
though invertebrate chordates such as the lancelet have heads there has been a question of how the vertebrate head characterized by a bony skull clearly separated from the main body might have evolved from the head structures of these animals in 2014 a transient larva tissue of the lancelet was found to be virtually indistinguishable from the neural crest-derived cartilage which forms the vertebrate skull suggesting that persistence of this tissue and expansion into the entire head space could be a viable evolutionary route to formation of the vertebrate head

=== heraldry ===
the heads of humans and other animals are a commonly recurring charges in heraldry heads of humans are sometimes blazoned simply as a man's head but are far more frequently described in greater detail either characteristic of a particular race or nationality (such as moors heads saxons heads egyptians heads or turks heads) or specifically identified (such as the head of moses in the crest of hilton or the head of st john the baptist in the crest of the london company of tallowchandlers) several varieties of women's heads also occur including maidens heads (often couped under the bust with hair disheveled) ladies heads nuns heads (often veiled) and occasionally queens heads the arms of daveney of norfolk include three nun's heads veiled couped at the shoulders proper, and the bust of a queen occurs in the arms of queenborough kent infants or children's heads are often couped at the shoulders with a snake wrapped around the neck (e.g argent a boy's head proper crined or couped below the shoulders vested gules garnished gold, in the arms of boyman)
=== art ===
one of the ways of drawing sketches of headsas jack ham advisesis to develop it in six well defined steps starting with the shape of the head in the shape of an egg female head in particular is sketched in a double circle design procedure with proportions considered as ideal of female head in the first circle division is made of five sections on the diameter each section of five eyes width it is then developed over a series of ten defined steps with the smaller circle imposed partially over the larger circle at lower end at the fourth stage eyes and chins are fitted in various shapes to form the head
leonardo da vinci was one of the worlds greatest artists who drew sketches of human anatomy using grid structures his image of the face drawn on the grid structure principle is in perfect proportion in this genre using the technique of pen and ink leonardo created a sketch which is a study on the proportions of head and eyes(pictured)
=== idiomatic expressions ===
an idiom is a phrase or a fixed expression that has a figurative or sometimes literal meaning
to come to a head to reach a critical stage and require immediate action

to bang your head against a brick wall to continually try to achieve something without success
to have one's head in the clouds to not pay attention to what is happening around one because one is so absorbed by one's own thoughts
=== engineering and scientific fields ===
the head's function and appearance play an analogous role in the etymology of many technical terms cylinder head pothead and weatherhead are three such examples
