phylogenetic nomenclature ties names clades groups consisting ancestor descendants groups equivalently called monophyletic slightly different ways specifying ancestor discussed ancestor specified meaning name fixed ancestor organisms descendants included named taxon listing organisms ie providing full circumscription requires full phylogenetic tree known practice one hypotheses correct tree different hypotheses lead different organisms thought included named taxon affect organisms name actually applies sense name independent theory revision
phylogenetic definitions clade namesedit
phylogenetic nomenclature ties names clades groups consisting solely ancestor descendants needed specify clade therefore designate ancestor number ways commonly ancestor indicated relation two specifiers species specimens traits mentioned explicitly diagram shows three common ways
nodebased definition could read last common ancestor b descendants ancestor thus entire line junction b belong clade name definition refers
example sauropod dinosaurs consist last common ancestor vulcanodon apatosaurus b ancestors descendants ancestor first sauropod c could include dinosaurs like stegosaurus
branchbased definition often called stembased definition could read first ancestor also ancestor c descendants ancestor thus entire line junction b bottommost point belong clade name definition refers
example rodents consist first ancestor house mouse also ancestor eastern cottontail rabbit c together descendants ancestor ancestor first rodent b descendant perhaps red squirrel
apomorphybased definition could read first ancestor possess trait m inherited descendants ancestor diagram m evolves intersection horizontal line tree thus clade name definition refers contains part line last common ancestor b corresponds ancestors possessing apomorphy m lower part line excluded required b trait m may disappeared lineage leading b
example tetrapods consist first ancestor humans humans inherited limbs fingers toes m descendants ancestor descendants include snakes b limbs
several alternatives provided phylocode see though attempt exhaustive
phylogenetic nomenclature allows use ancestral relations also property extant one many ways specifying neornithes modern birds example
neornithes consist last common ancestor extant members inclusive clade containing cockatoo cacatua galerita dinosaur stegosaurus armatus well descendants ancestor
neornithes crown clade clade last common ancestor extant members also last common ancestor members
node namesedit
crown node recent common ancestor sampled species clade interest
stem node recent common ancestor clade interest sister clade
ancestrybased definitions names paraphyletic polyphyletic taxaedit
phylocode clade receive phylogenetic definition restriction observed present article however also possible create definitions names groups phylogenetic sense use ancestral relations anchored species specimens example assuming mammalia aves birds defined manner reptilia could defined recent common ancestor mammalia aves descendants except mammalia aves example paraphyletic group clade minus one subordinate clades names polyphyletic groups characterized trait evolved convergently two subgroups similarly defined sum multiple clades
ranksedit
traditional nomenclature codes international code zoological nomenclature international code nomenclature algae fungi plants taxa explicitly associated rank cannot formally named application name taxon based type rank requirement rank major difference traditional phylogenetic nomenclature several consequences limits number nested levels names applied causes endings names change group rank changed even precisely members ie circumscription logically inconsistent taxa monophyletic
especially recent decades due advances phylogenetics taxonomists named many nested taxa ie taxa contained inside taxa system nomenclature attempts name every clade would particularly difficult traditional nomenclature since every named taxon must given lower rank named taxon nested number names assigned nested set taxa greater number generally recognized ranks gauthier et al suggested reptilia assigned traditional rank class phylogenetic classification assign rank genus aves classification known species extant extinct birds would incorporated genus
various solutions proposed keeping rankbased nomenclature codes patterson rosen suggested nine new ranks family superfamily order able classify clade herrings mckenna bell introduced large array new ranks order cope diversity mammalia widely adopted botany angiosperm phylogeny group responsible currently widely used classification flowering plants chose different approach retained traditional ranks family order considering value teaching studying relationships taxa also introduced named clades without formal ranks
current codes also rules stating names must certain endings depending rank taxa applied group different rank different classifications name must different suffix ereshefsky gave example noted simpson wiley agreed group genera included genus homo placed together taxon simpson treated taxon family gave name hominidae homin homo idae family ending zoological code wiley considered rank tribe gave name hominini ini tribe ending wileys tribe hominini formed part family called hominidae thus zoological code two groups precisely circumscription given different names simpsons hominidae wileys hominini two groups name different circumscriptions simpsons hominidae wileys hominidae
phylogenetic nomenclature ranks bearing spelling taxon names see eg gauthier phylocode ranks however altogether forbidden phylogenetic nomenclature merely decoupled nomenclature influence names used taxa associated names names refer nested taxa
principles traditional rankbased nomenclature logically incompatible taxa strictly monophyletic every organism must belong genus example would genus every common ancestor mammals birds genus monophyletic would include class mammalia class aves rankbased nomenclature however classes must include genera way around

historyedit
phylogenetic nomenclature result general acceptance branching course evolution represented diagrams jeanbaptiste lamarck later writers like charles darwin ernst haeckel haeckel first time constructed single tree life immediately proceeded translate classification classification rankbased usual time contain taxa haeckel considered polyphyletic haeckel introduced rank phylum carries connotation monophyly name literally meaning stem
ever since debated ways extent phylogeny life used basis classification views ranging numerical taxonomy phenetics evolutionary taxonomy gradistics phylogenetic systematics onwards rankless classifications occasionally proposed general principles rankbased nomenclature used three schools thought
basic tenets phylogenetic nomenclature lack obligatory ranks something close phylogenetic definitions however traced edwin goodrich interpreted name sauropsida erected years earlier h huxley include birds aves well part reptilia coined new name theropsida include mammals well another part reptilia goodrich give ranks treated exactly phylogenetic definitions using neither contents diagnostic characters decide whether given animal belong theropsida sauropsida something else phylogenetic position agreed upon goodrich also opined name reptilia abandoned phylogeny reptiles would better known

controversyedit
willi hennigs pioneering work provoked spirited debate relative merits phylogenetic nomenclature versus linnaean taxonomy related approach evolutionary taxonomy continued present debates cladists engaged running since th century hennig insisted different classification schemes useful different purposes gave primacy claiming categories system individuality reality contrast timeless abstractions morphologybased classifications
formal classifications based cladistic reasoning said emphasize ancestry expense descriptive characteristics nonetheless taxonomists today avoid paraphyletic groups whenever think possible within linnaean taxonomy polyphyletic taxa long fallen fashion
