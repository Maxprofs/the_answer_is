pepsin is an enzyme whose zymogen (pepsinogen) is released by the chief cells in the stomach and that degrades food proteins into peptides it was discovered in 1836 by theodor schwann who also coined its name from the greek word pepsis meaning digestion (from peptein to digest") it was one of the first enzymes to be discovered and in 1928 it became one of the first enzymes to be crystallized by john h northrop pepsin is a digestive protease a member of the aspartate protease family
pepsin is one of three principal protein-degrading or proteolytic enzymes in the digestive system the other two being chymotrypsin and trypsin the three enzymes were among the first to be isolated in crystalline form during the process of digestion these enzymes each of which is specialized in severing links between particular types of amino acids collaborate to break down dietary proteins into their components i.e. peptides and amino acids which can be readily absorbed by the intestinal lining pepsin is most efficient in cleaving peptide bonds between hydrophobic and preferably aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine tryptophan and tyrosine
== historyedit ==
the term pepsin was first coined by theodor schwann in the early 19th century scientists around this time began discovering many biochemical compounds that play a significant role in biological processes and pepsin was one of them this acidic substance that was able to convert nitrogen based foods into water-soluble material was determined to be pepsin
== precursoredit ==
pepsin is expressed as a pro-form zymogen pepsinogen whose primary structure has an additional 44 amino acids
in the stomach chief cells release pepsinogen this zymogen is activated by hydrochloric acid (hcl) which is released from parietal cells in the stomach lining the hormone gastrin and the vagus nerve trigger the release of both pepsinogen and hcl from the stomach lining when food is ingested hydrochloric acid creates an acidic environment which allows pepsinogen to unfold and cleave itself in an autocatalytic fashion thereby generating pepsin (the active form) pepsin cleaves the 44 amino acids from pepsinogen to create more pepsin
== activity and stabilityedit ==
pepsin is most active in acidic environments between 37 c and 42 c accordingly its primary site of synthesis and activity is in the stomach (ph 1.5 to 2) pepsin will digest up to 20% of ingested amide bonds by cleaving preferentially after the n-terminal of aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine tryptophan and tyrosine pepsin exhibits preferential cleavage for hydrophobic preferably aromatic residues in p1 and p1 positions increased susceptibility to hydrolysis occurs if there is a sulfur-containing amino acid close to the peptide bond which has an aromatic amino acid pepsin cleaves phe1val gln4his glu13ala ala14leu leu15tyr tyr16leu gly23phe phe24 pepsin exhibits maximal activity at ph 2.0 and is inactive at ph 6.5 and above however pepsin is not fully denatured or irreversibly inactivated until ph 8.0 therefore pepsin in solution of up to ph 8.0 can be reactivated upon re-acidification the stability of pepsin at high ph has significant implications on disease attributed to laryngopharyngeal reflux pepsin remains in the larynx following a gastric reflux event at the mean ph of the laryngopharynx (ph = 6.8) pepsin would be inactive but could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events resulting in damage to local tissues
== in laryngopharyngeal refluxedit ==
pepsin is one of the primary causes of mucosal damage during laryngopharyngeal reflux pepsin remains in the larynx (ph 6.8) following a gastric reflux event while enzymatically inactive in this environment pepsin would remain stable and could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events exposure of laryngeal mucosa to enzymatically active pepsin but not irreversibly inactivated pepsin or acid results in reduced expression of protective proteins and thereby increases laryngeal susceptibility to damage
pepsin may also cause mucosal damage during weakly acidic or non-acid gastric reflux weak or non-acid reflux is correlated with reflux symptoms and mucosal injury under non-acid conditions (neutral ph) pepsin is internalized by cells of the upper airways such as the larynx and hypopharynx by a process known as receptor-mediated endocytosis the receptor by which pepsin is endocytosed is currently unknown upon cellular uptake pepsin is stored in intracellular vesicles of low ph at which its enzymatic activity would be restored pepsin is retained within the cell for up to 24 hours such exposure to pepsin at neutral ph and endoyctosis of pepsin causes changes in gene expression associated with inflammation which underlies signs and symptoms of reflux and tumor progression this and other research implicates pepsin in carcinogenesis attributed to gastric reflux
pepsin in airway specimens is considered to be a sensitive and specific marker for laryngopharyngeal reflux research to develop new pepsin-targeted therapeutic and diagnostic tools for gastric reflux is ongoing a rapid non-invasive pepsin diagnostic called peptest is now available which determines the presence of pepsin in saliva samples
== storageedit ==
pepsins should be stored at very low temperatures (between 80 c and 20 c) to prevent autolysis (self-digestion)
== inhibitorsedit ==
pepsin may be inhibited by high ph (see activity and stability above) or by inhibitor compounds pepstatin is a low molecular weight compound and potent inhibitor specific for acid proteases with a ki of about 1010 m for pepsin the statyl residue of pepstatin is thought to be responsible for pepstatin inhibition of pepsin statine is a potential analog of the transition state for catalysis by pepsin and other acid proteases pepstatin does not covalently bind pepsin and inhibition of pepsin by pepstatin is therefore reversible 1-bis(diazoacetyl)-2-penylethane reversibly inactivates pepsin at ph 5 a reaction which is accelerated by the presence of cu(ii)
pepsin also undergoes feedback inhibition a product of protein digestion slows down the reaction by inhibiting pepsin
sucralfate also inhibits pepsin activity
== applicationsedit ==
commercial pepsin is extracted from the glandular layer of hog stomachs it is a component of rennet used to curdle milk during the manufacture of cheese pepsin is used for a variety of applications in food manufacturing to modify and provide whipping qualities to soy protein and gelatin to modify vegetable proteins for use in nondairy snack items to make precooked cereals into instant hot cereals and to prepare animal and vegetable protein hydrolysates for use in flavoring foods and beverages it is used in the leather industry to remove hair and residual tissue from hides and in the recovery of silver from discarded photographic films by digesting the gelatin layer that holds the silver pepsin was historically an additive of beemans gum brand chewing gum by dr edward e beeman it also gave name to pepsi-cola originally formulated with pepsin and kola nuts
pepsin is commonly used in the preparation of f(ab')2 fragments from antibodies in some assays it is preferable to use only the antigen-binding (fab) portion of the antibody for these applications antibodies may be enzymatically digested to produce either an fab or an f(ab')2 fragment of the antibody to produce an f(ab')2 fragment igg is digested with pepsin which cleaves the heavy chains near the hinge region one or more of the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains in the hinge region are preserved so the two fab regions of the antibody remain joined together yielding a divalent molecule (containing two antibody binding sites) hence the designation f(ab')2 the light chains remain intact and attached to the heavy chain the fc fragment is digested into small peptides fab fragments are generated by cleavage of igg with papain instead of pepsin papain cleaves igg above the hinge region containing the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains but below the site of the disulfide bond between the light chain and heavy chain this generates two separate monovalent (containing a single antibody binding site) fab fragments and an intact fc fragment the fragments can be purified by gel filtration ion exchange or affinity chromatography
fab and f(ab')2 antibody fragments are used in assay systems where the presence of the fc region may cause problems in tissues such as lymph nodes or spleen or in peripheral blood preparations cells with fc receptors (macrophages monocytes b lymphocytes and natural killer cells) are present which can bind the fc region of intact antibodies causing background staining in areas that do not contain the target antigen use of f(ab')2 or fab fragments ensures that the antibodies are binding to the antigen and not fc receptors these fragments may also be desirable for staining cell preparations in the presence of plasma because they are not able to bind complement which could lyse the cells f(ab')2 and to a greater extent fab fragments allow more exact localization of the target antigen i.e. in staining tissue for electron microscopy the divalency of the f(ab')2 fragment enables it to cross-link antigens allowing use for precipitation assays cellular aggregation via surface antigens or rosetting assays
