in the prehistoric eras the tyrannosaurus rex may have been an apex predator preying upon hadrosaurs ceratopsians and possibly sauropods although some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a scavenger the debate about whether tyrannosaurus was an apex predator or scavenger was among the longest ongoing feud in paleontology however most scientists now agree that tyrannosaurus rex was an opportunistic carnivore acting as both a predator and a scavenger
animals which consume feces such as dung beetles are referred to as coprovores animals that collect small particles of dead organic material of both animal and plant origin are referred to as detritivores

in the 1950s louis binford suggested that early humans were obtaining meat via scavenging not hunting in 2010 dennis bramble and daniel lieberman however proposed that early humans used long-distance running to hunt pursuing a single animal until it died of exhaustion and hyperthermia such behavior has been suggested as an adaptation to ensure a food supply that in turn made large brains possible
the eating of human meat a practice known as anthropophagy (and known across all species more commonly as cannibalism) is extremely taboo in almost every culture
