in general an opinion is a judgment viewpoint or statement about matters commonly considered to be subjective
what distinguishes fact from opinion is that facts are verifiable i.e can be objectively proven to have occurred an example is united states of america was involved in the vietnam war versus united states of america was right to get involved in the vietnam war an opinion may be supported by facts in which case it becomes an argument although people may draw opposing opinions from the same set of facts opinions rarely change without new arguments being presented it can be reasoned that one opinion is better supported by the facts than another by analyzing the supporting arguments in casual use the term opinion may be the result of a person's perspective understanding particular feelings beliefs and desires it may refer to unsubstantiated information in contrast to knowledge and fact
collective or professional opinions are defined as meeting a higher standard to substantiate the opinion (see below)

in economics other social sciences and philosophy analysis of social phenomena based on one's own opinion(s) is referred to as normative analysis (what ought to be) as opposed to positive analysis which is based on scientific observation (what materially is or is empirically demonstrable)
historically the distinction of demonstrated knowledge and opinion was articulated by ancient greek philosophers today plato's analogy of the divided line is a well-known illustration of the distinction between knowledge and opinion or knowledge and belief in customary terminology of contemporary philosophy opinions can be persuasive but only the assertions they are based on can be said to be true or false
