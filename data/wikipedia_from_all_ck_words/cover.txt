grains are small hard dry seeds with or without attached hulls or fruit layers harvested for human or animal consumption agronomists also call the plants producing such seeds grain crops the two main types of commercial grain crops are cereals such as wheat and rye and legumes such as beans and soybeans ubiquity of grain as a food source encouraged use of the term to describe other particles with volume or mass similar to an individual seed
after being harvested dry grains are more durable than other staple foods such as starchy fruits (plantains breadfruit etc.) and tubers (sweet potatoes cassava and more) this durability has made grains well suited to industrial agriculture since they can be mechanically harvested transported by rail or ship stored for long periods in silos and milled for flour or pressed for oil thus major global commodity markets exist for canola maize rice soybeans wheat and other grains but not for tubers vegetables or other crops
== grains and cereals ==
in botany grains and cereals are synonymous with caryopses the fruits of the grass family in agronomy and commerce seeds or fruits from other plant families are called grains if they resemble caryopses for example amaranth is sold as grain amaranth and amaranth products may be described as whole grains the pre-hispanic civilizations of the andes had grain-based food systems but at the higher elevations none of the grains was a cereal all three grains native to the andes (kaniwa kiwicha and quinoa) are broad-leafed plants rather than grasses such as corn rice and wheat
== classification ==
=== cereal grains ===
all cereal crops are members of the grass family cereal grains contain a substantial amount of starch a carbohydrate that provides dietary energy
==== warm-season (c4) cereals ====
finger millet
fonio
foxtail millet
japanese millet
job's tears
kodo millet
maize (corn)
millet
pearl millet
proso millet
sorghum
==== cool-season (c3) cereals ====
barley
oats
rice
rye
spelt
teff
triticale
wheat
wild rice
=== pseudocereal grains ===
starchy grains from broadleaf (dicot) plant families
amaranth (amaranth family)
buckwheat (smartweed family)
chia (mint family)
quinoa (amaranth family formerly classified as goosefoot family)
=== pulses ===
pulses or grain legumes members of the pea family have a higher protein content than most other plant foods at around 20% while soybeans have as much as 35% proteins in pulses are typically incomplete as they do not contain all the essential amino acids pulses may also contain starch or oil common pulses include
chickpeas
common beans
common peas (garden peas)
fava beans
lentils
lima beans
lupins
mung beans
peanuts
pigeon peas
runner beans
soybeans
=== oilseeds ===
oilseed grains are grown primarily for the extraction of their edible oil vegetable oils provide dietary energy and some essential fatty acids they are also used as fuel or lubricants
==== mustard family ====
black mustard
india mustard
rapeseed (including canola)
==== aster family ====
safflower
sunflower seed
==== other families ====
flax seed (flax family)
hemp seed (hemp family)
poppy seed (poppy family)
== historical impact of grain agriculture ==
because grains are small hard and dry they can be stored measured and transported more readily than can other kinds of food crops such as fresh fruits roots and tubers the development of grain agriculture allowed excess food to be produced and stored easily which could have led to the creation of the first permanent settlements and the division of society into classes
