in psychology and ethology play is a range of voluntary intrinsically motivated activities normally associated with recreational pleasure and enjoyment play is commonly associated with children and juvenile-level activities but play occurs at any life stage and among other higher-functioning animals as well most notably mammals
many prominent researchers in the field of psychology including melanie klein jean piaget william james sigmund freud carl jung and lev vygotsky have viewed play as confined to the human species believing play was important for human development and using different research methods to prove their theories
play is often interpreted as frivolous yet the player can be intently focused on their objective particularly when play is structured and goal-oriented as in a game accordingly play can range from relaxed free-spirited and spontaneous through frivolous to planned or even compulsive play is not just a pastime activity it has the potential to serve as an important tool in numerous aspects of daily life for adolescents adults and cognitively advanced non-human species (such as primates) not only does play promote and aid in physical development (such as handeye coordination) but it also aids in cognitive development and social skills and can even act as a stepping stone into the world of integration which can be a very stressful process

the seminal text in the field of play studies is the book homo ludens first published in 1944 with several subsequent editions in which johan huizinga defines play as follows
summing up the formal characteristic of play we might call it a free activity standing quite consciously outside ordinary life as being not serious but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly it is an activity connected with no material interest and no profit can be gained by it it proceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner it promotes the formation of social groupings that tend to surround themselves with secrecy and to stress the difference from the common world by disguise or other means.
this definition of play as constituting a separate and independent sphere of human activity is sometimes referred to as the magic circle notion of play a phrase also attributed to huizinga many other definitions exist jean piaget stated the many theories of play expounded in the past are clear proof that the phenomenon is difficult to understand.
== forms of playedit ==
play can take the form of improvisation or pretence interactive performance mimicry games sports and thrill-seeking such as extreme or dangerous sports (sky-diving high-speed racing etc.) philosopher roger caillois wrote about play in his 1961 book man play and games and stephen nachmanovitch expanded on these concepts in his 1990 book free play improvisation in life and art nachmanovitch writes that
improvisation composition writing painting theater invention all creative acts are forms of play the starting place of creativity in the human growth cycle and one of the great primal life functions without play learning and evolution are impossible play is the taproot from which original art springs it is the raw stuff that the artist channels and organizes with all his learning and technique (free play p 42)
structured play has clearly defined goals and rules and such play is called a game other play is unstructured or open-ended both types of play promote adaptive behaviors and mental states of happiness
often sports with defined rules will take place within designated play spaces such as sports fields where in soccer for example players kick a ball in a certain direction and push opponents out of their way as they do so while appropriate within the sport's play space these same behaviors might be inappropriate or even illegal outside the playfield
other designed play spaces can be playgrounds with dedicated equipment and structures to promote active and social play some play spaces go even farther in specialization to bring the play indoors and will often charge admission as seen at children's museums science centers or family entertainment centers family entertainment centers (or play zones) are typically for-profit businesses purely for play and entertainment while children's museums and science centers are typically non-profit organizations for educational entertainment
the california based national institute for play describes seven play patterns
attunement play which establishes a connection such as between newborn and mother
body play in which an infant explores the ways in which his or her body works and interacts with the world such as making funny sounds or discovering what happens in a fall
object play such as playing with toys banging pots and pans handling physical things in ways that use curiosity
social play play which involves others in activities such as tumbling making faces and building connections with another child or group of children
imaginative or pretend play in which a child invents scenarios from his or her imagination and acts within them as a form of play such as princess or pirate play
storytelling play the play of learning and language that develops intellect such as a parent reading aloud to a child or a child retelling the story in his or her own words
creative play by which one plays with imagination to transcend what is known in the current state to create a higher state for example a person might experiment to find a new way to use a musical instrument thereby taking that form of music to a higher plane or as einstein was known to do a person might wonder about things which are not yet known and play with unproven ideas as a bridge to the discovery of new knowledge
separate from self-initiated play play therapy is used as a clinical application of play aimed at treating children who suffer from trauma emotional issues and other problems
== play and childrenedit ==
in young children play is frequently associated with cognitive development and socialization play that promotes learning and recreation often incorporates toys props tools or other playmates play can consist of an amusing pretend or imaginary activity alone or with another some forms of play are rehearsals or trials for later life events such as play fighting pretend social encounters (such as parties with dolls) or flirting modern findings in neuroscience suggest that play promotes flexibility of mind including adaptive practices such as discovering multiple ways to achieve a desired result or creative ways to improve or reorganize a given situation (millar 1967 shonkoff & phillips 2000)
as children get older they engage in board games video games and computer play and in this context the word gameplay is used to describe the concept and theory of play and its relationship to rules and game design in their book rules of play researchers katie salen and eric zimmerman outline 18 schemas for games using them to define play interaction and design formally for behaviorists similarly in his book half-real video games between real rules and fictional worlds game researcher and theorist jesper juul explores the relationship between real rules and unreal scenarios in play such as winning or losing a game in the real world when played together with real-world friends but doing so by slaying a dragon in the fantasy world presented in the shared video game
learning through play has been long recognized as a critical aspect of childhood and child development some of the earliest studies of play started in the 1890s with g stanley hall the father of the child study movement that sparked an interest in the developmental mental and behavioral world of babies and children play also promotes healthy development of parent-child bonds establishing social emotional and cognitive developmental milestones that help them relate to others manage stress and learn resiliency
modern research in the field of affective neuroscience (the neural mechanisms of emotion) has uncovered important links between role play and neurogenesis in the brain for example researcher roger caillois used the word ilinx to describe the momentary disruption of perception that comes from forms of physical play that disorient the senses especially balance
studies have found that play and coping to daily stressors to be positively correlated in children by playing children regulate their emotions and this is important for adaptive functioning because without regulation emotions could be overwhelming and stressful
in addition evolutionary psychologists have begun to explore the phylogenetic relationship between higher intelligence in humans and its relationship to play i.e. the relationship of play to the progress of whole evolutionary groups as opposed to the psychological implications of play to a specific individual
play is explicitly recognized in article 31 of the convention on the rights of the child (adopted by the general assembly of the united nations november 29 1989) which declares
parties recognize the right of the child to rest and leisure to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts
parties shall respect and promote the right of the child to participate fully in cultural and artistic life and shall encourage the provision of appropriate and equal opportunities for cultural artistic recreational and leisure activities
=== history of childhood playtimeedit ===
american historian howard chudacoff has studied the interplay between parental control of toys and games and children's drive for freedom to play in the colonial era toys were makeshift and children taught each other very simple games with little adult supervision the market economy of the 19th century enabled the modern concept of childhood as a distinct happy life stage factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted young girls organized sports filtered down from adults and colleges and boys learned to play with a bat a ball and an impromptu playing field in the 20th century teenagers were increasingly organized into club sports supervised and coached by adults with swimming taught at summer camps and through supervised playgrounds under the new deal's works progress administration thousands of local playgrounds and ball fields opened promoting softball especially as a sport for all ages and both sexes by the 21st century chudacoff notes the old tension between parental controls and a childs individual freedom was being played out in cyberspace
== play and sportsedit ==
sportive activities are one of the most universal forms of play different continents have their own popular/dominant sports for example european south american and african countries enjoy soccer (also known as football in europe) while north american countries prefer basketball ice hockey baseball or american football in asia sports such as table tennis and badminton are played professionally however soccer and basketball are played amongst common folks events such as the olympics games and fifa world cup showcase countries competing with each other and are broadcast all over the world sports can be played as a leisure activity or within a competition according to sociologist norbert elias it is an important part of civilization process victory and defeat in sports can also influence ones emotions to a point where everything else seems so irrelevant sport fans can also imagine what it feels like to play for their preferred team the feelings people experience can be so surreal that it affects their emotions and behaviour
=== benefits of playing sports in youthedit ===
youth sport can provide a positive outcome for youth development research shows adolescents are more motivated and engaged in sports than any other activity and these conditions predict a richer personal and interpersonal development there is a high correlation between the amount of time that youth spend playing sport sports and the effects of physical (e.g. better general health) psychological (e.g. subjective well being) academic (e.g. school grades) and social benefits (e.g. making friends) in order to maximize these effects the following are recommended
youth should have a group of supportive people around them (teammates coaches and parents) with positive relationships
youth should poses skill development such as physical interpersonal and knowledge about the sport
youth should be able to make their own decisions about their sport participation
youth should have experiences that are on par with their certain needs and developmental level
=== research findings on possible health and physical benefits of youth sportsedit ===
with regular participation in a variety of sports children can develop and become more proficient at various sports skills (including but not limited to jumping kicking running throwing etc.) if the focus is on skill mastery and development young people participating in sports also develop agility coordination endurance flexibility speed and strength more specifically young athletes could develop the following
enhanced functioning and health of cardiorespiratory and muscular systems
improved flexibility mobility and coordination
increased stamina and strength
increased likelihood of maintaining weight
moreover research shows that regular participation in sport and physical activity is highly associated with lowering the risk of diabetes heart disease obesity and other related diseases young people also tend to be more nutrition-conscious in their food choices when participating in sport girls involved in sport tend associate with lower chance of teenage pregnancy begin smoking and/or developing breast cancer young athletes have shown lower levels of total cholesterol and other favorable profiles in serum lipid parameters associated with cardiovascular disease sport provides an arena for young people to be physically active and in result reduce the time spent in sedentary pursuits such as watching tv and playing video games
== play and adultsedit ==
although adults who engage in excessive amounts of play may find themselves described as childish or young at heart by less playful adults play is actually an important activity regardless of age creativity and happiness can result from adult play where the objective can be more than fun alone as in adult expression of the arts or curiosity-driven science some adult hobbies are examples of such creative play in creative professions such as design playfulness can remove more serious attitudes (such as shame or embarrassment) that impede brainstorming or artistic experimentation in design
imaginative play and role play may allow adult individuals to practice useful habits such as learned optimism which is helpful in managing fear or terrors play also offers adults the opportunity to practice concepts that may not have been explicitly or formally taught (e.g how to manage misinformation or deceit) thus even though play is just one of many tools used by effective adults it remains a necessary one
== play in the workplaceedit ==
there has been extensive research when it comes to the benefits of play amongst children youth and adolescence most commonly overlooked are the benefits of play for adults more specifically adults who spend a lot of time in the workplace many adults in north america are in the workforce and spend half of their waking hours in a workplace environment with little to no time for play play in this context refers to leisure-type activities with colleagues during lunch breaks or short breaks throughout the working day leisure activities could include but are not limited to different forms of physical sport activities card games board games video games and interaction-based type video games foosball ping-pong yoga and boot-camp sessions
research shows that playing games may promote a persistent and optimistic motivational style and positive affect positive affect enhances peoples experiences enjoyment and sense of satisfaction derived from the activity during their engagement with a certain task while people are engaged in their work positive affect increases the satisfaction they feel from the work and this has also been shown to increase their creativity and improve their performance on problem-solving tasks as well as other tasks the development of a persistent motivational style charged with positive affect may lead to lasting work success
studies show that work and play are mutually supportive employees need to experience the sense of newness flow discovery and liveliness that play provides by doing this it will provide the employee with the sense that they are integrated within the organization and therefore they will feel and perform better by incorporating play at work it will also result in more productivity creativity and innovation higher job satisfaction greater workplace morale stronger or new social bonds  improved job performance a decrease in staff turnover absenteeism and stress decreased stress leads to less illness which results in lower health care costs play at work may help employees function and cope when under stress refresh body and mind encourage teamwork trigger creativity and increase energy while preventing burnout
studies show that companies that encourage play at work whether short breaks throughout the day or during lunch breaks experience more success because it leads to positive emotion amongst emplyees risk taking confidence in presenting novel ideas and embracing unusual and fresh perspectives are common characteristics associated with play at work play can increase self-reported job satisfaction and well-being employees experiencing positive emotions are more cooperative more social and perform better when faced with complex tasks
contests team-building exercises fitness programs mental health breaks and other social activities will make the work environment fun interactive and rewarding
== play and seniorsedit ==
older adults represent one of the fastest growing populations around the world in fact the united nations predicted an increase of those aged 60 and above from 629 million in 2002 to approximately two billion in 2050 but increased life expectancy does not necessarily translate to a better quality of life for this reason research has begun to investigate methods to maintain and/or improve quality of life among older adults
similar to the data surrounding children and adults play and activity are associated with improved health and quality of life among seniors additionally play and activity tend to affect successful aging as well as boost well-being throughout the lifespan although children adults and seniors all tend to benefit from play older adults often perform it in unique ways to account for possible issues such as health restrictions limited accessibility and revised priorities for this reason elderly people may partake in physical exercise groups interactive video games and social forums specifically geared towards their needs and interests one qualitative research study found older adults often chose to engage in specific games such as dominoes checkers and bingo for entertainment another study indicated a common pattern within game preferences among older adults seniors often favor activities that encourage mental and physical fitness incorporate past interests have some level of competition and foster a sense of belonging researchers investigating play in older adults are also interested in the benefits of technology and video games as therapeutic tools studies show these outlets can lower the risk of developing particular diseases reduce feelings of social isolation and stress as well as promote creativity and the maintenance of cognitive skills as a result play as been integrated into physiotherapy and occupational therapy interventions for seniors
the ability to incorporate play into one's routine is important because these activities allow participants to express creativity improve verbal and non-verbal intelligence as well as enhance balance these benefits may be especially crucial to seniors because evidence shows cognitive and physical functioning declines with age however other research argues it might not be aging that is associated with the decline in cognitive and physical capabilities more specifically some studies indicate it could be the higher levels of inactivity within older adults that may have significant ramifications on their health and well-being
with attention to these hypotheses research shows play and activity tend to decline with age which may result in negative outcomes such as social isolation depression and mobility issues american studies found that only 24% of seniors took part in regular physical activity and only 42% use the internet for entertainment purposes in comparison to other age groups the elderly are more likely experience a variety of barriers such as difficulty with environmental hazards and accessibility related issues that may hinder their abilities to execute healthy play behaviours similarly although playing may benefit seniors it also has the potential to negatively impact their health for example those who play may be more susceptible to injury investigating these barriers may assist in the creation of useful interventions and/or the development of preventative measures such as establishing safer recreational areas that promote the maintenance of play behaviours throughout elderly life
a significant amount of literature suggests a moderate level of play has numerous positive outcomes in the lives of senior citizens in order to support and promote play within the older population studies suggest institutions should set up more diverse equipment improve conditions within recreational areas and create more video games or online forums that appeal to the needs of seniors
== play and animalsedit ==
evolutionary psychologists believe that there must be an important benefit of play since there are so many reasons to avoid it animals are often injured during play become distracted from predators and expend valuable energy in rare cases play has even been observed between different species that are natural enemies such as a polar bear and a dog yet play seems to be a normal activity with animals who occupy the higher strata of their own hierarchy of needs animals on the lower strata e.g stressed and starving animals generally do not play however in wild assamese macaques physically active play is performed also during periods of low food availability and even if it is at the expense of growth which strongly highlights the developmental and evolutionary importance of play
the social cognitive complexity of numerous species including dogs have recently been explored in experimental studies in one such study conducted by alexandra horowitz of the university of california the communication and attention-getting skills of dogs were investigated in a natural setting dyadic play behavior was observed head-direction and posture was specifically noted when one of the two dogs was facing away or otherwise preoccupied attention-getting behaviors and signals (nudging barking growling pawing jumping etc.) were used by the other dog to communicate the intent and/or desire to continue on with the dyadic play stronger or more frequent signaling was used if the attention of the other dog was not captured these observations tell us that these dogs know how play behavior and signaling can be used to capture attention communicate intent and desire and manipulate one another this characteristic and skill called the attention-getting skill has generally only been seen in humans but is now being researched and seen in many different species
observing play behavior in various species can tell us a lot about the player's environment (including the welfare of the animal) personal needs social rank (if any) immediate relationships and eligibility for mating play activity often observed through action and signals often serves as a tool for communication and expression through mimicry chasing biting and touching animals will often act out in ways so as to send messages to one another whether it's an alert initiation of play or expressing intent when play behavior was observed for a study in tonkean macaques it was discovered that play signals weren't always used to initiate play rather these signals were viewed primarily as methods of communication (sharing information and attention-getting)
one theory play as preparation was inspired by the observation that play often mimics adult themes of survival predators such as lions and bears play by chasing pouncing pawing wrestling and biting as they learn to stalk and kill prey prey animals such as deer and zebras play by running and leaping as they acquire speed and agility hoofed mammals also practice kicking their hind legs to learn to ward off attacks indeed time spent in physical play accelerates motor skill acquisition in wild assamese macaques while mimicking adult behavior attacking actions such as kicking and biting are not completely fulfilled so playmates do not generally injure each other in social animals playing might also help to establish dominance rankings among the young to avoid conflicts as adults
john byers a zoologist at the university of idaho discovered that the amount of time spent at play for many mammals (e.g rats and cats) peaks around puberty and then drops off this corresponds to the development of the cerebellum suggesting that play is not so much about practicing exact behaviors as much as building general connections in the brain sergio pellis and colleagues at the university of lethbridge in alberta canada discovered that play may shape the brain in other ways too young mammals have an overabundance of brain cells in their cerebrum (the outer areas of the brain part of what distinguishes mammals) there is evidence that play helps the brain clean up this excess of cells resulting in a more efficient cerebrum at maturity
marc bekoff (a university of colorado evolutionary biologist) proposes a flexibility hypothesis that attempts to incorporate these newer neurological findings it argues that play helps animals learn to switch and improvise all behaviors more effectively to be prepared for the unexpected there may however be other ways to acquire even these benefits of play the concept of equifinality the idea is that the social benefits of play for many animals for example could instead be garnered by grooming patrick bateson maintains that equifinality is exactly what play teaches in accordance with the flexibility hypothesis play may teach animals to avoid false endpoints in other words they will harness the childlike tendency to keep playing with something that works well enough eventually allowing them to come up with something that might work better if only in some situations this also allows mammals to build up various skills that could come in handy in entirely novel situations.a study on two species of monkeys presbytis entellus and macaca mulatta that came into association with each other during food provisioning by pilgrims at the ambagarh forest reserve near jaipur india shows the interspecific interaction that developed between the juveniles of the two species when opportunity presented itself
== benefits of playedit ==
play has varying effects and benefits to human development there has been an abundance of research on the effects of different forms of play and how they influence various areas of a persons life whether it is a child or an adult these benefits of play can have cognitive social and emotional or motivational effects on a persons life or development
=== cognitive development and playedit ===
physical play
various forms of play whether it is physical or mental have influenced cognitive abilities in individuals as little as ten minutes of exercise (including physical play) can improve cognitive abilities these researchers did a study and have developed an exergame which is a game that incorporates some physical movement but is by no means formal exercise these games increase ones heart rate to the level of aerobics exercise and have proven to result in recognizable improvements in mental faculties in this study they use play in a way that incorporates physical activity that creates physical excursions the results of the study had statistical significance there were improvements in math by 3.4% and general improvements in recall memory by 4% among the participants of the study
mental play
on the other hand other research has focused on the cognitive effects of mentally stimulating play playing video games is one of the most common mediums of play for children and adults today there has been mixed reviews on the effects of video games despite this according to a research conducted by hollis (2014) [playing video games] was positively associated with skills strongly related to academic success such as time management attention executive control memory and spatial abilities when playing video game occurs in moderation
social development and play
play can also influence ones social development and social interactions much of the research focuses on the influence play has on child social development there are different forms of play that have been noted to influence child social development one study conducted by (sullivan 2003) explores the influence of playing styles with mothers versus playing styles with fathers and how it influences child social development this article explains that integral to positive development is the childs social competence or more precisely the ability to regulate their own emotions and behaviors in the social contexts of early childhood to support the effective accomplishment of relevant developmental tasks
the research further goes on to show that the social benefits of play have been measured using basic interpersonal values such as getting along with peers one of the social benefits that this researcher has uncovered is that play with parents has proven to reduce anxiety in children having play time with parents that involves socially acceptable behaviour makes it easier for children to relate to be more socially adjusted to peers at school or at play social development involving child interaction with peers is thus an area of influence for playful interactions with parents and peers
