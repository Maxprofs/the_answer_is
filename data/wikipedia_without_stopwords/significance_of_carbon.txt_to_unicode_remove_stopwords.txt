diffusionedit
diffusion follows ficks law passive process energy required affected factors surface area available distance gas molecules must diffuse across concentration gradient
gases must first dissolve liquid order diffuse across membrane gas exchange systems require moist environment
singlecelled organisms diffusion occur straight across cell membrane organisms increase size distance gases must travel across surface areatovolume ratio also decreases diffusion alone efficient enough specialized respiratory systems required case humans fish evolved circulatory systems able transport gases respiratory surface maintain continuous concentration gradient

varying responseedit
physical exercise excess carbon dioxide produced result increased respiration muscles cells require increased oxygen body responds change increasing breathing rate maximizing rate possible gas exchange
