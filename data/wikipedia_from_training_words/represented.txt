new iso 639-1 codes are not added if an iso 639-2 code exists so systems that use iso 639-1 and 639-2 codes with 639-1 codes preferred do not have to change existing codes
if an iso 639-2 code that covers a group of languages is used it might be overridden for some specific languages by a new iso 639-1 code
there is no specification on treatment of macrolanguages (see iso 639-3)
