a match is a tool for starting a fire typically modern matches are made of small wooden sticks or stiff paper one end is coated with a material that can be ignited by frictional heat generated by striking the match against a suitable surface wooden matches are packaged in matchboxes and paper matches are partially cut into rows and stapled into matchbooks the coated end of a match known as the match head consists of a bead of active ingredients and binder often coloured for easier inspection there are two main types of matches safety matches which can be struck only against a specially prepared surface and strike-anywhere matches for which any suitably frictional surface can be used some match-like compositions known as electric matches are ignited electrically and do not make use of heat from friction
== etymologyedit ==
historically the term match referred to lengths of cord (later cambric) impregnated with chemicals and allowed to burn continuously these were used to light fires and fire guns (see matchlock) and cannons (see linstock) such matches were characterised by their burning speed i.e quick match and slow match depending on its formulation a slow match burns at a rate of around 30 cm (1 ft) per hour and a quick match at 4 to 60 centimetres (1.6 to 23.6 in) per minute
the modern equivalent of this sort of match is the simple fuse still used in pyrotechnics to obtain a controlled time delay before ignition the original meaning of the word still persists in some pyrotechnics terms such as black match (a black-powder-impregnated fuse) and bengal match (a firework akin to sparklers producing a relatively long-burning coloured flame) but when friction matches became commonplace they became the main object meant by the term
the word match derives from old french mche referring to the wick of a candle

=== early matchesedit ===
a note in the text cho keng lu written in 1366 describes a sulfur match small sticks of pinewood impregnated with sulfur used in china by impoverished court ladies in ad 577 during the conquest of northern qi during the five dynasties and ten kingdoms (ad 907960) a book called the records of the unworldly and the strange written by chinese author tao gu in about 950 stated
if there occurs an emergency at night it may take some time to make a light to light a lamp but an ingenious man devised the system of impregnating little sticks of pinewood with sulfur and storing them ready for use at the slightest touch of fire they burst into flame one gets a little flame like an ear of corn this marvellous thing was formerly called a light-bringing slave but afterwards when it became an article of commerce its name was changed to fire inch-stick
another text wu lin chiu shih dated from 1270 ad lists sulphur matches as something that was sold in the markets of hangzhou around the time of marco polo's visit the matches were known as fa chu or tshui erh

prior to the use of matches fires were sometimes lit using a burning glass (a lens) to focus the sun on tinder a method that could only work on sunny days another more common method was igniting tinder with sparks produced by striking flint and steel or by sharply increasing air pressure in a fire piston early work had been done by alchemist hennig brandt who discovered the flammable nature of phosphorus in 1669 others including robert boyle and his assistant ambrose godfrey continued these experiments in the 1680s with phosphorus and sulfur but their efforts did not produce practical and inexpensive methods for generating fires
smoking tobacco was lit a number of different ways one was use of a spill which was a thin object like a straw rolled paper or thin candle which would be lit from a nearby fire and then used to light the pipe or cigar often kept near the fireplace in a spill vase another was to use a striker a tool that looked like scissors but with flint on one blade and steel on the other these would be rubbed together producing sparks if neither of these were available one could use ember tongs to pick up a coal from a fire and light the tobacco
the first modern self-igniting match was invented in 1805 by jean chancel assistant to professor louis jacques thnard of paris the head of the match consisted of a mixture of potassium chlorate sulfur sugar and rubber the match was ignited by dipping its tip in a small asbestos bottle filled with sulfuric acid this kind of match was expensive and its usage was dangerous so chancel's matches did not become common
this approach to match making was refined in the following decades culminating with the promethean match patented by samuel jones of london in 1828 his match consisted of a small glass capsule containing a chemical composition of sulfuric acid coloured with indigo and coated on the exterior with potassium chlorate wrapped up in a roll of paper immediate ignition was caused by crushing the capsule with a pair of pliers
in london similar matches meant for lighting cigars were introduced in 1849 by heurtner who had a shop called the lighthouse in the strand one version that he sold was called euperion (sometimes empyrion") which was popular for kitchen use and nicknamed as hugh perry while another meant for outdoor use was called a vesuvian the vesuvians or flamers were designed to work out of doors the head was large and contained niter charcoal and wood dust and had a phosphorus tip the handle was large and made of hardwood so as to burn vigorously and last for a while some even had glass stems both vesuvians and prometheans had a bulb of sulfuric acid at the tip which had to be broken to start the reaction
samuel jones introduced fuzees for lighting cigars and pipes in 1832 a similar invention was patented in 1839 by john hucks stevens in america
in 1832 william newton patented the wax vesta in england it consisted of a wax stem that embedded cotton threads and had a tip of phosphorus variants known as candle matches were made by savaresse and merckel in 1836 john hucks stevens also patented a safety version of the friction match in 1839
=== the friction matchedit ===
chemical matches were unable to make the leap into mass production due to the expense their cumbersome nature and inherent danger an alternative method was to produce the ignition through friction produced by rubbing two rough surfaces together an early example was made by franois derosne in 1816 his crude match was called a briquet phosphorique and it used a sulfur-tipped match to scrape inside a tube coated internally with phosphorus it was both inconvenient and unsafe
the first successful friction match was invented in 1826 by english chemist john walker a chemist and druggist from stockton-on-tees he developed a keen interest in trying to find a means of obtaining fire easily several chemical mixtures were already known which would ignite by a sudden explosion but it had not been found possible to transmit the flame to a slow-burning substance like wood while walker was preparing a lighting mixture on one occasion a match which had been dipped in it took fire by an accidental friction upon the hearth he at once appreciated the practical value of the discovery and started making friction matches they consisted of wooden splints or sticks of cardboard coated with sulphur and tipped with a mixture of sulphide of antimony chlorate of potash and gum the sulphur serving to communicate the flame to the wood
the price of a box of 50 matches was one shilling with each box was supplied a piece of sandpaper folded double through which the match had to be drawn to ignite it he named the matches congreves in honour of the inventor and rocket pioneer sir william congreve he did not divulge the exact composition of his matches between 1827 and 1829 walker made about 168 sales of his matches it was however dangerous and flaming balls sometimes fell to the floor burning carpets and dresses leading to their ban in france and germany walker either did not consider his invention important enough to patent or neglected it in order for the splints to catch fire they were often treated with sulfur and the odor was improved by the addition of camphor
in 1829 scots inventor sir isaac holden invented an improved version of walker's match and demonstrated it to his class at castle academy in reading berkshire holden did not patent his invention and claimed that one of his pupils wrote to his father samuel jones a chemist in london who commercialised his process a version of holden's match was patented by samuel jones and these were sold as lucifer matches these early matches had a number of problems - an initial violent reaction an unsteady flame and unpleasant odor and fumes lucifers could ignite explosively sometimes throwing sparks a considerable distance lucifers were manufactured in the united states by ezekial byam the term lucifer persisted as slang in the 20th century (for example in the first world war song pack up your troubles) and matches are still called lucifers (in dutch) in the netherlands and belgium
lucifers were however quickly replaced after the discovery in 1830 by frenchman charles sauria who substituted the antimony sulfide with white phosphorus these new phosphorus matches had to be kept in airtight metal boxes but became popular in england these phosphorus matches were called congreves after sir william congreve while they went by the name of loco foco in the united states the earliest american patent for the phosphorus friction match was granted in 1836 to alonzo dwight phillips of springfield massachusetts
from 1830 to 1890 the composition of these matches remained largely unchanged although some improvements were made in 1843 william ashgard replaced the sulfur with beeswax reducing the pungency of the fumes this was replaced by paraffin in 1862 by charles w smith resulting in what were called parlor matches from 1870 the end of the splint was fireproofed by impregnation with fire-retardant chemicals such as alum sodium silicate and other salts resulting in what was commonly called a drunkard's match that prevented the accidental burning of the user's fingers other advances were made for the mass manufacture of matches early matches were made from blocks of woods with cuts separating the splints but leaving their bases attached later versions were made in the form of thin combs the splints would be broken away from the comb when required
a noiseless match was invented in 1836 by the hungarian jnos irinyi who was a student of chemistry an unsuccessful experiment by his professor meissner gave irinyi the idea to replace potassium chlorate with lead dioxide in the head of the phosphorus match he liquefied phosphorus in warm water and shook it in a glass vial until it became granulated he mixed the phosphorus with lead and gum arabic poured the paste-like mass into a jar and dipped the pine sticks into the mixture and let them dry when he tried them that evening all of them lit evenly irinyi thus invented the noiseless match he sold the invention to istvn rmer a match manufacturer rmer a hungarian pharmacist living in vienna bought the invention and production rights from irinyi for 60 forints (about 22.5 oz t of silver) rmer became rich and irinyi went on to publish articles and a textbook on chemistry and founded several match factories

those involved in the manufacture of the new phosphorus matches were afflicted with phossy jaw and other bone disorders and there was enough white phosphorus in one pack to kill a person deaths and suicides from eating the heads of matches became frequent the earliest report of phosphorus necrosis was made in 1845 by lorinser in vienna and a new york surgeon published a pamphlet with notes on nine cases
the conditions of working class women at the bryant & may factories led to a strike in 1888 the strike was focused on the severe health complications of working with white phosphorus such as phossy jaw social activist annie besant published an article in her halfpenny weekly paper the link on 23 june 1888 a strike fund was set up and some newspapers collected donations from readers the women and girls also solicited contributions members of the fabian society including george bernard shaw sidney webb and graham wallas were involved in the distribution of the cash collected the strike and negative publicity led to changes being made to limit the health effects of the inhalation of white phosphorus
attempts were made to reduce the ill-effects on workers through the introduction of inspections and regulations anton schrtter von kristelli discovered in 1850 that heating white phosphorus at 250 c in an inert atmosphere produced a red allotropic form which did not fume in contact with air it was suggested that this would make a suitable substitute in match manufacture although it was slightly more expensive two french chemists henri savene and emile david cahen proved in 1898 that the addition of phosphorus sesquisulfide meant that the substance was not poisonous that it could be used in a strike-anywhere match and that the match heads were not explosive
british company albright and wilson was the first company to produce phosphorus sesquisulfide matches commercially the company developed a safe means of making commercial quantities of phosphorus sesquisulfide in 1899 and started selling it to match manufacturers white phosphorus however continued to be used and its serious effects led many countries to ban its use finland prohibited the use of white phosphorus in 1872 followed by denmark in 1874 france in 1897 switzerland in 1898 and the netherlands in 1901 an agreement the berne convention was reached at bern switzerland in september 1906 which banned the use of white phosphorus in matches this required each country to pass laws prohibiting the use of white phosphorus in matches great britain passed a law in 1908 prohibiting its use in matches after 31 december 1910 the united states did not pass a law but instead placed a punitive tax on white phosphorus-based matches one so high as to render their manufacture financially impractical in 1913 and canada banned them in 1914 india and japan banned them in 1919 china followed banning them in 1925
in 1901 albright and wilson started making phosphorus sesquisulfide at their niagara falls new york plant for the us market but american manufacturers continued to use white phosphorus matches the niagara falls plant made them until 1910 when the united states congress forbade the shipment of white phosphorus matches in interstate commerce
=== the safety matchedit ===
the dangers of white phosphorus in the manufacture of matches led to the development of the hygienic or safety match the major innovation in its development was the use of red phosphorus not on the head of the match but instead on a specially designed striking surface
arthur albright developed the industrial process for large-scale manufacture of red phosphorus after schrtters discoveries became known by 1851 his company was producing the substance by heating white phosphorus in a sealed pot at a specific temperature he exhibited his red phosphorus in 1851 at the great exhibition in london
the idea of creating a specially designed striking surface was developed in 1844 by the swede gustaf erik pasch pasch patented the use of red phosphorus in the striking surface he found that this could ignite heads that did not need to contain white phosphorus johan edvard and his younger brother carl frans lundstrm (18231917) started a large-scale match industry in jnkping sweden around 1847 but the improved safety match was not introduced until around 185055 the lundstrm brothers had obtained a sample of red phosphorus matches from arthur albright at the great exhibition held at the crystal palace in 1851 but had misplaced it and therefore they did not try the matches until just before the paris exhibition of 1855 when they found that the matches were still usable in 1858 their company produced around 12 million match boxes
the safety of true safety matches is derived from the separation of the reactive ingredients between a match head on the end of a paraffin-impregnated splint and the special striking surface (in addition to the safety aspect of replacing the white phosphorus with red phosphorus) the idea for separating the chemicals had been introduced in 1859 in the form of two-headed matches known in france as alumettes androgynes these were sticks with one end made of potassium chlorate and the other of red phosphorus they had to be broken and the heads rubbed together there was however a risk of the heads rubbing each other accidentally in their box such dangers were removed when the striking surface was moved to the outside of the box the striking surface on modern matchboxes is typically composed of 25% powdered glass or other abrasive material 50% red phosphorus 5% neutralizer 4% carbon black and 16% binder and the match head is typically composed of 4555% potassium chlorate with a little sulfur and starch a neutralizer (zno or caco
3) 2040% of siliceous filler diatomite and glue some heads contain antimony(iii) sulfide to make them burn more vigorously safety matches ignite due to the extreme reactivity of phosphorus with the potassium chlorate in the match head when the match is struck the phosphorus and chlorate mix in a small amount forming something akin to the explosive armstrong's mixture which ignites due to the friction
the swedes long held a virtual worldwide monopoly on safety matches with the industry mainly situated in jnkping by 1903 called jnkpings & vulcans tndsticksfabriks ab in france they sold the rights to their safety match patent to coigent pre & fils of lyon but coigent contested the payment in the french courts on the basis that the invention was known in vienna before the lundstrm brothers patented it the british match manufacturer bryant and may visited jnkping in 1858 to try to obtain a supply of safety matches but it was unsuccessful in 1862 it established its own factory and bought the rights for the british safety match patent from the lundstrm brothers
== varieties of matches todayedit ==
friction matches made with white phosphorus as well as those made from phosphorus sesquisulfide can be struck on any suitable surface they remained particularly popular in the united states even when safety matches had become common in europe however strike anywhere matches are still used today all around the world including many developing countries strike anywhere matches are still widely used today for such uses as camping outdoor activities emergency/survival situations and stocking homemade survival kits
strike-anywhere matches are banned on both passenger aircraft and cargo-only aircraft flight under dangerous goods classification. u.n 1331 matches strike-anywhere
safety matches are classified as dangerous goods u.n 1944 matches safety they are not universally forbidden on aircraft however they must be declared as dangerous goods and individual airlines or countries may impose tighter restrictions
storm matches also known as lifeboat matches or flare matches are often included in survival kits they have a strikeable tip similar to a normal match but the combustible compound continues down the length of the stick coating half or more of the entire matchstick the match also has a waterproof coating (which often makes the match more difficult to light) and often storm matches are longer than standard matches as a result of the combustible coating storm matches burn strongly even in strong winds and can even spontaneously re-ignite after being briefly immersed under water
the development of a specialized matchbook with both matches and a striking surface occurred in the 1890s with the american joshua pusey who sold his patent to the diamond match company
the hobby of collecting match-related items such as matchcovers and matchbox labels is known as phillumeny
