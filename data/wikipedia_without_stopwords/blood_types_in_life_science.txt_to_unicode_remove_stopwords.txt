blood transfusionedit
transfusion medicine specialized branch hematology concerned study blood groups along work blood bank provide transfusion service blood blood products across world blood products must prescribed medical doctor licensed physician surgeon similar way medicines
much routine work blood bank involves testing blood donors recipients ensure every individual recipient given blood compatible safe possible unit incompatible blood transfused donor recipient severe acute hemolytic reaction hemolysis rbc destruction renal failure shock likely occur death possibility antibodies highly active attack rbcs bind components complement system cause massive hemolysis transfused blood
patients ideally receive blood typespecific blood products minimize chance transfusion reaction risks reduced crossmatching blood may skipped blood required emergency crossmatching involves mixing sample recipients serum sample donors red blood cells checking mixture agglutinates forms clumps agglutination obvious direct vision blood bank technicians usually check agglutination microscope agglutination occurs particular donors blood cannot transfused particular recipient blood bank vital blood specimens correctly identified labelling standardized using barcode system known isbt

blood group genotypingedit
addition current practice serologic testing blood types progress molecular diagnostics allows increasing use blood group genotyping contrast serologic tests reporting direct blood type phenotype genotyping allows prediction phenotype based knowledge molecular basis currently known antigens allows detailed determination blood type therefore better match transfusion crucial particular patients needs many transfusions prevent alloimmunization
