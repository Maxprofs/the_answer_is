in human development a fetus (/fits/ plural fetuses") also spelled foetus is a prenatal human between its embryonic state and its birth the fetal stage of development tends to be taken as beginning at the gestational age of eleven weeks i.e nine weeks after fertilization in biological terms however prenatal development is a continuum with no clear defining feature distinguishing an embryo from a fetus the use of the term fetus generally implies that an embryo has developed to the point of being recognizable as a human this is the point usually taken to be the ninth week after fertilization a fetus is also characterized by the presence of all the major body organs though they will not yet be fully developed and functional and some not yet situated in their final anatomical location
== etymologyedit ==
the word fetus (plural fetuses) is from the latin ftus (offspring bringing forth hatching of young) the british irish and commonwealth spelling is foetus which has been in use since at least 1594 it arose as a hypercorrection based on an incorrect etymology (i.e due to insufficient knowledge of latin) that may have originated with an error by isidore of seville in ad 620 this spelling is the most common in most commonwealth nations except in the medical literature where fetus is used the etymologically accurate original spelling fetus is used in canada and the united states in addition fetus is now the standard english spelling throughout the world in medical journals the spelling faetus was used historically

=== weeks 9 to 16edit ===
in humans the fetal stage commences at the beginning of the ninth week at the start of the fetal stage the fetus is typically about 30 millimetres (1.2 in) in length from crown to rump and weighs about 8 grams the head makes up nearly half of the fetus size breathing-like movement of the fetus is necessary for stimulation of lung development rather than for obtaining oxygen the heart hands feet brain and other organs are present but are only at the beginning of development and have minimal operation
at this point in development uncontrolled movements and twitches occur as muscles the brain and pathways begin to develop
=== weeks 17 to 25edit ===
a woman pregnant for the first time (primiparous) typically feels fetal movements at about 21 weeks whereas a woman who has given birth at least once (multiparous) will typically feel movements by 20 weeks by the end of the fifth month the fetus is about 20 cm (8 inches) long
=== weeks 26 to 38edit ===
the amount of body fat rapidly increases lungs are not fully mature thalamic brain connections which mediate sensory input form bones are fully developed but are still soft and pliable iron calcium and phosphorus become more abundant fingernails reach the end of the fingertips the lanugo or fine hair begins to disappear until it is gone except on the upper arms and shoulders small breast buds are present on both sexes head hair becomes coarse and thicker birth is imminent and occurs around the 38th week after fertilization the fetus is considered full-term between weeks 35 and 38 when it is sufficiently developed for life outside the uterus it may be 48 to 53 cm (19 to 21 inches) in length when born control of movement is limited at birth and purposeful voluntary movements develop all the way until puberty
=== variation in growthedit ===
there is much variation in the growth of the human fetus when fetal size is less than expected that condition is known as intrauterine growth restriction (iugr) also called fetal growth restriction (fgr) factors affecting fetal growth can be maternal placental or fetal
maternal factors include maternal weight body mass index nutritional state emotional stress toxin exposure (including tobacco alcohol heroin and other drugs which can also harm the fetus in other ways) and uterine blood flow
placental factors include size microstructure (densities and architecture) umbilical blood flow transporters and binding proteins nutrient utilization and nutrient production
fetal factors include the fetus genome nutrient production and hormone output also female fetuses tend to weigh less than males at full term
fetal growth is often classified as follows small for gestational age (sga) appropriate for gestational age (aga) and large for gestational age (lga) sga can result in low birth weight although premature birth can also result in low birth weight low birth weight increases risk for perinatal mortality (death shortly after birth) asphyxia hypothermia polycythemia hypocalcemia immune dysfunction neurologic abnormalities and other long-term health problems sga may be associated with growth delay or it may instead be associated with absolute stunting of growth
== viabilityedit ==
viability refers to a point in fetal development at which the fetus may survive outside the womb the lower limit of viability is approximately five months gestational age and is usually later
there is no sharp limit of development age or weight at which a fetus automatically becomes viable according to data from 200305 survival rates are 20 to 35 percent for babies born at 23 weeks of gestation 50 to 70 percent at 24 to 25 weeks and over 90 percent at 26 to 27 weeks it is rare for a baby weighing less than 500 gm to survive
when such premature babies are born the main causes of perinatal mortality are that the respiratory system and the central nervous system are not completely differentiated if given expert postnatal care some fetuses weighing less than 500 gm may survive and are referred to as extremely low birth weight or immature infants preterm birth is the most common cause of perinatal mortality causing almost 30 percent of neonatal deaths
== fetal painedit ==
fetal pain its existence and its implications are debated politically and academically according to the conclusions of a review published in 2005 evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester. however developmental neurobiologists argue that the establishment of thalamocortical connections (at about 26 weeks) is an essential event with regard to fetal perception of pain nevertheless the perception of pain involves sensory emotional and cognitive factors and it is impossible to know when pain is experienced even if it is known when thalamocortical connections are established some authors argue that fetal pain is possible from the second half of pregnancy the available scientific evidence makes it possible even probable that fetal pain perception occurs well before late gestation wrote kjs anand in the journal of the iasp
whether a fetus has the ability to feel pain and suffering is part of the abortion debate in the united states for example pro-life advocates have proposed legislation that would require providers of abortions to inform women that their fetuses may feel pain during the procedure and that would require each woman to accept or decline anesthesia for the fetus
== circulatory systemedit ==
the heart and blood vessels which form the circulatory system form relatively early during embryonic development but continue to grow and develop in complexity in the growing fetus a functional circulatory system is a biological necessity since mammalian tissues can not grow more than a few cell layers thick without an active blood supply the prenatal circulation of blood is different than the postnatal circulation mainly because the lungs are not in use the fetus obtains oxygen and nutrients from the mother through the placenta and the umbilical cord
blood from the placenta is carried to the fetus by the umbilical vein about half of this enters the fetal ductus venosus and is carried to the inferior vena cava while the other half enters the liver proper from the inferior border of the liver the branch of the umbilical vein that supplies the right lobe of the liver first joins with the portal vein the blood then moves to the right atrium of the heart in the fetus there is an opening between the right and left atrium (the foramen ovale) and most of the blood flows from the right into the left atrium thus bypassing pulmonary circulation the majority of blood flow is into the left ventricle from where it is pumped through the aorta into the body some of the blood moves from the aorta through the internal iliac arteries to the umbilical arteries and re-enters the placenta where carbon dioxide and other waste products from the fetus are taken up and enter the woman's circulation
some of the blood from the right atrium does not enter the left atrium but enters the right ventricle and is pumped into the pulmonary artery in the fetus there is a special connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta called the ductus arteriosus which directs most of this blood away from the lungs (which aren't being used for respiration at this point as the fetus is suspended in amniotic fluid)
=== postnatal developmentedit ===
with the first breath after birth the system changes suddenly pulmonary resistance is reduced dramatically prompting more blood to move into the pulmonary arteries from the right atrium and ventricle of the heart and less to flow through the foramen ovale into the left atrium the blood from the lungs travels through the pulmonary veins to the left atrium producing an increase in pressure that pushes the septum primum against the septum secundum closing the foramen ovale and completing the separation of the newborn's circulatory system into the standard left and right sides thereafter the foramen ovale is known as the fossa ovalis
the ductus arteriosus normally closes within one or two days of birth leaving the ligamentum arteriosum while the umbilical vein and ductus venosus usually closes within two to five days after birth leaving respectively the liver's ligamentum teres and ligamentum venosus
=== differences between fetal and postnataledit ===
remnants of the fetal circulation can be found in the adult
in addition to differences in circulation the developing fetus also employs a different type of oxygen transport molecule in its hemoglobin from that when it is born and breathing its own oxygen fetal hemoglobin enhances the fetus ability to draw oxygen from the placenta its oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is shifted to the left meaning that it is able to absorb oxygen at lower concentrations than adult hemoglobin this enables fetal hemoglobin to absorb oxygen from adult hemoglobin in the placenta where the oxygen pressure is lower than at the lungs until around six months old the human infant's hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha and two gamma chains (22) the gamma chains are gradually replaced by beta chains until the molecule becomes hemoglobin a with its two alpha and two beta chains (22)
== immune systemedit ==
the placenta functions as a maternal-fetal barrier against the transmission of microbes when this is insufficient mother-to-child transmission of infectious diseases can occur
maternal igg antibodies cross the placenta giving the fetus passive immunity against those diseases for which the mother has antibodies this transfer of antibodies in humans begins as early as the twentieth week (gestational age) and certainly by the twenty-fourth week
== developmental problemsedit ==
a developing fetus is highly susceptible to anomalies in its growth and metabolism increasing the risk of birth defects one area of concern is the pregnant woman's lifestyle choices made during pregnancy diet is especially important in the early stages of development studies show that supplementation of the woman's diet with folic acid reduces the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube defects another dietary concern is whether breakfast is eaten skipping breakfast could lead to extended periods of lower than normal nutrients in the woman's blood leading to a higher risk of prematurity or other birth defects in the fetus during this time alcohol consumption may increase the risk of the development of fetal alcohol syndrome a condition leading to mental retardation in some infants
smoking during pregnancy may also lead to reduced birth weight low birth weight is defined as 2500 grams (5.5 lb) low birth weight is a concern for medical providers due to the tendency of these infants described as premature by weight to have a higher risk of secondary medical problems some research shows that fetal ultrasounds (including doppler 3d/4d ultrasound and 2d ultrasound) can have negative effect on birth weight and neurodevelopment
congenital anomalies are acquired before birth infants with certain congenital anomalies of the heart can survive only as long as the ductus remains open in such cases the closure of the ductus can be delayed by the administration of prostaglandins to permit sufficient time for the surgical correction of the anomalies conversely in cases of patent ductus arteriosus where the ductus does not properly close drugs that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis can be used to encourage its closure so that surgery can be avoided
