generating methods
conventional dams
hydroelectric power comes potential energy dammed water driving water turbine generator power extracted water depends volume difference height source waters outflow height difference called head large pipe penstock delivers water reservoir turbine
pumpedstorage
method produces electricity supply high peak demands moving water reservoirs different elevations times low electrical demand excess generation capacity used pump water higher reservoir demand becomes greater water released back lower reservoir turbine pumpedstorage schemes currently provide commercially important means largescale grid energy storage improve daily capacity factor generation system pumped storage energy source appears negative number listings
runoftheriver
runoftheriver hydroelectric stations small reservoir capacity water coming upstream available generation moment oversupply must pass unused constant supply water lake existing reservoir upstream significant advantage choosing sites runoftheriver united states run river hydropower could potentially provide megawatts hp total use continuously available

small hydro stations may connected conventional electrical distribution networks source lowcost renewable energy alternatively small hydro projects may built isolated areas would uneconomic serve network areas national electrical distribution network since small hydro projects usually minimal reservoirs civil construction work seen relatively low environmental impact compared large hydro decreased environmental impact depends strongly balance stream flow power production
micro
micro hydro term used hydroelectric power installations typically produce kw power installations provide power isolated home small community sometimes connected electric power networks many installations around world particularly developing nations provide economical source energy without purchase fuel micro hydro systems complement photovoltaic solar energy systems many areas water flow thus available hydro power highest winter solar energy minimum
pico
pico hydro term used hydroelectric power generation kw useful small remote communities require small amount electricity example power one two fluorescent light bulbs tv radio homes even smaller turbines w may power single home developing country drop m ft picohydro setup typically runoftheriver meaning dams used rather pipes divert flow drop gradient turbine returning stream

advantages disadvantages
advantages
flexibility
hydropower flexible source electricity since stations ramped quickly adapt changing energy demands hydro turbines startup time order minutes takes around seconds bring unit cold startup full load much shorter gas turbines steam plants power generation also decreased quickly surplus power generation hence limited capacity hydropower units generally used produce base power except vacating flood pool meeting downstream needs instead serves backup nonhydro generators
low power costs
major advantage hydroelectricity elimination cost fuel cost operating hydroelectric station nearly immune increases cost fossil fuels oil natural gas coal imports needed average cost electricity hydro station larger megawatts us cents per kilowatthour
hydroelectric stations long economic lives plants still service years operating labor cost also usually low plants automated personnel site normal operation
dam serves multiple purposes hydroelectric station may added relatively low construction cost providing useful revenue stream offset costs dam operation calculated sale electricity three gorges dam cover construction costs years full generation additionally data shows countries large hydropower dams costly take long build deliver positive risk adjusted return unless appropriate risk management measures put place
suitability industrial applications
many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks created serve specific industrial enterprises dedicated hydroelectric projects often built provide substantial amounts electricity needed aluminium electrolytic plants example grand coulee dam switched support alcoa aluminium bellingham washington united states american world war ii airplanes allowed provide irrigation power citizens addition aluminium power war suriname brokopondo reservoir constructed provide electricity alcoa aluminium industry new zealands manapouri power station constructed supply electricity aluminium smelter tiwai point
reduced co emissions
since hydroelectric dams burn fossil fuels directly produce carbon dioxide carbon dioxide produced manufacture construction project tiny fraction operating emissions equivalent fossilfuel electricity generation one measurement greenhouse gas related externality comparison energy sources found externe project paul scherrer institut university stuttgart funded european commission according study hydroelectricity produces least amount greenhouse gases externality energy source coming second place wind third nuclear energy fourth solar photovoltaic low greenhouse gas impact hydroelectricity found especially temperate climates study local energy europe presumably similar conditions prevail north america northern asia see regular natural freezethaw cycle associated seasonal plant decay regrowth greater greenhouse gas emission impacts found tropical regions reservoirs power stations tropical regions produce larger amount methane temperate areas
uses reservoir
reservoirs created hydroelectric schemes often provide facilities water sports become tourist attractions countries aquaculture reservoirs common multiuse dams installed irrigation support agriculture relatively constant water supply large hydro dams control floods would otherwise affect people living downstream project
disadvantages
ecosystem damage loss land
large reservoirs associated traditional hydroelectric power stations result submersion extensive areas upstream dams sometimes destroying biologically rich productive lowland riverine valley forests marshland grasslands loss land often exacerbated habitat fragmentation surrounding areas caused reservoir
hydroelectric projects disruptive surrounding aquatic ecosystems upstream downstream plant site generation hydroelectric power changes downstream river environment water exiting turbine usually contains little suspended sediment lead scouring river beds loss riverbanks since turbine gates often opened intermittently rapid even daily fluctuations river flow observed
siltation flow shortage
water flows ability transport particles heavier downstream negative effect dams subsequently power stations particularly rivers within catchment areas high siltation siltation fill reservoir reduce capacity control floods along causing additional horizontal pressure upstream portion dam eventually reservoirs become full sediment useless overtop flood fail
changes amount river flow correlate amount energy produced dam lower river flows reduce amount live storage reservoir therefore reducing amount water used hydroelectricity result diminished river flow power shortages areas depend heavily hydroelectric power risk flow shortage may increase result climate change one study colorado river united states suggest modest climate changes increase temperature degree celsius resulting decline precipitation might reduce river runoff brazil particular vulnerable due heavy reliance hydroelectricity increasing temperatures lower water ow alterations rainfall regime could reduce total energy production annually end century
methane emissions reservoirs
lower positive impacts found tropical regions noted reservoirs power plants tropical regions produce substantial amounts methane due plant material flooded areas decaying anaerobic environment forming methane greenhouse gas according world commission dams report reservoir large compared generating capacity less watts per square metre surface area clearing forests area undertaken prior impoundment reservoir greenhouse gas emissions reservoir may higher conventional oilfired thermal generation plant
boreal reservoirs canada northern europe however greenhouse gas emissions typically kind conventional fossilfuel thermal generation new class underwater logging operation targets drowned forests mitigate effect forest decay
relocation
another disadvantage hydroelectric dams need relocate people living reservoirs planned world commission dams estimated dams physically displaced million people worldwide
