explanationedit
electric power transformed forms energy electric charges move electric potential voltage difference occurs electrical components electric circuits standpoint electric power components electric circuit divided two categories
passive devices loads electric charges move potential difference higher lower voltage conventional current positive charge moves positive terminal negative terminal work done charges device potential energy charges due voltage terminals converted kinetic energy device devices called passive components loads consume electric power circuit converting forms energy mechanical work heat light etc examples electrical appliances light bulbs electric motors electric heaters alternating current ac circuits direction voltage periodically reverses current always flows higher potential lower potential side
active devices power sources charges moved exterior force device direction lower electric potential higher positive charge moves negative positive terminal work done charges energy converted electric potential energy type energy mechanical energy chemical energy devices occurs called active devices power sources electric generators batteries
devices either source load depending voltage current example rechargeable battery acts source provides power circuit load connected battery charger recharged
passive sign conventionedit
since electric power flow either component convention needed direction represents positive power flow electric power flowing circuit component arbitrarily defined positive sign power flowing circuit component defined negative sign thus passive components positive power consumption power sources negative power consumption called passive sign convention
