ancient history is the aggregate of past events from the beginning of recorded human history and extending as far as the early middle ages or the postclassical era the span of recorded history is roughly 5,000 years beginning with sumerian cuneiform script the oldest discovered form of coherent writing from the protoliterate period around the 30th century bc
the term classical antiquity is often used to refer to history in the old world from the beginning of recorded greek history in 776 bc (first olympiad) this roughly coincides with the traditional date of the founding of rome in 753 bc the beginning of the history of ancient rome and the beginning of the archaic period in ancient greece although the ending date of ancient history is disputed some western scholars use the fall of the western roman empire in 476 ad (the most used) the closure of the platonic academy in 529 ad the death of the emperor justinian i in 565 ad the coming of islam or the rise of charlemagne as the end of ancient and classical european history
in india ancient history includes the early period of the middle kingdoms and in china the time up to the qin dynasty
== studyedit ==
historians have two major avenues which they take to better understand the ancient world archaeology and the study of source texts primary sources are those sources closest to the origin of the information or idea under study primary sources have been distinguished from secondary sources which often cite comment on or build upon primary sources
=== archaeologyedit ===
archaeology is the excavation and study of artefacts in an effort to interpret and reconstruct past human behavior archaeologists excavate the ruins of ancient cities looking for clues as to how the people of the time period lived some important discoveries by archaeologists studying ancient history include
the egyptian pyramids giant tombs built by the ancient egyptians beginning about 2600 bc as the final resting places of their royalty
the study of the ancient cities of harappa (pakistan) mohenjo-daro (pakistan) and lothal in india (south asia)
the city of pompeii an ancient roman city preserved by the eruption of a volcano in ad 79 its state of preservation is so great that it is a valuable window into roman culture and provided insight into the cultures of the etruscans and the samnites
the terracotta army the mausoleum of the first qin emperor in ancient china
the discovery of knossos by minos kalokairinos and sir arthur evans
the discovery of troy by heinrich schliemann

most of what is known of the ancient world comes from the accounts of antiquity's own historians although it is important to take into account the bias of each ancient author their accounts are the basis for our understanding of the ancient past some of the more notable ancient writers include herodotus thucydides arrian plutarch polybius sima qian sallust livy josephus suetonius and tacitus
a fundamental difficulty of studying ancient history is that recorded histories cannot document the entirety of human events and only a fraction of those documents have survived into the present day furthermore the reliability of the information obtained from these surviving records must be considered few people were capable of writing histories as literacy was not widespread in almost any culture until long after the end of ancient history
the earliest known systematic historical thought emerged in ancient greece beginning with herodotus of halicarnassus (484c 425 bc) thucydides largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between athens and sparta establishing a rationalistic element which set a precedent for subsequent western historical writings he was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event
the roman empire was one of the ancient world's most literate cultures but many works by its most widely read historians are lost for example livy a roman historian who lived in the 1st century bc wrote a history of rome called ab urbe condita (from the founding of the city) in 144 volumes only 35 volumes still exist although short summaries of most of the rest do exist indeed only a minority of the work of any major roman historian has survived

=== timeline of ancient historyedit ===
==== middle to late bronze ageedit ====
the bronze age forms part of the three-age system it follows the neolithic age in some areas of the world
in the 24th century bc the akkadian empire was founded in mesopotamia
the first intermediate period of egypt of the 22nd century bc was followed by the middle kingdom of egypt between the 21st to 17th centuries bc the sumerian renaissance also developed c the 21st century bc in ur around the 18th century bc the second intermediate period of egypt began
by 1600 bc mycenaean greece developed the beginning of the shang dynasty emerged in china in this period and there was evidence of a fully developed chinese writing system the beginning of hittite dominance of the eastern mediterranean region is also seen in the 1600s bc the time from the 16th to the 11th centuries bc around the nile is called the new kingdom of egypt between 1550 bc and 1292 bc the amarna period developed in egypt

==== classical antiquityedit ====
classical antiquity is a broad term for a long period of cultural history centered around the mediterranean sea which begins roughly with the earliest-recorded greek poetry of homer (9th century bc) and continues through the rise of christianity and the fall of the western roman empire (5th century ad) ending in the dissolution of classical culture with the close of late antiquity
such a wide sampling of history and territory covers many rather disparate cultures and periods classical antiquity typically refers to an idealized vision of later people of what was in edgar allan poe's words the glory that was greece the grandeur that was rome! in the 18th and 19th centuries ad reverence for classical antiquity was much greater in europe and the united states than it is today respect for the ancients of greece and rome affected politics philosophy sculpture literature theatre education and even architecture and sexuality
in politics the presence of a roman emperor was felt to be desirable long after the empire fell this tendency reached its peak when charlemagne was crowned roman emperor in the year 800 an act which led to the formation of the holy roman empire the notion that an emperor is a monarch who outranks a mere king dates from this period in this political ideal there would always be a roman empire a state whose jurisdiction extended to the entire civilized world
epic poetry in latin continued to be written and circulated well into the 19th century john milton and even arthur rimbaud received their first poetic educations in latin genres like epic poetry pastoral verse and the endless use of characters and themes from greek mythology left a deep mark on western literature
in architecture there have been several greek revivals (though while apparently more inspired in retrospect by roman architecture than greek) still one needs only to look at washington dc to see a city filled with large marble buildings with faades made out to look like roman temples with columns constructed in the classical orders of architecture
in philosophy the efforts of st thomas aquinas were derived largely from the thought of aristotle despite the intervening change in religion from paganism to christianity greek and roman authorities such as hippocrates and galen formed the foundation of the practice of medicine even longer than greek thought prevailed in philosophy in the french theatre tragedians such as molire and racine wrote plays on mythological or classical historical subjects and subjected them to the strict rules of the classical unities derived from aristotle's poetics the desire to dance like a latter-day vision of how the ancient greeks did it moved isadora duncan to create her brand of ballet the renaissance was partly caused by the rediscovery of classic antiquity

the ancient near east is considered the cradle of civilization it was the first to practice intensive year-round agriculture created the first coherent writing system invented the potter's wheel and then the vehicular- and mill wheel created the first centralized governments law codes and empires as well as introducing social stratification slavery and organized warfare and it laid the foundation for the fields of astronomy and mathematics
==== mesopotamiaedit ====
mesopotamia is the site of some of the earliest known civilizations in the world early settlement of the alluvial plain lasted from the ubaid period (late 6th millennium bc) through the uruk period (4th millennium bc) and the dynastic periods (3rd millennium bc) until the rise of babylon in the early 2nd millennium bc the surplus of storable foodstuffs created by this economy allowed the population to settle in one place instead of migrating after crops and herds it also allowed for a much greater population density and in turn required an extensive labor force and division of labor this organization led to the necessity of record keeping and the development of writing (c 3500 bc)
babylonia was an amorite state in lower mesopotamia (modern southern iraq) with babylon as its capital babylonia emerged when hammurabi (fl c 17281686 bc according to the short chronology) created an empire out of the territories of the former kingdoms of sumer and akkad the amorites being a semitic people babylonia adopted the written semitic akkadian language for official use they retained the sumerian language for religious use which by that time was no longer a spoken language the akkadian and sumerian cultures played a major role in later babylonian culture and the region would remain an important cultural center even under outside rule the earliest mention of the city of babylon can be found in a tablet from the reign of sargon of akkad dating back to the 23rd century bc
the neo-babylonian empire or chaldea was babylonia under the rule of the 11th ("chaldean") dynasty from the revolt of nabopolassar in 626 bc until the invasion of cyrus the great in 539 bc notably it included the reign of nebuchadrezzar ii who conquered judah and jerusalem

assyria was originally (in the middle bronze age) a region on the upper tigris river named for its original capital the ancient city of assur later as a nation and empire that came to control all of the fertile crescent egypt and much of anatolia the term assyria proper referred to roughly the northern half of mesopotamia (the southern half being babylonia) with nineveh as its capital the assyrian kings controlled a large kingdom at three different times in history these are called the old (20th to 15th centuries bc) middle (15th to 10th centuries bc) and neo-assyrian (911612 bc) kingdoms or periods of which the last is the most well known and best documented assyrians invented excavation to undermine city walls battering rams to knock down gates as well as the concept of a corps of engineers who bridged rivers with pontoons or provided soldiers with inflatable skins for swimming
mitanni was an indo-iranian empire in northern mesopotamia from c 1500 bc at the height of mitanni power during the 14th century bc it encompassed what is today southeastern turkey northern syria and northern iraq centered around its capital washukanni whose precise location has not been determined by archaeologists

the achaemenid empire was the first of the persian empires to rule over significant portions of greater persia and followed the median empire as the second great empire of the persian people it is noted in western history as the foe of the greek city states in the greco-persian wars for freeing the israelites from their babylonian captivity and for instituting aramaic as the empire's official language because of the empire's vast extent and long endurance persian influence upon the language religion architecture philosophy law and government of nations around the world lasts to this day at the height of its power the achaemenid dynasty encompassed approximately 8.0 million square kilometers held the greatest percentage of world population to date and was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity
parthia was an iranian civilization situated in the northeastern part of modern iran their power was based on a combination of the guerrilla warfare of a mounted nomadic tribe with organizational skills to build and administer a vast empire even though it never matched in power and extent the persian empires that preceded and followed it the parthian empire was led by the arsacid dynasty which reunited and ruled over the iranian plateau after defeating and disposing the hellenistic seleucid empire beginning in the late 3rd century bc and intermittently controlled mesopotamia between 150 bc and 224 ad it was the third native dynasty of ancient iran (after the median and the achaemenid dynasties) parthia had many wars with the roman empire
the sassanid empire lasting the length of the late antiquity period is considered to be one of iran's most important and influential historical periods in many ways the sassanid period witnessed the highest achievements of persian civilization and constituted the last great iranian empire before the muslim conquest and the adoption of islam during sassanid times persia influenced roman civilization considerably and the romans reserved for the sassanid persians alone the status of equals sassanid cultural influence extended far beyond the empire's territorial borders reaching as far as western europe africa china and india playing a role for example in the formation of both european and asiatic medieval art

==== armeniaedit ====
the early history of the hittite empire is known through tablets that may first have been written in the 17th century bc but survived only as copies made in the 14th and 13th centuries bc these tablets known collectively as the anitta text begin by telling how pithana the king of kussara or kussar (a small city-state yet to be identified by archaeologists) conquered the neighbouring city of nea (kanesh) however the real subject of these tablets is pithana's son anitta who conquered several neighbouring cities including hattusa and zalpuwa (zalpa)
assyrian inscriptions of shalmaneser i (c 1270 bc) first mention uruartri as one of the states of nairi a loose confederation of small kingdoms and tribal states in the armenian highland from the 13th to 11th centuries bc uruartri itself was in the region around lake van the nairi states were repeatedly subjected to attacks by the assyrians especially under tukulti-ninurta i (c 1240 bc) tiglath-pileser i (c 1100 bc) ashur-bel-kala (c 1070 bc) adad-nirari ii (c 900) tukulti-ninurta ii (c 890) and ashurnasirpal ii (883-859 bc)

==== arabiaedit ====
the history of pre-islamic arabia before the rise of islam in the 630s is not known in great detail archaeological exploration in the arabian peninsula has been sparse indigenous written sources are limited to the many inscriptions and coins from southern arabia existing material consists primarily of written sources from other traditions (such as egyptians greeks persians romans etc.) and oral traditions later recorded by islamic scholars
the first known inscriptions of the kingdom of hadhramaut are known from the 8th century bc it was first referenced by an outside civilization in an old sabaic inscription of karab'il watar from the early 7th century bc in which the king of hadramaut yada`'il is mentioned as being one of his allies
dilmun appears first in sumerian cuneiform clay tablets dated to the end of 4th millennium bc found in the temple of goddess inanna in the city of uruk the adjective dilmun refers to a type of axe and one specific official in addition there are lists of rations of wool issued to people connected with dilmun
the sabaeans were an ancient people speaking an old south arabian language who lived in what is today yemen in south west arabian peninsula from 2000 bc to the 8th century bc some sabaeans also lived in d'mt located in northern ethiopia and eritrea due to their hegemony over the red sea they lasted from the early 2nd millennium to the 1st century bc in the 1st century bc it was conquered by the himyarites but after the disintegration of the first himyarite empire of the kings of saba and dhu-raydan the middle sabaean kingdom reappeared in the early 2nd century it was finally conquered by the himyarites in the late 3rd century
the ancient kingdom of awsan with a capital at hagar yahirr in the wadi markha to the south of the wadi bayhan is now marked by a tell or artificial mound which is locally named hagar asfal once it was one of the most important small kingdoms of south arabia the city seems to have been destroyed in the 7th century bc by the king and mukarrib of saba karib'il watar according to a sabaean text that reports the victory in terms that attest to its significance for the sabaeans
the himyar was a state in ancient south arabia dating from 110 bc it conquered neighbouring saba (sheba) in c 25 bc qataban in c 200 ad and hadramaut c 300 ad its political fortunes relative to saba changed frequently until it finally conquered the sabaean kingdom around 280 ad it was the dominant state in arabia until 525 ad the economy was based on agriculture
foreign trade was based on the export of frankincense and myrrh for many years it was also the major intermediary linking east africa and the mediterranean world this trade largely consisted of exporting ivory from africa to be sold in the roman empire ships from himyar regularly traveled the east african coast and the state also exerted a considerable amount of political control of the trading cities of east africa
the nabataean origins remain obscure on the similarity of sounds jerome suggested a connection with the tribe nebaioth mentioned in genesis but modern historians are cautious about an early nabatean history the babylonian captivity that began in 586 bc opened a power vacuum in judah and as edomites moved into judaean grazing lands nabataean inscriptions began to be left in edomite territory (earlier than 312 bc when they were attacked at petra without success by antigonus i) the first definite appearance was in 312 bc when hieronymus of cardia a seleucid officer mentioned the nabateans in a battle report in 50 bc the greek historian diodorus siculus cited hieronymus in his report and added the following just as the seleucids had tried to subdue them so the romans made several attempts to get their hands on that lucrative trade.
petra or sela was the ancient capital of edom the nabataeans must have occupied the old edomite country and succeeded to its commerce after the edomites took advantage of the babylonian captivity to press forward into southern judaea this migration the date of which cannot be determined also made them masters of the shores of the gulf of aqaba and the important harbor of elath here according to agatharchides they were for a time very troublesome as wreckers and pirates to the reopened commerce between egypt and the east until they were chastised by the ptolemaic rulers of alexandria
the lakhmid kingdom was founded by the lakhum tribe that immigrated out of yemen in the 2nd century and ruled by the banu lakhm hence the name given it it was formed of a group of arab christians who lived in southern iraq and made al-hirah their capital in (266) the founder of the dynasty was amr and the son imru al-qais converted to christianity gradually the whole city converted to that faith imru al-qais dreamt of a unified and independent arab kingdom and following that dream he seized many cities in arabia
the ghassanids were a group of south arabian christian tribes that emigrated in the early 3rd century from yemen to the hauran in southern syria jordan and the holy land where they intermarried with hellenized roman settlers and greek-speaking early christian communities the ghassanid emigration has been passed down in the rich oral tradition of southern syria it is said that the ghassanids came from the city of ma'rib in yemen there was a dam in this city however one year there was so much rain that the dam was carried away by the ensuing flood thus the people there had to leave the inhabitants emigrated seeking to live in less arid lands and became scattered far and wide the proverb they were scattered like the people of saba refers to that exodus in history the emigrants were from the southern arab tribe of azd of the kahlan branch of qahtani tribes

though the ugaritic site is thought to have been inhabited earlier neolithic ugarit was already important enough to be fortified with a wall early on the first written evidence mentioning the city comes from the nearby city of ebla c 1800 bc ugarit passed into the sphere of influence of egypt which deeply influenced its art
==== israeledit ====
israel and judah were related iron age kingdoms of the ancient levant and had existed during the iron ages and the neo-babylonian persian and hellenistic periods the name israel first appears in the stele of the egyptian pharaoh merneptah c 1209 bc israel is laid waste and his seed is no more. this israel was a cultural and probably political entity of the central highlands well enough established to be perceived by the egyptians as a possible challenge to their hegemony but an ethnic group rather than an organised state archaeologist paula mcnutt says it is probably  during iron age i [that] a population began to identify itself as israelite', differentiating itself from its neighbours via prohibitions on intermarriage an emphasis on family history and genealogy and religion
israel had emerged by the middle of the 9th century bc when the assyrian king shalmaneser iii names ahab the israelite among his enemies at the battle of qarqar (853) judah emerged somewhat later than israel probably during the 9th century bc but the subject is one of considerable controversy israel came into increasing conflict with the expanding neo-assyrian empire which first split its territory into several smaller units and then destroyed its capital samaria (722) a series of campaigns by the neo-babylonian empire between 597 and 582 led to the destruction of judah
followed by the fall of babylon to the persian empire jews were allowed by cyrus the great to return to judea the hasmonean kingdom (followed by the maccabean revolt) had existed during the hellenistic period and then the herodian kingdom during the roman period
==== phoeniciansedit ====
phoenicia was an ancient civilization centered in the north of ancient canaan with its heartland along the coastal regions of modern-day lebanon syria and israel phoenician civilization was an enterprising maritime trading culture that spread across the mediterranean between the period of 1550 to 300 bc
a written reference herodotus's account (written c 440 bc) refers to a memory from 800 years earlier which may be subject to question in the fullness of genetic results (history i:1) this is a legendary introduction to herodotus brief retelling of some mythical hellene-phoenician interactions though few modern archaeologists would confuse this myth with history a grain of truth may yet lie therein
=== africaedit ===
==== egyptedit ====
ancient egypt was a long-lived civilization geographically located in north-eastern africa it was concentrated along the middle to lower reaches of the nile river reaching its greatest extension during the 2nd millennium bc which is referred to as the new kingdom period it reached broadly from the nile delta in the north as far south as jebel barkal at the fourth cataract of the nile extensions to the geographical range of ancient egyptian civilization included at different times areas of the southern levant the eastern desert and the red sea coastline the sinai peninsula and the western desert (focused on the several oases)
ancient egypt developed over at least three and a half millennia it began with the incipient unification of nile valley polities around 3500 bc and is conventionally thought to have ended in 30 bc when the early roman empire conquered and absorbed ptolemaic egypt as a province (though this last did not represent the first period of foreign domination the roman period was to witness a marked if gradual transformation in the political and religious life of the nile valley effectively marking the termination of independent civilisational development)
the civilization of ancient egypt was based on a finely balanced control of natural and human resources characterised primarily by controlled irrigation of the fertile nile valley the mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions the early development of an independent writing system and literature the organisation of collective projects trade with surrounding regions in east / central africa and the eastern mediterranean finally military ventures that exhibited strong characteristics of imperial hegemony and territorial domination of neighbouring cultures at different periods motivating and organizing these activities were a socio-political and economic elite that achieved social consensus by means of an elaborate system of religious belief under the figure of a (semi)-divine ruler (usually male) from a succession of ruling dynasties and which related to the larger world by means of polytheistic beliefs
==== nubiaedit ====
the kushite state was formed before a period of egyptian incursion into the area the kushite civilization has also been referred to as nubia the first cultures arose in sudan before the time of a unified egypt and the most widespread is known as the kerma civilization it is through egyptian hebrew roman and greek records that most of our knowledge of kush (cush) comes
it is also referred to as ethiopia in ancient greek and roman records according to josephus and other classical writers the kushite empire covered all of africa and some parts of asia and europe at one time or another the kushites are also famous for having buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves the kushites also built burial mounds and pyramids and shared some of the same gods worshipped in egypt especially amon and isis

the land of punt also called pwenet or pwene by the ancient egyptians was a trading partner known for producing and exporting gold aromatic resins african blackwood ebony ivory slaves and wild animals information about punt has been found in ancient egyptian records of trade missions to this region the exact location of punt remains a mystery the mainstream view is that punt was located to the south-east of egypt most likely on the coast of the horn of africa the earliest recorded egyptian expedition to punt was organized by pharaoh sahure of the fifth dynasty (25th century bc) although gold from punt is recorded as having been in egypt in the time of king khufu of the fourth dynasty of egypt subsequently there were more expeditions to punt in the sixth dynasty of egypt the eleventh dynasty of egypt the twelfth dynasty of egypt and the eighteenth dynasty of egypt in the twelfth dynasty of egypt trade with punt was celebrated in popular literature in tale of the shipwrecked sailor
==== nok cultureedit ====
the nok culture appeared in nigeria around 1000 bc and mysteriously vanished around 200 ad the civilizations social system is thought to have been highly advanced the nok civilization was considered to be the earliest sub-saharan producer of life-sized terracotta which have been discovered by archaeologists a nok sculpture resident at the minneapolis institute of arts portrays a sitting dignitary wearing a shepherds crook on the right arm and a hinged flail on the left these are symbols of authority associated with ancient egyptian pharaohs and the god osiris which suggests that an ancient egyptian style of social structure and perhaps religion existed in the area of modern nigeria during the late pharonic period (informational excerpt copied from nigeria and nok culture articles)
==== carthageedit ====
carthage was founded in 814 bc by phoenician settlers from the city of tyre bringing with them the city-god melqart ancient carthage was an informal hegemony of phoenician city-states throughout north africa and modern spain from 575 bc until 146 bc it was more or less under the control of the city-state of carthage after the fall of tyre to babylonian forces at the height of the city's influence its empire included most of the western mediterranean the empire was in a constant state of struggle with the roman republic which led to a series of conflicts known as the punic wars after the third and final punic war carthage was destroyed then occupied by roman forces nearly all of the territory held by carthage fell into roman hands
=== south asiaedit ===
the earliest evidence of human civilization in south asia is from the mehrgarh region (7000 bc to 3200 bc) of pakistan located near the bolan pass to the west of the indus river valley and between the present-day pakistani cities of quetta kalat and sibi mehrgarh was discovered in 1974 by an archaeological team directed by french archaeologist jean-franois jarrige and was excavated continuously between 1974 and 1986 the earliest settlement at mehrgarhin the northeast corner of the 495 acres (2.00 km2) sitewas a small farming village dated between 7000 bc5500 bc early mehrgarh residents lived in mud brick houses stored their grain in granaries fashioned tools with local copper ore and lined their large basket containers with bitumen they cultivated six-row barley einkorn and emmer wheat jujubes and dates and herded sheep goats and cattle residents of the later period (5500 bc to 2600 bc) put much effort into crafts including flint knapping tanning bead production and metal working the site was occupied continuously until about 2600 bc.[2]
in april 2006 it was announced in the scientific journal nature that the oldest evidence in human history for the drilling of teeth in vivo (i.e in a living person) was found in mehrgarh mehrgarh is sometimes cited as the earliest known farming settlement in south asia based on archaeological excavations from 1974 (jarrige et al.) the earliest evidence of settlement dates from 7000 bc it is also cited for the earliest evidence of pottery in south asia archaeologists divide the occupation at the site into several periods mehrgarh is now seen as a precursor to the indus valley civilization
==== indus valley civilizationedit ====
the indus valley civilization (c 33001700 bc flourished 26001900 bc) abbreviated ivc was an ancient civilization that flourished in the indus and ghaggar-hakra river valleys primarily in what is now pakistan although settlements linked to this ancient civilization have been found in eastern afghanistan and western india minor scattered sites have been found as far away as turkmenistan another name for this civilization is the harappan civilization after the first of its cities to be excavated harappa in the pakistani province of punjab the ivc might have been known to the sumerians as the meluhha and other trade contacts may have included egypt africa however the modern world discovered it only in the 1920s as a result of archaeological excavations and rail road building prominent historians of ancient india would include ram sharan sharma and romila thapar
==== mahajanapadasedit ====
the births of mahavira and buddha in the 6th century bc mark the beginning of well-recorded history in the region around the 5th century bc the ancient region of pakistan was invaded by the achaemenid empire under darius in 522 bc forming the easternmost satraps of the persian empire the provinces of sindh and panjab were said to be the richest satraps of the persian empire and contributed many soldiers to various persian expeditions it is known that an indian contingent fought in xerxes army on his expedition to greece herodotus mentions that the indus satrapy supplied cavalry and chariots to the persian army he also mentions that the indus people were clad in armaments made of cotton carried bows and arrows of cane covered with iron herodotus states that in 517 bc darius sent an expedition under scylax to explore the indus under persian rule much irrigation and commerce flourished within the vast territory of the empire the persian empire was followed by the invasion of the greeks under alexander's army since alexander was determined to reach the eastern-most limits of the persian empire he could not resist the temptation to conquer india (i.e the punjab region) which at this time was parcelled out into small chieftain-ships who were feudatories of the persian empire alexander amalgamated the region into the expanding hellenic empire the rigveda in sanskrit goes back to about 1500 bc the indian literary tradition has an oral history reaching down into the vedic period of the later 2nd millennium bc
ancient india is usually taken to refer to the golden age of classical hindu culture as reflected in sanskrit literature beginning around 500 bc with the sixteen monarchies and republics known as the mahajanapadas stretched across the indo-gangetic plains from modern-day afghanistan to bangladesh the largest of these nations were magadha kosala kuru and gandhara notably the great epics of ramayana and mahabharata are rooted in this classical period
amongst the sixteen mahajanapadas the kingdom of magadha rose to prominence under a number of dynasties that peaked in power under the reign of ashoka maurya one of india's most legendary and famous emperors during the reign of ashoka the four dynasties of chola chera and pandya were ruling in the south while the king devanampiya tissa was controlling the anuradhapura kingdom (now sri lanka) these kingdoms while not part of ashoka's empire were in friendly terms with the maurya empire there was a strong alliance existed between devanampiya tissa (250210 bc) and ashoka of india who sent arahat mahinda four monks and a novice being sent to sri lanka they encountered devanampiya tissa at mihintale after this meeting devanampiya tissa embraced buddhism the order of monks was established in the country devanampiya tissa guided by arahat mahinda took steps to firmly establish buddhism in the country
the satavahanas started out as feudatories to the mauryan empire and declared independence soon after the death of ashoka (232 bc) other notable ancient south indian dynasties include the kadambas of banavasi western ganga dynasty badami chalukyas western chalukyas hoysalas kakatiya dynasty pallavas rashtrakutas of manyaketha and satavahanas
==== middle kingdomsedit ====
the period between ad 320550 is known as the classical age when most of north india was reunited under the gupta empire (c ad 320550) this was a period of relative peace law and order and extensive achievements in religion education mathematics arts sanskrit literature and drama grammar composition logic metaphysics mathematics medicine and astronomy became increasingly specialized and reached an advanced level the gupta empire was weakened and ultimately ruined by the raids of hunas (a branch of the hephthalites emanating from central asia) under harsha (r 60647) north india was reunited briefly
the educated speech at that time was sanskrit while the dialects of the general population of northern india were referred to as prakrits the south indian malabar coast and the tamil people of the sangam age traded with the graeco-roman world they were in contact with the phoenicians romans greeks arabs syrians jews and the chinese
the regions of south asia primarily present-day pakistan and india were estimated to have had the largest economy of the world between the 1st and 15th centuries ad controlling between one third and one quarter of the world's wealth up to the time of the mughals from whence it rapidly declined during british rule

written records of china's past dates from the shang dynasty () in perhaps the 13th century bc and takes the form of inscriptions of divination records on the bones or shells of animalsthe so-called oracle bones () archaeological findings providing evidence for the existence of the shang dynasty c 16001046 bc is divided into two sets the first from the earlier shang period (c 16001300) comes from sources at erligang () zhengzhou () and shangcheng the second set from the later shang or yin () period consists of a large body of oracle bone writings anyang () in modern-day henan has been confirmed as the last of the nine capitals of the shang (c 13001046 bc)
by the end of the 2nd millennium bc the zhou dynasty () began to emerge in the yellow river valley overrunning the shang the zhou appeared to have begun their rule under a semi-feudal system the ruler of the zhou king wu with the assistance of his brother the duke of zhou as regent managed to defeat the shang at the battle of muye the king of zhou at this time invoked the concept of the mandate of heaven to legitimize his rule a concept that would be influential for almost every successive dynasty the zhou initially moved their capital west to an area near modern xi'an near the yellow river but they would preside over a series of expansions into the yangtze river valley this would be the first of many population migrations from north to south in chinese history
===== spring and autumnedit =====
in the 8th century bc power became decentralized during the spring and autumn period () named after the influential spring and autumn annals in this period local military leaders used by the zhou began to assert their power and vie for hegemony the situation was aggravated by the invasion of other peoples from the northwest such as the quanrong forcing the zhou to move their capital east to luoyang this marks the second large phase of the zhou dynasty the eastern zhou in each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose local strongmen held most of the political power and continued their subservience to the zhou kings in name only local leaders for instance started using royal titles for themselves the hundred schools of thought () of chinese philosophy blossomed during this period and such influential intellectual movements as confucianism () taoism () legalism () and mohism () were founded partly in response to the changing political world the spring and autumn period is marked by a falling apart of the central zhou power china now consists of hundreds of states some only as large as a village with a fort
===== warring statesedit =====
after further political consolidation seven prominent states remained by the end of 5th century bc and the years in which these few states battled each other is known as the warring states period () though there remained a nominal zhou king until 256 bc he was largely a figurehead and held little power as neighboring territories of these warring states including areas of modern sichuan () and liaoning () were annexed they were governed under the new local administrative system of commandery and prefecture () this system had been in use since the spring and autumn period and parts can still be seen in the modern system of sheng & xian (province and county ) the final expansion in this period began during the reign of ying zheng () the king of qin his unification of the other six powers and further annexations in the modern regions of zhejiang () fujian () guangdong () and guangxi () in 214 bc enabled him to proclaim himself the first emperor (qin shi huangdi )

the three kingdoms (baekje goguryeo and silla) conquered other successor states of gojoseon and came to dominate the peninsula and much of manchuria the three kingdoms competed with each other both economically and militarily goguryeo and baekje were the more powerful states for much of the three kingdoms era at times more powerful than the neighboring sui dynasty goguryeo was a regional power that defeated massive chinese invasions multiple times as one of the three kingdoms of korea silla gradually extended across korea and eventually became the first state since gojoseon to cover most of korean peninsula in 676 in 698 former goguryeo general dae jo-yeong founded balhae as the successor to goguryeo
unified silla itself fell apart in the late 9th century giving way to the tumultuous later three kingdoms period (892-936) which ended with the establishment of the goryeo dynasty after the fall of balhae in 926 to the khitan much of its people were absorbed into goryeo dynasty

==== mongolsedit ====
north-western mongolia was turkic while south-western mongolia had come under indo-european (tocharian and scythian) influence in antiquity the eastern portions of both inner and outer mongolia were inhabited by mongolic peoples descended from the donghu people including the xianbei wuhuan rouran tuoba murong shiwei kumo xi and khitan these were tengriist horse-riding pastoralist kingdoms that had close contact with the chinese the donghu are first mentioned by sima qian as already existing in inner mongolia north of the state of yan in 699-632 bc the mongolic-speaking xianbei (208 bc-234 ad) originally formed a part of the donghu confederation but existed even before that time as evidenced by a mention in the guoyu  section which states that during the reign of king cheng of zhou (reigned 1042-1021 bc) the xianbei came to participate at a meeting of zhou subject-lords at qiyang () (now qishan county) but were only allowed to perform the fire ceremony under the supervision of chu () since they were not vassals by covenant () as a nomadic confederation composed of the xianbei and wuhuan the donghu were prosperous in the 4th century bc forcing surrounding tribes to pay tribute and constantly harassing the state of zhao (325 bc during the early years of the reign of wuling) and the state of yan (in 304 bc general qin kai was given as a hostage to the donghu)

in pre-columbian times several large centralized ancient civilizations developed in the western hemisphere both in mesoamerica and western south america
==== andean civilizationsedit ====
the central andes in south america has the largest ancient civilization register spanning 4,500 years from norte chico to the latest civilization the inca empire
==== mesoamericaedit ====
mesoamerican ancient civilizations included the olmecs and mayans between 2000 and 300 bc complex cultures began to form and many matured into advanced mesoamerican civilizations such as the olmec izapa teotihuacan maya zapotec mixtec huastec purpecha toltec and aztec which flourished for nearly 4,000 years before the first contact with europeans these civilizations progress included pyramid-temples mathematics astronomy medicine and theology
the zapotec emerged around 1500 years bc they left behind the great city monte alban their writing system had been thought to have influenced the olmecs but with recent evidence the olmec may have been the first civilization in the area to develop a true writing system independently at the present time there is some debate as to whether or not olmec symbols dated to 650 bc are actually a form of writing preceding the oldest zapotec writing dated to about 500 bc
olmec symbols found in 2002 and 2006 date to 650 bc and 900 bc respectively preceding the oldest zapotec writing the olmec symbols found in 2006 dating to 900 bc are known as the cascajal block
the earliest mayan inscriptions found which are identifiably maya date to the 3rd century bc in san bartolo guatemala

==== etruriaedit ====
the history of the etruscans can be traced relatively accurately based on the examination of burial sites artifacts and writing etruscans culture that is identifiably and certainly etruscan developed in italy in earnest by 800 bc approximately over the range of the preceding iron age villanovan culture the latter gave way in the 7th century to a culture that was influenced by greek traders and greek neighbors in magna graecia the hellenic civilization of southern italy
from the descendants of the villanovan people in etruria in central italy a separate etruscan culture emerged in the beginning of the 7th century bc evidenced by around 7,000 inscriptions in an alphabet similar to that of euboean greek in the non-indo-european etruscan language the burial tombs some of which had been fabulously decorated promotes the idea of an aristocratic city-state with centralized power structures maintaining order and constructing public works such as irrigation networks roads and town defenses
==== greeceedit ====
ancient greece is the period in greek history lasting for close to a millennium until the rise of christianity it is considered by most historians to be the foundational culture of western civilization greek culture was a powerful influence in the roman empire which carried a version of it to many parts of europe
the earliest known human settlements in greece were on the island of crete more than 9,000 years ago though there is evidence of tool use on the island going back over 100,000 years the earliest evidence of a civilisation in ancient greece is that of the minoans on crete dating as far back as 3600 bc on the mainland the mycenaean civilisation rose to prominence around 1600 bc superseded the minoan civilisation on crete and lasted until about 1100 bc leading to a period known as the greek dark ages
the archaic period in greece is generally considered to have lasted from around the eighth century bc to the invasion by xerxes in 480 bc this period saw the expansion of the greek world around the mediterranean with the founding of greek city-states as far afield as sicily in the west and the black sea in the east politically the archaic period in greece saw the collapse of the power of the old aristocracies with democratic reforms in athens and the development of sparta's unique constitution the end of the archaic period also saw the rise of athens which would come to be a dominant power in the classical period after the reforms of solon and the tyranny of pisistratus
the classical greek world was dominated throughout the fifth century bc by the major powers of athens and sparta through the delian league athens was able to convert pan-hellenist sentiment and fear of the persian threat into a powerful empire and this along with the conflict between sparta and athens culminating in the peloponnesian war was the major political development of the first part of the classical period
the period in greek history from the death of alexander the great until the rise of the roman empire and its conquest of egypt in 30 bc is known as the hellenistic period the name derives from the greek word hellenistes ("the greek speaking ones") and describes the spread of greek culture into the non-greek world following the conquests of alexander and the rise of his successors
following the battle of corinth in 146 bc greece came under roman rule ruled from the province of macedonia in 27 bc augustus organised the greek peninsula into the province of achaea greece remained under roman control until the break up of the roman empire in which it remained part of the eastern empire much of greece remained under byzantine control until the end of the byzantine empire

==== romeedit ====
ancient rome was a civilization that grew out of the city-state of rome originating as a small agricultural community founded on the italian peninsula in the 9th century bc in its twelve centuries of existence roman civilization shifted from a monarchy to an oligarchic republic to an increasingly autocratic empire
roman civilization is often grouped into classical antiquity with ancient greece a civilization that inspired much of the culture of ancient rome ancient rome contributed greatly to the development of law war art literature architecture and language in the western world and its history continues to have a major influence on the world today the roman civilization came to dominate europe and the mediterranean region through conquest and assimilation
throughout the territory under the control of ancient rome residential architecture ranged from very modest houses to country villas a number of roman founded cities had monumental structures many contained fountains with fresh drinking-water supplied by hundreds of miles of aqueducts theatres gymnasiums bath complexes sometime with libraries and shops marketplaces and occasionally functional sewers
however a number of factors led to the eventual decline of the roman empire the western half of the empire including hispania gaul and italy eventually broke into independent kingdoms in the 5th century the eastern roman empire governed from constantinople is referred to as the byzantine empire after ad 476 the traditional date for the fall of rome and subsequent onset of the middle ages
==== late antiquityedit ====
the roman empire underwent considerable social cultural and organizational change starting with reign of diocletian who began the custom of splitting the empire into eastern and western halves ruled by multiple emperors beginning with constantine the great the empire was christianized and a new capital founded at constantinople migrations of germanic tribes disrupted roman rule from the late 4th century onwards culminating in the eventual collapse of the empire in the west in 476 replaced by the so-called barbarian kingdoms the resultant cultural fusion of greco-roman germanic and christian traditions formed the cultural foundations of europe

migration of germanic peoples to britain from what is now northern germany and southern scandinavia is attested from the 5th century (e.g undley bracteate) based on bede's historia ecclesiastica gentis anglorum the intruding population is traditionally divided into angles saxons and jutes but their composition was likely less clear-cut and may also have included ancient frisians and franks the anglo-saxon chronicle contains text that may be the first recorded indications of the movement of these germanic tribes to britain the angles and saxons and jutes were noted to be a confederation in the greek geographia written by ptolemy in around ad 150
anglo-saxon is the term usually used to describe the peoples living in the south and east of great britain from the early 5th century ad benedictine monk bede identified them as the descendants of three germanic tribes the angles the saxons and the jutes from the jutland peninsula and lower saxony (german niedersachsen germany) the angles may have come from angeln and bede wrote their nation came to britain leaving their land empty they spoke closely related germanic dialects the anglo-saxons knew themselves as the englisc, from which the word english derives
the celts were a diverse group of tribal societies in iron age europe proto-celtic culture formed in the early iron age in central europe (hallstatt period named for the site in present-day austria) by the later iron age (la tne period) celts had expanded over wide range of lands as far west as ireland and the iberian peninsula as far east as galatia (central anatolia) and as far north as scotland by the early centuries ad following the expansion of the roman empire and the great migrations of germanic peoples celtic culture had become restricted to the british isles (insular celtic) with the continental celtic languages extinct by the mid-1st millennium ad
viking refers to a member of the norse (scandinavian) peoples famous as explorers warriors merchants and pirates who raided and colonized wide areas of europe beginning in the late 8th these norsemen used their famed longships to travel the viking age forms a major part of scandinavian history with a minor yet significant part in european history

=== religion and philosophyedit ===
new philosophies and religions arose in both east and west particularly about the 6th century bc over time a great variety of religions developed around the world with some of the earliest major ones being hinduism buddhism and jainism in india and zoroastrianism in persia the abrahamic religions trace their origin to judaism around 1800 bc
the ancient indian philosophy is a fusion of two ancient traditions sramana tradition and vedic tradition indian philosophy begins with the vedas where questions related to laws of nature the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked jainism and buddhism are continuation of the sramana school of thought the sramanas cultivated a pessimistic world view of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities they laid stress on philosophical concepts like ahimsa karma jnana samsara and moksa while there are ancient relations between the indian vedas and the iranian avesta the two main families of the indo-iranian philosophical traditions were characterized by fundamental differences in their implications for the human being's position in society and their view on the role of man in the universe
in the east three schools of thought were to dominate chinese thinking until the modern day these were taoism legalism and confucianism the confucian tradition which would attain dominance looked for political morality not to the force of law but to the power and example of tradition confucianism would later spread into the korean peninsula and goguryeo and toward japan
in the west the greek philosophical tradition represented by socrates plato and aristotle was diffused throughout europe and the middle east in the 4th century bc by the conquests of alexander iii of macedon more commonly known as alexander the great after the bronze and iron age religions formed the rise and spread of christianity through the roman world marked the end of hellenistic philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of medieval philosophy
=== science and technologyedit ===
in the history of technology and ancient science during the growth of the ancient civilizations ancient technological advances were produced in engineering these advances stimulated other societies to adopt new ways of living and governance
the characteristics of ancient egyptian technology are indicated by a set of artifacts and customs that lasted for thousands of years the egyptians invented and used many basic machines such as the ramp and the lever to aid construction processes the egyptians also played an important role in developing mediterranean maritime technology including ships and lighthouses
the history of science and technology in india dates back to ancient times the indus valley civilization yields evidence of hydrography metrology and sewage collection and disposal being practiced by its inhabitants among the fields of science and technology pursued in india were ayurveda metallurgy astronomy and mathematics some ancient inventions include plastic surgery cataract surgery hindu-arabic numeral system and wootz steel
the history of science and technology in china show significant advances in science technology mathematics and astronomy the first recorded observations of comets and supernovae were made in china traditional chinese medicine acupuncture and herbal medicine were also practiced
ancient greek technology developed at an unprecedented speed during the 5th century bc continuing up to and including the roman period and beyond inventions that are credited to the ancient greeks such as the gear screw bronze casting techniques water clock water organ torsion catapult and the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys many of these inventions occurred late in the greek period often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war roman technology is the engineering practice which supported roman civilization and made the expansion of roman commerce and roman military possible over nearly a thousand years the roman empire had the most advanced set of technology of their time some of which may have been lost during the turbulent eras of late antiquity and the early middle ages roman technological feats of many different areas like civil engineering construction materials transport technology and some inventions such as the mechanical reaper went unmatched until the 19th century
qanats which likely emerged on the iranian plateau and possibly also in the arabian peninsula sometime in the early 1st millennium bc spread from there slowly west- and eastward
=== maritime activityedit ===
the history of ancient navigation began in earnest when men took to the sea in planked boats and ships propelled by sails hung on masts like the ancient egyptian khufu ship from the mid-3rd millennium bc according to the greek historian herodotus necho ii sent out an expedition of phoenicians which in three years sailed from the red sea around africa to the mouth of the nile many current historians tend to believe herodotus on this point even though herodotus himself was in disbelief that the phoenicians had accomplished the act
hannu was an ancient egyptian explorer (around 2750 bc) and the first explorer of whom there is any knowledge he made the first recorded exploring expedition writing his account of his exploration in stone hannu travelled along the red sea to punt and sailed to what is now part of eastern ethiopia and somalia he returned to egypt with great treasures including precious myrrh metal and wood
=== warfareedit ===
ancient warfare is war as conducted from the beginnings of recorded history to the end of the ancient period in europe the end of antiquity is often equated with the fall of rome in 476 in china it can also be seen as ending in the 5th century with the growing role of mounted warriors needed to counter the ever-growing threat from the north
the difference between prehistoric warfare and ancient warfare is less one of technology than of organization the development of first city-states and then empires allowed warfare to change dramatically beginning in mesopotamia states produced sufficient agricultural surplus that full-time ruling elites and military commanders could emerge while the bulk of military forces were still farmers the society could support having them campaigning rather than working the land for a portion of each year thus organized armies developed for the first time
these new armies could help states grow in size and became increasingly centralized and the first empire that of the sumerians formed in mesopotamia early ancient armies continued to primarily use bows and spears the same weapons that had been developed in prehistoric times for hunting early armies in egypt and china followed a similar pattern of using massed infantry armed with bows and spears
=== artwork and musicedit ===
ancient music is music that developed in literate cultures replacing prehistoric music ancient music refers to the various musical systems that were developed across various geographical regions such as persia india china greece rome egypt and mesopotamia (see music of mesopotamia music of ancient greece music of ancient rome music of iran) ancient music is designated by the characterization of the basic audible tones and scales it may have been transmitted through oral or written systems arts of the ancient world refers to the many types of art that were in the cultures of ancient societies such as those of ancient china egypt greece india persia mesopotamia and rome
