height is the measure of vertical distance but has two meanings in common use it can either indicate how tall something is or how high up it is for example the height of the building is 50 m or the height of the airplane is 10,000 m when used to describe how high something like an airplane or mountain peak is from sea level height is more often called altitude height is measured along the vertical (y) axis between a specified point and another 
== etymologyedit ==
english high is derived from old english hah ultimately from proto-germanic *xauxa-z from a pie base *keuk- the derived noun height also the obsolete forms heighth and highth is from old english heho later hahu as it were from proto-germanic *xaux-ia
== in mathematicsedit ==
in elementary models of space height may indicate the third dimension the other two being length and width height is normal to the plane formed by the length and width
height is also used as a name for some more abstract definitions these include
the altitude of a triangle which is the length from a vertex of a triangle to the line formed by the opposite side
a measurement in a circular segment of the distance from the midpoint of the arc of the circular segment to the midpoint of the line joining the endpoints of the arc (see diagram in circular segment)
in algebraic number theory a height function is a measurement related to the minimal polynomial of an algebraic number
among other uses in commutative algebra and representation theory
== in geologyedit ==
although height is relative to a plane of reference most measurements of height in the physical world are based upon a zero surface known as sea level both altitude and elevation two synonyms for height are usually defined as the position of a point above the mean sea level one can extend the sea-level surface under the continents naively one can imagine a lot of narrow canals through the continents in practice the sea level under a continent has to be computed from gravity measurements and slightly different computational methods exist see geodesy heights
== in geodesyedit ==
instead of using the sea level geodesists often prefer to define height from the surface of a reference ellipsoid see geodetic system vertical datum
defining the height of geographic landmarks becomes a question of reference for example the highest mountain by elevation in reference to sea level belongs to mount everest located on the border of nepal and tibet china however the highest mountain by measurement of apex to base belongs to mauna kea in hawaii united states
== in aviationedit ==
in aviation terminology the terms height altitude and elevation are not synonyms usually the altitude of an aircraft is measured from sea level while its height is measured from ground level elevation is also measured from sea level but is most often regarded as a property of the ground thus elevation plus height can equal altitude but the term altitude has several meanings in aviation see altitude in aviation
== in human cultureedit ==
human height is one of the areas of study within anthropometry while height variations within a population are largely genetic height variations between populations are mostly environmental
the united nations uses height (among other statistics) to monitor changes in the nutrition of developing nations in human populations average height can distill down complex data about the group's birth upbringing social class diet and health care system
