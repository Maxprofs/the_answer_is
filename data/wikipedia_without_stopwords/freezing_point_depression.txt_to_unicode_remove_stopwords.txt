freezingpoint depression describes process adding solute solvent decreases freezing point solvent
examples include salt water alcohol water mixing two solids impurities finely powdered drug last case added compound solute original solid thought solvent resulting solution solidsolid mixture lower freezing point pure solvent solid phenomenon causes sea water mixture salt things water remain liquid temperatures c f freezing point pure water
uses
phenomenon freezing point depression many practical uses radiator fluid automobile mixture water ethylene glycol antifreeze result freezing point depression radiators freeze winter unless extremely cold eg c f road salting takes advantage effect lower freezing point ice placed lowering freezing point allows street ice melt lower temperatures preventing accumulation dangerous slippery ice maximum depression freezing point commonly used sodium chloride water c f ambient temperature lower becomes ineffective salts used calcium chloride magnesium chloride mixture many salts little aggressive metals especially iron airports need safer media sodium formate potassium formate sodium acetate potassium acetate others
freezingpoint depression used organisms live extreme cold creatures evolved means produce high concentration various compounds sorbitol glycerol elevated concentration solute decreases freezing point water inside preventing organism freezing solid even water around freezes air around becomes cold examples organisms produce antifreeze compounds include species arcticliving fish rainbow smelt produces glycerol molecules survive frozenover estuaries winter months animals spring peeper frog pseudacris crucifer molality increased temporarily reaction cold temperatures case peeper frog freezing temperatures trigger large scale breakdown glycogen frogs liver subsequent release massive amounts glucose blood
formula freezingpoint depression used measure degree dissociation molar mass solute kind measurement called cryoscopy greek cryo cold scopos observe observe cold relies exact measurement freezing point degree dissociation measured determining van hoff factor first determining mb comparing msolute case molar mass solute must known molar mass solute determined comparing mb amount solute dissolved case must known procedure primarily useful organic compounds using nonpolar solvent cryoscopy longer common measurement method included textbooks turn th century example still taught useful analytic procedure cohens practical organic chemistry molar mass naphthalene determined using beckmann freezing apparatus
freezingpoint depression also used purity analysis tool analysed differential scanning calorimetry results obtained mol method place methods analysis fail
also principle acting meltingpoint depression observed melting point impure solid mixture measured melting point apparatus since melting freezing points refer liquidsolid phase transition albeit different directions
principle boiling point elevation freezing point depression could used interchangeably purpose however cryoscopic constant larger ebullioscopic constant freezing point often easier measure precision means measurements using freezing point depression precise

freezingpoint depression solvent nonvolatile solute
consider problem solvent freezes nearly pure crystal regardless presence nonvolatile solute typically occurs simply solute molecules fit well crystal ie substituting solute solvent molecule crystal high enthalpy case low solute concentrations freezing point depression depends solely concentration solute particles individual properties freezing point depression thus called colligative property
explanation freezing point depression simply solvent molecules leave liquid join solid leave behind smaller volume liquid solute particles roam resulting reduced entropy solute particles thus independent properties approximation ceases hold concentration becomes large enough solutesolute interactions become important case freezing point depression depends particular properties solute concentration
