in the context of human society a family (from latin familia) is a group of people affiliated by consanguinity (by recognized birth) affinity (by marriage) or co-residence (as implied by the etymology of the english word family") and/or shared consumption (see nurture kinship) members of the immediate family includes spouses parents brothers sisters sons and/or daughters members of the extended family may include grandparents aunts uncles cousins nephews nieces and/or siblings-in-law
in most societies the family is the principal institution for the socialization of children as the basic unit for raising children anthropologists generally classify most family organization as matrifocal (a mother and her children) conjugal (a husband his wife and children also called the nuclear family) avuncular (for example a grandparent a brother his sister and her children) or extended (parents and children co-reside with other members of one parent's family) sexual relations among the members are regulated by rules concerning incest such as the incest taboo
the word family is used metaphorically to create more inclusive categories such as community nationhood global village and humanism
the field of genealogy aims to trace family lineages through history
family is also an important economic unit studied in family economics
== social reproduction ==
one of the primary functions of the family involves providing a framework for the production and reproduction of persons biologically and/or socially this can occur through the sharing of material substances (such as food) the giving and receiving of care and nurture (nurture kinship) jural rights and obligations and moral and sentimental ties thus one's experience of one's family shifts over time from the perspective of children the family is a family of orientation the family serves to locate children socially and plays a major role in their enculturation and socialization from the point of view of the parent(s) the family is a family of procreation, the goal of which is to produce and enculturate and socialize children however producing children is not the only function of the family in societies with a sexual division of labor marriage and the resulting relationship between two people it is necessary for the formation of an economically productive household
christopher harris notes that the western conception of family is ambiguous and confused with the household as revealed in the different contexts in which the word is used
we have seen that people can refer to their relatives as the family. all the family turned up for the funeral but of course my brother didn't bring his family along - they're much too young. here the reference is to the offspring (as distinct from all the family) the neighbors were very good too the jones came and their two children it was nice the whole family turning up like that. here the usage is more restricted than relatives or his relatives, but includes just both parents and offspring of course the children will be leaving home soon it's always sad to see the family break up like that. here the reference is not only to parents and children but to their co-residence that is to the household.
olivia harris states this confusion is not accidental but indicative of the familial ideology of capitalist western countries that pass social legislation that insists members of a nuclear family should live together and that those not so related should not live together despite the ideological and legal pressures a large percentage of families do not conform to the ideal nuclear family type
== types ==
the diverse data coming from ethnography history law and social statistics establish that the human family is an institution and not a biological fact found on the natural relationship of consanguinity the different types of families occur in a wide variety of settings and their specific functions and meanings depend largely on their relationship to other social institutions although the concept of consanguinity originally referred to relations by blood, cultural anthropologists have argued that one must understand the idea of blood metaphorically and that many societies understand family through other concepts rather than through genetic distance sociologists have a special interest in the function and status of these forms in stratified (especially capitalist) societies however in societies with the presence of extended families their basis is more structured in the reality of actual relatedness rather than on even afinityor anything else entirely herbert gintis economist and evolutionary scholar in his response to the book sex at dawn critiques the idea that human males were unconcerned with parentage which would make us unlike any other species i can think of
according to the work of scholars max weber alan macfarlane steven ozment jack goody and peter laslett the huge transformation that led to modern marriage in western democracies was fueled by the religio-cultural value system provided by elements of judaism early christianity roman catholic canon law and the protestant reformation
much sociological historical and anthropological research dedicates itself to the understanding of this variation and of changes in the family that form over time times have changed it is more acceptable and encouraged for mothers to work and fathers to spend more time at home with the children the way roles are balanced between the parents will help children grow and learn valuable life lessons there is great importance of communication and equality in families in order to avoid role strain.
=== conjugal (nuclear or single) family ===
the term nuclear family is commonly used especially in the united states to refer to conjugal families a conjugal family includes only the husband the wife and unmarried children who are not of age sociologists distinguish between conjugal families (relatively independent of the kindred of the parents and of other families in general) and nuclear families (which maintain relatively close ties with their kindred) however in the 21st century the nuclear family according to the 2010 census is disappearing at a rapid rate are homes with traditional nuclear familiesmom dad and two children. the nuclear family is being replaced by other family structures such as blended parents single parents and domestic partnerships
=== matrifocal family ===
a matrifocal family consists of a mother and her children generally these children are her biological offspring although adoption of children is a practice in nearly every society this kind of family is common where women have the resources to rear their children by themselves or where men are more mobile than women as a definition a family or domestic group is matrifocal when it is centred on a woman and her children in this case the father(s) of these children are intermittently present in the life of the group and occupy a secondary place the children's mother is not necessarily the wife of one of the children's fathers.
=== extended family ===
the term extended family is also common especially in united states this term has two distinct meanings first it serves as a synonym of consanguinal family (consanguine means of the same blood") second in societies dominated by the conjugal family it refers to kindred (an egocentric network of relatives that extends beyond the domestic group) who do not belong to the conjugal family these types refer to ideal or normative structures found in particular societies any society will exhibit some variation in the actual composition and conception of families
== blended family ==
the term blended family or stepfamily describes families with mixed parents one or both parents remarried bringing children of the former family into the new family also in sociology particularly in the works of social psychologist michael lamb traditional family refers to a middleclass family with a bread-winning father and a stay-at-home mother married to each other and raising their biological children, and nontraditional to exceptions from this rule most of the us households are now non-traditional under this definition
in terms of communication patterns in families there are a certain set of beliefs within the family that reflect how its members should communicate and interact these family communication patterns arise from two underlying sets of beliefs one being conversation orientation (the degree to which the importance of communication is valued) and two conformity orientation (the degree to which families should emphasize similarities or differences regarding attitudes beliefs and values)
== monogamous family ==
a monogamous family is based on legal or social monogamy in this case an individual has only one (official) partner during their lifetime or at any one time (i.e serial monogamy) this means that a person may not have several different legal spouses at the same time as this is usually prohibited by bigamy laws in jurisdictions that require monogamous marriages
== polygamous family ==
polygamy is a marriage that includes more than two partners when a man is married to more than one wife at a time the relationship is called polygyny and when a woman is married to more than one husband at a time it is called polyandry if a marriage includes multiple husbands and wives it can be called polyamory group or conjoint marriage
=== polygyny ===
polygyny is a form of plural marriage in which a man is allowed more than one wife  in modern countries that permit polygamy polygyny is typically the only form permitted polygyny is practiced primarily (but not only) in parts of the middle east and africa and is often associated with islam
=== polyandry ===
polyandry is a form of marriage whereby a woman takes two or more husbands at the same time fraternal polyandry where two or more brothers are married to the same wife is a common form of polyandry polyandry was traditionally practiced in areas of the himalayan mountains among tibetans in nepal in parts of china and in parts of northern india polyandry is most common in societies marked by high male mortality or male absenteeism
== kinship terminology ==
=== degrees of kinship ===
a first-degree relative is one who shares 50% of your dna such as a full sibling parent or progeny
=== terminologies ===
in his book systems of consanguinity and affinity of the human family anthropologist lewis henry morgan (18181881) performed the first survey of kinship terminologies in use around the world although much of his work is now considered dated he argued that kinship terminologies reflect different sets of distinctions for example most kinship terminologies distinguish between sexes (the difference between a brother and a sister) and between generations (the difference between a child and a parent) moreover he argued kinship terminologies distinguish between relatives by blood and marriage (although recently some anthropologists have argued that many societies define kinship in terms other than blood")
morgan made a distinction between kinship systems that use classificatory terminology and those that use descriptive terminology classificatory systems are generally and erroneously understood to be those that class together with a single term relatives who actually do not have the same type of relationship to ego (what defines same type of relationship under such definitions seems to be genealogical relationship this is problematic given that any genealogical description no matter how standardized employs words originating in a folk understanding of kinship.) what morgan's terminology actually differentiates are those (classificatory) kinship systems that do not distinguish lineal and collateral relationships and those (descriptive) kinship systems that do morgan a lawyer came to make this distinction in an effort to understand seneca inheritance practices a seneca man's effects were inherited by his sisters children rather than by his own children morgan identified six basic patterns of kinship terminologies
hawaiian only distinguishes relatives based upon sex and generation
sudanese no two relatives share the same term
eskimo in addition to distinguishing relatives based upon sex and generation also distinguishes between lineal relatives and collateral relatives
iroquois in addition to sex and generation also distinguishes between siblings of opposite sexes in the parental generation
crow a matrilineal system with some features of an iroquois system but with a skewing feature in which generation is frozen for some relatives
omaha like a crow system but patrilineal
== roles ==
most western societies employ eskimo kinship terminology this kinship terminology commonly occurs in societies based on conjugal (or nuclear) families where nuclear families have a degree of relative mobility members of the nuclear use descriptive kinship terms
father a male parent
mother a female parent
son a male child of the parent(s)
daughter a female child of the parent(s)
brother a male sibling
sister a female sibling
grandfather the father of a parent
grandmother the mother of a parent
cousins two people who share at least one grandparent in common but neither the same parents
such systems generally assume that the mother's husband is also the biological father in some families a woman may have children with more than one man or a man may have children with more than one woman the system refers to a child who shares only one parent with another child as a half-brother or half-sister for children who do not share biological or adoptive parents in common english-speakers use the term stepbrother or stepsister to refer to their new relationship with each other when one of their biological parents marries one of the other child's biological parents any person (other than the biological parent of a child) who marries the parent of that child becomes the stepparent of the child either the stepmother or stepfather the same terms generally apply to children adopted into a family as to children born into the family in the united states one in five mothers have children by different fathers among mothers with two or more children the figure is higher with 28% having children with at least two different men such families are more common among blacks and hispanics and among the lower socioeconomic class
typically societies with conjugal families also favor neolocal residence thus upon marriage a person separates from the nuclear family of their childhood (family of orientation) and forms a new nuclear family (family of procreation) however in western society the single parent family has been growing more accepted and has begun to make an impact on culture single parent families are more commonly single mother families than single father these families sometimes face difficult issues besides the fact that they have to rear their children on their own for example low income making it difficult to pay for rent child care and other necessities for a healthy and safe home members of the nuclear families of members of one's own (former) nuclear family may class as lineal or as collateral kin who regard them as lineal refer to them in terms that build on the terms used within the nuclear family
grandparent
grandfather a parent's father
grandmother a parent's mother
grandchild
grandson a child's son
granddaughter a child's daughter
for collateral relatives more classificatory terms come into play terms that do not build on the terms used within the nuclear family
uncle father's brother mother's brother father's sister's husband mother's sister's husband
aunt father's sister mother's sister father's brother's wife mother's brother's wife
nephew brother's son sister's son husband's brother's son husband's sister's son wife's brother's son wife's sister's son
niece brother's daughter sister's daughter husband's brother's daughter husband's sister's daughter wife's brother's daughter wife's sister's daughter
when additional generations intervene (in other words when one's collateral relatives belong to the same generation as one's grandparents or grandchildren) the prefixes great- or grand- modifies these terms also as with grandparents and grandchildren as more generations intervene the prefix becomes great-grand-, adding another great- for each additional generation most collateral relatives have never had membership of the nuclear family of the members of one's own nuclear family
cousin the most classificatory term the children of uncles or aunts one can further distinguish cousins by degrees of collaterality and by generation two persons of the same generation who share a grandparent count as first cousins (one degree of collaterality) if they share a great-grandparent they count as second cousins (two degrees of collaterality) and so on if two persons share an ancestor one as a grandchild and the other as a great-grandchild of that individual then the two descendants class as first cousins once removed (removed by one generation) if they shared ancestor figures as the grandparent of one individual and the great-great-grandparent of the other the individuals class as first cousins twice removed (removed by two generations) and so on similarly if they shared ancestor figures as the great-grandparent of one person and the great-great-grandparent of the other the individuals class as second cousins once removed hence one can refer to a third cousin once removed upwards.
cousins of an older generation (in other words one's parents first cousins) although technically first cousins once removed are often classified with aunts and uncles. similarly a person may refer to close friends of one's parents as aunt or uncle, or may refer to close friends as brother or sister, using the practice of fictive kinship english-speakers mark relationships by marriage (except for wife/husband) with the tag -in-law. the mother and father of one's spouse become one's mother-in-law and father-in-law the female spouse of one's child becomes one's daughter-in-law and the male spouse of one's child becomes one's son-in-law the term sister-in-law refers to three essentially different relationships either the wife of one's sibling or the sister of one's spouse or in some uses the wife of one's spouse's sibling brother-in-law expresses a similar ambiguity the terms half-brother and half-sister indicate siblings who share only one biological or adoptive parent
== types of kinship ==
=== patrilineal ===
patrilineality also known as the male line or agnatic kinship is a form of kinship system in which an individual's family membership derives from and is traced through his or her father's lineage it generally involves the inheritance of property rights names or titles by persons related through male kin
a patriline ("father line") is a person's father and additional ancestors as traced only through males one's patriline is thus a record of descent from a man in which the individuals in all intervening generations are male in cultural anthropology a patrilineage is a consanguineal male and female kinship group each of whose members is descended from the common ancestor through male forebears
=== matrilineal ===
matrilineality is a form of kinship system in which an individual's family membership derives from and is traced through his or her mother's lineage it may also correlate with a societal system in which each person is identified with their matriline their mother's lineage and which can involve the inheritance of property and/or titles a matriline is a line of descent from a female ancestor to a descendant in which the individuals in all intervening generations are mothers in other words a mother line in a matrilineal descent system an individual is considered to belong to the same descent group as her or his mother this matrilineal descent pattern is in contrast to the more common pattern of patrilineal descent pattern
=== bilateral descent ===
bilateral descent is a form of kinship system in which an individual's family membership derives from and is traced through both the paternal and maternal sides the relatives on the mother's side and father's side are equally important for emotional ties or for transfer of property or wealth it is a family arrangement where descent and inheritance are passed equally through both parents families who use this system trace descent through both parents simultaneously and recognize multiple ancestors but unlike with cognatic descent it is not used to form descent groups
traditionally this is found among some groups in west africa india australia indonesia melanesia malaysia and polynesia anthropologists believe that a tribal structure based on bilateral descent helps members live in extreme environments because it allows individuals to rely on two sets of families dispersed over a wide area
== history of theories ==
=== social darwinists ===
early scholars of family history applied darwin's biological theory of evolution in their theory of evolution of family systems american anthropologist lewis h morgan published ancient society in 1877 based on his theory of the three stages of human progress from savagery through barbarism to civilization morgan's book was the inspiration for friedrich engels book the origin of the family private property and the state published in 1884
engels expanded morgan's hypothesis that economical factors caused the transformation of primitive community into a class-divided society engels theory of resource control and later that of karl marx was used to explain the cause and effect of change in family structure and function the popularity of this theory was largely unmatched until the 1980s when other sociological theories most notably structural functionalism gained acceptance
=== the nuclear family in industrial society ===
contemporary society generally views the family as a haven from the world supplying absolute fulfillment zinn and eitzen discuss the image of the family as haven [...] a place of intimacy love and trust where individuals may escape the competition of dehumanizing forces in modern society during industrialization [t]he family as a repository of warmth and tenderness (embodied by the mother) stands in opposition to the competitive and aggressive world of commerce (embodied by the father) the family's task was to protect against the outside world. however zinn and eitzen note the protective image of the family has waned in recent years as the ideals of family fulfillment have taken shape today the family is more compensatory than protective it supplies what is vitally needed but missing in other social arrangements.
the popular wisdom according to zinn and eitzen sees the family structures of the past as superior to those today and families as more stable and happier at a time when they did not have to contend with problems such as illegitimate children and divorce they respond to this saying there is no golden age of the family gleaming at us in the far back historical past. desertion by spouses illegitimate children and other conditions that are considered characteristics of modern times existed in the past as well.
=== the postmodern family ===
others argue that whether or not one views the family as declining depends on one's definition of family married couples have dropped below half of all american households this drop is shocking from traditional forms of the family system only a fifth of households were following traditional ways of having married couples raising a family together. in the western world marriages are no longer arranged for economic social or political gain and children are no longer expected to contribute to family income instead people choose mates based on love this increased role of love indicates a societal shift toward favoring emotional fulfilment and relationships within a family and this shift necessarily weakens the institution of the family
margaret mead considers the family as a main safeguard to continuing human progress observing human beings have learned laboriously to be human she adds we hold our present form of humanity on trust [and] it is possible to lose it  it is not without significance that the most successful large-scale abrogations of the family have occurred not among simple savages living close to the subsistence edge but among great nations and strong empires the resources of which were ample the populations huge and the power almost unlimited
many countries (particularly western) have in recent years changed their family laws in order to accommodate diverse family models for instance in the united kingdom in scotland the family law (scotland) act 2006 provides cohabitants with some limited rights in 2010 ireland enacted the civil partnership and certain rights and obligations of cohabitants act 2010 there have also been moves at an international level most notably the council of europe european convention on the legal status of children born out of wedlock which came into force in 1978 countries which ratify it must ensure that children born outside marriage are provided with legal rights as stipulated in the text of this convention the convention was ratified by the uk in 1981 and by ireland in 1988
=== oedipal family model and fascism ===
the model common in the western societies of the family triangle husband-wife-children isolated from the outside is also called the oedipal model of the family and it is a form of patriarchal family many philosophers and psychiatrists have analyzed such a model in such a family they argue the young develop in a perverse relationship wherein they learn to love the same person who beats and oppresses them they believe that young children grow up and develop loving a person who is oppressing them physically or mentally and that these children are not taught in a way that will raise affectionate children such philosophers claim that the family therefore constitutes the first cell of the fascist society as the children will carry this attitude of love for oppressive figures in their adult life they claim that fathers torment their sons deleuze and guattari in their analysis of the dynamics at work within a family track down all varieties of fascism from the enormous ones that surround and crush us to the petty ones that constitute the tyrannical bitterness of our everyday lives
as it has been explained by deleuze guattari and foucault as well as other philosophers and psychiatrists such as laing and reich the patriarchal-family conceived in the west tradition serves the purpose of perpetuating a propertarian and authoritarian society the child grows according to the oedipal model which is typical of the structure of capitalist societies and he becomes in turn owner of submissive children and protector of the woman
as the young undergoes physical and psychological repression from someone for whom they develop love they develop a loving attitude towards authority figures they will bring such attitude in their adult life when they will desire social repression and will form docile subjects for society michel foucault in his systematic study of sexuality argued that rather than being merely repressed the desires of the individual are efficiently mobilized and used to control the individual alter interpersonal relationships and control the masses foucault believed organized religion through moral prohibitions and economic powers through advertising make use of unconscious sex drives dominating desire they dominate individuals according to the analysis of michel foucault in the west
the [conjugal] family organization precisely to the extent that it was insular and heteromorphous with respect to the other power mechanisms was used to support the great maneuvers employed for the malthusian control of the birthrate for the populationist incitements for the medicalization of sex and the psychiatrization of its nongenital forms
== domestic violence ==
domestic violence (dv) is violence that happens within the family the legal and social understanding of the concept of dv differs by culture the definition of the term domestic violence varies depending on the context in which it is used it may be defined differently in medical legal political or social contexts the definitions have varied over time and vary in different parts of the world
the convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence states that
 domestic violence shall mean all acts of physical sexual psychological or economic violence that occur within the family or domestic unit or between former or current spouses or partners whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the victim
in 1993 the united nations declaration on the elimination of violence against women identified domestic violence as one of three contexts in which violence against women occurs describing it as
physical sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family including battering sexual abuse of female children in the household dowry-related violence marital rape female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation

the core element to the harm of elder abuse is the expectation of trust of the older person toward their abuser thus it includes harms by people the older person knows or with whom they have a relationship such as a spouse partner or family member a friend or neighbor or people that the older person relies on for services many forms of elder abuse are recognized as types of domestic violence or family violence
=== forced and child marriage ===
forced and child marriages are practiced in certain regions of the world particularly in asia and africa and these types of marriages are associated with a high rate of domestic violence
a forced marriage is a marriage where one or both participants are married without their freely given consent the line between forced marriage and consensual marriage may become blurred because the social norms of many cultures dictate that one should never oppose the desire of one's parents/relatives in regard to the choice of a spouse in such cultures it is not necessary for violence threats intimidation etc to occur the person simply consents to the marriage even if he/she doesn't want it out of the implied social pressure and duty the customs of bride price and dowry that exist in parts of the world can lead to buying and selling people into marriage

family policies differ significantly between countries depending on jurisdiction family policy may have a multiplicity of functions horizontal redistribution the enhancement of individual choices increasing fertility rates supporting economic growth and productivity as well as reducing gender inequalities (ferragina and seeleib-kaiser 2015) from a societal perspective family policies can contribute to horizontal redistribution between generations as well as between households with and without children to favour individual choices by supporting the reconciliation between care and paid work and to reduce the costs of having children and child poverty from an economic perspective employment-oriented family policy is part of an overall redesign of welfare states geared to foster active citizenship also among mothers who were formerly not employed through the development of an enabling state more generous family policies are said to lead to higher employment rates for women mitigate the risk of unemployment for mothers after a substantial period of leave support a social investment strategy and offset some of the costs of raising children from many feminist perspectives family policies should aim at equalising opportunities between men and women through de-familialising care encouraging men's involvement in care work and facilitating employment opportunities for women profound social economic and cultural changes have led in many societies to the decline of the male breadwinner model and the move towards a variety of adult worker models (daly 2011) nevertheless family policy expansion has not always fundamentally challenged gender inequalities overall men have not increased their contribution to care work sufficiently to compensate for women's increased labour force participation and slightly reduced participation in care
in an era of perceived permanent austerity and overall welfare state retrenchment rich oecd countries have not been prevented from expanding family policies (ferragina and seeleib-kaiser 2015) in fact in many of these countries there has been an expansion of family policies leading to a socialisation of family care responsibilities traditionally disproportionately performed by women (daly and lewis 2000) although at the institutional policy level the expansion of family policy might be characterised as a silent revolution relevant for gender equality a cautious interpretation might be necessary gender inequalities in income opportunities leisure and other significant outcomes remain and are sometimes sustained by policy even if there is an observed shift in their character towards support for women's employment (ferragina and seeleib-kaiser 2015)
the policy shift has been particularly significant in countries that had previously emphasised more conservative approaches to family policies such as germany ireland japan and norway hence it can no longer be assumed that in the majority of rich oecd countries care for young children will be mainly provided through unpaid work within the family nevertheless a certain number of countries still fail to provide adequate childcare arrangements constituting a barrier for full-time maternal employment furthermore in some countries such as the united states and the united kingdom gender discrimination continues to strongly intersect with class high childcare costs constitute a disincentive to labour force participation especially among less educated and unskilled women (esping-andersen 2009) this means that higher-class and more educated women tend to have better opportunities than women belonging to a lower social class
partisanship and women's political agency have been the main drivers for family policy change during the 1980s and 1990s in many countries for the 2000s however the importance of these drivers has significantly declined as societal preferences have undergone profound changes to some extent driven by the activities of women's equality movements as well as by the experience of women's employment the policy preferences of voters have also changed electorates in western democracies increasingly want policies supporting modern family lifestyles which depend on women's employment (ferragina and seeleib-kaiser 2015) as political parties react to these changed policy preferences the traditional differences in family policy positions between political parties decline the extent to which this translates into support for gender equality and how such equality might be defined is as yet not decided however societal policy preferences long believed to be set in stone are undergoing profound changes and public opinion increasingly matters for changing policies the changed policy preferences are also mirrored in new political discourses that prioritise social investment and the preservation of the human capital of women especially of those who are highly skilled the expansion of family policies geared to supporting women's employment and investment in children is very likely to continue in western democracies.(ferragina and seeleib-kaiser 2015)
while in many parts of the world family policies seek to promote a gender-equal organization of the family life in others the male-dominated family continues to be the official policy of the authorities which is also supported by law for instance the civil code of iran states at article 1105 in relations between husband and wife the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband
in some parts of the world some governments promote a specific form of family such as that based on traditional family values the term family values is often used in political discourse in some countries its general meaning being that of traditional or cultural values that pertain to the family's structure function roles beliefs attitudes and ideals usually involving the traditional family - a middle-class family with a breadwinner father and a homemaker mother raising their biological children any deviation from this family model is considered a nontraditional family these family ideals are often advanced through policies such as marriage promotion some jurisdictions outlaw practices which they deem as socially or religiously unacceptable such as fornication cohabitation or adultery

article 8 of the european convention on human rights provides a right to respect for one's private and family life his home and his correspondence subject to certain restrictions that are in accordance with law and necessary in a democratic society
== criticism ==
certain social scientists have advocated the abolition of the family an early opponent of the family was socrates whose position was outlined by plato in the republic in book 5 of the republic socrates tells his interlocutors that a just city is one in which citizens have no family ties
the family being such a deep-rooted and much-venerated institution few intellectuals have ventured to speak against it familialism has been atypically defined as a social structure where a family's values are held in higher esteem than the values of the individual members of the family favoritism granted to relatives regardless of merit is called nepotism
the russian-american rationalist and individualist philosopher novelist and playwright ayn rand compared partiality towards consanguinity with racism as a small-scale manifestation of the latter the worship of the family is merely racism like a crudely primitive first installment on the worship of the tribe it places the accident of birth above a man's values and duty to the tribe above a man's right to his own life additionally she spoke in favor of childfree lifestyle while following it herself
the british social critic poet mountaineer and occultist aleister crowley censured the institution of family in his works horrid word family its very etymology accuses it of servility and stagnation / latin famulus a servant oscan faamat he dwells [t]hink what horrid images it evokes from the mind not only victorian wherever the family has been strong it has always been an engine of tyranny weak members or weak neighbours it is the mob spirit crushing genius or overwhelming opposition by brute arithmetic in every magical or similar system it is invariably the first condition which the aspirant must fulfill he must once and for all and for ever put his family outside his magical circle
the american journalist marty nemko considers family to be overrated politicians clerics and just plain folks extol family as our most important institution / i believe family is overrated so many people suffer inordinately from family / millions of people don't even speak with a family member millions more spend years and fortunes on therapists trying to undo the ills that family perpetrated on them / all this shouldnt be surprising after all unlike with friends we are placed in our family of origin at random with no say in the matter
== the family and social justice ==
one of the controversies regarding the family is the application of the concept of social justice to the private sphere of family relations in particular with regard to the rights of women and children throughout much of the history most philosophers who advocated for social justice focused on the public political arena not on the family structures with the family often being seen as a separate entity which needed to be protected from outside state intrusion one notable exception was john stuart mill who in his work the subjection of women advocated for greater rights for women within marriage and family second wave feminists argued that the personal is political stating that there are strong connections between personal experiences and the larger social and political structures in the context of the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s this was a challenge to the nuclear family and family values as they were understood then feminists focused on domestic violence arguing that the reluctance - in law or in practice - of the state to intervene and offer protection to women who have been abused within the family is in violation of women's human rights and is the result of an ideology which places family relations outside the conceptual framework of human rights
