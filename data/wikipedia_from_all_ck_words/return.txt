sauces in french cuisine date back to the middle ages there were many hundreds of sauces in the culinary repertoire in cuisine classique (roughly from the end of the 19th century until the advent of nouvelle cuisine in the 1980s) sauces were a major defining characteristic of french cuisine
in the early 19th century the chef marie-antoine carme created an extensive list of sauces many of which were original recipes it is unknown how many sauces carme is responsible for but it is estimated to be in the hundreds the cream sauce in its most popular form around the world was concurrently created by another chef dennis leblanc working in the same kitchen as carme he considered the four grandes sauces to be espagnole velout allemande and bchamel from which a large variety of petites sauces could be composed
in the early 20th century the chef auguste escoffier refined carme's list of basic sauces in the four editions of his classic le guide culinaire and its abridged english translation a guide to modern cookery he dropped allemande as he considered it a variation of velout and added hollandaise and sauce tomate defining the five fundamental mother sauces still used today
sauce bchamel milk-based sauce thickened with a white roux
sauce espagnole a fortified brown veal stock sauce thickened with a brown roux
sauce velout light stock-based sauce thickened with a roux or a liaison a mixture of egg yolks and cream
sauce hollandaise an emulsion of egg yolk butter and lemon or vinegar
sauce tomate tomato-based
a sauce which is derived from one of the mother sauces by augmenting with additional ingredients is sometimes called a daughter sauce or secondary sauce. most sauces commonly used in classical cuisine are daughter sauces for example bchamel can be made into mornay by the addition of grated cheese and espagnole becomes bordelaise with the addition of reduction of red wine shallots and poached beef marrow
in the mid-20th century a specialized implement the french sauce spoon was introduced to aid in eating sauce in french cuisine and now enjoys some popularity at high-end restaurants
