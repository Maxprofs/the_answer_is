origin lifeedit
one reasons interest early atmosphere ocean form conditions life first arose many models little consensus life emerged nonliving chemicals chemical systems created laboratory still fall well short minimum complexity living organism
first step emergence life may chemical reactions produced many simpler organic compounds including nucleobases amino acids building blocks life experiment stanley miller harold urey showed molecules could form atmosphere water methane ammonia hydrogen aid sparks mimic effect lightning although atmospheric composition probably different composition used miller urey later experiments realistic compositions also managed synthesize organic molecules recent computer simulations even shown extraterrestrial organic molecules could formed protoplanetary disk formation earth
next stage complexity could reached least three possible starting points selfreplication organisms ability produce offspring similar metabolism ability feed repair external cell membranes allow food enter waste products leave exclude unwanted substances
replication first rna worldedit
even simplest members three modern domains life use dna record recipes complex array rna protein molecules read instructions use growth maintenance selfreplication
discovery kind rna molecule called ribozyme catalyze replication construction proteins led hypothesis earlier lifeforms based entirely rna could formed rna world individuals species mutations horizontal gene transfers would meant offspring generation quite likely different genomes parents started rna would later replaced dna stable therefore build longer genomes expanding range capabilities single organism ribozymes remain main components ribosomes protein factories modern cells
although short selfreplicating rna molecules artificially produced laboratories doubts raised whether natural nonbiological synthesis rna possible earliest ribozymes may formed simpler nucleic acids pna tna gna would replaced later rna prerna replicators posited including crystals even quantum systems
proposed porous metal sulfide precipitates would assist rna synthesis c f oceanbottom pressures near hydrothermal vents hypothesis lipid membranes would last major cell components appear protocells would confined pores
