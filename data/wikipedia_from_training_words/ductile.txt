in materials science ductility is a solid material's ability to deform under tensile stress this is often characterized by the material's ability to be stretched into a wire malleability a similar property is a material's ability to deform under compressive stress this is often characterized by the material's ability to form a thin sheet by hammering or rolling both of these mechanical properties are aspects of plasticity the extent to which a solid material can be plastically deformed without fracture also these material properties are dependent on temperature and pressure (investigated by percy williams bridgman as part of his nobel prizewinning work on high pressures)
ductility and malleability are not always coextensive for instance while gold has high ductility and malleability lead has low ductility but high malleability the word ductility is sometimes used to encompass both types of plasticity
== materials scienceedit ==
ductility is especially important in metalworking as materials that crack break or shatter under stress cannot be manipulated using metal-forming processes such as hammering rolling and drawing malleable materials can be formed cold using stamping or pressing whereas brittle materials may be cast or thermoformed
high degrees of ductility occur due to metallic bonds which are found predominantly in metals and leads to the common perception that metals are ductile in general in metallic bonds valence shell electrons are delocalized and shared between many atoms the delocalized electrons allow metal atoms to slide past one another without being subjected to strong repulsive forces that would cause other materials to shatter
ductility can be quantified by the fracture strain  which is the engineering strain at which a test specimen fractures during a uniaxial tensile test another commonly used measure is the reduction of area at fracture  the ductility of steel varies depending on the alloying constituents increasing levels of carbon decrease ductility many plastics and amorphous solids such as play-doh are also malleable the most ductile metal is platinum and the most malleable metal is gold
== ductilebrittle transition temperatureedit ==
the ductilebrittle transition temperature (dbtt) nil ductility temperature (ndt) or nil ductility transition temperature of a metal is the temperature at which the fracture energy passes below a predetermined value (for steels typically 40 j for a standard charpy impact test) dbtt is important since once a material is cooled below the dbtt it has a much greater tendency to shatter on impact instead of bending or deforming for example zamak 3 exhibits good ductility at room temperature but shatters when impacted at sub-zero temperatures dbtt is a very important consideration in materials selection when the material in question is subject to mechanical stresses a similar phenomenon the glass transition temperature occurs with glasses and polymers although the mechanism is different in these amorphous materials
in some materials this transition is sharper than others for example the transition is generally sharper in materials with a body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice than those with a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice this can be observed in the brittleness of martensitic steel obtained by quenching and used for instance in files (body-centered tetragonal lattice) in comparison with the toughness of austenitic steel obtained by tempering (fcc lattice) dbtt can also be influenced by external factors such as neutron radiation which leads to an increase in internal lattice defects and a corresponding decrease in ductility and increase in dbtt
the most accurate method of measuring the dbtt of a material is by fracture testing typically four point bend testing at a range of temperatures is performed on pre-cracked bars of polished material
for experiments conducted at higher temperatures dislocation activity increases at a certain temperature dislocations shield the crack tip to such an extent the applied deformation rate is not sufficient for the stress intensity at the crack-tip to reach the critical value for fracture (kic) the temperature at which this occurs is the ductilebrittle transition temperature if experiments are performed at a higher strain rate more dislocation shielding is required to prevent brittle fracture and the transition temperature is raised
