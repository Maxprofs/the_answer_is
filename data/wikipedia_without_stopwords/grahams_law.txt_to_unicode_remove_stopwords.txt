grahams law states rate effusion diffusion gas inversely proportional square root molecular weight thus molecular weight one gas four times another would diffuse porous plug escape small pinhole vessel half rate heavier gases diffuse slowly complete theoretical explanation grahams law provided years later kinetic theory gases grahams law provides basis separating isotopes diffusion method came play crucial role development atomic bomb
grahams law accurate molecular effusion involves movement one gas time hole approximate diffusion one gas another air processes involve movement one gas
conditions temperature pressure molar mass proportional mass density therefore rate diffusion different gases inversely proportional square root mass densities
history
grahams research diffusion gases triggered reading observation german chemist johann dbereiner hydrogen gas diffused small crack glass bottle faster surrounding air diffused replace graham measured rate diffusion gases plaster plugs fine tubes small orifices way slowed process could studied quantitatively first stated rate effusion gas inversely proportional square root density later showed rate inversely proportional square root molar mass graham went study diffusion substances solution process made discovery apparent solutions actually suspensions particles large pass parchment filter termed materials colloids term come denote important class finely divided materials
time graham work concept molecular weight established large part measurements gases italian physicist amedeo avogadro suggested equal volumes different gases contain equal numbers molecules thus relative molecular weights two gases equal ratio weights equal volumes gases avogadros insight together studies gas behaviour provided basis later theoretical work scottish physicist james clerk maxwell explain properties gases collections small particles moving largely empty space
perhaps greatest success kinetic theory gases came called discovery gases temperature measured kelvin absolute temperature scale directly proportional average kinetic energy gas molecules kinetic energy object equal onehalf mass times square velocity thus equal kinetic energies velocities two different molecules would inverse proportion square roots masses rate effusion determined number molecules entering aperture per unit time hence average molecular velocity grahams law diffusion could thus understood consequence molecular kinetic energies equal temperature
example
let gas h gas o
therefore hydrogen molecules effuse four times faster oxygen
grahams law also used find approximate molecular weight gas one gas known species specific ratio rates two gases previous example equation solved unknown molecular weight
