upgrading is the process of replacing a product with a newer version of the same product in computing and consumer electronics an upgrade is generally a replacement of hardware software or firmware with a newer or better version in order to bring the system up to date or to improve its characteristics

examples of common hardware upgrades include installing additional memory (ram) adding larger hard disks replacing microprocessor cards or graphics cards and installing new versions of software many other upgrades are possible as well
common software upgrades include changing the version of an operating system of an office suite of an anti-virus program or of various other tools
common firmware upgrades include the updating of the ipod control menus the xbox 360 dashboard or the non-volatile flash memory that contains the embedded operating system for a consumer electronics device
users can often download software and firmware upgrades from the internet often the download is a patchit does not contain the new version of the software in its entirety just the changes that need to be made software patches usually aim to improve functionality or solve problems with security rushed patches can cause more harm than good and are therefore sometimes regarded with skepticism for a short time after release patches are generally free
a software or firmware upgrade can be major or minor and the release version code-number increases accordingly a major upgrade will change the version number whereas a minor update will often append a .01 .02 .03 etc for example version 10.03 might designate the third minor upgrade of version 10 in commercial software the minor upgrades (or updates) are generally free but the major versions must be purchased see also sidegrade
companies usually make software upgrades for the following reasons 1.) to support industry regulatory requirements 2.) to access emerging technologies with new features and tools 3.) to meet the demands of changing markets 4.) to continue to receive comprehensive product support
== risksedit ==
although developers usually produce upgrades in order to improve a product there are risks involvedincluding the possibility that the upgrade will worsen the product
upgrades of hardware involve a risk that new hardware will not be compatible with other pieces of hardware in a system for example an upgrade of ram may not be compatible with existing ram in a computer other hardware components may not be compatible after either an upgrade or downgrade due to the non-availability of compatible drivers for the hardware with a specific operating system conversely there is the same risk of non-compatibility when software is upgraded or downgraded for previously functioning hardware to no longer function
upgrades of software introduce the risk that the new version (or patch) will contain a bug causing the program to malfunction in some way or not to function at all for example in october 2005 a glitch in a software upgrade caused trading on the tokyo stock exchange to shut down for most of the day similar gaffes have occurred from important government systems to freeware on the internet
upgrades can also worsen a product subjectively a user may prefer an older version even if a newer version functions perfectly as designed
a software upgrade can be a downgrade from the point of view of the user for example by removing features for marketing or copyright reasons see otheros
