transpiration is the process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts such as leaves stems and flowers water is necessary for plants but only a small amount of water taken up by the roots is used for growth and metabolism the remaining 99-99.5% is lost by transpiration leaf surfaces are dotted with pores called stomata and in most plants they are more numerous on the undersides of the foliage the stomata are bordered by guard cells and their stomatal accessory cells (together known as stomatal complex) that open and close the pore transpiration occurs through the stomatal apertures and can be thought of as a necessary cost associated with the opening of the stomata to allow the diffusion of carbon dioxide gas from the air for photosynthesis transpiration also cools plants changes osmotic pressure of cells and enables mass flow of mineral nutrients and water from roots to shoots
mass flow of liquid water from the roots to the leaves is driven in part by capillary action but primarily driven by water potential differences in taller plants and trees the force of gravity can only be overcome by the decrease in hydrostatic (water) pressure in the upper parts of the plants due to the diffusion of water out of stomata into the atmosphere water is absorbed at the roots by osmosis and any dissolved mineral nutrients travel with it through the xylem
== regulation ==
plants regulate the rate of transpiration by controlling the size of the stomatal apertures the rate of transpiration is also influenced by the evaporative demand of the atmosphere surrounding the leaf such as boundary layer conductance humidity temperature wind and incident sunlight soil water supply and soil temperature can influence stomatal opening and thus transpiration rate the amount of water lost by a plant also depends on its size and the amount of water absorbed at the roots transpiration accounts for most of the water loss by a plant by the leaves and young stems transpiration serves to evaporatively cool plants as the evaporating water carries away heat energy due to its large latent heat of vaporization of 2260 kj per litre
this table summarizes the factors that has an effect on the rates of transpiration
during a growing season a leaf will transpire many times more water than its own weight an acre of corn gives off about 3,000-4,000 gallons (11,400-15,100 liters) of water each day and a large oak tree can transpire 40,000 gallons (151,000 liters) per year the transpiration ratio is the ratio of the mass of water transpired to the mass of dry matter produced the transpiration ratio of crops tends to fall between 200 and 1000 (i.e. crop plants transpire 200 to 1000 kg of water for every kg of dry matter produced)
transpiration rates of plants can be measured by a number of techniques including potometers lysimeters porometers photosynthesis systems and thermometric sap flow sensors isotope measurements indicate transpiration is the larger component of evapotranspiration recent evidence from a global study of water stable isotopes shows that transpired water is isotopically different from groundwater and streams this suggests that soil water is not as well mixed as widely assumed
desert plants have specially adapted structures such as thick cuticles reduced leaf areas sunken stomata and hairs to reduce transpiration and conserve water many cacti conduct photosynthesis in succulent stems rather than leaves so the surface area of the shoot is very low many desert plants have a special type of photosynthesis termed crassulacean acid metabolism or cam photosynthesis in which the stomata are closed during the day and open at night when transpiration will be lower
