philosophers have tried to establish rules for promises immanuel kant suggested promises should always be kept while some consequentialists argue that promises should be broken whenever doing so would yield benefits in how to make good decisions and be right all the time iain king tried to reconcile these positions suggesting that promises should be kept unless they are worth less to others than a new option is to you, and that this requires a relevant unforeseen and reasonably unforeseeable change in the situation more important than the promise itself arising after the promise is made
as opposed to kant some rossian pluralists believe that morality with regards to right and wrong cannot be formalized in writing in certain circumstances breaking ones promise may be more beneficial than the cost of keeping it these moral principles need guidance and good judgments to maximize the benefits of people involved

promises are compared with threats by verbrugge dieussaert schaeken and william when a threat or promise is conditional it tends to receive biconditional interpretation also both threats and promises are highly controlled by the speaker the fundamental difference is the valence of the prospective action on the speaker's part in the case of a promise it is generally positive while in the case of a threat it is negative promises are often made with an intent on the speaker's part to convince a hearer to do something by holding out the prospect of a reward threats by contrasts are often made with an intent to influence a hearer's behavior by holding out the prospect of a punishment in addition certain characteristics of promises and threats such as magnitude and credibility affect the probability that the target will gain compliance or failure promises can fall under many different categories however they will have two key components the type of activity that the promises undertakes to do and the content of the promise promises can give us both the security that something is being fully guaranteed and the stress that you are guaranteeing something that cannot be verified at that given moment this can create both a positive and a negative effect on our minds
