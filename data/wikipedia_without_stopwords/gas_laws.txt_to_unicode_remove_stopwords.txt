article outlines historical development laws describing ideal gases detailed description ideal gas laws development see ideal gas law
gas laws developed end th century scientists began realize relationships pressure volume temperature sample gas could obtained would hold good approximation gases gases behave similar way wide variety conditions molecules widely spaced equation state ideal gas derived kinetic theory earlier gas laws considered special cases ideal gas equation one variables held constant
boyles law
boyles law published states constant temperature product pressure volume given mass ideal gas closed system always constant verified experimentally using pressure gauge variable volume container also derived kinetic theory gases container fixed number molecules inside reduced volume molecules strike given area sides container per unit time causing greater pressure
mathematical equation boyles law written either
p pressure v volume gas k constant equation proportionality constants equations statement boyle law follows
volume given mass gas inversely related pressure exerted given temperature given number moles
charles law
charles law law volumes found jacques charles states given mass ideal gas constant pressure volume directly proportional absolute temperature assuming closed system
mathematical equation charles law written either
v volume gas absolute temperature k proportionality constant proportionality constants equations article
gaylussacs law
gaylussacs law pressure law found joseph louis gaylussac states given mass constant volume ideal gas pressure exerted sides container directly proportional absolute temperature
mathematical equation gaylussacs law written either
p pressure absolute temperature k another proportionality constant
avogadros law
avogadros law states volume occupied ideal gas directly proportional number molecules gas present container gives rise molar volume gas stp dm litres relation given
n equal number molecules gas number moles gas
combined ideal gas laws
combined gas law general gas equation obtained combining three preceding gas laws shows relationship pressure volume temperature fixed mass quantity gas
also written
addition avogadros law combined gas law develops ideal gas law
p pressure
v volume
n number moles
r universal gas constant
temperature k
proportionality constant named r universal gas constant value atmlmolk equivalent formulation law
p pressure
v volume
n number gas molecules
k boltzmann constant jk si units
absolute temperature
equations exact ideal gas neglects various intermolecular effects see real gas however ideal gas law good approximation gases moderate pressure temperature
law following important consequences
temperature pressure kept constant volume gas directly proportional number molecules gas
temperature volume remain constant pressure gas changes directly proportional number molecules gas present
number gas molecules temperature remain constant pressure inversely proportional volume
temperature changes number gas molecules kept constant either pressure volume change direct proportion temperature
gas laws
grahams law states rate gas molecules diffuse inversely proportional square root density combined avogadros law ie since equal volumes equal number molecules inversely proportional root molecular weight
daltons law partial pressures states pressure mixture gases simply sum partial pressures individual components daltons law follows
ptotal total pressure atmosphere pgas pressure gas mixture atmosphere pho water pressure temperature
henrys law states
constant temperature amount given gas dissolved given type volume liquid directly proportional partial pressure gas equilibrium liquid
