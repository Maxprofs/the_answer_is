a checked tone commonly known by its chinese calque entering tone (simplified chinese  traditional chinese  pinyin rshng literally the tone of character ) is one of four syllable types in the phonology in middle chinese although usually translated as tone a checked tone is not a tone in the phonetic sense but rather a syllable that ends in a stop consonant such as p t k or glottal stop note that separating the checked tone allows us to treat -p -t and -k as allophones of -m -n and -ng respectively because they are in a complementary distribution in which stops appear only in the checked tone while nasals appear only in other tones due to the origin of tone in chinese the number of tones found in such syllables is smaller than the number of tones in other syllables and in chinese phonetics they have traditionally been counted separately for instance in cantonese there are 6 tones in syllables which do not end in stops but only three in syllables which do therefore although cantonese only has 6 tones in the sense of 6 contrasting variations in pitch it is often said to have 9
final voiceless stops and therefore the checked tones have disappeared from most mandarin dialects (spoken in northern and southwestern china) but remain preserved in southeastern branches of chinese such as yue min and hakka
tones are an indispensable part of chinese literature as characters in poetry and prose were chosen according to tones and rhymes for their euphony this use of language helps in reconstructing the pronunciation of old chinese and middle chinese since the chinese writing system is logographic rather than phonetic
== phoneticsedit ==
from a phonetic perspective the entering tone is simply a syllable ending with a voiceless stop that has no audible release [p ] [t ] or [k ] in some variants of chinese the final stop has become a glottal stop [ ]
== historyedit ==
the voiceless stops that typify the entering tone date back to the proto-sino-tibetan the parent language of chinese as well as the tibeto-burman languages in addition it is commonly thought that old chinese had syllables ending in clusters /ps/ /ts/ and /ks/ (sometimes called the long entering tone while syllables ending in /p/ /t/ and /k/ are the short entering tone") these clusters later reduced to /s/ in turn this became /h/ and ultimately tone 3 in middle chinese (the departing tone")
the first chinese philologists began to describe the phonology of chinese during the early middle chinese period (specifically during the northern and southern dynasties between 400 to 600) under the influence of buddhism and the sanskrit language that arrived along with it there were several unsuccessful attempts to classify the tones of chinese before the establishment of the traditional four-tone description between 483 and 493 it is based on the vedic theory of three intonations () the middle intonation udtta maps to the level tone () the upwards intonation svarita to the rising tone () the downward intonation anudtta to the departing tone () the distinctive sound of syllables ending with a stop did not fit the three intonations and was categorised as the entering tone () the use of four-tone system flourished in the sui and tang dynasties (7th10th centuries) an important rime dictionary qieyun was written in this period
note that modern linguistic descriptions of middle chinese often refer to the level rising and departing tones as tones 1 2 and 3 respectively
by the time of the mongol invasion (the yuan dynasty 12791368) former final stops had been reduced to a glottal stop // it is sometimes thought that the influence of these invading nomads caused this final glottal stop to be lost leading to the loss of entering tone syllables the zhongyuan yinyun a rime book of 1324 already shows signs of the disappearance of the glottal stop and the emergence of the modern mandarin tone system in its place the precise time at which the loss occurred is unknown though it was likely gone by the time of the qing dynasty

== entering tone in chineseedit ==
=== mandarinedit ===
the entering tone is extant in jianghuai mandarin and the minjiang dialect of sichuanese in other dialects the entering tone has been lost and words that had the tone have been distributed into the four modern tonal categories depending on the initial consonant of each word
note that in the beijing dialect that underlies standard mandarin syllables beginning with originally unvoiced consonants are redistributed across the four tones in a completely random pattern for example the three characters  all pronounced /tsjek/ in middle chinese (william baxter's reconstruction) are now pronounced j j j with tones 1 3 4 respectively the two characters  both pronounced /kat/ are now pronounced g (tone 1) and g/g (tone 2/3) respectively with character splitting on semantic grounds (tone 3 when used as a component of a name mostly tone 2 otherwise)
similarly the three characters (middle chinese /kak/) are now pronounced g g g with tones 1 2 4 the four characters (middle chinese /kop/) are now pronounced g g g g with tones 1 2 2 3 in these cases the two sets of characters are significant in that each member of the same set has the same phonetic component suggesting that the phonetic component of a character has little to do with the tone class that the character is assigned to
in other situations however the opposite appears to be the case for example the group / of six homophones all /pjuwk/ in middle chinese and divided into a group of four with one phonetic and a group of two with a different phonetic splits so that the first group of four is all pronounced f (tone 2) and the second group of two is pronounced f (tone 4) in situations like this it may be that only one of the characters in each group normally occurs in speech with an identifiable tone and as a result a reading pronunciation of the other characters was constructed based on the phonetic element of the character
the chart below summarizes the distribution in the different dialects
=== cantoneseedit ===
like most other variants of chinese cantonese has changed initial voiced stops affricates and fricatives of middle chinese to their voiceless counterparts to compensate for the loss of this difference cantonese has split each of the middle chinese tones into two one for middle chinese voiced initial consonants (yang) and one for middle chinese voiceless initial consonants (yin) in addition cantonese has split the yin-entering tone into two with a higher tone for short vowels and a lower tone for long vowels as a result cantonese now has three entering tones
upper (short yin )
middle (long yin ) derived from the upper tone
lower (yang )
the entering tone in cantonese has retained its short and sharp character
=== hakkaedit ===
hakka preserves all of the entering tones of middle chinese and it is split into two registers the meixian hakka dialect often taken as the paradigm gives the following
dark entering () [ ] a low-pitched checked tone
light entering () [ ] a high-pitched checked tone
middle chinese entering tone syllables ending in [k] whose vowel clusters have become front high vowels like [i] and [] shifts to syllables with [t] finals in some of the modern hakka as seen in the following table
=== minedit ===
southern min (minnan including taiwanese) has two entering tones
upper (yin ) also numbered tone 4
lower (yang ) tone 8
a word may switch from one of these tones to the other due to tone sandhi words with entering tones end with either a glottal stop ([-h]) [-p] [-t] or [-k] (all unaspirated) there are many words that have different finals in their literary and colloquial forms
== entering tone in sino-xenicedit ==
many chinese words were borrowed into japanese korean and vietnamese during the middle chinese period so these languages preserve the entering tone to varying degrees
=== japaneseedit ===
because japanese does not allow a syllable to end with a consonant the endings -k -p -t were rendered as separate syllables -ku or -ki -pu and -ti (-chi) or -tu (-tsu) respectively later phonological changes further altered some of the endings
in some cases where the ending is immediately followed by an unvoiced consonant in a compound the ending is lost and the consonant becomes geminate
examples gaku + kau (> modern japanese k) becomes gakk (school) and shitsu + hai becomes shippai (failure)
the -pu ending changes into -u (pu>fu>hu>u) this process can be followed by -au -> - and -iu -> -y
example jipu (ten) becomes j
it is possible to recover the original ending by examining the historical kana used in spelling a word
=== koreanedit ===
korean keeps the -k and -p endings while the -t ending has changed into -l
=== vietnameseedit ===
vietnamese preserves all of the endings /p/ /t/ and /k/ (spelt -c) additionally after the vowels or i the ending -c changes to -ch giving rise to -ich and -ch in addition ach (pronounced like aik) also occurs for some words of -k ending
== reconstruction of entering tones from languages that lack itedit ==
although it is hard to distinguish words of entering tone origin based on mandarin pronunciation only it is possible to do so to an extent with the help of the phonetic component of each chinese character although this is not completely accurate it is a quick way to identify characters of the entering tone
if a character has a phonetic component and is known to have an entering tone other characters that have that phonetic component probably have an entering tone for example if one already knows that (white) is of the entering tone then one can conjecture that (beat) (fir) (white cloth) (urgent) are also of entering tone
characters that begin with voiceless unaspirated obstruents and have a light level tone () in mandarin almost always have an entering tone
