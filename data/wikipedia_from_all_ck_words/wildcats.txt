wildcats sometimes rendered wildcats or wildc.a.t.s is a fictional superhero team created by the american comic book artist jim lee and writer brandon choi
== publication historyedit ==
the team first appeared in 1992 in the first issue of their eponymous comic book wildc.a.t.s covert action teams published by image comics it was image founding partner jim lee's first work published by the newly launched company and his first creator owned project the wildcats were the starting point for lee's menagerie of interconnected superhero creations which became the foundation of the wildstorm universe the wildcats comics launched at the apex of a speculator-fuelled comics sales boom was wildly popular at its inception with wholesale sales to comic book stores above one million copies for early issues this first series ran for 50 issues and in addition to lee featured work by comics creators such as travis charest chris claremont james robinson and alan moore this popularity saw the property expand into other media with an animated adaptation of the comic debuting on cbs in 1994 and a toyline from playmates toys
in 1998 ownership of the wildcats concepts and characters were sold to dc comics a subsidiary of time warner as part of dc's acquisition of lee's company wildstorm productions a new incarnation of the team was soon launched under the simplified title wildcats focusing on the former members of the now-disbanded team and emphasizing a grittier tone during its 28-issue run the third series wildcats version 3.0 revolved around the halo corporation its ceo jack marlowe (an amalgamation of original team members spartan & void) grifter and a gallery of new characters subverting corporation politics to their cause of creating a better world this incarnation lasted 24 issues and was followed by a nine-issue limited series titled wildcats nemesis which returned to a more superheroic style reminiscent of the first series in late 2006 a fourth ongoing series was launched as a part of the worldstorm publishing initiative the series saw the return of jim lee as regular penciller for the first time since its first volume while grant morrison took over writing duties only one issue was ever published with future issues placed on hold in mid-2008 a fifth volume of wildcats was launched tying into the world's end crossover event
=== wildc.a.t.s volume 1edit ===
launched as an original image comic book title by popular x-men penciler jim lee and his friend writer brandon choi the comic book's premise revolved around the centuries long war between aliens called kherubim and daemonites kherubims a nearly immortal human-looking alien race with exceptional powers and skills traveled to earth and by breeding with humans populated the planet with half-breeds daemonites besides having a fearsome appearance also possessed various superhuman abilities including body possession and mental control over human beings the initial arc brought voodoo over to the team as the readers point of view character as helspont a daemonite warlord had taken control over vice president of the united states dan quayle rob liefeld's youngblood co-starred in the closing chapters of the arc
wildc.a.t.s story continued in a three-part mini-series penciled by jae lee that introduced the daemonite lord hightower jim lee and marc silvestri proceeded to publish a killer instinct crossover detailing warblade's connection to marc silvestri's cyberforce
jim lee devoted his time to coming up with the new concepts of gen13 deathblow and stormwatch before he left the book he did the four-issue gathering of eagles storyline written by his uncanny x-men writer chris claremont it featured a new villain in tapestry and added the characters of mister majestic savant and soldier and featured claremont's creator owned character huntsman
almost all of the characters were spun off into their own mini-series with zealot featured in a 3 part ron marz written story spartan having his kurt busiek written mini-series warblade sharing another with cyberforce's ripclaw grifter co-starred in a mini with stormwatch's backlash that led to the latter's ongoing title as well as another with youngblood's badrock billy tucci's shi and even dark horse's the mask
james robinson wrote a handful of issues and also participated in the wildcats first annual as well as a team one stormwatch/wildc.a.t.s mini-series detailing the past of the wildstorm universe the title also participated in the wildc.a.t.s-oriented wildstorm rising crossover that saw the heroes try to gain control of the daemonite battleship which turned out to be the kheran ship instead with wildc.a.t.s eventually leaving for khera following a grifter oneshot the crossover gave birth to a short-lived steven seagle written grifter series that centered on his super spy/superhero adventures while linking to an obscure team one character regiment at one point
alan moore attempted to give the series depth and cohesion by following up on the initial premise of the daemonite and kherubim war after grifter resigned the c.a.t.s had the opportunity to venture to khera where they found what appeared to be paradise the kherubims had won the daemonite-kherubim war and were living in prosperity appearances were deceiving however and it was apparent the planet was run by power-hungry politicians who had ruthlessly subjugated the daemonites as second-class citizens voodoo with her daemonite blood experienced this firsthand maul's race was also treated unjustly and though emp warblade and zealot were seduced by promises of power and recognition spartan discovered the truth about khera's corrupt leaders it took the death of one of maul's race for the wildc.a.t.s to leave and head back for earth disillusioned by the outcome of the war offworld and their selfishness the team fell apart voodoo left and emp fell into depression the original team returned to earth in pieces and despite having new members they were defeated by the cunning traitor tao who had manipulated them at each turn alan moore also participated in fire from heaven a huge continuity-heavy crossover that resolved plotlines regarding team one team 7 and kaizen gamorra
alan moore spun voodoo off in a four-issue mini-series that had almost no connection to wildc.a.t.s mythos instead dealing with voodoo magic alan moore also wrote a time-traveling wildc.a.t.s/spawn crossover mini-series
at the time grifter had another turn at an ongoing series this time written by steven grant with a much more gritty take on the character while zealot was featured in a backlash spinoff wildcore
a two part arc was set in place before the book's co-creator brandon choi returned setting up the short lasting savant garde spin-off choi initiated a storyline with an organization called puritans as the main villains the puritans goal was to eradicate the kherubim and daemonites on earth the c.a.t.s included grifter condition red and new members mythos (a kherubim lord) olympia (a coda-trained daemonite) and sister eve (the daughter of emp's brother lord entropy) the team traveled in time and had various adventures through different time periods
=== wildcats volume 2edit ===
after the first series cancellation wildstorm now an imprint of dc comics resurrected the wildcats under a whole different premise - wildcats dealt with the lives of the original members after the team's breakup following a botched mission during which team member zealot apparently died scott lobdell provided the writing for the initial seven issues as well as a mosaic oneshot detailing the change in lord emp with travis charest penciling most of them new villains like kenyan and cc rendozo were featured as antagonists but it was all dropped very quickly with charest leaving the monthly comic format to work on a french metabarons graphic novel called dreamshifters and lobdell exiting a couple of issues later
as joe casey and sean phillips took over wildcats they quickly dealt away with kenyan while void and emp ended up having spartan absorb their assets and powers thus the book began a long spell featuring him aided by ladytron and grifter with maul and voodoo guest-starring and as well as new characters noir agents wax and mohr of the national park service warblade was featured very briefly last time in the wildcats 2000 annual that brought back the dead version condition red killing olympia casey and phillips signaled the new wildstorm - critically acclaimed but low on readers radar the heroes fought samuel slaughterhouse smith (a superhuman serial killer whose grandfather had appeared in team one wildc.a.t.s) after which eventually zealot returned casey also wrote the ladytron oneshot a farsic rendition of her past as well as a mister majestic ongoing series which ran for nine issues
wild times wildcats and wild times grifter were published as oneshots as a part of the crossover series wild times that spotlighted the characters in elseworlds-like alternate reality scenarios that blended genres wildcats also participated in the wildc.a.t.s/aliens crossover written by stormwatch's warren ellis that served as a coda to that series and a prequel to his authority run having very little to do with the wildcats themselves
=== wildcats volume 3edit ===
the third series wildcats version 3.0 was a part of the mature readers eye of the storm imprint dealing with spartan's (now jack marlowe) agenda to better the world by proliferating advanced technology and power sources throughout the world via the halo corporation grifter was his troubleshooter and agent wax was one of his first associates the stories added a motley group to this proactive organisation including the power broker c.c rendozzo and her organization agent orange and grifter's unlikely pupil edwin dolby one of halo's accountants the series ended with a thunderous finale where zealot destroyed the coda chapter she created on earth the whole series was written by joe casey and most of it was illustrated by dustin nguyen
concurrent with wildcats version 3.0 wildstorm also published a critically acclaimed noir-superhero series sleeper starring alan moore's wildcats villain tao several wildcats and other related characters spartan played a role in the coup d'tat crossover centering on the authority taking over as rulers of the wildstorm universe's united states
after guest-starring in superman books in 2004 dc published a mr majestic mini-series to test waters for an ongoing series that ran for seventeen issues
wildcats starred in a limited series by robbie morrison and talent caldwell entitled wildcats nemesis focusing on zealot majestic and the coda continuity while heavily spotlighting the new wildstorm universe anti-hero character of charis lady nemesis
at the same time wildstorm published the captain atom armageddon maxi-series heavily featuring the wildcats as they tried to help dc character captain atom return to his universe and stop him from accidentally destroying their reality nikola a female medic became the new void with captain atom sharing a part of the power that eventually remade the wildstorm universe altogether
=== wildcats volume 4edit ===
in 2006 as part of the worldstorm line-wide event the title was restarted written by grant morrison and drawn by jim lee the team consisted of spartan mr majestic zealot grifter voodoo savant and ladytron warblade is on a secret mission and maul has retired to his civilian identity kaizen gamorra returned as villain aided by the wildcats first enemy helspont however the title was permanently put on hold after only one issue
=== wildcats volume 5edit ===
in july 2008 wildstorm debuted a new ongoing wildcats series written by christos gage and pencilled by neil googe following on from the imprint's number of the beast mini-series adam beechen took over writing duties from gage in late 2009 with he and artist tim seeley starting with issue #19 until the book's cancellation in december 2010 with #30

=== original teamedit ===
the original wildc.a.t.s (covert action team) consisted of
spartan originally intended to be a highly sophisticated cyborg who could die and easily be downloaded to another body spartan's character has been revised several times it was discovered that he was designed after the hadrian-series of cyborgs from the kherubim's homeworld and there were plenty of similar androids like him spartan had human emotions towards voodoo spartan's history grew even more complicated when alan moore explained that he was an incarnation of a long-dead hero john colt a.k.a the kherubim lord yohn kohl later still he absorbed the powers of void making him one of the most powerful beings in the wildstorm universe he later turned away from the role of superhero trying to improve the world as jack marlowe ceo of the halo corporation by introducing highly advanced alien technology into human society
zealot (lady zannah) a kherubim and a coda warrior zealot is the former majestrix of the coda and helped develop their virtues and practices she has lived for thousands of years and has had many relationships with both humans and aliens alike after failing to follow her own rules under the coda she left their clan and they have hunted her since she was part of team one under the name of lucy blaze zealot has a close friendship with grifter though she is equally devoted to her sister savant who is secretly her real daughter winter from stormwatch is possibly zealot's son zealot left the wildcats and for a limited amount of time she joined dept psi and co-led wildcore with backlash a half kherubim and former member team 7 in later years zealot turned upon her former allies in the coda claiming that by becoming mere assassins they have betrayed their purpose since then she has almost wiped out the coda single-handed
voodoo (priscilla kitaen) a telepathic human-kherubim hybrid with daemonite ancestry voodoo has the ability to see daemonites who have possessed humans and separate them from the bodies the daemonites possessed voodoo was an exotic dancer before being rescued by the wildc.a.ts from the daemonites she was later trained by zealot in combat and developed an attraction towards spartan her daemonite ancestry was not revealed until she lapsed into a coma after being shot void entered her mind through a computer and it was revealed that one of her ancestors a kherubim was possessed by a daemonite disappointed by her life as a superhero she left the wildcats and studied voodoo magic after she left the wildcats voodoo was attacked by a serial killer named samuel smith a fight which cost her both her legs an elderly daemonite appeared to her and taught her to use her hidden powers of regeneration and time manipulation she managed to regrow her legs and started a relationship with her former teammate maul
grifter (cole cash) a former government operative and member of team 7 he is the only male ever trained by the coda grifter represented the loner of the group though he seemed devoted to his partner zealot he was the only member of the original team not to use any active post-human powers (even though he had them due to being gen-active following team 7's disbanding) his disagreements with jacob marlowe and the arrival of a second group of wildc.a.t.s led to his resignation and ill-fated solo comic book series he returned to the wildcats after the death of his brother max only to leave the team again after zealot's apparent death emp managed to convince him to rejoin the team to battle the threat of kenyan after kenyan's death cole started working for jack marlowe this job cost him the use of his legs landing him in a wheelchair for a long time even forcing him to use ladytron's robotic body as a remote-controlled stand-in later grifter's latent powers healed his broken legs
maul (jeremy stone) a human-titanthrope hybrid capable of increasing his size and mass at the cost of his reasoning capability maul experiences powerful rage and is actually a nobel-prize-winning scientist named dr jeremy stone in the second series by which time voodoo has become his roommate of three months he was shown to have become more devoted to science and reluctant to use his superhuman abilities he discovered he could increase his intelligence by decreasing his body mass but this proved to be physically depleting
warblade (reno bryce) a human-shaper hybrid capable of transforming parts of his body into any solid weapon warblade is an accomplished martial artist although a virtual killing machine reno also has the soul of an artist having his sculpted work displayed in major art galleries during moore's run a kheran lord trained him in the use of his powers in the second series he killed the mercenary pike for killing his girlfriend and retired as a superhero he still keeps in touch with grifter
void (adrianna tereshkova) she has the ability to see the future and teleport herself and others to anywhere on earth due to her absorption of an orb of power over time void grew more and more distant from humanity and the part of her spirit that was adrianna moved on to the afterlife the void entity existed without any host for a short time before the actions of the traitor noir endangered its existence and spartan temporarily became its new host before it bonded with paramedic nikola hanssen
lord emp (jacob marlowe) a multi-millionaire who owns the media/technology conglomerate the halo corporation although he was once a kherubim warlord emp does not remember his past and has no control over the powers he once wielded it was the woman named void who took him from his life as a homeless man and made him into the wealthy financier of the wildc.a.ts it was revealed he has assumed other rich personas in the past including that of industrialist saul baxter during most of the 20th century in the second series emp had taken a more alien appearance in preparation for his ascension a process which ultimately cost him his physical body but freed his spirit gone from the physical plane of existence he left all his possessions to spartan
=== savant's teamedit ===
a second team was introduced later in the series they were formed after the original team rumored to be dead had left for khera the kherubim homeworld this unlikely group broke from the wildc.a.t.s usual anti-daemonite agenda and conducted a proactive war on criminals this alienated them from many other characters in the wildstorm universe
mister majestic (lord majestros) another kherubim warlord who is one of four that had been stuck on earth mr majestic is a superman homage with similar powers and physical characteristics though he also is a genius inventor and a highly skilled martial artist (focused mostly on swordplay) he recently crossed over into the superman comics replacing the man of steel for a brief time though he later returned and recently met captain atom following his return from the dc universe majestic starred in his second ongoing solo-series
savant (kenesha) the daughter of lord majestros and zealot (a fact which was until recently only known to zealot) savant thinks she is zealot's sister she is an adventurer possessing many artifacts of mystic power and advanced technologies including boots that can teleport the person who wears it and a piece of void's orb savant has shown superhuman strength virtual immortality and has genius-level intellect but can also be irresponsible and brash she was the leading character of the short-lived savant garde series
condition red (max cash also known as max profitt) the younger brother of grifter with excellent fighting and marksmanship abilities max was gunned down by a coda assassin in issue #49 of the first series and died in the final issue he was resurrected as a zombie for one annual in the second series
t.a.o. an artificially produced human being with peculiar thinking abilities that enables him to be inhumanly persuasive and incredibly intuitive he was eventually revealed to have been manipulating the team to self-destruction the revelation of which caused him to seemingly be killed by majestic eventually it was revealed that he had foreseen this and had a shapeshifted prisoner take the hit he later re-appeared having founded a worldwide criminal organization that aimed to destabilize human global governments public institutions and age-old secret societies that controlled many aspects of the wildstorm universe t.a.o.'s story after he left the wildc.a.t.s were told in the series point blank and sleeper
ladytron (maxine manchester) a cyborg punk with homicidal tendencies she was captured by the wildcats and through t.a.o.'s reprogramming convinced to join the team she admired the cybernetic mercenary overtkill and was romantically interested in max cash though her interest was not returned when t.a.o was revealed as a traitor he disabled her robotic body and ladytron was taken to the church of gort she became a nun for this new age cult devoted to robotics but had a falling out with its members because she still contained organic bodyparts she ended up with the wildcats again but was wounded again this time by the serial killer samuel smith the damage was so extensive that ladytron was shut down a short stint as noir's reprogrammed pawn later ladytron's mind was downloaded into the halo mainframe and her body was used by the wheelchair-bound grifter as a remote-controlled stand-in
