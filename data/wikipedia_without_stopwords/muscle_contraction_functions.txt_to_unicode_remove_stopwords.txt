extraaural unrelated hearing bioeffects various internal organs central nervous system included auditory shifts vibrotactile sensitivity change muscle contraction cardiovascular function change central nervous system effects vestibular inner ear effects chest walllung tissue effects researchers found low frequency sonar exposure could result significant cavitations hypothermia tissue shearing follow experiments recommended tests performed mice show threshold lung liver damage occurs db damage increases rapidly intensity increased american institute ultrasound medicine aiumhas stated proven biological effects associated unfocused sound beam intensities mwcm spta focused sound beams intensity level mwcm spta
noiseinduced neurologic disturbances scuba divers exposed continuous low frequency tones durations longer minutes involved cases development immediate longterm problems affecting brain tissue symptoms resembled individuals suffered minor head injuries one theory causal mechanism prolonged sound exposure resulted enough mechanical strain brain tissue induce encephalopathy divers aquatic mammals may also suffer lung sinus injuries high intensity low frequency sound due ease low frequency sound passes water body pockets gas body reflect sound due mismatched acoustic impedance
