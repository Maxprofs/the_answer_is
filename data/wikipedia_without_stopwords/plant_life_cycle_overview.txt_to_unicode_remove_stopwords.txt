plant pathogens
fungi
majority phytopathogenic fungi belong ascomycetes basidiomycetes
fungi reproduce sexually asexually via production spores structures spores may spread long distances air water may soil borne many soil inhabiting fungi capable living saprotrophically carrying part life cycle soil known facultative saprotrophs
fungal diseases may controlled use fungicides agriculture practices however new races fungi often evolve resistant various fungicides
biotrophic fungal pathogens colonize living plant tissue obtain nutrients living host cells necrotrophic fungal pathogens infect kill host tissue extract nutrients dead host cells see powdery mildew rice blast images
significant fungal plant pathogens include
ascomycetes
fusarium spp causal agents fusarium wilt disease
thielaviopsis spp causal agents canker rot black root rot thielaviopsis root rot
verticillium spp
magnaporthe grisea causal agent rice blast
sclerotinia sclerotiorum causal agent cottony rot
basidiomycetes
ustilago spp causal agents smut
rhizoctonia spp
phakospora pachyrhizi causal agent soybean rust
puccinia spp causal agents severe rusts virtually cereal grains cultivated grasses
armillaria spp socalled honey fungus species virulent pathogens trees produce edible mushrooms
funguslike organisms
oomycetes
oomycetes true fungi funguslike organisms include destructive plant pathogens including genus phytophthora includes causal agents potato late blight sudden oak death particular species oomycetes responsible root rot
despite closely related fungi oomycetes developed similar infection strategies oomycetes capable using effector proteins turn plants defenses infection process plant pathologists commonly group fungal pathogens
significant oomycete plant pathogens
pythium spp
phytophthora spp including causal agent great irish famine
phytomyxea
slime molds phytomyxea cause important diseases includind club root cabbage relatives powdery scab potatoes caused species plasmodiophora spongospora respectively
bacteria
bacteria associated plants actually saprotrophic harm plant however small number around known species able cause disease bacterial diseases much prevalent subtropical tropical regions world
plant pathogenic bacteria rodshaped bacilli order able colonize plant specific pathogenicity factors five main types bacterial pathogenicity factors known uses cell walldegrading enzymes toxins effector proteins phytohormones exopolysaccharides
pathogens erwinia use cell walldegrading enzymes cause soft rot agrobacterium changes level auxins cause tumours phytohormones exopolysaccharides produced bacteria block xylem vessels often leading death plant
bacteria control production pathogenicity factors via quorum sensing
significant bacterial plant pathogens
burkholderia
proteobacteria
xanthomonas spp
pseudomonas spp
pseudomonas syringae pv tomato causes tomato plants produce less fruit continues adapt tomato minimizing recognition tomato immune system
phytoplasmas mycoplasmalike organisms spiroplasmas
phytoplasma spiroplasma genre bacteria lack cell walls related mycoplasmas human pathogens together referred mollicutes also tend smaller genomes bacteria normally transmitted sapsucking insects transferred plants phloem reproduces
viruses viroids viruslike organisms
many types plant virus even asymptomatic normal circumstances plant viruses cause loss crop yield therefore economically viable try control exception infect perennial species fruit trees
plant viruses small singlestranded rna genomes however plant viruses also double stranded rna single double stranded dna genomes genomes may encode three four proteins replicase coat protein movement protein order allow cell cell movement plasmodesmata sometimes protein allows transmission vector plant viruses several proteins employ many different molecular translation methods
plant viruses generally transmitted plant plant vector mechanical seed transmission also occur vector transmission often insect example aphids fungi nematodes protozoa shown viral vectors many cases insect virus specific virus transmission beet leafhopper transmits curly top virus causing disease several crop plants
nematodes
nematodes small multicellular wormlike animals many live freely soil species parasitize plant roots problem tropical subtropical regions world may infect crops potato cyst nematodes globodera pallida g rostochiensis widely distributed europe north south america cause million worth damage europe every year root knot nematodes quite large host range whereas cyst nematodes tend able infect species nematodes able cause radical changes root cells order facilitate lifestyle
protozoa algae
examples plant diseases caused protozoa eg phytomonas kinetoplastid transmitted zoospores durable may able survive resting state soil many years also shown transmit plant viruses
motile zoospores come contact root hair produce plasmodium invade roots
colourless parasitic algae eg cephaleuros also cause plant diseases
parasitic plants
parasitic plants mistletoe dodder included study phytopathology dodder example used conduit either transmission viruses viruslike agents host plant plant typically host agent grafttransmissible
common pathogenic infection methods
cell walldegrading enzymes used break plant cell wall order release nutrients inside
toxins nonhostspecific damage plants hostspecific cause damage host plant
effector proteins secreted extracellular environment directly host cell often via type three secretion system effectors known suppress host defense processes include reducing plants internal signaling mechanisms reduction phytochemicals production bacteria fungus oomycetes known function
physiological plant disorders
significant abiotic disorders caused
natural
drought
frost damage breakage snow hail
flooding poor drainage
nutrient deficiency
salt deposition soluble mineral excesses eg gypsum
wind windburn breakage hurricanes tornadoes
lightning wildfire also often manmade
manmade arguably abiotic usually regarded
soil compaction
pollution air soil
salt winter road salt application irrigation
herbicide overapplication
poor education training people working plants eg lawnmower damage trees
vandalism
epidemiology
disease resistance
management
quarantine
wherein diseased patch vegetation individual plants isolated healthy growth specimens may destroyed relocated greenhouse treatmentstudy another option avoid introduction harmful nonnative organisms controlling human traffic activity eg aqis although legislation enforcement key order ensure lasting effectiveness
cultural
farming societies kept small scale tended peoples whose culture includes farming traditions going back ancient times example traditions would lifelong training techniques plot terracing weather anticipation response fertilization grafting seed care dedicated gardening plants intently monitored often benefit active external protection also greater overall vigor primitive sense laborintensive solution far practical necessary adequate
plant resistance
sophisticated agricultural developments allow growers choose among systematically crossbred species ensure greatest hardiness crops suited particular regions pathological profile breeding practices perfected centuries advent genetic manipulation even finer control crops immunity traits possible engineering foodplants may less rewarding however higher output frequently offset popular suspicion negative opinion tampering nature
chemical
see pesticide application many natural synthetic compounds could employed combat threats exist method works directly eliminating diseasecausing organisms curbing spread however shown broad effect typically good local ecosystem economic standpoint simplest natural additives may disqualify product organic status potentially reducing value yield
biological
crop rotation may effective means prevent parasitic population becoming wellestablished organism affecting leaves would starved leafy crop replaced tuberous type etc means undermine parasites without attacking directly may exist
integrated
use two methods combination offers higher chance effectiveness
