bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water usually by baking throughout recorded history it has been popular around the world and is one of the oldest artificial foods having been of importance since the dawn of agriculture
there are many combinations and proportions of types of flour and other ingredients and also of different traditional recipes and modes of preparation of bread as a result there are wide varieties of types shapes sizes and textures of breads in various regions bread may be leavened by many different processes ranging from the use of naturally occurring microbes (for example in sourdough recipes) to high-pressure artificial aeration methods during preparation or baking however some products are left unleavened either for preference or for traditional or religious reasons many non-cereal ingredients may be included ranging from fruits and nuts to various fats commercial bread in particular commonly contains additives some of them non-nutritional to improve flavor texture color shelf life or ease of manufacturing
depending on local custom and convenience bread may be served in various forms at any meal of the day it also is eaten as a snack or used as an ingredient in other culinary preparations such as fried items coated in crumbs to prevent sticking or the bland main component of a bread pudding or stuffings designed to fill cavities or retain juices that otherwise might drip away
partly because of its importance as a basic foodstuff bread has a social and emotional significance beyond its importance in nutrition it plays essential roles in religious rituals and secular culture its prominence in daily life is reflected in language where it appears in proverbs colloquial expressions ("he stole the bread from my mouth") in prayer ("give us this day our daily bread") and even in the etymology of words such as companion and company (literally those who eat/share bread with you)
== etymologyedit ==
the word itself old english bread is most common in various forms to many germanic languages such as frisian brea dutch brood german brot swedish brd and norwegian and danish brd it has been claimed to be derived from the root of brew it may be connected with the root of break for its early uses are confined to broken pieces or bits of bread the latin crustum and it was not until the 12th century that it took the placeas the generic name for breadof hlaf (hlaifs in gothic modern english loaf) which appears to be the oldest teutonic name old high german hleib and modern german laib derive from this proto-germanic word for loaf which was borrowed into slavic (polish chleb russian khleb) and finnic (finnish leip estonian leib) languages as well
in many cultures bread is a metaphor for basic necessities and living conditions in general for example a bread-winner is a household's main economic contributor and has little to do with actual bread-provision this is also seen in the phrase putting bread on the table the roman poet juvenal satirized superficial politicians and the public as caring only for panem et circenses (bread and circuses) in russia in 1917 the bolsheviks promised peace land and bread. the term breadbasket denotes an agriculturally productive region in slavic cultures bread and salt is offered as a welcome to guests in india life's basic necessities are often referred to as roti kapra aur makan (bread cloth and house) in israel the most usual phrase in work-related demonstrations is lekhem avoda ("bread work")
the word bread is commonly used around the world in english-speaking countries as a synonym for money (as is the case with the word dough") a remarkable or revolutionary innovation is often referred to in north america and the united kingdom as the greatest thing since sliced bread or the best thing since sliced bread in cockney rhyming slang bread means money this usage is derived from the phrase bread and honey
== historyedit ==
bread is one of the oldest prepared foods evidence from 30,000 years ago in europe revealed starch residue on rocks used for pounding plants it is possible that during this time starch extract from the roots of plants such as cattails and ferns was spread on a flat rock placed over a fire and cooked into a primitive form of flatbread around 10,000 bc with the dawn of the neolithic age and the spread of agriculture grains became the mainstay of making bread yeast spores are ubiquitous including the surface of cereal grains so any dough left to rest will become naturally leavened
there were multiple sources of leavening available for early bread airborne yeasts could be harnessed by leaving uncooked dough exposed to air for some time before cooking pliny the elder reported that the gauls and iberians used the foam skimmed from beer to produce a lighter kind of bread than other peoples. parts of the ancient world that drank wine instead of beer used a paste composed of grape juice and flour that was allowed to begin fermenting or wheat bran steeped in wine as a source for yeast the most common source of leavening was to retain a piece of dough from the previous day to use as a form of sourdough starter
in 1961 the chorleywood bread process was developed which used the intense mechanical working of dough to dramatically reduce the fermentation period and the time taken to produce a loaf the process whose high-energy mixing allows for the use of lower protein grain is now widely used around the world in large factories as a result bread can be produced very quickly and at low costs to the manufacturer and the consumer however there has been some criticism of the effect on nutritional value
recently domestic bread machines that automate the process of making bread have become popular
== typesedit ==
bread is the staple food of the middle east north africa europe and in european-derived cultures such as those in the americas australia and southern africa in contrast to east asia where rice is the staple bread is usually made from a wheat-flour dough that is cultured with yeast allowed to rise and finally baked in an oven owing to its high levels of gluten (which give the dough sponginess and elasticity) common wheat (also known as bread wheat) is the most common grain used for the preparation of bread
bread is also made from the flour of other wheat species (including durum spelt and emmer) rye barley maize (corn) and oats usually but not always in combination with wheat flour spelt bread (dinkelbrot) continues to be widely consumed in germany and emmer bread was a staple food in ancient egypt canadian bread is known for its heartier consistency due to high protein levels in canadian flour
pita is an ancient semi-leavened bread widespread in the middle east levant and south eastern europe
white bread is made from flour containing only the central core of the grain (endosperm)
brown bread is made with endosperm and 10% bran it can also refer to white bread with added coloring (often caramel) to make it brown this is commonly labeled in america as wheat bread (as opposed to whole-wheat bread)
wholemeal bread contains the whole of the wheat grain (endosperm bran and germ) it is also referred to as whole-grain or whole-wheat bread especially in north america
wheat germ bread has added wheat germ for flavoring
whole-grain bread can refer to the same as wholemeal bread or to white bread with added whole grains to increase its fibre content as in 60% whole-grain bread
roti is a whole-wheat-based bread eaten in south asia chapatti is a type of roti naan is a leavened equivalent to these
granary bread (a registered trademark owned by rank hovis) is made from flaked wheat grains and white or brown flour the standard malting process is modified to maximise the maltose or sugar content but minimise residual alpha amylase content other flavor components are imparted from partial fermentation due to the particular malting process used and to maillard reactions on flaking and toasting
rye bread is made with flour from rye grain of varying levels it is higher in fiber than many common types of bread and is often darker in color and stronger in flavor it is popular in scandinavia germany finland the baltic states and russia
unleavened bread or matzo used for the jewish feast of passover does not include yeast so it does not rise
sourdough bread is made with a starter
flatbread is often simple made with flour water and salt and then formed into flattened dough most are unleavened made without yeast or sourdough culture though some are made with yeast
crisp bread is a flat and dry type of bread or cracker containing mostly rye flour
hemp bread includes strongly flavored hemp flour or seeds hemp has been used for thousands of years in traditional chinese medicine hemp flour is the by-product from pressing the oil from the seeds and milling the residue it is perishable and stores best in the freezer hemp dough won't rise due to its lack of gluten and for that reason it is best mixed with other flours a 5:1 ratio of wheat-to-hemp flour produces a hearty nutritious loaf high in protein and essential fatty acids hemp seeds have a relatively high oil content of 2535% and can be added at a rate up to 15% of the wheat flour the oil's omega-6-to-omega-3 ratio lies in the range of 2:1-to-3:1 which is considered ideal for human nutrition
quick breads usually refers to a bread chemically leavened usually with both baking powder and baking soda and a balance of acidic ingredients and alkaline ingredients examples include pancakes and waffles muffins and carrot cake boston brown bread and zucchini and banana bread
gluten-free breads have been created in recent years due to the discovery that celiac disease sufferers benefit from a gluten-free diet gluten-free bread is made with ground flours from a variety of materials such as almonds rice (rice bread) sorghum (sorghum bread) corn (cornbread) or legumes such as beans (bean bread) but since these flours lack gluten it can be difficult for them to retain their shape as they rise and they may be less fluffy additives such as xanthum gum guar gum hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (hpmc) corn starch or eggs are used to compensate for the lack of gluten
== preparationedit ==
doughs are usually baked but in some cuisines breads are steamed (e.g. mantou) fried (e.g. puri) or baked on an unoiled frying pan (e.g. tortillas) it may be leavened or unleavened (e.g matzo) salt fat and leavening agents such as yeast and baking soda are common ingredients though bread may contain other ingredients such as milk egg sugar spice fruit (such as raisins) vegetables (such as onion) nuts (such as walnuts) or seeds (such as poppy) referred to colloquially as the staff of life bread has been prepared for at least 30,000 years the development of leavened bread can probably also be traced to prehistoric times sometimes the word bread refers to a sweetened loaf cake often containing appealing ingredients like dried fruit chocolate chips nuts or spices such as pumpkin bread banana bread or gingerbread
fresh bread is prized for its taste aroma quality appearance and texture retaining its freshness is important to keep it appetizing bread that has stiffened or dried past its prime is said to be stale modern bread is sometimes wrapped in paper or plastic film or stored in a container such as a breadbox to reduce drying bread that is kept in warm moist environments is prone to the growth of mold bread kept at low temperatures in a refrigerator for example will develop mold growth more slowly than bread kept at room temperature but will turn stale quickly due to retrogradation
the soft inner part of bread is known to bakers and other culinary professionals as the crumb which is not to be confused with small bits of bread that often fall off called crumbs the outer hard portion of bread is called the crust the crumb's texture is greatly determined by the quality of the pores in the bread
=== formulationedit ===
professional baker recipes are stated using a notation called baker's percentage the amount of flour is denoted to be 100% and the amounts of the other ingredients are expressed as a percentage of that amount by weight measurement by weight is more accurate and consistent than measurement by volume particularly for dry ingredients
the proportion of water to flour is the most important measurement in a bread recipe as it affects texture and crumb the most hard us wheat flours absorb about 62% water while softer wheat flours absorb about 56% common table breads made from these doughs result in a finely textured light bread most artisan bread formulas contain anywhere from 60 to 75% water in yeast breads the higher water percentages result in more co2 bubbles and a coarser bread crumb one pound (450 g) of flour will yield a standard loaf of bread or two french loaves
calcium propionate is commonly added by commercial bakeries to retard the growth of molds
=== flouredit ===
flour is a product made from grain that has been ground to a powdery consistency flour provides the primary structure to the final baked bread while wheat flour is most commonly used for breads flours made from rye barley maize and other grains are also commonly available each of these grains provides the starch and protein needed to form bread
the protein content of the flour is the best indicator of the quality of the bread dough and the finished bread while bread can be made from all-purpose wheat flour a specialty bread flour containing more protein (1214%) is recommended for high-quality bread if one uses a flour with a lower protein content (911%) to produce bread a shorter mixing time will be required to develop gluten strength properly an extended mixing time leads to oxidization of the dough which gives the finished product a whiter crumb instead of the cream color preferred by most artisan bakers
wheat flour in addition to its starch contains three water-soluble protein groups (albumin globulin and proteoses) and two water-insoluble protein groups (glutenin and gliadin) when flour is mixed with water the water-soluble proteins dissolve leaving the glutenin and gliadin to form the structure of the resulting bread when relatively dry dough is worked by kneading or wet dough is allowed to rise for a long time (see no-knead bread) the glutenin forms strands of long thin chainlike molecules while the shorter gliadin forms bridges between the strands of glutenin the resulting networks of strands produced by these two proteins are known as gluten gluten development improves if the dough is allowed to autolyse
=== liquidsedit ===
water or some other liquid is used to form the flour into a paste or dough the weight of liquid required varies between recipes but a ratio of 3 parts liquid to 5 parts flour is common for yeast breads recipes that use steam as the primary leavening method may have a liquid content in excess of 1 part liquid to 1 part flour instead of water other types of liquids such as dairy products fruit juices or beer may be used they contribute additional sweeteners fats or leavening components as well as water
=== leaveningedit ===
leavening is the process of adding gas to a dough before or during baking to produce a lighter more easily chewed bread most bread consumed in the west is leavened unleavened breads have symbolic importance in judaism and christianity jews consume unleavened bread called matzo during passover and roman catholic and some protestant christians consume unleavened sacramental bread when celebrating the eucharist a rite derived from the narrative of the last supper when jesus broke bread with his disciples perhaps during a passover seder in contrast orthodox christians always use leavened bread during their liturgy
==== chemical leaveningedit ====
a simple technique for leavening bread is the use of gas-producing chemicals there are two common methods the first is to use baking powder or a self-rising flour that includes baking powder the second is to include an acidic ingredient such as buttermilk and add baking soda the reaction of the acid with the soda produces gas
chemically leavened breads are called quick breads and soda breads this method is commonly used to make muffins pancakes american-style biscuits and quick breads such as banana bread
==== yeastedit ====
many breads are leavened by yeast the yeast most commonly used for leavening bread is saccharomyces cerevisiae the same species used for brewing alcoholic beverages this yeast ferments some of the carbohydrates in the flour including any sugar producing carbon dioxide most bakers in the u.s leaven their dough with commercially produced baker's yeast baker's yeast has the advantage of producing uniform quick and reliable results because it is obtained from a pure culture many artisan bakers produce their own yeast by preparing a growth culture that they then use in the making of bread when this culture is kept in the right conditions it will continue to grow and provide leavening for many years
both the baker's yeast and the sourdough methods of baking bread follow the same pattern water is mixed with flour salt and the leavening agent (baker's yeast or sourdough starter) other additions (spices herbs fats seeds fruit etc.) are not needed to bake bread but are often used the mixed dough is then allowed to rise one or more times (a longer rising time results in more flavor so bakers often punch down the dough and let it rise again) then loaves are formed and (after an optional final rising time) the bread is baked in an oven
many breads are made from a straight dough which means that all of the ingredients are combined in one step and the dough is baked after the rising time others are made from a pre-ferment in which the leavening agent is combined with some of the flour and water a day or so ahead of baking and allowed to ferment overnight on the day of the baking the rest of the ingredients are added and process continues as with straight dough this produces a more flavorful bread with better texture
many bakers see the starter method as a compromise between the highly reliable results of baker's yeast and the flavor and complexity of a longer fermentation it also allows the baker to use only a minimal amount of baker's yeast which was scarce and expensive when it first became available most yeasted pre-ferments fall into one of three categories poolish or pouliche a loose-textured mixture composed of roughly equal amounts of flour and water (by weight) biga a stiff mixture with a higher proportion of flour and pte fermente which is simply a portion of dough reserved from a previous batch sourdough (also known as levain or natural leaven") takes the pre-ferment method a step further mixing flour and water to allow naturally occurring yeast and bacteria to propagate (usually saccharomyces exiguus which is more acid-tolerant than s cerevisiae and various species of lactobacillus)
==== sourdoughedit ====
sourdough is a type of bread produced by a long fermentation of dough using naturally occurring yeasts and lactobacilli in comparison with breads made with cultivated yeast it usually has a mildly sour taste because of the lactic acid produced by the lactobacilli
sourdough breads are made with a sourdough starter (which differs from starters made with baker's yeast) the starter cultivates yeast and lactobacilli in a mixture of flour and water making use of the microorganisms already present on flour it does not need any added yeast a starter may be maintained indefinitely by regular additions of flour and water some bakers have starters several generations old which are said to have a special taste or texture it is possible to obtain existing starter cultures to begin a new one
at one time all yeast-leavened breads were sourdoughs the leavening process was not understood until the 19th century when yeast was first identified since then strains of saccaromyces cerevisiae have been bred for their reliability and speed of leavening and sold as baker's yeast baker's yeast was adopted for the simpicity and flexibility it introduced to bread making obviating the lengthy cultivation of a sourdough starter while sourdough breads survived in some parts of europe throughout most of the u.s. they were replaced by baker's yeast recently there has been a revival of sourdough bread in artisan bakeries
there are other ways of sourdough baking and culture maintenance a more traditional one is the process that was followed by peasant families throughout europe in past centuries the family (usually the woman was in charge of breadmaking) would bake on a fixed schedule perhaps once a week the starter was saved from the previous week's dough the starter was mixed with the new ingredients the dough was left to rise and then a piece of it was saved (to be the starter for next week's bread) the rest was formed into loaves that were marked with the family sign (this is where today's decorative slashing of bread loaves originates from) and taken to the communal oven to bake these communal ovens with time evolved into the modern bakery
==== steamedit ====
the rapid expansion of steam produced during baking leavens the bread which is as simple as it is unpredictable the best known steam-leavened bread is the popover steam-leavening is unpredictable since the steam is not produced until the bread is baked
steam leavening happens regardless of the rising agents (baking soda yeast baking powder sour dough beaten egg whites etc.)
the leavening agent either contains air bubbles or generates carbon dioxide
the heat vaporises the water from the inner surface of the bubbles within the dough
the steam expands and makes the bread rise
this is the main factor in the rise of bread once it has been put in the oven co2 generation on its own is too small to account for the rise heat kills bacteria or yeast at an early stage so the co2 generation is stopped
==== bacteriaedit ====
salt-rising bread employs a form of bacterial leavening that does not require yeast although the leavening action is not always consistent and requires close attention to the incubating conditions this bread is making a comeback due to its unique cheese-like flavor and fine texture
==== aerationedit ====
aerated bread is leavened by carbon dioxide being forced into dough under pressure from the mid 19th to 20th centuries bread made this way was somewhat popular in the united kingdom made by the aerated bread company and sold in its high-street tearooms the company was founded in 1862 and ceased independent operations in 1955 while it had some devoted adherents it never eclipsed the use of baker's yeast worldwide
the pressure-vacuum mixer was later developed by the flour milling and baking research association at chorleywood with the application of both pressure and vacuum at different points in the mixing process this mixer not only manipulates the gas bubble size it may also manipulate the composition of gases in the dough via the gas applied to the headspace
=== fats or shorteningsedit ===
fats such as butter vegetable oils lard or that contained in eggs affect the development of gluten in breads by coating and lubricating the individual strands of protein they also help to hold the structure together if too much fat is included in a bread dough the lubrication effect will cause the protein structures to divide a fat content of approximately 3% by weight is the concentration that will produce the greatest leavening action in addition to their effects on leavening fats also serve to tenderize breads and preserve freshness
=== bread improversedit ===
bread improvers and dough conditioners are often used in producing commercial breads to reduce the time needed for rising and to improve texture and volume chemical substances commonly used as bread improvers include ascorbic acid hydrochloride sodium metabisulfate ammonium chloride various phosphates amylase and protease
salt is one of the most common additives used in production in addition to enhancing flavor and restricting yeast activity salt affects the crumb and the overall texture by stabilizing and strengthening the gluten some artisan bakers are foregoing early addition of salt to the dough and are waiting until after a 20-minute rest this is known as an autolyse and is done with both refined and whole-grain flours
== propertiesedit ==
=== chemical compositionedit ===
in wheat phenolic compounds are mainly found in hulls in the form of insoluble bound ferulic acid where it is relevant to wheat resistance to fungal diseases
rye bread contains phenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers
three natural phenolic glucosides secoisolariciresinol diglucoside p-coumaric acid glucoside and ferulic acid glucoside can be found in commercial breads containing flaxseed
=== serving and consumptionedit ===
bread can be served at many temperatures once baked it can subsequently be toasted it is most commonly eaten with the hands either by itself or as a carrier for other foods bread can be dipped into liquids such as gravy olive oil or soup it can be topped with various sweet and savory spreads or used to make sandwiches containing myriad varieties of meats cheeses vegetables and condiments
bread may also be used as an ingredient in other culinary preparations such as the use of breadcrumbs to provide crunchy crusts or thicken sauces sweet or savoury bread puddings or as a binding agent in sausages and other ground meat products
=== nutritional significanceedit ===
nutritionally bread is known as an ample source for the grains category of nutrition serving size of bread is standard through ounces counting one slice of bread (white processed bread) as 1 oz also bread is considered a good source of carbohydrates through the whole grains nutrients such as magnesium iron selenium b vitamins and dietary fiber as part of the 2010 dietary guidelines for americans it is recommended to make at least half of the recommended total grain intake as whole grains and to overall increase whole grains intake
=== shelf lifeedit ===
in 2009 a natural preservative for extending the shelf life of bread for up to two weeks (as opposed to a few days) had been patented and licensed to puratos a belgium-based baking ingredients company that supplies to more than 100 countries the breakthrough was pioneered by prof elke arendt at the university college cork (ucc) by incorporating into the bread a lactic acid bacteria strain which also produces a fine crumb texture and improves the flavour volume and nutritional value of the food as well. prior to this about 20% of all bread is thrown out due to shelf-life issues.
=== crustedit ===
the bread crust is formed from surface dough during the cooking process it is hardened and browned through the maillard reaction using the sugars and amino acids and the intense heat at the bread surface the nature of a bread's crust differs depending on the type of bread and the way it is baked commercial bread is baked using jets that direct steam toward the bread to help produce a desirable crust
the crust of most breads is less soft and more complexly and intensely flavored than the rest and judgments vary among individuals and cultures as to whether it is therefore the less palatable or the more flavorful part of a particular style of bread some manufacturers including as of september 2009 sara lee market traditional and crustless breads
the first and last slices of a loaf (or a slice with a high ratio of crust-area to volume compared to others of the same loaf) are sometimes referred to as the heel or the crust of the loaf
old wives tales suggest that eating the bread crust makes a person's hair curlier additionally the crust is rumored to be healthier than the rest some studies have shown that this is true as the crust has more dietary fiber and antioxidants notably pronyl-lysine the pronyl-lysine found in bread crust is being researched for its potential colorectal cancer inhibitory properties
== cultural significanceedit ==
bread has a significance beyond mere nutrition in many cultures in the west and near and middle east because of its history and contemporary importance bread is also significant in christianity as one of the elements (alongside wine) of the eucharist see sacramental bread the word companion comes from latin com- with + panis bread
the political significance of bread is considerable in 19th century britain the inflated price of bread due to the corn laws caused major political and social divisions and was central to debates over free trade versus protectionism the assize of bread and ale in the 13th century demonstrated the importance of bread in medieval times by setting heavy punishments for short-changing bakers and bread appeared in the magna carta a half-century earlier
like other foods choosing the right kind of bread is used as a type of social signalling to let others know for example that the person buying expensive bread is financially secure or the person buying whatever type of bread that the current fashions deem most healthful is a health-conscious consumer
as a simple cheap and adaptable type of food bread is often used as a synecdoche for food in general in some languages and dialects such as greek and punjabi there are many variations on the basic recipe of bread worldwide such as bagels baguettes biscuits bocadillo brioche chapatis lavash naan pitas pizza pretzels puris tortillas and many others there are various types of traditional cheese breads in many countries including brazil colombia italy and russia
=== asiaedit ===
the traditional bread in china is mantou it is made by steaming or deep-frying dough made from wheat flour in northern china and northern central china mantou is often eaten as an alternative staple to rice steamed mantou is similar to western white bread but since it is not baked it does not have a brown outer crust mantou that have a filling such as meat or vegetables (cha siu bao for example) are called baozi the kompyang of fuzhou is an example of a chinese bread baked in a clay oven
in south asia (including india pakistan and the middle east) chapati or roti types of unleavened flatbreads usually made from whole-wheat flour or sometimes refined wheat flour and baked on a hot iron griddle called a tava form the mainstay of the people's diet the miracle chapati as it became known is an unleavened bread with a long tradition the bread can be spelled chapathi chapati chapatti or chappati rotis and naans are usually served with curry throughout the region a variant called makki di roti uses maize flour rather than white flour another variant is puri a thin flat bread that is fried rather than baked and puffs up while cooked paratha is another variation on roti naan (leavened wholewheat bread) is baked in a tandoor or clay oven and is rarely prepared at home white and brown breads are also very common but not as common as roti
in the philippines pandesal (or pan de sal meaning bread of salt or salt bread) is a rounded bread usually eaten by filipinos during breakfast the philippines also produces a cheap generic white bread called pinoy tasty
=== europeedit ===
an enormous variety of bread is available across europe germany lays claim to over 1300 basic varieties of breads rolls and pastries as well as having the largest consumption of bread per capita worldwide followed by chile bread and salt is a welcome greeting ceremony in many central and eastern european cultures during important occasions when guests arrive they are offered a loaf of bread with a salt holder to represent hospitality
in france there has been a huge decline in the baguette culture in the 1970s french people were consuming an average of one loaf of bread per day only a century ago the french ate approximately 3 loaves of bread per day today french people eat only a half a loaf of bread per day in response to this decline bakers have created a national campaign to get people to call at the bakery before and after work just as they used to the campaign models the american got milk? campaign plastering hey there have you picked up the bread? all over billboards and bread bags
there is a wide variety of traditional breads in great britain often baked in a rectangular tin round loaves are also produced such as the north east england specialty called a stottie cake a cob is a small round loaf a cottage loaf is made of two balls of dough one on top of the other to form a figure-of-eight shape there are many variations on bread rolls such as baps barms breadcakes and so on the chorleywood process for mass-producing bread was developed in england in the 1960s before spreading worldwide mass-produced sliced white bread brands such as wonderloaf and mother's pride have been criticized on grounds of poor nutritional value and taste of the loaves produced
in spain bread is called pan the traditional spanish pan is a long loaf of bread similar to the french baguette but wider one can buy it freshly made every morning in the traditional bakeries where there is a large assortment of bread a smaller version is known as bocadillo an iconic piece of the hispanic cuisine in spain especially in the mediterranean area there have been guilds of bakers for over 750 years the bakers guild in barcelona was founded in 1200 ad there is a region called tierra del pan ("land of the bread") located in the province of zamora where economy was in the past joined to this activity
=== latin americaedit ===
in mexico bread is called pan although corn tortillas are the staple bread in most of mexico bread rolls in many varieties are an important daily food for city dwellers popular breads in mexico include the bolillo roll and pan dulce pan dulce which is spanish for sweet bread is eaten in the evenings with hot drinks like traditional hot chocolate
in peru pan has many variations due to the diversity of peruvian cuisine people usually eat pan de piso and pan serrano there are also some kinds of bread made of potatoes these are currently popular in the andes bizcochos are sweet bread usually eaten with some butter and hot chocolate a dough made with cooked pumpkin or squash often shaped and fried into doughnuts and served with a sweet fruity dipping sauce is a traditional favorite bread is an ingredient of sopas de ajo gazpacho and salmorejo

in ethiopia in east north africa a bread called injera is made from a grain called teff this is a wide flat circular bread that is in a similar shape of a tortilla and is also used as a utensil to pick up food
also consumed is a thick and chewy fried bread that is smothered in oil beforehand the rghifa bread is a staple in the food of morocco and consists of several layers of lightly cooked bread
=== north americaedit ===
traditional breads in the united states include cornbreads and various quick breads such as biscuits rolls made from wheat flour and yeast are another popular and traditional bread eaten with the dinner meal
cornbread is made from cornmeal and can differ significantly in taste and texture from region to region in general the south prefers white cornmeal with little to no wheat flour or sweeteners added it is traditionally baked in a cast-iron skillet and ideally has a crunchy outside and moist inside the north usually prefers yellow cornmeal with sometimes as much as half wheat flour in its composition as well as sugar honey or maple syrup this results in a bread that is softer and sweeter than its southern counterpart wheat flour was not available to the average north american family until the early 1900s when a new breed of wheat termed marquis was produced this was a hybrid of red fife and hard red winter wheat marquis grew well and soon average americans were able to have homemade wheat bread on the table homemade wheat breads are made in a rectangular tin similar to those in the united kingdom
spoon bread also called batter bread or egg bread is made of cornmeal with or without added rice and hominy and is mixed with milk eggs shortening and leavening to such a consistency that it must be served from the baking dish with a spoon this is popular chiefly in the south
sourdough biscuits are traditional cowboy food in the west the san francisco bay area is known for its crusty sourdough
up until the 20th century (and even later in certain regions) any flour other than cornmeal was considered a luxury this would explain the greater variety in cornbread types compared to that of wheat breads in terms of commercial manufacture the most popular bread has been a soft-textured type with a thin crust that is usually made with milk and is slightly sweet this is the type that is generally sold ready-sliced in packages it is usually eaten with the crust but some eaters or preparers may remove the crust due to a personal preference or style of serving as with finger sandwiches served with afternoon tea some of the softest bread including wonder bread is referred to as balloon bread
though white sandwich bread is the most popular americans are trending toward more artisanal breads different regions of the country feature certain ethnic bread varieties including the ashkenazi jewish bagel the french baguette the italian-style scali bread made in new england jewish rye commonly associated with delicatessen cuisine and native american frybread (a product of hardship developed during the indian resettlements of the 19th century)
== religious significanceedit ==
=== abrahamic religionsedit ===
during the jewish festival of passover only unleavened bread is eaten in commemoration of the flight from slavery in egypt the israelites did not have enough time to allow their bread to rise and so ate only unleavened bread (matzoh)
in the christian ritual of the eucharist bread symbolically represents the body of christ and is eaten as a sacrament specific aspects of the ritual itself including the composition of the bread vary from denomination to denomination the differences in the practice of the eucharist stem from different descriptions and depictions of the last supper which provides the scriptural basis for the eucharist the synoptic gospels present the last supper as a passover meal and suggest that the bread at the last supper would be unleavened however in the chronology in gospel of john the last supper occurred the day before passover suggesting that the bread would be leavened despite this point of disagreement the council of florence of the catholic church agreed that the body of christ is truly confected in both unleavened and leavened wheat bread and priests should confect the body of christ in either
=== paganismedit ===
some traditions of wicca and neo-paganism consume bread as part of their religious rituals attaching varied symbolism to the act
== anti-bread movementsedit ==
although eaten by nearly all people some have rejected bread entirely or rejected types of bread that they consider unhealthy reasons for doing so have varied through history whole grain bread has been criticized as being unrefined and white bread as being unhealthfully processed homemade bread has been deemed unsanitary and factory-made bread regarded with suspicion for being adulterated amylophobia literally fear of starch was a movement in the us during the 1920s and 1930s
in the united states bread sales fell by 11.3% between 2008 and 2013 this statistic might reflect a change in the types of food from which americans are getting their carbohydrates but the trends are unclear because of differences between the markets for different classes of bread products it is also possible that changing diet fashions affected the decrease in bread sales during that period
