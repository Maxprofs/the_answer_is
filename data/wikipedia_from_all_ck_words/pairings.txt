painting is the practice of applying paint pigment color or other medium to a surface (support base) the medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush but other implements such as knives sponges and airbrushes can be used
in art the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action the support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls paper canvas wood glass lacquer clay leaf copper and concrete and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials including sand clay paper plaster gold leaf as well as objects
the term painting is also used outside of art as a common trade among craftsmen and builders
painting is a mode of creative expression and the forms are numerous drawing gesture (as in gestural painting) composition narration (as in narrative art) or abstraction (as in abstract art) among other aesthetic modes may serve to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a still life or landscape painting) photographic abstract narrative symbolistic (as in symbolist art) emotive (as in expressionism) or political in nature (as in artivism)
a portion of the history of painting in both eastern and western art is dominated by spiritual motifs and ideas examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to biblical scenes rendered on the interior walls and ceiling of the sistine chapel to scenes from the life of buddha or other images of eastern religious origin

=== intensityedit ===
what enables painting is the perception and representation of intensity every point in space has different intensity which can be represented in painting by black and white and all the gray shades between in practice painters can articulate shapes by juxtaposing surfaces of different intensity by using just color (of the same intensity) one can only represent symbolic shapes thus the basic means of painting are distinct from ideological means such as geometrical figures various points of view and organization (perspective) and symbols for example a painter perceives that a particular white wall has different intensity at each point due to shades and reflections from nearby objects but ideally a white wall is still a white wall in pitch darkness in technical drawing thickness of line is also ideal demarcating ideal outlines of an object within a perceptual frame different from the one used by painters
=== color and toneedit ===
color and tone are the essence of painting as pitch and rhythm are the essence of music color is highly subjective but has observable psychological effects although these can differ from one culture to the next black is associated with mourning in the west but in the east white is some painters theoreticians writers and scientists including goethe kandinsky and newton have written their own color theory
moreover the use of language is only an abstraction for a color equivalent the word red for example can cover a wide range of variations from the pure red of the visible spectrum of light there is not a formalized register of different colors in the way that there is agreement on different notes in music such as f or c for a painter color is not simply divided into basic (primary) and derived (complementary or mixed) colors (like red blue green brown etc.)
painters deal practically with pigments so blue for a painter can be any of the blues phthalocyanine blue prussian blue indigo cobalt ultramarine and so on psychological and symbolical meanings of color are not strictly speaking means of painting colors only add to the potential derived context of meanings and because of this the perception of a painting is highly subjective the analogy with music is quite clearsound in music (like a c note) is analogous to light in painting shades to dynamics and coloration is to painting as the specific timbre of musical instruments is to music though these elements do not necessarily form a melody (in music) but can add different contexts to it
=== non-traditional elementsedit ===
modern artists have extended the practice of painting considerably to include as one example collage which began with cubism and is not painting in the strict sense some modern painters incorporate different materials such as sand cement straw or wood for their texture examples of this are the works of jean dubuffet and anselm kiefer there is a growing community of artists who use computers to paint color onto a digital canvas using programs such as adobe photoshop corel painter and many others these images can be printed onto traditional canvas if required
=== rhythmedit ===
rhythm is important in painting as it is in music if one defines rhythm as a pause incorporated into a sequence then there can be rhythm in paintings these pauses allow creative force to intervene and add new creationsform melody coloration the distribution of form or any kind of information is of crucial importance in the given work of art and it directly affects the aesthetic value of that work this is because the aesthetical value is functionality dependent i.e the freedom (of movement) of perception is perceived as beauty free flow of energy in art as well as in other forms of techne directly contributes to the aesthetical value
== historyedit ==
the oldest known paintings are at the grotte chauvet in france which some historians believe are about 32,000 years old they are engraved and painted using red ochre and black pigment and they show horses rhinoceros lions buffalo mammoth abstract designs and what are possibly partial human figures however the earliest evidence of the act of painting has been discovered in two rock-shelters in arnhem land in northern australia in the lowest layer of material at these sites there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a limestone rock-shelter in the kimberley region of north-western australia that is dated 40,000 years old there are examples of cave paintings all over the worldin italy france spain portugal china australia mexico etc
in western cultures oil painting and watercolor painting have rich and complex traditions in style and subject matter in the east ink and color ink historically predominated the choice of media with equally rich and complex traditions
the invention of photography had a major impact on painting in the decades after the first photograph was produced in 1829 photographic processes improved and became more widely practiced depriving painting of much of its historic purpose to provide an accurate record of the observable world a series of art movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuriesnotably impressionism post-impressionism fauvism expressionism cubism and dadaismchallenged the renaissance view of the world eastern and african painting however continued a long history of stylization and did not undergo an equivalent transformation at the same time
modern and contemporary art has moved away from the historic value of craft and documentation in favour of concept leading some to say in the 1960s that painting as a serious art form is dead this has not deterred the majority of living painters from continuing to practice painting either as whole or part of their work the vitality and versatility of painting in the 21st century defies the previous declarations of its demise in an epoch characterized by the idea of pluralism there is no consensus as to a representative style of the age artists continue to make important works of art in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperamentstheir merits are left to the public and the marketplace to judge
among the continuing and current directions in painting at the beginning of the 21st century are monochrome painting hard-edge painting geometric abstraction appropriation hyperrealism photorealism expressionism minimalism lyrical abstraction pop art op art abstract expressionism color field painting neo-expressionism collage intermedia painting assemblage painting computer art painting postmodern painting neo-dada painting shaped canvas painting environmental mural painting traditional figure painting landscape painting portrait painting and paint-on-glass animation
== aesthetics and theoryedit ==
aesthetics is the study of art and beauty it was an important issue for 18th- and 19th-century philosophers such as kant and hegel classical philosophers like plato and aristotle also theorized about art and painting in particular plato disregarded painters (as well as sculptors) in his philosophical system he maintained that painting cannot depict the truthit is a copy of reality (a shadow of the world of ideas) and is nothing but a craft similar to shoemaking or iron casting by the time of leonardo painting had become a closer representation of the truth than painting was in ancient greece leonardo da vinci on the contrary said that italian la pittura cosa mentale ("english painting is a thing of the mind") kant distinguished between beauty and the sublime in terms that clearly gave priority to the former although he did not refer to painting in particular this concept was taken up by painters such as j.m.w turner and caspar david friedrich
hegel recognized the failure of attaining a universal concept of beauty and in his aesthetic essay wrote that painting is one of the three romantic arts along with poetry and music for its symbolic highly intellectual purpose painters who have written theoretical works on painting include kandinsky and paul klee in his essay kandinsky maintains that painting has a spiritual value and he attaches primary colors to essential feelings or concepts something that goethe and other writers had already tried to do
iconography is the study of the content of paintings rather than their style erwin panofsky and other art historians first seek to understand the things depicted before looking at their meaning for the viewer at the time and finally analyzing their wider cultural religious and social meaning
in 1890 the parisian painter maurice denis famously asserted remember that a paintingbefore being a warhorse a naked woman or some story or otheris essentially a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order. thus many 20th-century developments in painting such as cubism were reflections on the means of painting rather than on the external worldnaturewhich had previously been its core subject recent contributions to thinking about painting have been offered by the painter and writer julian bell in his book what is painting? bell discusses the development through history of the notion that paintings can express feelings and ideas in mirror of the world bell writes
a work of art seeks to hold your attention and keep it fixed a history of art urges it onwards bulldozing a highway through the homes of the imagination
== painting mediaedit ==
different types of paint are usually identified by the medium that the pigment is suspended or embedded in which determines the general working characteristics of the paint such as viscosity miscibility solubility drying time etc
=== oiledit ===
oil painting is the process of painting with pigments that are bound with a medium of drying oilespecially in early modern europe linseed oil often an oil such as linseed was boiled with a resin such as pine resin or even frankincense these were called varnishes and were prized for their body and gloss oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known the transition began with early netherlandish painting in northern europe and by the height of the renaissance oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced tempera paints in the majority of europe
=== pasteledit ===
pastel is a painting medium in the form of a stick consisting of pure powdered pigment and a binder the pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all colored art media including oil paints the binder is of a neutral hue and low saturation the color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process because the surface of a pastel painting is fragile and easily smudged its preservation requires protective measures such as framing under glass it may also be sprayed with a fixative nonetheless when made with permanent pigments and properly cared for a pastel painting may endure unchanged for centuries pastels are not susceptible as are paintings made with a fluid medium to the cracking and discoloration that result from changes in the color opacity or dimensions of the medium as it dries
=== acrylicedit ===
acrylic paint is fast drying paint containing pigment suspension in acrylic polymer emulsion acrylic paints can be diluted with water but become water-resistant when dry depending on how much the paint is diluted (with water) or modified with acrylic gels media or pastes the finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor or an oil painting or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media the main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent drying time oils allow for more time to blend colors and apply even glazes over under-paintings this slow drying aspect of oil can be seen as an advantage for certain techniques but in other regards it impedes the artist trying to work quickly
=== watercoloredit ===
watercolor is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-soluble vehicle the traditional and most common support for watercolor paintings is paper other supports include papyrus bark papers plastics vellum or leather fabric wood and canvas in east asia watercolor painting with inks is referred to as brush painting or scroll painting in chinese korean and japanese painting it has been the dominant medium often in monochrome black or browns india ethiopia and other countries also have long traditions finger-painting with watercolor paints originated in china watercolor pencils (water-soluble color pencils) may be used either wet or dry

=== hot waxedit ===
encaustic painting also known as hot wax painting involves using heated beeswax to which colored pigments are added the liquid/paste is then applied to a surfaceusually prepared wood though canvas and other materials are often used the simplest encaustic mixture can be made from adding pigments to beeswax but there are several other recipes that can be usedsome containing other types of waxes damar resin linseed oil or other ingredients pure powdered pigments can be purchased and used though some mixtures use oil paints or other forms of pigment metal tools and special brushes can be used to shape the paint before it cools or heated metal tools can be used to manipulate the wax once it has cooled onto the surface other materials can be encased or collaged into the surface or layered using the encaustic medium to adhere it to the surface
=== frescoedit ===
fresco is any of several related mural painting types done on plaster on walls or ceilings the word fresco comes from the italian word affresco [affresko] which derives from the latin word for fresh frescoes were often made during the renaissance and other early time periods buon fresco technique consists of painting in pigment mixed with water on a thin layer of wet fresh lime mortar or plaster for which the italian word for plaster intonaco is used a secco painting in contrast is done on dry plaster (secco is dry in italian) the pigments require a binding medium such as egg (tempera) glue or oil to attach the pigment to the wall
=== gouacheedit ===
gouache is a water based paint consisting of pigment and other materials designed to be used in an opaque painting method gouache differs from watercolor in that the particles are larger the ratio of pigment to water is much higher and an additional inert white pigment such as chalk is also present this makes gouache heavier and more opaque with greater reflective qualities like all watermedia it is diluted with water
=== enameledit ===
enamels are made by painting a substrate typically metal with frit a type of powdered glass minerals called color oxides provide coloration after firing at a temperature of 750850 degrees celsius (13801560 degrees fahrenheit) the result is a fused lamination of glass and metal enamels have traditionally been used for decoration of precious objects but have also been used for other purposes in the 18th century enamel painting enjoyed a vogue in europe especially as a medium for portrait miniatures in the late 20th century the technique of porcelain enamel on metal has been used as a durable medium for outdoor murals
=== spray paintedit ===
aerosol paint (also called spray paint) is a type of paint that comes in a sealed pressurized container and is released in a fine spray mist when depressing a valve button a form of spray painting aerosol paint leaves a smooth evenly coated surface standard sized cans are portable inexpensive and easy to store aerosol primer can be applied directly to bare metal and many plastics
speed portability and permanence also make aerosol paint a common graffiti medium in the late 1970s street graffiti writers signatures and murals became more elaborate and a unique style developed as a factor of the aerosol medium and the speed required for illicit work many now recognize graffiti and street art as a unique art form and specifically manufactured aerosol paints are made for the graffiti artist a stencil protects a surface except the specific shape to be painted stencils can be purchased as movable letters ordered as professionally cut logos or hand-cut by artists
=== temperaedit ===
tempera also known as egg tempera is a permanent fast-drying painting medium consisting of colored pigment mixed with a water-soluble binder medium (usually a glutinous material such as egg yolk or some other size) tempera also refers to the paintings done in this medium tempera paintings are very long lasting and examples from the first centuries ce still exist egg tempera was a primary method of painting until after 1500 when it was superseded by the invention of oil painting a paint commonly called tempera (though it is not) consisting of pigment and glue size is commonly used and referred to by some manufacturers in america as poster paint
=== water miscible oil paintedit ===
water miscible oil paints (also called water soluble or water-mixable") is a modern variety of oil paint engineered to be thinned and cleaned up with water rather than having to use chemicals such as turpentine it can be mixed and applied using the same techniques as traditional oil-based paint but while still wet it can be effectively removed from brushes palettes and rags with ordinary soap and water its water solubility comes from the use of an oil medium in which one end of the molecule has been altered to bind loosely to water molecules as in a solution
== painting stylesedit ==
style is used in two senses it can refer to the distinctive visual elements techniques and methods that typify an individual artist's work it can also refer to the movement or school that an artist is associated with this can stem from an actual group that the artist was consciously involved with or it can be a category in which art historians have placed the painter the word style in the latter sense has fallen out of favor in academic discussions about contemporary painting though it continues to be used in popular contexts such movements or classifications include the following
=== westernedit ===
==== modernismedit ====
modernism describes both a set of cultural tendencies and an array of associated cultural movements originally arising from wide-scale and far-reaching changes to western society in the late 19th century and early 20th century modernism was a revolt against the conservative values of realism the term encompasses the activities and output of those who felt the traditional forms of art architecture literature religious faith social organization and daily life were becoming outdated in the new economic social and political conditions of an emerging fully industrialized world a salient characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness this often led to experiments with form and work that draws attention to the processes and materials used (and to the further tendency of abstraction)
===== impressionismedit =====
the first example of modernism in painting was impressionism a school of painting that initially focused on work done not in studios but outdoors (en plein air) impressionist paintings demonstrated that human beings do not see objects but instead see light itself the school gathered adherents despite internal divisions among its leading practitioners and became increasingly influential initially rejected from the most important commercial show of the time the government-sponsored paris salon the impressionists organized yearly group exhibitions in commercial venues during the 1870s and 1880s timing them to coincide with the official salon a significant event of 1863 was the salon des refuss created by emperor napoleon iii to display all of the paintings rejected by the paris salon
===== abstract stylesedit =====
abstract painting uses a visual language of form color and line to create a composition that may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world abstract expressionism was an american post-world war ii art movement that combined the emotional intensity and self-denial of the german expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the european abstract schoolssuch as futurism the bauhaus and synthetic cubism and the image of being rebellious anarchic highly idiosyncratic and some feel nihilistic
action painting sometimes called gestural abstraction is a style of painting in which paint is spontaneously dribbled splashed or smeared onto the canvas rather than being carefully applied the resulting work often emphasizes the physical act of painting itself as an essential aspect of the finished work or concern of its artist the style was widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s and is closely associated with abstract expressionism (some critics have used the terms action painting and abstract expressionism interchangeably)
other modernist styles include
color field
hard-edge painting
expressionism
cubism
pop art
===== outsider artedit =====
the term outsider art was coined by art critic roger cardinal in 1972 as an english synonym for art brut (french [a byt] raw art or rough art") a label created by french artist jean dubuffet to describe art created outside the boundaries of official culture dubuffet focused particularly on art by insane-asylum inmates outsider art has emerged as a successful art marketing category (an annual outsider art fair has taken place in new york since 1992) the term is sometimes misapplied as a catch-all marketing label for art created by people outside the mainstream art world, regardless of their circumstances or the content of their work
