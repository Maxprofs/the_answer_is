vegetation is assemblages of plant species and the ground cover they provide it is a general term without specific reference to particular taxa life forms structure spatial extent or any other specific botanical or geographic characteristics it is broader than the term flora which refers to species composition perhaps the closest synonym is plant community but vegetation can and often does refer to a wider range of spatial scales than that term does including scales as large as the global primeval redwood forests coastal mangrove stands sphagnum bogs desert soil crusts roadside weed patches wheat fields cultivated gardens and lawns all are encompassed by the term vegetation
the vegetation type is defined by characteristic dominant species or a common aspect of the assemblage such as an elevation range or environmental commonality earth cover is the expression used by ecologist frederick edward clements that has its closest modern equivalent being vegetation the expression continues to be used by the bureau of land management
== classificationedit ==
much of the work on vegetation classification comes from european and north american ecologists and they have fundamentally different approaches in north america vegetation types are based on a combination of the following criteria climate pattern plant habit phenology and/or growth form and dominant species in the current us standard (adopted by the federal geographic data committee (fgdc) and originally developed by unesco and the nature conservancy) the classification is hierarchical and incorporates the non-floristic criteria into the upper (most general) five levels and limited floristic criteria only into the lower (most specific) two levels in europe classification often relies much more heavily sometimes entirely on floristic (species) composition alone without explicit reference to climate phenoloogy or growth forms it often emphasizes indicator or diagnostic species which may distinguish one classification from another
in the fgdc standard the hierarchy levels from most general to most specific are system class subclass group formation alliance and association the lowest level or association is thus the most precisely defined and incorporates the names of the dominant one to three (usually two) species of a type an example of a vegetation type defined at the level of class might be forest canopy cover > 60% at the level of a formation as winter-rain broad-leaved evergreen sclerophyllous closed-canopy forest at the level of alliance as arbutus menziesii forest and at the level of association as arbutus menziesii-lithocarpus densiflora forest referring to pacific madrone-tanoak forests which occur in california and oregon usa in practice the levels of the alliance and/or association are the most often used particularly in vegetation mapping just as the latin binomial is most often used in discussing particular species in taxonomy and in general communication

like all the biological systems plant communities are temporally and spatially dynamic they change at all possible scales dynamism in vegetation is defined primarily as changes in species composition and/or vegetation structure
=== temporal dynamicsedit ===
temporally a large number of processes or events can cause change but for sake of simplicity they can be categorized roughly as either abrupt or gradual abrupt changes are generally referred to as disturbances these include things like wildfires high winds landslides floods avalanches and the like their causes are usually external (exogenous) to the communitythey are natural processes occurring (mostly) independently of the natural processes of the community (such as germination growth death etc.) such events can change vegetation structure and composition very quickly and for long time periods and they can do so over large areas very few ecosystems are without some type of disturbance as a regular and recurring part of the long term system dynamic fire and wind disturbances are particularly common throughout many vegetation types worldwide fire is particularly potent because of its ability to destroy not only living plants but also the seeds spores and living meristems representing the potential next generation and because of fire's impact on fauna populations soil characteristics and other ecosystem elements and processes (for further discussion of this topic see fire ecology)
temporal change at a slower pace is ubiquitous it comprises the field of ecological succession succession is the relatively gradual change in structure and taxonomic composition that arises as the vegetation itself modifies various environmental variables over time including light water and nutrient levels these modifications change the suite of species most adapted to grow survive and reproduce in an area causing floristic changes these floristic changes contribute to structural changes that are inherent in plant growth even in the absence of species changes (especially where plants have a large maximum size i.e trees) causing slow and broadly predictable changes in the vegetation succession can be interrupted at any time by disturbance setting the system either back to a previous state or off on another trajectory altogether because of this successional processes may or may not lead to some static final state moreover accurately predicting the characteristics of such a state even if it does arise is not always possible in short vegetative communities are subject to many variables that together set limits on the predictability of future conditions
=== spatial dynamicsedit ===
as a general rule the larger an area under consideration the more likely the vegetation will be heterogeneous across it two main factors are at work first the temporal dynamics of disturbance and succession are increasingly unlikely to be in synchrony across any area as the size of that area increases that is different areas will be at different developmental stages due to different local histories particularly their times since last major disturbance this fact interacts with inherent environmental variability (e.g in soils climate topography etc.) which is also a function of area environmental variability constrains the suite of species that can occupy a given area and the two factors together interact to create a mosaic of vegetation conditions across the landscape only in agricultural or horticultural systems does vegetation ever approach perfect uniformity in natural systems there is always heterogeneity although its scale and intensity will vary widely a natural grassland may be homogeneous when compared to the same area of partially burned forest
