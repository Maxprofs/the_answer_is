prevalence sexual monogamyedit
prevalence sexual monogamy roughly estimated percentage married people engage extramarital sex standard crosscultural sample describes amount extramarital sex men women preindustrial cultures amount extramarital sex men described universal cultures moderate cultures occasional cultures uncommon cultures amount extramarital sex women described universal cultures moderate cultures occasional cultures uncommon cultures findings support claim amount extramarital sex differs across cultures across genders
recent surveys conducted nonwestern nations also found cultural gender differences extramarital sex study sexual behavior thailand tanzania cte divoire suggests men engage extramarital sex much smaller unreported percentage women engage extramarital sex studies nigeria found around men women engage extramarital sex survey married cohabiting couples zimbabwe reports men women engaged extracouple sexual relationships within last months
issue extramarital sex examined frequently united states many surveys asking extramarital sex united states relied convenience samples convenience sample means surveys given whoever happens easily available eg volunteer college students volunteer magazine readers convenience samples accurately reflect population united states whole cause serious biases survey results surprising therefore surveys extramarital sex united states produced widely differing results studies report married women married men engage extramarital sex way get scientifically reliable estimates extramarital sex use nationally representative samples three studies used nationally representative samples studies found women men engage extramarital sex

paleoanthropology genetic studies offer two perspectives monogamy evolved human species paleoanthropologists offer tentative evidence monogamy may evolved early human history whereas genetic studies show monogamy evolved much recently less years ago
paleoanthropological estimates time frame evolution monogamy primarily based level sexual dimorphism seen fossil record general reduced malemale competition seen monogamous mating results reduced sexual dimorphism according reno et al sexual dimorphism australopithecus afarensis human ancestor approximately million years ago within modern human range based dental postcranial morphology although careful say indicates monogamous mating early hominids authors say reduced levels sexual dimorphism afarensis imply monogamy less probable polygyny however gordon green richmond claim examining postcranial remains afarensis sexually dimorphic modern humans chimps levels closer orangutans gorillas furthermore homo habilis living approximately mya sexually dimorphic early hominid plavcan van schaik conclude examination controversy stating overall sexual dimorphism australopithecines indicative behavioral implications mating systems

varieties monogamy biologyedit
recent discoveries led biologists talk three varieties monogamy social monogamy sexual monogamy genetic monogamy distinction three important modern understanding monogamy
monogamous pairs animals always sexually exclusive many animals form pairs mate raise offspring regularly engage sexual activities partners primary mate called extrapair copulation sometimes extrapair sexual activities lead offspring genetic tests frequently show offspring raised monogamous pair come female mating extrapair male partner discoveries led biologists adopt new ways talking monogamy
social monogamy refers male females social living arrangement eg shared use territory behaviour indicative social pair andor proximity male female without inferring sexual interactions reproductive patterns humans social monogamy equals monogamous marriage sexual monogamy defined exclusive sexual relationship female male based observations sexual interactions finally term genetic monogamy used dna analyses confirm femalemale pair reproduce exclusively combination terms indicates examples levels relationships coincide eg sociosexual sociogenetic monogamy describe corresponding social sexual social genetic monogamous relationships respectively reichard page
whatever makes pair animals socially monogamous necessarily make sexually genetically monogamous social monogamy sexual monogamy genetic monogamy occur different combinations
social monogamy always involve marriage humans married couple almost always socially monogamous couple couples choose cohabit without getting married also socially monogamous popular science author matt ridley book red queen sex evolution human nature described human mating system monogamy plagued adultery
serial monogamyedit
serial monogamy mating practice individuals may engage sequential monogamous pairings terms humans men women marry another partner ceasing married previous partner
one theory pattern pacifies elite men equalizes reproductive success called male compromise theory serial monogamy may effectively resemble polygyny reproductive consequences men able utilize one womans reproductive lifespan repeated marriages
serial monogamy may also refer sequential sexual relationships irrespective marital status pair humans may remain sexually exclusive monogamous relationship ended may go form new exclusive pairing different partner pattern serial monogamy common among people western cultures
reproductive successedit
evolutionary theory predicts males would apt seek mating partners females obtain higher reproductive benefits strategy accordingly males developed many behavior strategies allow acquire reproductively capable sexual partners therefore order monopolize periods one females reproductive life span without considered polygamous thus breaking social norms monogamous society males try remarry women younger study done found significant difference ages remarried men women men longer reproductive window
breakupedit
serial monogamy always closely linked divorce practices whenever procedures obtaining divorce simple easy serial monogamy found divorce continued become accessible individuals availed many go remarry barry schwartz author paradox choice less suggests western cultures inundation choice devalued relationships based lifetime commitments singularity choice suggested however high mortality rates centuries past accomplished much result divorce enabling remarriage one spouse thus serial monogamy
mating systemedit
monogamy one several mating systems observed animals however pair animals may socially monogamous necessarily make sexually genetically monogamous social monogamy sexual monogamy genetic monogamy occur different combinations
social monogamy refers overtly observed living arrangement whereby male female share territory engage behaviour indicative social pair imply particular sexual fidelity reproductive pattern extent social monogamy observed animals varies across taxa percent avian species socially monogamous compared percent mammalian species percent primate species social monogamy also observed reptiles fish insects
sexual monogamy defined exclusive sexual relationship female male based observations sexual interactions however scientific analyses test paternity example dna paternity testing fluorescent pigment powder tracing females track physical contact type analysis uncover reproductively successful sexual pairings physical contact genetic monogamy refers dna analyses confirming femalemale pair reproduce exclusively
incidence sexual monogamy appears quite rare parts animal kingdom becoming clear even animals overtly socially monogamous engage extrapair copulations example birds socially monogamous average percent baby birds nest sired someone resident male patricia adair gowaty estimated different species socially monogamous songbirds sexually monogamous offspring far successful male female members social pair contribute food resources
example seen scientists studied red winged blackbirds birds known remaining monogamous relationships course mating season course study researchers gave select males vasectomies mating season male birds behaved like every season establishing territory finding mate attempting make baby birds despite apparent social monogamy female birds whose partners surgically altered still became pregnant indicating overt social monogamy predict sexual fidelity babies cared sterile adoptive fathers
highest known frequency reproductively successful extrapair copulations found among fairywrens malurus splendens malurus cyaneus percent chicks fathered males outside supposed breeding pair discordantly low level genetic monogamy surprise biologists zoologists social monogamy longer assumed determine genes distributed species
elacatinus also widely known neon gobies also exhibit social monogamy hetereosexual pairs fish belonging genus elacatinus remain closely associated reproductive nonreproductive periods often reside cleaning station serve client fish
