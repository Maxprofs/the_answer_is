water vascular system
echinoderms possess unique water vascular system network fluidfilled canals derived coelom body cavity function gas exchange feeding sensory reception locomotion system varies different classes echinoderm typically opens exterior sievelike madreporite aboral upper surface animal madreporite linked slender duct stone canal extends ring canal encircles mouth oesophagus radial canals extend along arms asteroids adjoin test ambulacral areas echinoids short lateral canals branch radial canals one ending ampulla part ampulla protrude pore pair pores sea urchins exterior known podium tube foot water vascular system assists distribution nutrients throughout animals body obviously expressed tube feet extended contracted redistribution fluid foot internal sac

organs
echinoderms possess simple digestive system varies according animals diet starfish mostly carnivorous mouth oesophagus twopart stomach intestine rectum anus located centre aboral body surface many species large cardiac stomach everted digest food outside body species whole food items molluscs may ingested brittle stars blind gut intestine anus varying diets expel food waste mouth sea urchins herbivores use specialised mouthparts graze tear chew algae sometimes animal vegetable material oesophagus large stomach rectum anus apex test sea cucumbers mostly detritivores sorting sediment buccal tentacles modified tube feet sand mud accompanies food simple gut long coiled intestine capacious cloaca crinoids passive suspension feeders catching plankton outstretched arms boluses mucustrapped food passed mouth linked anus loop consisting short oesophagus longer intestine

regeneration
many echinoderms remarkable powers regeneration many species routinely autotomize regenerate arms viscera sea cucumbers often discharge parts internal organs perceive threatened discharged organs tissues regenerated course several months sea urchins constantly replacing spines lost damage sea stars sea lilies readily lose regenerate arms cases single severed arm cannot grow new starfish absence least part disc however species single arm survive develop complete individual species arms intentionally detached purpose asexual reproduction periods lost digestive tracts sea cucumbers live stored nutrients absorb dissolved organic matter directly water

robust larval growth responsible many echinoderms used popular model organisms developmental biology
reproduction
sexual reproduction
echinoderms become sexually mature approximately two three years depending species environmental conditions nearly gonochoric though species hermaphroditic eggs sperm cells typically released open water fertilization takes place release sperm eggs synchronised species usually regard lunar cycle species individuals may aggregate reproductive season thereby increasing likelihood successful fertilisation internal fertilisation currently observed three species sea star three brittle stars deep water sea cucumber even abyssal depths light penetrates synchronisation reproductive activity echinoderms surprisingly frequent
echinoderms brood eggs especially common cold water species planktonic larvae might able find sufficient food retained eggs usually number supplied large yolks nourish developing embryos starfish female may carry eggs special pouches arms arched body even cardiac stomach many brittle stars hermaphrodites egg brooding quite common usually takes place special chambers oral surfaces sometimes ovary coelom used starfish brittle stars direct development without passing bilateral larval stage usually takes place sea urchins one species sand dollar carry eggs cavities near anus holding place spines sea cucumbers use buccal tentacles transfer eggs underside back retained small number species eggs retained coelom develop viviparously later emerging ruptures body wall species crinoid embryos develop special breeding bags eggs held sperm released male happens find
asexual reproduction
one species seastar ophidiaster granifer reproduces asexually parthenogenesis certain asterozoans adults reproduce asexually mature time reproduce sexually species asexual reproduction transverse fission disc splitting two regrowth lost disc area missing arms occur individual may arms varying lengths though species least part disc needed complete regeneration species sea stars single severed arm grow complete individual period several months least species actively use method asexual reproduction fracture develops lower surface arm arm pulls free body holds onto substrate process period regrowth tiny arms one large arm thus often referred comets
asexual reproduction transverse fission also observed adult sea cucumbers holothuria parvula uses method frequently individual splitting two little front midpoint two halves regenerate missing organs period several months missing genital organs often slow develop
larvae echinoderm species capable asexual reproduction long known occur among starfish brittle stars recently observed sea cucumber sand dollar sea urchin species belong four major classes echinoderms except crinozoans asexual reproduction planktonic larvae occurs numerous modes may autotomise parts develop secondary larvae grow buds undergo paratomy parts autotomised buds may develop directly fully formed larvae may develop gastrula even blastula stage parts develop new larvae vary preoral hood mound like structure mouth side body wall posterolateral arms rear ends
process cloning cost borne larva resources well development time larvae observed undergo process food plentiful temperature conditions optimal also suggested cloning may occur make use tissues normally lost metamorphosis recent research shown larvae sand dollars clone detect predators sensing dissolved fish mucus asexual reproduction produces many smaller larvae escape better planktivorous fish
larval development
development echinoderm begins bilaterally symmetrical embryo coeloblastula developing first gastrulation marks opening second mouth places echinoderms within deuterostomes mesoderm host skeleton migrates inwards secondary body cavity coelom forms partitioning three body cavities larvae mostly planktonic species eggs retained inside female larvae also brooded female
larvae echinoderms pass number stages specific names derived taxonomic names adults appearance example sea urchin echinopluteus larva brittle star ophiopluteus larva starfish bipinnaria larva later develops multiarmed brachiolaria larva sea cucumber larva auricularia crinoid one vitellaria larvae bilaterally symmetrical bands cilia swim usually known pluteus larvae arms fully developed settle seabed undergo metamorphosis larval arms gut degenerate left hand side larva develops oral surface juvenile right side becomes aboral surface stage bilateral symmetry lost radial symmetry develops
planktotrophic larva considered ancestral larval type echinoderms million years larval evolution species whose development known lecithotrophic larval type provision yolksac means smaller numbers eggs produced larvae shorter development period smaller dispersal potential greater chance survival seems evolutionary trend towards lowerrisklowergain strategy direct development
distribution habitat
echinoderms globally distributed almost depths latitudes environments ocean reach highest diversity reef environments also widespread shallow shores around poles refugia crinoids abundant throughout deep ocean bottomdwelling burrowing sea cucumbers common sometimes accounting organisms almost echinoderms benthic live sea floor sealilies swim great velocity brief periods time deepsea sea cucumbers fully floating crinoids pseudoplanktonic attaching floating logs debris although behaviour exercised extensively paleozoic competition organisms barnacles restricted extent behaviour
larvae echinoderms especially starfish sea urchins pelagic aid ocean currents transported great distances reinforcing global distribution phylum
mode life
locomotion
echinoderms primarily use tube feet move sea urchins also use spines tube feet typically tip shaped like suction pad vacuum created contraction muscles along stickiness provided secretion mucus provides adhesion waves tube feet contractions relaxations move along adherent surface animal moves slowly along
brittle stars agile echinoderms raising discs taking strides moving two forward arms grip substrate tube feet two side arms row hindermost arm trails animal moves jerks arm spines provide traction moving among objects supple arms coil around things species creep around pointed tube feet starfish extend tube feet intended direction travel grip substrate suction feet drawn backwards movement multiple tube feet coordinated waves moves animal forward progress slow burrowing starfish points rather suckers tube feet able glide across seabed faster rate
sea urchins use tube feet move around similar way starfish also use articulated spines push lever along lift oral surfaces substrate sea urchin overturned extend tube feet one ambulacral area far enough bring within reach substrate successively attach feet adjoining area righted species bore rock usually grinding away surface mouthparts
sea cucumbers generally sluggish animals many move surface burrow sand mud using peristaltic movements short tube feet surface creep along manner starfish species drag along means buccal tentacles others expand contract body rhythmically flex swim many live cracks hollows burrows hardly move deep water species pelagic float water webbed papillae forming sails fins
majority crinoids motile sea lilies sessile attached hard substrates stalks stems bend arms roll unroll limit sea lilys movement although species relocate seabed crawling sea feathers unattached usually live crevices corals inside sponges arms visible part sea feathers emerge night perch nearby eminences better exploit foodbearing current many species walk across seabed raising body help arms many also swim arms largely sedentary seldom moving far chosen place concealment
feeding
modes feeding vary greatly different echinoderm taxa crinoids brittle stars tend passive filterfeeders enmeshing suspended particles passing water sea urchins grazers sea cucumbers deposit feeders majority starfish active hunters
crinoids suspension feeders spread arms wide catch particles floating past caught tube feet pinnules moved ambulacral grooves wrapped mucus conveyed mouth cilia lining grooves exact dietary requirements crinoids little researched laboratory fed diatoms
basket stars suspension feeders raising branched arms collect zooplankton brittle stars use several methods feeding though usually one predominates suspension feeders securing food particles mucus strands spines tube feet raised arms others scavengers feeders detritus others voracious carnivores able lasso waterborne prey sudden encirclement flexible arms limbs bend disc transfer food jaws mouth
many sea urchins feed algae often scraping thin layer algae covering surfaces rocks specialised mouthparts known aristotles lantern species devour smaller organisms may catch tube feet may also feed dead fish animal matter sand dollars may perform suspension feeding feed phytoplankton detritus algal pieces bacterial layer surrounding grains sand
many sea cucumbers mobile deposit suspension feeders using buccal podia actively capture food stuffing particles individually buccal cavities others ingest large quantities sediment absorb organic matter pass indigestible mineral particles guts way disturb process large volumes substrate often leaving characteristic ridges sediment seabed sea cucumbers live infaunally burrows anteriorend anus surface swallowing sediment passing gut burrowers live anteriorend wait detritus fall entrances burrows rake debris surface nearby buccal podia
nearly starfish detritivores carnivores though suspension feeders small fish landing upper surface may captured pedicilaria dead animal matter may scavenged main prey items living invertebrates mostly bivalve molluscs feed one starfish moves attaches tube feet exerts pressure valves arching back small gap valves formed starfish inserts part stomach prey excretes digestive enzymes slowly liquefies soft body parts adductor muscle shellfish relaxes stomach inserted digestion complete stomach returned usual position starfish liquefied bivalve meal inside everted stomach process used starfish feed sponges sea anemones corals detritus algal films
defense mechanisms
