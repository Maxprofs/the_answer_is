== evolution of the glyph ==
the evolution of the modern western glyph for five cannot be neatly traced back to the indian system as for the numbers 1 to 4 the kushana and gupta empires in what is now india had among themselves several different glyphs which bear no resemblance to the modern glyph the nagari and punjabi took these glyphs and all came up with glyphs that are similar to a lowercase h rotated 180 the ghubar arabs transformed the glyph in several different ways producing glyphs that were more similar to the numbers 4 or 3 than to the number 5
it was from those characters that europeans finally came up with the modern 5 though from purely graphical evidence it would be much easier to conclude that the modern symbol came from the khmer the khmer glyph develops from the kushana/ndhra/gupta numeral its shape looking like the modern version with an extended swirled tail
while the shape of the 5 character has an ascender in most modern typefaces in typefaces with text figures the character usually has a descender as for example in
