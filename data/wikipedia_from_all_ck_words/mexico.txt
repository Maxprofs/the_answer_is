mexico (/mksko/ spanish mxico [mexiko]) officially the united mexican states (spanish estados unidos mexicanos listen ) is a federal republic in north america it is bordered on the north by the united states on the south and west by the pacific ocean on the southeast by guatemala belize and the caribbean sea and on the east by the gulf of mexico covering almost two million square kilometres (over 760,000 sq mi) mexico is the fifth largest country in the americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world with an estimated population of over 120 million it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous spanish-speaking country in the world and the second most populous country in latin america mexico is a federation comprising thirty-one states and a federal district its capital and largest city
pre-columbian mexico was home to many advanced mesoamerican civilizations such as the olmec toltec teotihuacan zapotec maya and aztec before first contact with europeans in 1521 the spanish empire conquered and colonized the territory from its base in mexico-tenochtitlan which was administered as the viceroyalty of new spain three centuries later this territory became mexico following recognition in 1821 after the colony's mexican war of independence the tumultuous post-independence period was characterized by economic instability and many political changes
the mexican-american war (1846-1848) led to the territorial cession of the extensive northern borderlands one-third of its territory to the united states the pastry war the franco-mexican war a civil war two empires and a domestic dictatorship occurred through the 19th century the dictatorship was overthrown in the mexican revolution of 1910 which culminated with the promulgation of the 1917 constitution and the emergence of the country's current political system mexico has the fifteenth largest nominal gdp and the eleventh largest gdp by purchasing power parity the mexican economy is strongly linked to those of its north american free trade agreement (nafta) partners especially the united states mexico was the first latin american member of the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd (since 1994) it is classified as an upper-middle income country by the world bank and a newly industrialized country by several analysts by 2050 mexico could become the world's fifth or seventh largest economy the country is considered both a regional power and middle power and is often identified as an emerging global power due to its rich culture and history mexico ranks first in the americas and sixth in the world by number of unesco world heritage sites in 2010 it was the tenth most visited country in the world with 22.5 million international arrivals annually mexico is a member of the un the wto the g20 the uniting for consensus and is an observer of the organisation internationale de la francophonie since 2014
== etymology ==
mxihco is the nahuatl term for the heartland of the aztec empire namely the valley of mexico and its people the mexica and surrounding territories this became the future state of mexico as a division of new spain prior to independence (compare latium) it is generally considered to be a toponym for the valley which became the primary ethnonym for the aztec triple alliance as a result or vice versa after new spain won independence from spain representatives decided to name the new country after its capital mexico city this was founded in 1524 on top of the ancient mexica capital of mexico-tenochtitlan
traditionally the name tenochtitlan was thought to come from nahuatl tetl [tet] ("rock") and nchtli [notti] ("prickly pear") and is often thought to mean among the prickly pears [growing among] rocks however one attestation in the late 16th-century manuscript known as the bancroft dialogues suggests the second vowel was short so that the true etymology remains uncertain
the suffix -co is the nahuatl locative making the word a place name beyond that the etymology is uncertain it has been suggested that it is derived from mextli or mxihtli a secret name for the god of war and patron of the mexica huitzilopochtli in which case mxihco means place where huitzilopochtli lives another hypothesis suggests that mxihco derives from a portmanteau of the nahuatl words for moon (mtztli) and navel (xctli) this meaning ("place at the center of the moon") might refer to tenochtitlan's position in the middle of lake texcoco the system of interconnected lakes of which texcoco formed the center had the form of a rabbit which the mesoamericans pareidolically associated with the moon still another hypothesis suggests that the word is derived from mctli the goddess of maguey
the name of the city-state was transliterated to spanish as mxico with the phonetic value of the letter x in medieval spanish which represented the voiceless postalveolar fricative [] this sound as well as the voiced postalveolar fricative [] represented by a j evolved into a voiceless velar fricative [x] during the 16th century this led to the use of the variant mjico in many publications in spanish most notably in spain whereas in mexico and most other spanishspeaking countries mxico was the preferred spelling in recent years the real academia espaola which regulates the spanish language determined that both variants are acceptable in spanish but that the normative recommended spelling is mxico the majority of publications in all spanish-speaking countries now adhere to the new norm even though the alternative variant is still occasionally used in english the x in mexico represents neither the original nor the current sound but the consonant cluster [ks]
the official name of the country has changed as the form of government has changed on three occasions (13251521 18211823 and 18631867) the country was known as imperio mexicano (mexican empire) all three federal constitutions (1824 1857 and 1917 the current constitution) used the name estados unidos mexicanosor the variant estados-unidos mexicanos all of which have been translated as united mexican states the phrase repblica mexicana mexican republic was used in the 1836 constitutional laws on november 22 2012 president felipe caldern sent to the mexican congress a piece of legislation to change the country's name officially to simply mexico to be implemented the bill needed to be passed by both houses of congress as well as a majority of mexico's 31 state legislatures as this legislation was proposed just a week before caldern turned power over to enrique pea nieto caldern's critics saw this as a symbolic gesture
== history ==
=== ancient cultures ===
the earliest human artifacts in mexico are chips of stone tools found near campfire remains in the valley of mexico and radiocarbon-dated to circa 10,000 years ago mexico is the site of the domestication of maize and beans which produced an agricultural surplus this enabled the transition from paleo-indian hunter-gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 5000 bce
in the subsequent formative eras maize cultivation and cultural traits such as a mythological and religious complex and a vigesimal numeric system were diffused from the mexican cultures to the rest of the mesoamerican culture area in this period villages became more dense in terms of population becoming socially stratified with an artisan class and developing into chiefdoms the most powerful rulers had religious and political power organizing construction of large ceremonial centers developed
among the earliest complex civilizations in mexico was the olmec culture which flourished on the gulf coast from around 1500 bce olmec cultural traits diffused through mexico into other formative-era cultures in chiapas oaxaca and the valley of mexico the formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions as well as artistic and architectural complexes
in the subsequent pre-classical period the maya and zapotec civilizations developed complex centers at calakmul and monte albn respectively during this period the first true mesoamerican writing systems were developed in the epi-olmec and the zapotec cultures the mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the classic maya hieroglyphic script
in central mexico the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of teotihuacan which formed a military and commercial empire whose political influence stretched south into the maya area as well as north teotihuacan with a population of more than 150,000 people had some of the largest pyramidal structures in the pre-columbian americas after the collapse of teotihuacn around 600 ce competition ensued between several important political centers in central mexico such as xochicalco and cholula at this time during the epi-classic nahua peoples began moving south into mesoamerica from the north and became politically and culturally dominant in central mexico as they displaced speakers of oto-manguean languages
==== post-classic period (7001519 ad) ====
during the early post-classic central mexico was dominated by the toltec culture oaxaca by the mixtec and the lowland maya area had important centers at chichn itz and mayapn towards the end of the post-classic period the mexica established dominance
alexander von humboldt originated the modern usage of aztec as a collective term applied to all the people linked by trade custom religion and language to the mexica state and xcn tlahtlyn the triple alliance in 1843 with the publication of the work of william h prescott it was adopted by most of the world including 19th-century mexican scholars who considered it a way to distinguish present-day mexicans from pre-conquest mexicans this usage has been the subject of debate since the late 20th century
the aztec empire was an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands it was satisfied with the payment of tributes from them it was a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected for example the southern peripheral zones of xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center the hegemonic nature of the aztec empire was demonstrated by their restoration of local rulers to their former position after their city-state was conquered the aztec did not interfere in local affairs as long as the tributes were paid
the aztec of central mexico built a tributary empire covering most of central mexico the aztec were noted for practicing human sacrifice on a large scale along with this practice they avoided killing enemies on the battlefield their warring casualty rate was far lower than that of their spanish counterparts whose principal objective was immediate slaughter during battle this distinct mesoamerican cultural tradition of human sacrifice ended with the spanish conquest in the 16th century over the next centuries mexican indigenous cultures were gradually subjected to spanish colonial rule
=== spanish conquest (1519) ===
the spanish first learned of mexico during the juan de grijalva expedition of 1518 the natives kept repeating colua colua and mexico mexico but we [explorers] did not know what colua or mexico meant until encountering montezuma's governor at the mouth of the rio de las banderas the spanish conquest of the aztec empire began in february 1519 when hernn corts arrived at the port in veracruz with ca 500 conquistadores after taking control of that city he moved on to the aztec capital in his search for gold and other riches corts decided to invade and conquer the aztec empire
when the spaniards arrived the ruler of the aztec empire was moctezuma ii who was later killed his successor and brother cuitlhuac took control of the aztec empire but was among the first to fall from the first smallpox epidemic in the area a short time later unintentionally introduced by spanish conquerors among whom smallpox was endemic the infectious disease ravaged mesoamerica in the 1520s it killed more than 3 million aztecs as they had no immunity other sources however mentioned that the death toll of the aztecs might have reached 15 million (out of a population of less than 30 million) severely weakened the aztec empire was easily defeated by corts and his forces on his second return
smallpox was a devastating disease it generally killed aztecs but not spaniards who as europeans had already been exposed to it in their cities for centuries and therefore had developed acquired immunity the deaths caused by smallpox are believed to have triggered a rapid growth of christianity in mexico and the americas at first the aztecs believed the epidemic was a punishment from an angry god but they later accepted their fate and no longer resisted the spanish rule many of the surviving aztecs believed that smallpox could be credited to the superiority of the christian god which resulted in their acceptance of catholicism and yielding to the spanish rule throughout mexico
the territory became part of the spanish empire under the name of new spain mexico city was systematically rebuilt by corts following the fall of tenochtitlan in 1521 much of the identity traditions and architecture of mexico developed during the 300-year colonial period
=== colonial period (15191821) ===
the capture of tenochtitlan marked the beginning of a 300-year-long colonial period during which mexico was known as new spain
==== period of the conquest (15211650) ====
contrary to a widespread misconception spain did not conquer all of the aztec empire when cortes took tenochtitlan it required another two centuries to complete the conquest rebellions broke out within the old empire and wars continued with other native peoples after the fall of tenochtitlan spain required decades of sporadic warfare to subdue the rest of mesoamerica particularly fierce was the chichimeca war (15761606) and the tepehun revolt (16161620) in the north
economics the council of indies and the mendicant establishments which arose in mesoamerica as early as 1524 labored to generate capital for the crown of spain and convert the indian populations to catholicism during this period and the following colonial periods the sponsorship of mendicant friars and a process of religious syncretism combined the pre-hispanic cultures with spanish socio-religious tradition
the resulting hodgepodge of culture was a pluriethnic state that relied on the repartimiento a system of peasant republic of indians labor that carried out any necessary work thus the existing feudal system of pre-hispanic mesoamerican culture was replaced by the encomienda feudal-style system of spain probably adapted to the pre-hispanic tradition this in turn was replaced in the 19th century by a debt-based inscription of labor its burden was a catalyst for political revitalization movements and prompted the revolution that ended colonial new spain in 1821
evolution of the race during the three centuries of colonial rule fewer than 700,000 spaniards most of them men settled in mexico the settlers intermarried with indigenous women fathering the mixed race (mestizo) descendants who today constitute the great majority of mexico's population
==== the colonial period (16501821) ====
during this period mexico was part of the much larger viceroyalty of new spain which included cuba puerto rico central america as far south as costa rica florida the southwestern united states and the philippines spain during the 16th century focused its energies on areas with dense populations that had produced pre-columbian civilizations since these areas could provide the settlers with a disciplined labor force and a population to catechize
territories populated by nomadic peoples were harder to conquer and though the spanish did explore a good part of north america seeking the fabled el dorado they made no concerted effort to settle the northern desert regions in what is now the united states until the end of the 16th century (santa fe 1598)
colonial law with spanish roots but original native features were introduced creating a hierarchy between local jurisdiction (the cabildos) and the crown's whereby upper administrative offices were closed to the natives even those of pure spanish blood administration was based on the racial separation of the population among republics of spaniards indians and mestizos autonomous and directly dependent on the king himself
from an economic point of view new spain was administered principally for the benefit of the empire and its military and defensive efforts (mexico provided more than half of the empire's taxes and supported the administration of all north and central america) competition with spain was discouraged to the extent that activities like cultivation of grapes and olives introduced by cortez himself was banned out of fear that these crops would compete with spain's
in order to protect mexico from the attacks of english french and dutch pirates as well as the crown's revenue only two ports were open to foreign tradeveracruz on the atlantic and acapulco on the pacific the pirates attacked plundered and ravaged several cities like campeche (1557) veracruz (1568) and alvarado (1667)
education was encouraged by the crown from the very beginning and mexico boasts the first primary school (texcoco 1523) first university (1551) and the first printing house (1524) of the americas indigenous languages were studied mainly by the religious orders during the first centuries and became official languages in the so-called republic of indians only to be outlawed and ignored after independence by the prevailing spanish-speaking creoles
mexico produced important cultural achievements during the colonial period like the literature of sor juana ins de la cruz and ruiz de alarcn as well as cathedrals civil monuments forts and colonial cities such as puebla mexico city quertaro zacatecas and others today part of unesco's world heritage
the syncretism between indigenous and spanish cultures in new spain gave birth to many of today's mexican cultural traits like tequila (first distilled in the 16th century) mariachi (18th) jarabe (17th) charros (17th) and mexican cuisine a mixture of european and indigenous ingredients and techniques
==== independence from spain (1821) ====
on september 16 1810 a loyalist revolt against the ruling junta was declared by priest miguel hidalgo y costilla in the small town of dolores guanajuato the first insurgent group was formed by hidalgo the spanish viceregal army captain ignacio allende the militia captain juan aldama and la corregidora josefa ortiz de domnguez hidalgo and some of his soldiers were captured and executed by firing squad in chihuahua on july 31 1811 following his death the leadership was assumed by priest jos mara morelos who occupied key southern cities
in 1813 the congress of chilpancingo was convened and on november 6 signed the solemn act of the declaration of independence of northern america morelos was captured and executed on december 22 1815
in subsequent years the insurgency was near collapse but in 1820 viceroy juan ruiz de apodaca sent an army under the criollo general agustn de iturbide against the troops of vicente guerrero instead iturbide approached guerrero to join forces and on august 24 1821 representatives of the spanish crown and iturbide signed the treaty of crdoba and the declaration of independence of the mexican empire which recognized the independence of mexico under the terms of the plan of iguala
=== birth of mexico (1821) ===
==== territorial losses and jurez reforms (1821-1876) ====
agustn de iturbide immediately proclaimed himself emperor of the first mexican empire a revolt against him in 1823 established the united mexican states in 1824 a republican constitution was drafted and guadalupe victoria became the first president of the newly born country in 1829 president guerrero abolished slavery the first decades of the post-independence period were marked by economic instability which led to the pastry war in 1836 there was constant strife between liberales supporters of a federal form of government and conservadores who proposed a hierarchical form of government
during this period the frontier borderlands to the north became quite isolated from the government in mexico city and its monopolistic economic policies caused suffering with limited trade the people had difficulty meeting tax payments and resented the central government's actions in collecting customs resentment built up from california to texas both the mission system and the presidios had collapsed after the spanish withdrew from the colony causing great disruption especially in alta california and new mexico the people in the borderlands had to raise local militias to protect themselves from hostile native americans these areas developed in different directions from the center of the country
wanting to stabilize and develop the frontier mexico encouraged immigration into present-day texas as they were unable to persuade people from central mexico to move into those areas they allowed for religious freedom for the new settlers who were primarily protestant english speakers from the united states within several years the anglos far outnumbered the tejano in the area itinerant traders traveled through the area working by free market principles the tejano grew more separate from the government and due to its neglect many supported the idea of independence and joined movements to that end collaborating with the english-speaking americans
general antonio lpez de santa anna a centralist and two-time dictator approved the siete leyes in 1836 a radical amendment that institutionalized the centralized form of government when he suspended the 1824 constitution civil war spread across the country three new governments declared independence the republic of texas the republic of the rio grande and the republic of yucatn
texas successfully achieved independence as a republic in 1836 and joined the united states a border dispute between the us and mexico led to the mexican-american war which began in 1846 and lasted for two years many southerners intended that slavery should be extended to the west in these newly acquired territories but the united states generally would not permit it except in texas the war was settled via the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo mexico was forced to give up more than one-third of its land to the u.s. including alta california new mexico and the disputed parts of texas a much smaller transfer of territory in what is today southern arizona and southwestern new mexico known as the gadsden purchase occurred in 1854
the caste war of yucatn the mayan uprising that began in 1847 was one of the most successful modern native american revolts maya rebels or cruzob maintained relatively independent enclaves in the peninsula until the 1930s
dissatisfaction with santa anna's return to power led to the liberal plan of ayutla initiating an era known as la reforma the new constitution drafted in 1857 established a secular state federalism as the form of government and several freedoms as the conservadores refused to recognize it the reform war began in 1858 during which both groups had their own governments the war ended in 1861 with victory by the liberals led by president benito jurez who was amerindian
in the 1860s mexico was occupied by france which established the second mexican empire under the rule of the habsburg archduke ferdinand maximilian of austria with support from the roman catholic clergy and the conservadores the latter switched sides and joined the liberales maximilian surrendered was tried on june 14 1867 and was executed a few days later on june 19
==== porfiriato (18761910) ====
porfirio daz a republican general during the french intervention ruled mexico from 1876 to 1880 and then from 1884 to 1911 in five consecutive reelections period known as the porfiriato characterized by remarkable economic achievements investments in the arts and sciences but also of economic inequality and political repression
=== mexican revolution (19101929) ===
president daz announced in 1908 that he would retire in 1911 resulting in the development of new coalitions but then he ran for reelection anyway and in a show of u.s support daz and william howard taft planned a summit in el paso texas and ciudad jurez mexico for october 16 1909 an historic first meeting between a mexican and a u.s president and also the first time an american president would cross the border into mexico both sides agreed that the disputed chamizal strip connecting el paso to ciudad jurez would be considered neutral territory with no flags present during the summit but the meeting focused attention on this territory and resulted in assassination threats and other serious security concerns
on the day of the summit frederick russell burnham the celebrated scout and private c.r moore a texas ranger discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the el paso chamber of commerce building along the procession route and they disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of daz and taft both presidents were unharmed and the summit was held daz was re-elected in 1910 but alleged electoral fraud forced him into exile in france and sparked the 1910 mexican revolution initially led by francisco i madero
madero was elected president but overthrown and murdered in a coup d'tat two years later directed by conservative general victoriano huerta that event re-ignited the civil war involving figures such as francisco villa and emiliano zapata who formed their own forces a third force the constitutional army led by venustiano carranza managed to bring an end to the war and radically amended the 1857 constitution to include many of the social premises and demands of the revolutionaries into what was eventually called the 1917 constitution it is estimated that the war killed 900,000 of the 1910 population of 15 million
assassinated in 1920 carranza was succeeded by another revolutionary hero lvaro obregn who in turn was succeeded by plutarco elas calles obregn was reelected in 1928 but assassinated before he could assume power although this period is usually referred to as the mexican revolution it might also be termed a civil war since president daz (1909) narrowly escaped assassination and presidents francisco i madero (1913) venustiano carranza (1920) lvaro obregn (1928) and former revolutionary leaders emiliano zapata (1919) and pancho villa (1923) all were assassinated during this period
==== one-party rule (19292000) ====
in 1929 calles founded the national revolutionary party (pnr) later renamed the institutional revolutionary party (pri) and started a period known as the maximato which ended with the election of lzaro crdenas who implemented many economic and social reforms this included the mexican oil expropriation in march 1938 which nationalized the u.s and anglo-dutch oil company known as the mexican eagle petroleum company this movement would result in the creation of the state-owned mexican oil company known as pemex this sparked a diplomatic crisis with the countries whose citizens had lost businesses by crdenas radical measure but since then the company has played an important role in the economic development of mexico
between 1940 and 1980 mexico remained a poor country but experienced substantial economic growth that some historians call the mexican miracle although the economy continued to flourish social inequality remained a factor of discontent moreover the pri rule became increasingly authoritarian and at times oppressive (see the 1968 tlatelolco massacre which claimed the life of around 30800 protesters)
electoral reforms and high oil prices followed the administration of luis echeverra mismanagement of these revenues led to inflation and exacerbated the 1982 crisis that year oil prices plunged interest rates soared and the government defaulted on its debt president miguel de la madrid resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked inflation
in the 1980s the first cracks emerged in pri's monopolistic position in baja california ernesto ruffo appel was elected as governor in 1988 alleged electoral fraud prevented the leftist candidate cuauhtmoc crdenas from winning the national presidential elections giving carlos salinas de gortari the presidency and leading to massive protests in mexico city
salinas embarked on a program of neoliberal reforms which fixed the exchange rate controlled inflation and culminated with the signing of the north american free trade agreement (nafta) which came into effect on january 1 1994 the same day the zapatista army of national liberation (ezln) started a two-week-long armed rebellion against the federal government and has continued as a non-violent opposition movement against neoliberalism and globalization
==== end of one-party rule (2000present) ====
in december 1994 a month after salinas was succeeded by ernesto zedillo the mexican economy collapsed with a rapid rescue package authorized by the u.s president bill clinton and major macroeconomic reforms started by president zedillo the economy rapidly recovered and growth peaked at almost 7% by the end of 1999
in 2000 after 71 years the pri lost a presidential election to vicente fox of the opposition national action party (pan) in the 2006 presidential election felipe caldern from the pan was declared the winner with a very narrow margin over leftist politician andrs manuel lpez obrador of the party of the democratic revolution (prd) lpez obrador however contested the election and pledged to create an alternative government
after twelve years in 2012 the pri won the presidency again with the election of enrique pea nieto the governor of the state of mexico from 2005-2011 however he won with only a plurality of about 38% and did not have a legislative majority
== geography ==
mexico is located between latitudes 14 and 33n and longitudes 86 and 119w in the southern portion of north america almost all of mexico lies in the north american plate with small parts of the baja california peninsula on the pacific and cocos plates geophysically some geographers include the territory east of the isthmus of tehuantepec (around 12% of the total) within central america geopolitically however mexico is entirely considered part of north america along with canada and the united states
mexico's total area is 1,972,550 km2 (761,606 sq mi) making it the world's 14th largest country by total area and includes approximately 6,000 km2 (2,317 sq mi) of islands in the pacific ocean (including the remote guadalupe island and the revillagigedo islands) gulf of mexico caribbean and gulf of california from its farthest land points mexico is a little over 2,000 mi (3,219 km) in length
on its north mexico shares a 3,141 km (1,952 mi) border with the united states the meandering ro bravo del norte (known as the rio grande in the united states) defines the border from ciudad jurez east to the gulf of mexico a series of natural and artificial markers delineate the united states-mexican border west from ciudad jurez to the pacific ocean on its south mexico shares an 871 km (541 mi) border with guatemala and a 251 km (156 mi) border with belize
mexico is crossed from north to south by two mountain ranges known as sierra madre oriental and sierra madre occidental which are the extension of the rocky mountains from northern north america from east to west at the center the country is crossed by the trans-mexican volcanic belt also known as the sierra nevada a fourth mountain range the sierra madre del sur runs from michoacn to oaxaca
as such the majority of the mexican central and northern territories are located at high altitudes and the highest elevations are found at the trans-mexican volcanic belt pico de orizaba (5,700 m or 18,701 ft) popocatepetl (5,462 m or 17,920 ft) and iztaccihuatl (5,286 m or 17,343 ft) and the nevado de toluca (4,577 m or 15,016 ft) three major urban agglomerations are located in the valleys between these four elevations toluca greater mexico city and puebla
=== climate ===
the tropic of cancer effectively divides the country into temperate and tropical zones land north of the twenty-fourth parallel experiences cooler temperatures during the winter months south of the twenty-fourth parallel temperatures are fairly constant year round and vary solely as a function of elevation this gives mexico one of the world's most diverse weather systems
areas south of the 24th parallel with elevations up to 1,000 m (3,281 ft) (the southern parts of both coastal plains as well as the yucatn peninsula) have a yearly median temperature between 24 to 28 c (75.2 to 82.4 f) temperatures here remain high throughout the year with only a 5 c (9 f) difference between winter and summer median temperatures both mexican coasts except for the south coast of the bay of campeche and northern baja are also vulnerable to serious hurricanes during the summer and fall although low-lying areas north of the 24th parallel are hot and humid during the summer they generally have lower yearly temperature averages (from 20 to 24 c or 68.0 to 75.2 f) because of more moderate conditions during the winter
many large cities in mexico are located in the valley of mexico or in adjacent valleys with altitudes generally above 2,000 m (6,562 ft) this gives them a year-round temperate climate with yearly temperature averages (from 16 to 18 c or 60.8 to 64.4 f) and cool nighttime temperatures throughout the year
many parts of mexico particularly the north have a dry climate with sporadic rainfall while parts of the tropical lowlands in the south average more than 2,000 mm (78.7 in) of annual precipitation for example many cities in the north like monterrey hermosillo and mexicali experience temperatures of 40 c (104 f) or more in summer in the sonoran desert temperatures reach 50 c (122 f) or more
in 2012 mexico passed a comprehensive climate change bill a first in the developing world that has set a goal for the country to generate 35% of its energy from clean energy sources by 2024 and to cut emissions by 50% by 2050 from the level found in 2000
=== biodiversity ===
mexico is one of the 18 megadiverse countries of the world with over 200,000 different species mexico is home of 1012% of the world's biodiversity mexico ranks first in biodiversity in reptiles with 707 known species second in mammals with 438 species fourth in amphibians with 290 species and fourth in flora with 26,000 different species mexico is also considered the second country in the world in ecosystems and fourth in overall species approximately 2,500 species are protected by mexican legislations
in 2002 mexico had the second fastest rate of deforestation in the world second only to brazil the government has taken another initiative in the late 1990s to broaden the people's knowledge interest and use of the country's esteemed biodiversity through the comisin nacional para el conocimiento y uso de la biodiversidad
in mexico 170,000 square kilometres (65,637 sq mi) are considered protected natural areas. these include 34 biosphere reserves (unaltered ecosystems) 67 national parks 4 natural monuments (protected in perpetuity for their aesthetic scientific or historical value) 26 areas of protected flora and fauna 4 areas for natural resource protection (conservation of soil hydrological basins and forests) and 17 sanctuaries (zones rich in diverse species)
the discovery of the americas brought to the rest of the world many widely used food crops and edible plants some of mexico's native culinary ingredients include chocolate avocado tomato maize vanilla guava chayote epazote camote jcama nopal zucchini tejocote huitlacoche sapote mamey sapote many varieties of beans and an even greater variety of chiles such as the habanero and the jalapeo most of these names come from indigenous languages like nahuatl
because of its high biodiversity mexico has also been a frequent site of bioprospecting by international research bodies the first highly successful instance being the discovery in 1947 of the tuber barbasco (dioscorea composita) which has a high content of diosgenin revolutionizing the production of synthetic hormones in the 1950s and 1960s and eventually leading to the invention of combined oral contraceptive pills

=== law enforcement ===
public security is enacted at the three levels of government each of which has different prerogatives and responsibilities local and state police departments are primarily in charge of law enforcement whereas the mexican federal police are in charge of specialized duties all levels report to the secretara de seguridad pblica (secretary of public security) the general attorney's office (procuradura general de la repblica pgr) is the executive power's agency in charge of investigating and prosecuting crimes at the federal level mainly those related to drug and arms trafficking espionage and bank robberies the pgr operates the federal investigations agency (agencia federal de investigacin afi) an investigative and preventive agency
while the government generally respects the human rights of its citizens serious abuses of power have been reported in security operations in the southern part of the country and in indigenous communities and poor urban neighborhoods the national human rights commission has had little impact in reversing this trend engaging mostly in documentation but failing to use its powers to issue public condemnations to the officials who ignore its recommendations by law all defendants have the rights that assure them fair trials and human treatment however the system is overburdened and overwhelmed with several problems
despite the efforts of the authorities to fight crime and fraud most mexicans have low confidence in the police or the judicial system and therefore few crimes are actually reported by the citizens the global integrity index which measures the existence and effectiveness of national anti-corruption mechanisms rated mexico 31st behind kenya thailand and russia in 2008 president caldern proposed a major reform of the judicial system which was approved by the congress of the union which included oral trials the presumption of innocence for defendants the authority of local police to investigate crimeuntil then a prerogative of special police unitsand several other changes intended to speed up trials

president felipe caldern made abating organized crime one of the top priorities of his administration by deploying military personnel to cities where drug cartels operate this move was criticized by the opposition parties and the national human rights commission for escalating the violence but its effects have been positively evaluated by the us state department's bureau for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs as having obtained unprecedented results with many important successes
since president felipe caldern launched a crackdown against cartels in 2006 more than 28,000 alleged criminals have been killed of the total drug-related violence 4% are innocent people mostly by-passers and people trapped in between shootings 90% accounts for criminals and 6% for military personnel and police officers in october 2007 president caldern and us president george w bush announced the mrida initiative a plan of law enforcement cooperation between the two countries

the challenges include water scarcity in the northern and central parts of the country inadequate water service quality (drinking water quality 55% of mexicans receiving water only intermittently according to results of the 2000 census) poor technical and commercial efficiency of most utilities (with an average level of non-revenue water of 51% in 2003) an insufficient share of wastewater receiving treatment (36% in 2006) and still inadequate access in rural areas in addition to on-going investments to expand access the government has embarked on a large investment program to improve wastewater treatment
== demographics ==
the recently conducted 2010 census showed a population of 112,336,538 making it the most populous spanish-speaking country in the world between 2005 and 2010 the mexican population grew at an average of 1.70% per year up from 1.16% per year between 2000 and 2005
mexico is ethnically diverse the various indigenous peoples and european immigrants are united under a single national identity the core part of mexican national identity is formed on the basis of a synthesis of european culture with indigenous cultures in a process known as mestizaje alluding to the mixed biological origins of the majority of mexicans mexican politicians and reformers such as jos vasconcelos and manuel gamio were instrumental in building a mexican national identity on the concept of mestizaje
since the mestizo identity promoted by the government is more of a cultural identity than a biological one it has achieved a strong influence in the country with a good number of biologically white people identifying with it leading to being considered mestizos in mexico's demographic investigations and censuses due the ethnic criteria having its base on cultural traits rather than biological ones a similar situation occurs regarding the distinctions between indigenous peoples and mestizos while the term mestizo is sometimes used in english with the meaning of a person with mixed indigenous and european blood this usage does not conform to the mexican social reality where a person of pure indigenous genetic heritage would be considered mestizo either by rejecting his indigenous culture or by not speaking an indigenous language and a person with a very low percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage
the term mestizo itself albeit often used in literature about mexican social identities carries a variety of socio-cultural economic racial and biological meanings for this reason it has been deemed too imprecise to be used for ethnic classification and has been abandoned in mexican censuses
the category of indgena (indigenous) can be defined narrowly according to linguistic criteria including only speakers of one of mexico's 62 indigenous languages or people who self-identify as having an indigenous cultural background according to the national commission for the development of indigenous peoples in 2005 there were 10.1 million mexicans who spoke an indigenous language and claimed indigenous heritage representing 9.8% of the total population another source the 2010 census found that 14.86% of the population self-identified as indigenous
mexico is home to the largest number of u.s citizens abroad (estimated at one million in 1999) the argentine community is considered to be the second-largest foreign community in the country (estimated somewhere between 30,000 and 150,000) mexico also has a large lebanese community now numbering around 400,000 in october 2008 mexico agreed to deport cubans using the country as an entry point to the us large numbers of central american migrants who have crossed guatemala's western border into mexico are deported every year small numbers of illegal immigrants come from ecuador cuba china south africa and pakistan mexico is the largest source of immigration to the united states 11.6 million americans listed their ancestry as mexican as of 2014
=== mestizo ===
a large majority of mexicans have been classified as mestizos meaning in modern mexican usage that they identify fully neither with any indigenous culture nor with a particular non-mexican heritage but rather identify as having cultural traits and heritage incorporating elements from indigenous and european traditions by the deliberate efforts of post-revolutionary governments the mestizo identity was constructed as the base of the modern mexican national identity through a process of cultural synthesis referred to as mestizaje mexican politicians and reformers such as jos vasconcelos and manuel gamio were instrumental in building a mexican national identity on the concept of mestizaje cultural policies in early post-revolutionary mexico were paternalistic towards the indigenous people with efforts designed to help indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the rest of society eventually assimilating indigenous peoples completely to mestizo mexican culture working toward the goal of eventually solving the indian problem by transforming indigenous communities into mestizo communities
a 2014 publication summarizing population genetics research in mexico which have included three nationwide surveys and several region-specific surveys found that in the studies done to date counting only studies that looked at the ancestry of both parents amerindian ancestry is most prevalent (51% to 56%) in the three general estimates followed by european ancestry (40% to 45%) the african share represents only 2% to 5% in mexico city the european contribution was estimated as 21% to 32% in six of the seven reports with the anomalous value of 57% obtained in a single sample of 19 subjects european ancestry is most prevalent in the north (chihuahua 50% sonora 62% nuevo len 55%) but in a recent sample from nuevo len and elsewhere in the country amerindian ancestry is dominant.
the term mestizo is not in wide use in mexican society today and has been dropped as a category in population censuses it is however still used in social and cultural studies when referring to the non-indigenous part of the mexican population the word has somewhat pejorative connotations and most of the mexican citizens who would be defined as mestizos in the sociological literature would probably self-identify primarily as mexicans in the yucatn peninsula the word mestizo is even used about maya-speaking populations living in traditional communities because during the caste war of the late 19th century those maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as mestizos in chiapas the word ladino is used instead of mestizo
=== indigenous peoples ===
according to the national commission for the development of indigenous peoples (comisin nacional para el desarrollo de los pueblos indgenas or cdi in spanish) and the inegi (official census institute) there are 15.7 million indigenous people in mexico of many different ethnic groups which constitute 14.9% of the population in the country the number of indigenous mexicans is judged using the political criteria found in the 2nd article of the mexican constitution the mexican census does not report racial-ethnicity but only the cultural-ethnicity of indigenous communities that preserve their indigenous languages traditions beliefs and cultures the absolute indigenous population is growing but at a slower rate than the rest of the population so that the percentage of indigenous peoples is nonetheless falling
in 2011 a large scale mitochondrial sequencing in mexican americans revealed 85 to 90% of mtdna lineages of native american origin with the remainder having european (57%) or african ancestry (35%) thus the observed frequency of native american mtdna in mexican/mexican americans is higher than was expected on the basis of autosomal estimates of native american admixture for these populations i.e ~ 3046%
the category of indigena (indigenous) can be defined narrowly according to linguistic criteria including only persons that speak one of mexico's 62 indigenous languages this is the categorization used by the national mexican institute of statistics it can also be defined broadly to include all persons who selfidentify as having an indigenous cultural background whether or not they speak the language of the indigenous group they identify with this means that the percentage of the mexican population defined as indigenous varies according to the definition applied cultural activists have referred to the usage of the narrow definition of the term for census purposes as statistical genocide
the majority of the indigenous population is concentrated in the central and southern states these states are generally the least developed and the majority of the indigenous population live in rural areas some indigenous communities have a degree of autonomy under the legislation of usos y costumbres which allows them to regulate some internal issues under customary law
according to the cdi the states with the greatest proportion of indigenous residents are yucatn at 59% quintana roo 39% and campeche 27% chiefly maya oaxaca with 48% of the population the most numerous groups being the mixtec and zapotec peoples chiapas at 28% the majority being tzeltal and tzotzil maya hidalgo 24% the majority being otomi puebla 19% and guerrero 17% mostly nahua people and the states of san luis potos and veracruz both home to a population that is 15% indigenous mostly from the totonac nahua and teenek (huastec) groups
all of the indices of social development for the indigenous population are considerably lower than the national average in all states indigenous people have higher infant mortality in some states almost double of the non-indigenous populations literacy rates are also much lower with 27% of indigenous children between 6 and 14 being illiterate compared to a national average of 12% the indigenous population participate in the workforce longer than the national average starting earlier and continuing longer however 55% of the indigenous population receive less than a minimum salary compared to 20% for the national average many practice subsistence agriculture and receive no salaries indigenous people also have less access to health care and a lower quality of housing
=== mexicans of european descent ===
european mexicans are mexican citizens of european descent despite that mexico does not have a racial census estimations from different international organizations regarding the number of this ethnic group within the country's population range from 9% according to the world factbook to as high as 20% (approximately one-fifth) according to encyclopdia britannica another group in mexico the mestizos also include people with varying amounts of european ancestry with some having a european admixture higher than 90% although it must be considered that the criteria to define mestizo might be different from study to study and that in mexico a good number of white people has been historically classified as mestizos because the mexican government defines ethnicity on cultural standards as opposed to racial ones
genetic studies in mexico show a varying degree of european admixture in mestizos genetic variation is largely based upon where in the country an individual is from this is true because native mexicans are concentrated in the south and central part of the country whilst the white population is concentrated in the north.)
in another study mexico's national institute of genomic medicine issued a report on a genomic study of mestizos from the states of guerrero sonora veracruz yucatn zacatecas and guanajuato the study found that the mestizo population of these mexican states were on average 55% of indigenous ancestry followed by 41.8% of european 1.8% of african and 1.2% of east asian ancestry the study also noted that whereas mestizo individuals from the southern state of guerrero showed on average 66% of indigenous ancestry those from the northern state of sonora displayed about 61.6% european ancestry the study found that there was an increase in indigenous ancestry as one traveled towards to the southern states in mexico while the indigenous ancestry declined as one traveled to the northern states in the country such as sonora
europeans began arriving in mexico with the spanish conquest of the aztec empire with the descendents of the conquistadors along with new arrivals from spain formed an elite but were a small minority of the population most white immigrants however intermixed with the mestizo and indigenous populations
while most of european migration into mexico was spanish during the colonial period in the 19th and 20th centuries european and european derived populations from north and south america did immigrate to the country however at its height the total immigrant population in mexico never exceeded ten percent of the total many of these immigrants came with money to invest and/or ties to allow them to become prominent in business and other aspects of mexican society however due to government restrictions many of them left the country in the early 20th century
