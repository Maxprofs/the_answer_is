packaging is the technology of enclosing or protecting products for distribution storage sale and use packaging also refers to the process of design evaluation and production of packages packaging can be described as a coordinated system of preparing goods for transport warehousing logistics sale and end use packaging contains protects preserves transports informs and sells in many countries it is fully integrated into government business institutional industrial and personal use
package labeling (american english) or labelling (british english) is any written electronic or graphic communication on the package or on a separate but associated label
== historyedit ==
=== ancient eraedit ===
the first packages used the natural materials available at the time baskets of reeds wineskins (bota bags) wooden boxes pottery vases ceramic amphorae wooden barrels woven bags etc processed materials were used to form packages as they were developed for example early glass and bronze vessels the study of old packages is an important aspect of archaeology
the earliest recorded use of paper for packaging dates back to 1035 when a persian traveler visiting markets in cairo noted that vegetables spices and hardware were wrapped in paper for the customers after they were sold
=== modern eraedit ===
==== tinningedit ====
the use of tinplate for packaging dates back to the 18th century the manufacture of tinplate was long a monopoly of bohemia in 1667 andrew yarranton an english engineer and ambrose crowley brought the method to england where it was improved by ironmasters including philip foley by 1697 john hanbury had a rolling mill at pontypool for making pontypoole plates the method of rolling iron plates by means of cylinders pioneered there enabled more uniform black plates to be produced than was possible with the old plan of hammering
tinplate boxes first began to be sold from ports in the bristol channel in 1725 the tinplate was shipped from newport monmouthshire by 1805 80,000 boxes were made and 50,000 exported tobacconists in london began packaging snuff in metal-plated canisters from the 1760s onwards
==== canningedit ====
with the discovery of the importance of airtight containers for food preservation by french inventor nicholas appert the tin canning process was patented by british merchant peter durand in 1810 after receiving the patent durand did not pursue canning food himself he sold his patent in 1812 to two other englishmen bryan donkin and john hall who refined the process and product and set up the world's first commercial canning factory on southwark park road london by 1813 they were producing the first canned goods for the royal navy
the progressive improvement in canning stimulated the 1855 invention of the can opener robert yeates a cutlery and surgical instrument maker of trafalgar place west hackney road middlesex uk devised a claw-ended can opener with a hand-operated tool that haggled its way around the top of metal cans in 1858 another lever-type opener of a more complex shape was patented in the united states by ezra warner of waterbury connecticut
==== paper-based packagingedit ====
set-up boxes were first used in the 16th century and modern folding cartons date back to 1839 the first corrugated box was produced commercially in 1817 in england corrugated (also called pleated) paper received a british patent in 1856 and was used as a liner for tall hats the scottish-born robert gair invented the pre-cut paperboard box in 1890 flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes gair's invention came about as a result of an accident as a brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s he was once printing an order of seed bags and the metal ruler normally used to crease bags shifted in position and cut them gair discovered that by cutting and creasing in one operation he could make prefabricated paperboard boxes
commercial paper bags were first manufactured in bristol england in 1844 and american francis wolle patented a machine for automated bag-making in 1852
=== 20th centuryedit ===
packaging advancements in the early 20th century included bakelite closures on bottles transparent cellophane overwraps and panels on cartons increased processing efficiency and improved food safety as additional materials such as aluminum and several types of plastic were developed they were incorporated into packages to improve performance and functionality
in 1952 michigan state university became the first university in the world to offer a degree in packaging engineering
in-plant recycling has long been common for production of packaging materials post-consumer recycling of aluminum and paper based products has been economical for many years since the 1980s post-consumer recycling has increased due to curbside recycling consumer awareness and regulatory pressure
many prominent innovations in the packaging industry were developed first for military uses some military supplies are packaged in the same commercial packaging used for general industry other military packaging must transport materiel supplies foods etc under the most severe distribution and storage conditions packaging problems encountered in world war ii led to military standard or mil spec regulations being applied to packaging designating it military specification packaging as a prominent concept in the military mil spec packaging officially came into being around 1941 due to operations in iceland experiencing critical losses eventually attributed to bad packaging in most cases mil spec packaging solutions (such as barrier materials field rations antistatic bags and various shipping crates) are similar to commercial grade packaging materials but subject to more stringent performance and quality requirements
as of 2003 the packaging sector accounted for about two percent of the gross national product in developed countries about half of this market was related to food packaging
== the purposes of packaging and package labelsedit ==
packaging and package labeling have several objectives
physical protection the objects enclosed in the package may require protection from among other things mechanical shock vibration electrostatic discharge compression temperature etc
barrier protection a barrier from oxygen water vapor dust etc. is often required permeation is a critical factor in design some packages contain desiccants or oxygen absorbers to help extend shelf life modified atmospheres or controlled atmospheres are also maintained in some food packages keeping the contents clean fresh sterile and safe for the intended shelf life is a primary function a barrier is also implemented in cases where segregation of two materials prior to end use is required as in case of special paints glues medical fluids etc at consumer end the packaging barrier is broken or measured amounts of material removed for mixing and subsequent end use
containment or agglomeration small objects are typically grouped together in one package for reasons of efficiency for example a single box of 1000 pencils requires less physical handling than 1000 single pencils liquids powders and granular materials need containment
information transmission packages and labels communicate how to use transport recycle or dispose of the package or product with pharmaceuticals food medical and chemical products some types of information are required by governments some packages and labels also are used for track and trace purposes most items include their serial and lot numbers on the packaging and in the case of food products medicine and some chemicals the packaging often contains an expiry/best-before date usually in a shorthand form packages may indicate their material with a symbol
marketing the packaging and labels can be used by marketers to encourage potential buyers to purchase the product package graphic design and physical design have been important and constantly evolving phenomenon for several decades marketing communications and graphic design are applied to the surface of the package and (in many cases) the point of sale display most packaging is designed to reflect the brand's message and identity
security packaging can play an important role in reducing the security risks of shipment packages can be made with improved tamper resistance to deter tampering and also can have tamper-evident features to help indicate tampering packages can be engineered to help reduce the risks of package pilferage or the theft and resale of products some package constructions are more resistant to pilferage and some have pilfer indicating seals counterfeit consumer goods unauthorized sales (diversion) material substitution and tampering can all be prevented with these anti-counterfeiting technologies packages may include authentication seals and use security printing to help indicate that the package and contents are not counterfeit packages also can include anti-theft devices such as dye-packs rfid tags or electronic article surveillance tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate using packaging in this way is a means of loss prevention
convenience packages can have features that add convenience in distribution handling stacking display sale opening reclosing use dispensing reuse recycling and ease of disposal
portion control single serving or single dosage packaging has a precise amount of contents to control usage bulk commodities (such as salt) can be divided into packages that are a more suitable size for individual households it also aids the control of inventory selling sealed one-liter-bottles of milk rather than having people bring their own bottles to fill themselves
== packaging typesedit ==
packaging may be looked at as being of several different types for example a transport package or distribution package can be the shipping container used to ship store and handle the product or inner packages some identify a consumer package as one which is directed toward a consumer or household
packaging may be described in relation to the type of product being packaged medical device packaging bulk chemical packaging over-the-counter drug packaging retail food packaging military materiel packaging pharmaceutical packaging etc
it is sometimes convenient to categorize packages by layer or function primary secondary etc
primary packaging is the material that first envelops the product and holds it this usually is the smallest unit of distribution or use and is the package which is in direct contact with the contents
secondary packaging is outside the primary packaging perhaps used to group primary packages together
tertiary packaging is used for bulk handling warehouse storage and transport shipping the most common form is a palletized unit load that packs tightly into containers
these broad categories can be somewhat arbitrary for example depending on the use a shrink wrap can be primary packaging when applied directly to the product secondary packaging when combining smaller packages and tertiary packaging on some distribution packs
== symbols used on packages and labelsedit ==
many types of symbols for package labeling are nationally and internationally standardized for consumer packaging symbols exist for product certifications (such as the fcc and tv marks) trademarks proof of purchase etc some requirements and symbols exist to communicate aspects of consumer rights and safety for example the ce marking or the estimated sign that notes conformance to eu weights and measures accuracy regulations examples of environmental and recycling symbols include the recycling symbol the recycling code (which could be a resin identification code) and the green dot food packaging may show food contact material symbols in the european union products of animal origin which are intended to be consumed by humans have to carry standard oval-shaped ec identification and health marks for food safety and quality insurance reasons
bar codes universal product codes and rfid labels are common to allow automated information management in logistics and retailing country of origin labeling is often used some products might use qr codes or similar matrix barcodes packaging may have visible registration marks and other printing calibration/troubleshooting cues
=== shipping container labelingedit ===
technologies related to shipping containers are identification codes bar codes and electronic data interchange (edi) these three core technologies serve to enable the business functions in the process of shipping containers throughout the distribution channel each has an essential function identification codes either relate product information or serve as keys to other data bar codes allow for the automated input of identification codes and other data and edi moves data between trading partners within the distribution channel
elements of these core technologies include upc and ean item identification codes the scc-14 (upc shipping container code) the sscc-18 (serial shipping container codes) interleaved 2-of-5 and ucc/ean-128 (newly designated gs1-128) bar code symbologies and ansi asc x12 and un/edifact edi standards
small parcel carriers often have their own formats for example united parcel service has a maxicode 2-d code for parcel tracking
rfid labels for shipping containers are also increasing in usage a wal-mart division sam's club has also moved in this direction and is putting pressure on its suppliers for compliance
shipments of hazardous materials or dangerous goods have special information and symbols (labels placards etc.) as required by un country and specific carrier requirements with transport packages standardized symbols are also used to communicate handling needs some are defined in the astm d5445 standard practice for pictorial markings for handling of goods and iso 780 pictorial marking for handling of goods
== package development considerationsedit ==
package design and development are often thought of as an integral part of the new product development process alternatively development of a package (or component) can be a separate process but must be linked closely with the product to be packaged package design starts with the identification of all the requirements structural design marketing shelf life quality assurance logistics legal regulatory graphic design end-use environmental etc the design criteria performance (specified by package testing) completion time targets resources and cost constraints need to be established and agreed upon package design processes often employ rapid prototyping computer-aided design computer-aided manufacturing and document automation
an example of how package design is affected by other factors is the relationship to logistics when the distribution system includes individual shipments by a small parcel carrier the sortation handling and mixed stacking make severe demands on the strength and protective ability of the transport package if the logistics system consists of uniform palletized unit loads the structural design of the package can be designed to those specific needs vertical stacking perhaps for a longer time frame a package designed for one mode of shipment may not be suited for another
with some types of products the design process involves detailed regulatory requirements for the package for example with packaging foods any package components that may contact the food are food contact materials toxicologists and food scientists need to verify that the packaging materials are allowed by applicable regulations packaging engineers need to verify that the completed package will keep the product safe for its intended shelf life with normal usage packaging processes labeling distribution and sale need to be validated to comply with regulations and have the well being of the consumer in mind
sometimes the objectives of package development seem contradictory for example regulations for an over-the-counter drug might require the package to be tamper-evident and child resistant these intentionally make the package difficult to open the intended consumer however might be handicapped or elderly and be unable to readily open the package meeting all goals is a challenge
package design may take place within a company or with various degrees of external packaging engineering independent contractors consultants vendor evaluations independent laboratories contract packagers total outsourcing etc some sort of formal project planning and project management methodology is required for all but the simplest package design and development programs an effective quality management system and verification and validation protocols are mandatory for some types of packaging and recommended for all
=== environmental considerationsedit ===
package development involves considerations for sustainability environmental responsibility and applicable environmental and recycling regulations it may involve a life cycle assessment which considers the material and energy inputs and outputs to the package the packaged product (contents) the packaging process the logistics system waste management etc it is necessary to know the relevant regulatory requirements for point of manufacture sale and use
the traditional three rs of reduce reuse and recycle are part of a waste hierarchy which may be considered in product and package development
prevention waste prevention is a primary goal packaging should be used only where needed proper packaging can also help prevent waste packaging plays an important part in preventing loss or damage to the packaged-product (contents) usually the energy content and material usage of the product being packaged are much greater than that of the package a vital function of the package is to protect the product for its intended use if the product is damaged or degraded its entire energy and material content may be lost
minimization (also source reduction") the mass and volume of packaging (per unit of contents) can be measured and used as one of the criteria to minimize during the package design process usually reduced packaging also helps minimize costs packaging engineers continue to work toward reduced packaging
reuse reusable packaging is encouraged returnable packaging has long been useful (and economically viable) for closed loop logistics systems inspection cleaning repair and recouperage are often needed some manufacturers re-use the packaging of the incoming parts for a product either as packaging for the outgoing product or as part of the product itself
recycling recycling is the reprocessing of materials (pre- and post-consumer) into new products emphasis is focused on recycling the largest primary components of a package steel aluminum papers plastics etc small components can be chosen which are not difficult to separate and do not contaminate recycling operations packages can sometimes be designed to separate components to better facilitate recycling
energy recovery waste-to-energy and refuse-derived fuel in approved facilities are able to make use of the heat available from the packaging components
disposal incineration and placement in a sanitary landfill are needed for some materials certain us states regulate packages for toxic contents which have the potential to contaminate emissions and ash from incineration and leachate from landfill packages should not be littered
development of sustainable packaging is an area of considerable interest by standards organizations government consumers packagers and retailers
== packaging machinesedit ==
a choice of packaging machinery includes technical capabilities labor requirements worker safety maintainability serviceability reliability ability to integrate into the packaging line capital cost floorspace flexibility (change-over materials etc.) energy usage quality of outgoing packages qualifications (for food pharmaceuticals etc.) throughput efficiency productivity ergonomics return on investment etc
packaging machinery can be
