molecular biology genetics transcription factor sometimes called sequencespecific dnabinding factor protein binds specific dna sequences thereby controlling rate transcription genetic information dna messenger rna transcription factors perform function alone proteins complex promoting activator blocking repressor recruitment rna polymerase enzyme performs transcription genetic information dna rna specific genes
defining feature transcription factors contain one dnabinding domains dbds attach specific sequences dna adjacent genes regulate additional proteins coactivators chromatin remodelers histone acetylases deacetylases kinases methylases also playing crucial roles gene regulation lack dnabinding domains therefore classified transcription factors
conservation different organisms
transcription factors essential regulation gene expression consequence found living organisms number transcription factors found within organism increases genome size larger genomes tend transcription factors per gene
approximately proteins human genome contain dnabinding domains presumed function transcription factors though studies indicate smaller number therefore approximately genes genome code transcription factors makes family single largest family human proteins furthermore genes often flanked several binding sites distinct transcription factors efficient expression genes requires cooperative action several different transcription factors see example hepatocyte nuclear factors hence combinatorial use subset approximately human transcription factors easily accounts unique regulation gene human genome development

response intercellular signals
cells communicate releasing molecules produce signaling cascades within another receptive cell signal requires upregulation downregulation genes recipient cell often transcription factors downstream signaling cascade estrogen signaling example fairly short signaling cascade involves estrogen receptor transcription factor estrogen secreted tissues ovaries placenta crosses cell membrane recipient cell bound estrogen receptor cells cytoplasm estrogen receptor goes cells nucleus binds dnabinding sites changing transcriptional regulation associated genes

nuclear localization
eukaryotes transcription factors like proteins transcribed nucleus translated cells cytoplasm many proteins active nucleus contain nuclear localization signals direct nucleus many transcription factors key point regulation important classes transcription factors nuclear receptors must first bind ligand cytoplasm relocate nucleus
activation
transcription factors may activated deactivated signalsensing domain number mechanisms including
ligand binding ligand binding able influence transcription factor located within cell ligand binding also affect whether transcription factor active state capable binding dna cofactors see example nuclear receptors
phosphorylation many transcription factors stat proteins must phosphorylated bind dna
interaction transcription factors eg homo heterodimerization coregulatory proteins
accessibility dnabinding site
eukaryotes dna organized help histones compact particles nucleosomes dna base pairs make turns around histone protein octamer dna within nucleosomes inaccessible many transcription factors transcription factors socalled pioneering factors still able bind dna binding sites nucleosomal dna transcription factors nucleosome actively removed molecular motors chromatin remodelers alternatively nucleosome partially unwrapped thermal fluctuations allowing temporary access transcription factor binding site many cases transcription factor needs compete binding dna binding site transcription factors histones nonhistone chromatin proteins pairs transcription factors proteins play antagonistic roles activator versus repressor regulation gene

response elements
dna sequence transcription factor binds called transcription factorbinding site response element
transcription factors interact binding sites using combination electrostatic hydrogen bonds special case van der waals forces due nature chemical interactions transcription factors bind dna sequence specific manner however bases transcription factorbinding site may actually interact transcription factor addition interactions may weaker others thus transcription factors bind one sequence capable binding subset closely related sequences different strength interaction
example although consensus binding site tatabinding protein tbp tataaaa tbp transcription factor also bind similar sequences tatatat tatataa
transcription factors bind set related sequences sequences tend short potential transcription factor binding sites occur chance dna sequence long enough unlikely however transcription factor binds compatible sequences genome cell constraints dna accessibility cell availability cofactors may also help dictate transcription factor actually bind thus given genome sequence still difficult predict transcription factor actually bind living cell
additional recognition specificity however may obtained use one dnabinding domain example tandem dbds transcription factor dimerization two transcription factors bind two adjacent sequences dna
