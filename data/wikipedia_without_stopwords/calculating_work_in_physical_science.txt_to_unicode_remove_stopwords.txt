reproductive system genital system system sex organs within organism work together purpose sexual reproduction many nonliving substances fluids hormones pheromones also important accessories reproductive system unlike organ systems sexes differentiated species often significant differences differences allow combination genetic material two individuals allows possibility greater genetic fitness offspring
plantsedit
among living organisms flowers reproductive structures angiosperms varied physically show correspondingly great diversity methods reproduction plants flowering plants green algae mosses liverworts hornworts ferns gymnosperms conifers also complex interplays morphological adaptation environmental factors sexual reproduction breeding system sperm one plant fertilizes ovum another depends reproductive morphology single important determinant genetic structure nonclonal plant populations christian konrad sprengel studied reproduction flowering plants first time understood pollination process involved biotic abiotic interactions
fungiedit
fungal reproduction complex reflecting differences lifestyles genetic makeup within diverse kingdom organisms
animalsedit
mammals major organs reproductive system include external genitalia penis vulva well number internal organs including gamete producing gonads testicles ovaries diseases human reproductive system common widespread particularly communicable sexually transmitted diseases
vertebrate animals generally similar reproductive systems consisting gonads ducts openings however great diversity physical adaptations well reproductive strategies every group vertebrates
vertebratesedit
vertebrate animals share key elements reproductive systems gameteproducing organs gonads females gonads connected oviducts opening outside body typically cloaca sometimes unique pore vagina intromittent organ
humansedit
human reproductive system usually involves internal fertilization sexual intercourse process male inserts erect penis females vagina ejaculates semen contains sperm sperm travels vagina cervix uterus fallopian tubes fertilization ovum upon successful fertilization implantation gestation fetus occurs within females uterus approximately nine months process known pregnancy humans gestation ends birth process birth known labor labor consists muscles uterus contracting cervix dilating baby passing vagina female genital organ humans babies children nearly helpless require high levels parental care many years one important type parental care use mammary glands female breasts nurse baby
female reproductive system two functions first produce egg cells second protect nourish offspring birth male reproductive system one function produce deposit sperm humans high level sexual differentiation addition differences nearly every reproductive organ numerous differences typically occur secondary sexual characteristics
maleedit
male reproductive system series organs located outside body around pelvis region male contribute towards reproduction process primary direct function male reproductive system provide male sperm fertilization ovum
major reproductive organs male grouped three categories first category sperm production storage production takes place testes housed temperature regulating scrotum immature sperm travel epididymis development storage second category ejaculatory fluid producing glands include seminal vesicles prostate vas deferens final category used copulation deposition spermatozoa sperm within male include penis urethra vas deferens cowpers gland
major secondary sexual characteristics includes larger muscular stature deepened voice facial body hair broad shoulders development adams apple important sexual hormone males androgen particularly testosterone
testes release hormone controls development sperm hormone also responsible development physical characteristics men facial hair deep voice
femaleedit
human female reproductive system series organs primarily located inside body around pelvic region female contribute towards reproductive process human female reproductive system contains three main parts vagina leads vulva vaginal opening uterus uterus holds developing fetus ovaries produce females ova breasts involved parenting stage reproduction classifications considered part female reproductive system
vagina meets outside vulva also includes labia clitoris urethra intercourse area lubricated mucus secreted bartholins glands vagina attached uterus cervix uterus attached ovaries via fallopian tubes ovary contains hundreds egg cells ova singular ovum
approximately every days pituitary gland releases hormone stimulates ova develop grow one ovum released passes fallopian tube uterus hormones produced ovaries prepare uterus receive ovum lining uterus called endometrium unfertilized ova shed cycle process menstruation ovum fertilized sperm attaches endometrium fetus develops
mammalsedit
mammal reproductive systems similar however notable differences normal mammal humans instance mammalian males penis stored internally erect penis bone baculum additionally males species remain continually sexually fertile humans like humans groups mammals descended testicles found within scrotum however others descended testicles rest ventral body wall groups mammals elephants undescended testicles found deep within body cavities near kidneys
reproductive system marsupials unique female two vaginae open externally one orifice lead different compartments within uterus males usually twopronged penis corresponds females two vaginae marsupials typically develop offspring external pouch containing teats newborn young joeys attach post uterine development also marsupials unique prepenial scrotum mm long newborn joey instinctively crawls wriggles several inches cm clinging fur way mothers pouch
uterus vagina unique mammals homologue birds reptiles amphibians fish place uterus vertebrate groups unmodified oviduct leading directly cloaca shared exithole gametes urine feces monotremes ie platypus echidnas group egglaying mammals also lack uterus vagina respect reproductive system resembling reptile
dogsedit
domestic canines sexual maturity puberty occurs ages months males females although delayed two years age large breeds
horsesedit
mares reproductive system responsible controlling gestation birth lactation well estrous cycle mating behavior stallions reproductive system responsible sexual behavior secondary sex characteristics large crest
birdsedit
male female birds cloaca opening eggs sperm wastes pass intercourse performed pressing lips cloacae together sometimes knowna intromittent organ known phallus analogous mammals penis female lays amniotic eggs young fetus continues develop leaves females body unlike vertebrates female birds typically one functional ovary oviduct group birds like mammals noted high level parental care
reptilesedit
reptiles almost sexually dimorphic exhibit internal fertilization cloaca reptiles lay eggs others viviparous animals deliver live young reproductive organs found within cloaca reptiles male reptiles copulatory organs usually retracted inverted stored inside body turtles crocodilians male single median penislike organ male snakes lizards possess pair penislike organs
amphibiansedit
amphibians exhibit external fertilization eggs typically within water though amphibians caecilians internal fertilization paired internal gonads connected ducts cloaca
fishedit
fish exhibit wide range different reproductive strategies fish however oviparous exhibit external fertilization process females use cloaca release large quantities gametes called spawn water one males release milt white fluid containing many sperm unfertilized eggs species fish oviparous internal fertilization aided pelvic anal fins modified intromittent organ analogous human penis small portion fish species either viviparous ovoviviparous collectively known livebearers
fish gonads typically pairs either ovaries testes fish sexually dimorphic species hermaphroditic unisexual
invertebratesedit
invertebrates extremely diverse array reproductive systems commonality may lay eggs also aside cephalopods arthropods nearly invertebrates hermaphroditic exhibit external fertilization
cephalopodsedit
cephalopods sexually dimorphic reproduce laying eggs cephalopods semiinternal fertilization male places gametes inside females mantle cavity pallial cavity fertilize ova found females single ovary likewise male cephalopods single testicle female cephalopods nidamental glands aid development egg
penis unshelled male cephalopods coleoidea long muscular end gonoduct used transfer spermatophores modified arm called hectocotylus turn used transfer spermatophores female species hectocotylus missing penis long able extend beyond mantle cavity transfer spermatophores directly female
insectsedit
insects reproduce oviparously ie laying eggs eggs produced female pair ovaries sperm produced male one testis commonly two transmitted female mating means external genitalia sperm stored within female one spermathecae time fertilization eggs travel along oviducts fertilized sperm expelled body laid cases via ovipositor
