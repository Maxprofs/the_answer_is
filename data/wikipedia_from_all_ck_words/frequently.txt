in grammar a frequentative form (abbreviated freq or fr.) of a word is one that indicates repeated action the frequentative form can be considered a separate but not completely independent word called a frequentative the frequentative is no longer productive in english but it still is some languages such as finno-ugric languages (finnish or hungarian) balto-slavic (lithuanian russian and polish) turkic etc.
== english ==
english has -le and -er as frequentative suffixes some frequentative verbs surviving in english and their parent verbs are listed below additionally some frequentative verbs are formed by reduplication of a monosyllable (e.g. coo-cooing cf latin murmur) frequentative nouns are often formed by combining two different vowel grades of the same word (as in teeter-totter pitter-patter chitchat etc.)
== finnish ==
in finnish a frequentative verb signifies a single action repeated around the place both spatially and temporally the complete translation would be go around aimlessly there is a large array of different frequentatives indicated by lexical agglutinative markers in general one frequentative is -:i- and another -ele- but it is almost always combined with something else some forms
sataa sadella satelee to rain to rain occasionally it rains occasionally
ampua ammuskella ammuskelen to shoot go shooting around i go shooting around
juosta juoksennella juoksentelen to run to run around (to and fro) i run around
kirjoittaa kirjoitella kirjoittelen to write to write (something short) occasionally i write around
jrjest jrjestell jrjestelen to put in order to arrange continuously to play around i play around (with them) in order to put them in order
heitt heittelehti heittelehdit to throw to swerve you swerve
loikata loikkia loikin to jump once to jump (again and again) i jump (again and again)
istua istuksia istuksit to sit to sit (randomly somewhere) loiter you loiter there by sitting
there are several frequentative morphemes underlined above these are affected by consonant gradation as indicated their meanings are slightly different see the list arranged infinitive~personal
-ella~-ele- bare frequentative
-skella~-skele- frequentative unergative verb where the action is wanton (arbitrary)
-stella~-stele- frequentative causative where the subject causes something indicated in the root as order vs to continuously try to put something in order
-nnella~-ntele- a frequentative where an actor is required the marker -nt- indicates a continuing effort therefore -ntele- indicates a series of such efforts
-elehtia~-elehdi- movement that is random and compulsive as in under pain e.g vntelehti writhe in pain or heittelehti to swerve
-:ia-~-i- a continuing action definitely at a point in time where the action or effort is repeated
-ksia~-ksi- same as -i- but wanton cf -skella
frequentatives may be combined with momentanes that is to indicate the repetition of a short sudden action the momentane -ahta- can be prefixed with the frequentative -ele- to produce the morpheme -ahtele- as in trist to shake (continuously) trht to shake suddenly once trhdell to shake such that a single sudden shaking is repeated for example the contrast between these is that ground shakes (maa trisee) continuously when a large truck goes by the ground shakes once (maa trht) when a cannon fires and the ground shakes suddenly but repeatedly (maa trhtelee) when a battery of cannons is firing
since the frequentative is a lexical not a grammatical contrast considerable semantic drift may have occurred
for a list of different real and hypothetical forms see [1]
loanwords are put into the frequentative form if the action is such if the action can be nothing else but frequentative the basic form doesn't even exist such as with to go shopping
surfata surfailla to surf to surf (around in the net)
*shopata shoppailla *to shop once to go shopping
that's also the case with an adjective iso isotella big to talk big or feikkailla < english fake to be fake blatantly and consistently
== greek ==
in homer and herodotus there is a past frequentative usually called past iterative formed like the imperfect but with an additional -sk- suffix before the endings
khe-sk-on i used to have (imperfect kh-on)
the same suffix is used in inchoative verbs in both ancient greek and latin
== hungarian ==
in hungarian it is quite common and everyday to use frequentative
frequentative verbs are formed with the suffix gat (get after a front vowel see vowel harmony) also there is a so-called template rule which force an other vowel in between the base verb and the affix to result in a word containing at least three syllables verbal prefixes (coverbs) do not count as a syllable
some verbs frequentative forms have acquired an independent non-frequentative meaning in these cases the three syllables rule is not applied as the form isn't considered a frequentative these words can be affixed with gat again to create a frequentative meaning
in rare cases non-verbs can be affixed by gat to give them similar modification in meaning as to verbs in most cases these non-verbs are obviously related to some actions like a typical outcome or object the resulting word basically has the same meaning as if the related verb were affixed with gat
the change in meaning of a frequentative compared to the base can be different depending on the base the gat affix can modify the occurrences or the intensity or both of an action occasionally it produces a specific meaning which is related but distinct from the original form's
examples
== latin ==
in latin frequentative verbs show repeated or intense action they are formed from the supine stem with -tre/-sre -itre -titre/-sitre added
ventitre come frequently or repeatedly (< venio come see catullus 8 l 4)
cantre (continue to) sing (< canere sing a song')
cursre run around (< currere run')
dictre dictate (< dcere speak say')
ctitre zealously agitate and agitre put into motion (< agere do drive')
pulsre push/beat around (< pellere push (once) beat')
iactre shake disturb (< iacere throw cast')
the deponent verb minari ('threaten') has frequentives of both deponent and active form minitari and minitare
== lithuanian ==
in lithuanian the past iterative or frequentative signifies a single action repeated in the past
the past iterative does not exist in latvian and its construction is different in the samogitian dialect of lithuanian
it is created from the infinitive without the infinitive suffix -ti + dav + suffix for frequentative
for example
dirbti dirbau dirbdavau to work to work occasionally to work regularly (repeated action in the past)
== polish ==
in the polish language certain imperfective verbs ending in -a denote repeated or habitual action
je (to eat) jada (to eat habitually)
chodzi (to walk) chadza
widzie (to see) widywa
pisa (to write) pisywa
czyta (to read) czytywa
the interfix -yw- used to form many frequentative verbs has a different function for prefixed perfective verbs it serves to create their imperfective equivalents for instance rozczytywa (to try to read something barely legible) is simply an imperfective equivalent of rozczyta (to succeed at reading something barely legible)
== russian ==
in the russian language the frequentative form of verbs to denote a repeated or customary action is produced by inserting the suffix -/- often accompanied with a change in the root of the word (vowel alternation change of the last root consonant)
(to see) (to see repeatedly)
(to sit)
(to walk)
(to wear)
(to stroke)
(to write)
an interesting example is with the word (to take) an archaic usage recorded among hunters normally used in the past tense in hunter's boasting  meaning used to take (quite a few) trophies
== turkish ==
turkish also has a similar form the helping verbs ( yardmc eylem / yardmc fiil ) are used as suffixes to denote ability ( -ebilmek ) imminence ('-ivermek') close miss (narrow escape) situation ('-eyazmak') and repetition ('-egelmek or -edurmak')
anlat- (to recite) anlatagelmek (to be reciting repetitively.)
for other helping verbs see helping verbs section under turkish grammar
== reduplication ==
the simplest way to produce a frequentative is reduplication either of the entire word or of one of its phonemes this is common in austronesian languages although reduplication also serves to pluralize and intensify nouns and adjectives examples in niuean are available here
