a corporation is a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law early incorporated entities were established by charter (i.e by an ad hoc act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature) most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration
corporations come in many different types but are usually divided by the law of the jurisdiction where they are chartered into two kinds by whether or not they can issue stock or by whether or not they are for profit
where local law distinguishes corporations by ability to issue stock corporations allowed to do so are referred to as stock corporations ownership of the corporation is through stock and owners of stock are referred to as stockholders. corporations not allowed to issue stock are referred to as non-stock corporations those who are considered the owners of the corporation are those who have obtained membership in the corporation and are referred to as a member of the corporation
corporations chartered in regions where they are distinguished by whether they are allowed to be for profit or not are referred to as for profit and not-for-profit corporations respectively
there is some overlap between stock/non-stock and for profit/not-for-profit in that not-for-profit corporations are always non-stock as well a for profit corporation is almost always a stock corporation but some for profit corporations may choose to be non-stock to simplify the explanation whenever stockholder is used in the rest of this article to refer to a stock corporation it is presumed to mean the same as member for a non-profit corporation or for profit non-stock corporation
registered corporations have legal personality and are owned by shareholders whose liability is limited to their investment shareholders do not typically actively manage a corporation shareholders instead elect or appoint a board of directors to control the corporation in a fiduciary capacity
in american english the word corporation is most often used to describe large business corporations in british english and in the commonwealth countries the term company is more widely used to describe the same sort of entity while the word corporation encompasses all incorporated entities in american english the word company can include entities such as partnerships that would not be referred to as companies in british english as they are not a separate legal entity
despite not being human beings corporations as far as the law is concerned are legal persons and have many of the same rights and responsibilities as natural persons do corporations can exercise human rights against real individuals and the state and they can themselves be responsible for human rights violations corporations can be dissolved either by statutory operation order of court or voluntary action on the part of shareholders insolvency may result in a form of corporate failure when creditors force the liquidation and dissolution of the corporation under court order but it most often results in a restructuring of corporate holdings corporations can even be convicted of criminal offenses such as fraud and manslaughter however corporations are not considered living entities in the way that humans are
== historyedit ==
the word corporation derives from corpus the latin word for body or a body of people. by the time of justinian (reigned 527565) roman law recognized a range of corporate entities under the names universitas corpus or collegium these included the state itself (the populus romanus) municipalities and such private associations as sponsors of a religious cult burial clubs political groups and guilds of craftsmen or traders such bodies commonly had the right to own property and make contracts to receive gifts and legacies to sue and be sued and in general to perform legal acts through representatives private associations were granted designated privileges and liberties by the emperor
entities which carried on business and were the subjects of legal rights were found in ancient rome and the maurya empire in ancient india in medieval europe churches became incorporated as did local governments such as the pope and the city of london corporation the point was that the incorporation would survive longer than the lives of any particular member existing in perpetuity the alleged oldest commercial corporation in the world the stora kopparberg mining community in falun sweden obtained a charter from king magnus eriksson in 1347
in medieval times traders would do business through common law constructs such as partnerships whenever people acted together with a view to profit the law deemed that a partnership arose early guilds and livery companies were also often involved in the regulation of competition between traders
=== mercantilismedit ===
many european nations chartered corporations to lead colonial ventures such as the dutch east india company (voc) or the hudson's bay company these chartered companies became the progenitors of the modern corporation acting under a charter sanctioned by the dutch government the dutch east india company defeated portuguese forces and established itself in the moluccan islands in order to profit from the european demand for spices investors in the voc were issued paper certificates as proof of share ownership and were able to trade their shares on the original amsterdam stock exchange shareholders are also explicitly granted limited liability in the company's royal charter
in england the government created corporations under a royal charter or an act of parliament with the grant of a monopoly over a specified territory the best known example established in 1600 was the east india company of london queen elizabeth i granted it the exclusive right to trade with all countries to the east of the cape of good hope some corporations at this time would act on the government's behalf bringing in revenue from its exploits abroad subsequently the company became increasingly integrated with english and later british military and colonial policy just as most corporations were essentially dependent on the royal navy's ability to control trade routes
labeled by both contemporaries and historians as the grandest society of merchants in the universe the english east india company would come to symbolize the dazzlingly rich potential of the corporation as well as new methods of business that could be both brutal and exploitative on 31 december 1600 queen elizabeth i granted the company a 15-year monopoly on trade to and from the east indies and africa by 1611 shareholders in the east india company were earning a return on their investment of almost 150 per cent subsequent stock offerings demonstrated just how lucrative the company had become its first stock offering in 16131616 raised 418,000 its second in 16171622 raised 1.6 million
a similar chartered company the south sea company was established in 1711 to trade in the spanish south american colonies but met with less success the south sea company's monopoly rights were supposedly backed by the treaty of utrecht signed in 1713 as a settlement following the war of spanish succession which gave great britain an assiento to trade in the region for thirty years in fact the spanish remained hostile and let only one ship a year enter unaware of the problems investors in britain enticed by extravagant promises of profit from company promoters bought thousands of shares by 1717 the south sea company was so wealthy (still having done no real business) that it assumed the public debt of the british government this accelerated the inflation of the share price further as did the bubble act 1720 which (possibly with the motive of protecting the south sea company from competition) prohibited the establishment of any companies without a royal charter the share price rose so rapidly that people began buying shares merely in order to sell them at a higher price which in turn led to higher share prices this was the first speculative bubble the country had seen but by the end of 1720 the bubble had burst and the share price sank from 1000 to under 100 as bankruptcies and recriminations ricocheted through government and high society the mood against corporations and errant directors was bitter
in the late 18th century stewart kyd the author of the first treatise on corporate law in english defined a corporation as
a collection of many individuals united into one body under a special denomination having perpetual succession under an artificial form and vested by policy of the law with the capacity of acting in several respects as an individual particularly of taking and granting property of contracting obligations and of suing and being sued of enjoying privileges and immunities in common and of exercising a variety of political rights more or less extensive according to the design of its institution or the powers conferred upon it either at the time of its creation or at any subsequent period of its existence
=== modern company lawedit ===
due to the late 18th century abandonment of mercantilist economic theory and the rise of classical liberalism and laissez-faire economic theory due to a revolution in economics led by adam smith and other economists corporations transitioned from being government or guild affiliated entities to being public and private economic entities free of government direction
in 1776 adam smith wrote in the wealth of nations that mass corporate activity could not match private entrepreneurship because people in charge of others money would not exercise as much care as they would with their own
==== deregulationedit ====
the british bubble act 1720's prohibition on establishing companies remained in force until its repeal in 1825 by this point the industrial revolution had gathered pace pressing for legal change to facilitate business activity the repeal was the beginning of a gradual lifting on restrictions though business ventures (such as those chronicled by charles dickens in martin chuzzlewit) under primitive companies legislation were often scams without cohesive regulation proverbial operations like the anglo-bengalee disinterested loan and life assurance company were undercapitalised ventures promising no hope of success except for richly paid promoters
the process of incorporation was possible only through a royal charter or a private act and was limited owing to parliament's jealous protection of the privileges and advantages thereby granted as a result many businesses came to be operated as unincorporated associations with possibly thousands of members any consequent litigation had to be carried out in the joint names of all the members and was almost impossibly cumbersome though parliament would sometimes grant a private act to allow an individual to represent the whole in legal proceedings this was a narrow and necessarily costly expedient allowed only to established companies
then in 1843 william gladstone became the chairman of a parliamentary committee on joint stock companies which led to the joint stock companies act 1844 regarded as the first modern piece of company law the act created the registrar of joint stock companies empowered to register companies by a two-stage process the first provisional stage cost 5 and did not confer corporate status which arose after completing the second stage for another 5 for the first time in history it was possible for ordinary people through a simple registration procedure to incorporate the advantage of establishing a company as a separate legal person was mainly administrative as a unified entity under which the rights and duties of all investors and managers could be channeled
==== limited liabilityedit ====
however there was still no limited liability and company members could still be held responsible for unlimited losses by the company the next crucial development then was the limited liability act 1855 passed at the behest of the then vice president of the board of trade mr robert lowe this allowed investors to limit their liability in the event of business failure to the amount they invested in the company - shareholders were still liable directly to creditors but just for the unpaid portion of their shares (the principle that shareholders are liable to the corporation had been introduced in the joint stock companies act 1844)
the 1855 act allowed limited liability to companies of more than 25 members (shareholders) insurance companies were excluded from the act though it was standard practice for insurance contracts to exclude action against individual members limited liability for insurance companies was allowed by the companies act 1862
this prompted the english periodical the economist to write in 1855 that never perhaps was a change so vehemently and generally demanded of which the importance was so much overrated  the major error of this judgment was recognised by the same magazine more than 70 years later when it claimed that [t]he economic historian of the future   may be inclined to assign to the nameless inventor of the principle of limited liability as applied to trading corporations a place of honour with watt and stephenson and other pioneers of the industrial revolution 
these two features - a simple registration procedure and limited liability - were subsequently codified into the landmark 1856 joint stock companies act this was subsequently consolidated with a number of other statutes in the companies act 1862 which remained in force for the rest of the century up to and including the time of the decision in salomon v a salomon & co ltd
the legislation shortly gave way to a railway boom and from then the numbers of companies formed soared in the later nineteenth century depression took hold and just as company numbers had boomed many began to implode and fall into insolvency much strong academic legislative and judicial opinion was opposed to the notion that businessmen could escape accountability for their role in the failing businesses
a study title review on the loss problem of the listed corporations based on the valuation published in international journal of trends in economics management and technology (ijtemt) concluded that to price for the stock of loss listed company we should not consider single one or several aspects of factors but should stand in the angle of investor considering various expected factors to explore the driving path for all kinds of heterogeneity of loss listed company thereby make a reasonable assessment on the value of loss of listed company
==== further developmentsedit ====
the last significant development in the history of companies was the decision of the house of lords in salomon v salomon & co where the house of lords confirmed the separate legal personality of the company and that the liabilities of the company were separate and distinct from those of its owners
in the united states forming a corporation usually required an act of legislation until the late 19th century many private firms such as carnegie's steel company and rockefeller's standard oil avoided the corporate model for this reason (as a trust) state governments began to adopt more permissive corporate laws from the early 19th century although these were all restrictive in design often with the intention of preventing corporations for gaining too much wealth and power
new jersey was the first state to adopt an enabling corporate law with the goal of attracting more business to the state in 1896 in 1899 delaware followed new jersey's lead with the enactment of an enabling corporate statute but delaware only became the leading corporate state after the enabling provisions of the 1896 new jersey corporate law were repealed in 1913
the end of the 19th century saw the emergence of holding companies and corporate mergers creating larger corporations with dispersed shareholders countries began enacting anti-trust laws to prevent anti-competitive practices and corporations were granted more legal rights and protections
the 20th century saw a proliferation of laws allowing for the creation of corporations by registration across the world which helped to drive economic booms in many countries before and after world war i another major post world war i shift was toward the development of conglomerates in which large corporations purchased smaller corporations to expand their industrial base
starting in the 1980s many countries with large state-owned corporations moved toward privatization the selling of publicly owned (or nationalised') services and enterprises to corporations deregulation (reducing the regulation of corporate activity) often accompanied privatization as part of a laissez-faire policy
== ownership and controledit ==
a corporation is at least in theory owned and controlled by its members in a joint-stock company the members are known as shareholders and each of their shares in the ownership control and profits of the corporation is determined by the portion of shares in the company that they own thus a person who owns a quarter of the shares of a joint-stock company owns a quarter of the company is entitled to a quarter of the profit (or at least a quarter of the profit given to shareholders as dividends) and has a quarter of the votes capable of being cast at general meetings
in another kind of corporation the legal document which established the corporation or which contains its current rules will determine who the corporation's members are who a member is depends on what kind of corporation is involved in a worker cooperative the members are people who work for the cooperative in a credit union the members are people who have accounts with the credit union
the day-to-day activities of a corporation are typically controlled by individuals appointed by the members in some cases this will be a single individual but more commonly corporations are controlled by a committee or by committees broadly speaking there are two kinds of committee structure
a single committee known as a board of directors is the method favored in most common law countries under this model the board of directors is composed of both executive and non-executive directors the latter being meant to supervise the former's management of the company
a two-tiered committee structure with a supervisory board and a managing board is common in civil law countries
=== formationedit ===
historically corporations were created by a charter granted by government today corporations are usually registered with the state province or national government and regulated by the laws enacted by that government registration is the main prerequisite to the corporation's assumption of limited liability the law sometimes requires the corporation to designate its principal address as well as a registered agent (a person or company designated to receive legal service of process) it may also be required to designate an agent or other legal representative of the corporation
generally a corporation files articles of incorporation with the government laying out the general nature of the corporation the amount of stock it is authorized to issue and the names and addresses of directors once the articles are approved the corporation's directors meet to create bylaws that govern the internal functions of the corporation such as meeting procedures and officer positions
the law of the jurisdiction in which a corporation operates will regulate most of its internal activities as well as its finances if a corporation operates outside its home state it is often required to register with other governments as a foreign corporation and is almost always subject to laws of its host state pertaining to employment crimes contracts civil actions and the like
=== namingedit ===
corporations generally have a distinct name historically some corporations were named after their membership for instance the president and fellows of harvard college. nowadays corporations in most jurisdictions have a distinct name that does not need to make reference to their membership in canada this possibility is taken to its logical extreme many smaller canadian corporations have no names at all merely numbers based on a registration number (for example 12345678 ontario limited") which is assigned by the provincial or territorial government where the corporation incorporates
in most countries corporate names include a term or an abbreviation that denotes the corporate status of the entity (for example incorporated or inc. in the united states) or the limited liability of its members (for example limited or ltd.") these terms vary by jurisdiction and language in some jurisdictions they are mandatory and in others they are not their use puts everybody on constructive notice that they are dealing with an entity whose liability is limited one can only collect from whatever assets the entity still controls when one obtains a judgment against it
some jurisdictions do not allow the use of the word company alone to denote corporate status since the word company may refer to a partnership or some other form of collective ownership (in the united states it can be used by a sole proprietorship but this is not generally the case elsewhere)
