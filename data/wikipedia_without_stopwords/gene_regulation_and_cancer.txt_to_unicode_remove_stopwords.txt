early life education
arthur riggs born hospital modesto california near familys home ceres california family lost farm great depression moved san bernardino ca riggs attended san bernardino high school helped father managed trailer park build fix things mother nurse gave chemistry set encourage interest chemistry biology
riggs earned undergraduate degree chemistry university california riverside conducted doctoral thesis work california institute technology herschel k mitchell obtaining phd biochemistry
mammalian dna replication
graduate students caltech joel huberman collaborated work later led classic paper mammalian dna replication published wanted use radioactive nucleotides tag replicating dna use photographic film create physical image happens replication advisors interested experiment huberman riggs proposed students continued work using method able measure rate dna replication results indicated chromosomal dna contained many sections replicated independently replication occurred directions sections origin results important helped extend scientists understanding mammalian dna replication herschel mitchell giuseppe attardi advisors felt papers published huberman riggs names without advisors done work independently
proteindna interaction
riggs went postdoctoral work salk institute melvin cohn studying proteindna interactions time two proteins identified binding dna controlling gene expression lambda repressor lac repressor riggs worked isolation lac repressor using affinity chromatography walter gilbert benno mllerhill first successfully identify using different technique however arthur riggs first purify usable quantities transcription factor protein lac repressor suzanne bourgeois developed nitrocellulose filter binding assay method much faster existing methods analysis work resulted another wellknown series papers lac repressor bacterial gene regulation opening new areas research theory
city hope national medical center
result interest gene regulation mammalian cells riggs became curious x chromosome inactivation one two copies x chromosome present female mammal inactivated one codiscoverers susumu ohno worked city hope national medical center riggs joined department molecular biology city hope national medical center associate research scientist became senior researcher associate chair division biology chair division biology
somatostatin insulin
initially riggs continued lac repressor work examining gene regulation bacteria richard e dickerson john rosenberg keiichi itakura hoped mix e coli lac repressor lac operator crystallize examine proteindna binding crystals using highresolution dna methylation analysis able clone itakuras lac operator confirm would work live bacteria important result also developed method researchers add short linkers dna sequences insert bacteria
riggs itakura collaborated herbert boyer genentech used recombinant dna technology become first produce human protein e coli following advice riggs itakura group successfully produced hormone somatostatin proof concept attempted work complicated insulin molecule able link somatostatin larger protein betagalactosidase produce e coli isolate separate somatostatin galactosidase somatostatin first mammalian hormone produced bacteria
next group created gene coding human insulin one ten times times larger somatostatin encoding succeeded producing artificial insulin riggs received juvenile diabetes foundation research award work
dna methylation epigenetics antibody engineering
riggs hypothesized x chromosome inactivation might act ways analogous restriction enzyme complexes e coli eventually published theoretical paper topic correctly predicted key mechanism dna methylation epigenetics ongoing research helped understand mechanisms dna methylation gene regulation
riggs became convinced type splicing approach used recombinant dna also could used create antibodies riggs worked shmuel cabilly fundamental technology required artificial synthesis antibody molecules riggs group characterized genes antibodies cloned bacteria able describe patent method making humanized monoclonal antibodies using mouse antibodies created gene sequence would trick bacteria manufacturing humanized antibodies rather mouse antibodies technology used create smart cancer drugs herceptin rituxan avastin
riggs published work done gerd pfeifer methylome genome human b cell examining dna methylation pattern entire genome attempt find patterns epigenetic mark methylcytosine dna methylation believed pass information parent cells daughter cells functioning secondary highfidelity information encoding system blood donated isolation b cells riggs could anyones dna pioneer dna methylation epigenetics something special methylome riggs continues work epigenetic programming cell designing proteins bind dna highly specified ways wherever desired
administration
riggs closely involved institutional expansion city hope riggs helped created city hope graduate school biological sciences renamed irell manella graduate school biological sciences may riggs served founding dean
riggs time chair division biology city hope restructured response million grant arnold mabel beckman foundation established beckman research institute city hope creation riggs chair division biology beckman research institute riggs served director beckman research institute
