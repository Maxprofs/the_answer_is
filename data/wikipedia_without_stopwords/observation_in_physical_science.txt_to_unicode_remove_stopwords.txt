celestial observation measurement angular distance celestial body observer horizon usually sextant
celestial observation measurements absolute rather vary according observed recorded scientists may able make correlations based naked eye observations findings require tools additional recordings result anything significant recordings include pictorial observations celestial body gravitational lensing galactic light recordings light sparks spectroscope although measure angular distance like fist explained typical celestial observation take account light emissions transfer across sky clusters observations simple observing skies celestial bodies recording seen naked eye telescope science able reach astronomical recordings involve processes technological devices take account parameters correlations finds great achievement cases
parameters
every scientific aspect years numerous variables parameters although originate mathematics simply involves set measurable independent factors define system determine behaviour experimentation parameters celestial observation makes significant science include position timing wavelength within parameters observers determine secpifications remain consistent allow correlations accurate applications taking account every scientist must observe understand extent parameters effects find unknown observation otherwise data unvaild seen unreliable
position
position indicates direction observation made allow observer point telescope accurately least onetenth minute connection position important due process earths rotation axis since earth rotates within hours position celestial body change therefore important documented properly recording celestial observation
time
time plays important role astronomical observations start end exposure since light travels million meters per second ones viewing time shortlived therefore recording time observations result time elapse celestial body light exposure naked eye
wavelength
wavelength corresponds filters light isolated pass celestial body spectrum light large yet small naked eye therefore recording wavelength shows exactly color spectrum emitted mainly measurement wavelength used characterize radiation frequency important astronomical senses
observation types
pictorial observations
pictorial observation simply interpretation viewed subject transcribed drawing better expressed understood ancient astronomy started civilizations china egypt greece india theories importance stars planets existence galaxy scientist used telescopes calendars map position celestial bodies date according earth rotational period cultures used pictorial observations document findings celebrate ceremonies symbols greater power yet understood like galaxy structures planet formation ttime moving technology celestial observation physical science astronomy
gravitational lensing
gravitational lensing observation includes bending light span galaxy recently lee rannals redorbitcom blogs cited researchers able see light galaxy approximately billion lightyears away earth cluster celestial bodies fact possible shows sciences best achievement estimate far long galaxy existence perhaps even beginning viewing even bigger galaxies across skies
light emissions
light emissions measured spectroscope achieved using multilayered structures smallmoleculed organic semiconductors must controlled shape emission profile spatial distribution emitting excitons across active layer
devices processes
tools
methods observation range small scale base observatories large scale satellite imaging systems tools observation include naked eye telescope spherical astrolabe allow observer view light emission across galaxy simply within quadrant appers star planet galaxy cluster common tool observations telescope since easily used accessible public use observatory satellite imaging far advanced typically reserved scientific findings mirrors lenses important imaging observations focus light emissions one focal point display whole image
process
science would exist recorded findings history ancient civilization people documenting changes culture especially physical science astronomy celestial observations made simple men resulted investigations todays scientists theories celestial bodies made pictorial observations expanded upon satellite imaging telescopic recordings one processes observation relates wish convey discover words exposure wish filter sky document position time extend effect celestial body view makes astronomical process scientific much chemical biological physical
