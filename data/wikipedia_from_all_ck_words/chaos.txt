the 19th-century british painter j.m.w turner was one of the first in that century to use yellow to create moods and emotions the way romantic composers were using music his painting rain steam and speed - the great central railway was dominated by glowing yellow clouds
georges seurat use the new synthetic colors in his experimental paintings composed of tiny points of primary colors particularly in his famous sunday afternoon on the isle de la grand jatte (188486) he did not know that the new synthetic yellow pigment zinc yellow or zinc chromate which he used in the light green lawns was highly unstable and would quickly turn brown
the painter vincent van gogh was a particular admirer of the color yellow the color of sunshine writing to his sister from the south of france in 1888 he wrote now we are having beautiful warm windless weather that is very beneficial to me the sun a light that for lack of a better word i can only call yellow bright sulfur yellow pale lemon gold how beautiful yellow is! in arles van gogh painted sunflowers inside a small house he rented at 2 place lamartine a house painted what van gogh called buttery yellow. van gogh was one of the first artists to use commercially manufactured paints rather than paints he made himself he used the traditional yellow ochre but also chrome yellow first made in 1809 and cadmium yellow first made in 1820
at the end of the 19th century in 1895 a new popular art form began to appear in new york newspapers the color comic strip it took advantage of a new color printing process which used color separation and three different colors of ink magenta cyan and yellow plus black to create all the colors on the page one of the first characters in the new comic strips was a humorous boy of the new york streets named mickey dugen more commonly known as the yellow kid from the yellow nightshirt he wore he gave his name (and color) to the whole genre of popular sensational journalism which became known as yellow journalism

eliasson used humidifiers to create a fine mist in the air via a mixture of sugar and water as well as a semi-circular disc made up of hundreds of monochromatic lamps which radiated yellow light the ceiling of the hall was covered with a huge mirror in which visitors could see themselves as tiny black shadows against a mass of light
== science and natureedit ==
=== light optics and colorimetryedit ===
yellow is the color the human eye sees when it looks at light within the wavelengths of 570 and 590 nanometers the wavelength of light between green and orange
in the language of optics yellow is the evoked by light that stimulates both the l and m (long and medium wavelength) cone cells of the retina about equally with no significant stimulation of the s (short-wavelength) cone cells light with a wavelength of 570590 nm is yellow as is light with a suitable mixture of red and green yellow's traditional ryb complementary color is purple violet or indigo while its colorimetrically defined complementary color in both rgb and cmyk color spaces is blue
==== in color printing and on a computer screenedit ====
in color printing yellow is one of the three colors of ink along with magenta and cyan which can be overlaid in the right combination along with black to print any full color image (see the cmyk color model)
the yellow on a color television or computer screen is created in a completely different way by combining green and red light at the right level of intensity (see rgb color model)
the most intense yellow in the eight-bit rgb color model is rgb yellow or x11 yellow  yellow is a secondary color in an additive rgb space
the measured light spectrum from yellow pixels on a typical computer display is complex and very unlike the reflectance spectrum of a yellow object such as a banana
process yellow (also known as pigment yellow printer's yellow and canary yellow") is one of the three colors typically used as subtractive primary colors along with magenta and cyan the cmyk system for color printing is based on using four inks one of which is a yellow color this is in itself a standard color and a fairly narrow range of yellow inks or pigments are used process yellow is based on a colorant that reflects the preponderance of red and green light and absorbs most blue light as in the reflectance spectra shown in the figure on the lower right
because of the characteristics of paint pigments and use of different color wheels painters traditionally regard the complement of yellow as the color indigo or blue-violet
process yellow is not an rgb color and there is no fixed conversion from cmyk primaries to rgb different formulations are used for printer's ink so there can be variations in the printed color that is pure yellow ink
the first recorded use of canary yellow as a color name in english was in 1789
==== complementary colorsedit ====
traditionally the complementary color of yellow is violet the two colors are opposite each other on the color wheel long used by painters vincent van gogh an avid student of color theory used combinations of yellow and violet in several of his paintings for the maximum contrast and harmony
hunt defines that two colors are complementary when it is possible to reproduce the tristimulus values of a specified achromatic stimulus by an additive mixture of these two stimuli. that is when two colored lights can be mixed to match a specified white (achromatic non-colored) light the colors of those two lights are complementary this definition however does not constrain what version of white will be specified in the nineteenth century the scientists grassmann and helmholtz did experiments in which they concluded that finding a good complement for spectral yellow was difficult but that the result was indigo that is a wavelength that today's color scientists would call violet helmholtz says yellow and indigo blue are complements grassmann reconstructs newton's category boundaries in terms of wavelengths and says this indigo therefore falls within the limits of color between which according to helmholtz the complementary colors of yellow lie.
newton's own color circle has yellow directly opposite the boundary between indigo and violet these results that the complement of yellow is a wavelength shorter than 450 nm are derivable from the modern cie 1931 system of colorimetry if it is assumed that the yellow is about 580 nm or shorter wavelength and the specified white is the color of a blackbody radiator of temperature 2800 k or lower (that is the white of an ordinary incandescent light bulb) more typically with a daylight-colored or around 5000 to 6000 k white the complement of yellow will be in the blue wavelength range which is the standard modern answer for the complement of yellow
==== lasersedit ====
lasers emitting in the yellow part of the spectrum are less common and more expensive than most other colors in commercial products diode pumped solid state (dpss) technology is employed to create the yellow light an infrared laser diode at 808 nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (nd:yvo4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (nd:yag) and induces it to emit at two frequencies (281.76 thz and 223.39 thz 1064 nm and 1342 nm wavelengths) simultaneously this deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium titanium and phosphorus (ktp) whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is the sum of the two incident beams (505.15 thz) in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 593.5 nm ("yellow") this wavelength is also available though even more rarely from a heliumneon laser however this not a true yellow as it exceeds 590 nm a variant of this same dpss technology using slightly different starting frequencies was made available in 2010 producing a wavelength of 589 nm which is considered a true yellow color the use of yellow lasers at 589 nm and 594 nm have recently become more widespread thanks to the field of optogenetics
=== astronomyedit ===
stars of spectral classes f and g such as our sun sol have color temperatures that make them look yellowish the first astronomer to classify stars according to their color was f g w struve in 1827 one of his classifications was flavae or yellow and this roughly corresponded to stars in the modern spectral range f5 to k0 the strmgren photometric system for stellar classification includes a y or yellow filter that is centered at a wavelength of 550 nm and has a bandwidth of 2030 nm
=== biologyedit ===
autumn leaves yellow flowers bananas oranges and other yellow fruit all contain carotenoids yellow and red organic pigments that are found in the chloroplasts and chromoplasts of plants and some other photosynthetic organisms like algae some bacteria and some fungi they serve two key roles in plants and algae they absorb light energy for use in photosynthesis and they protect the green chlorophyll from photodamage
in late summer as daylight hours shorten and temperatures cool the veins that carry fluids into and out of the leaf are gradually closed off the water and mineral intake into the leaf is reduced slowly at first and then more rapidly it is during this time that the chlorophyll begins to decrease as the chlorophyll diminishes the yellow and red carotenoids become more and more visible creating the classic autumn leaf color
carotenoids are common in many living things they give the characteristic color to carrots corn daffodils rutabagas buttercups and bananas they are responsible for the red of cooked lobsters the pink of flamingoes and salmon and the yellow of canaries and egg yolks
xanthophylls are the most common yellow pigments that form one of two major divisions of the carotenoid group the name is from greek xanthos ( yellow") + phyllon ( leaf") xanthophylls are most commonly found in the leaves of green plants but they also find their way into animals through the food they eat for example the yellow color of chicken egg yolks fat and skin comes from the feed the chickens consume chicken farmers know this and often add xanthophylls usually lutein to make the egg yolks more yellow
bananas are green when they are picked because of the chlorophyll their skin contains once picked they begin to ripen hormones in the bananas convert amino acids into ethylene gas which stimulates the production of several enzymes these enzymes start to change the color texture and flavor of the banana the green chlorophyll supply is stopped and the yellow color of the carotenoids replaces it eventually as the enzymes continue their work the cell walls break down and the bananas turn brown
