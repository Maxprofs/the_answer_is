a norepinephrine releasing agent (nra) is a type of drug which induces the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine from the pre-synaptic neuron into the synapse this in turn leads to increased extracellular concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine therefore an increase in adrenergic neurotransmission
== uses and examples ==
nras are used for a variety of clinical indications including the following
for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) - e.g. amphetamine methamphetamine pemoline
as anorectics in the treatment of obesity - e.g. amphetamine phentermine benzphetamine phenmetrazine aminorex
as wakefulness-promoting agents in the treatment of narcolepsy - e.g. amphetamine methamphetamine
as nasal decongestants - e.g. levomethamphetamine propylhexedrine ephedrine pseudoephedrine phenylpropanolamine
they are also used as recreational drugs though this is typically reserved only for those that also induce the release of serotonin and/or dopamine like amphetamine methamphetamine mdma mephedrone and 4-methylaminorex among others
cathine and cathinone are nras found naturally in catha edulis ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are also found naturally in ephedra sinica both of these plants are used medicinally (and recreationally as well regarding the former) the endogenous trace amines phenethylamine and tyramine are nras found in many animals including humans
selective nras include ephedrine pseudoephedrine phenylpropanolamine levomethamphetamine phentermine and bupropion
