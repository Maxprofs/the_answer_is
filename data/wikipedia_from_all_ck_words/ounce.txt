an ounce (abbreviated oz apothecary symbol ) is a unit of mass used in some systems of measurement
whilst various definitions have been used throughout history two remain in common use the avoirdupois ounce equal to approximately 28.3 g and the troy ounce of about 31.1 g the avoirdupois ounce is widely used as part of the united states customary and british imperial systems but the troy ounce is now only commonly used for the mass of precious metals such as gold
== etymology ==
ounce derives from latin uncia a unit that was one twelfth (112) of the roman pound (libra) ounce was borrowed twice first into old english as ynsan or yndsan from an unattested vulgar latin form with ts for c before i (palatalization) and second into middle english through anglo-norman and middle french (unce once ounce) the abbreviation oz came later from the cognate italian word onza (now spelled oncia)
inch comes from the same latin word but differs because it was borrowed into old english and underwent i-mutation or umlaut (u y) and palatalization (k ch)

==== international avoirdupois ounce ====
the international avoirdupois ounce is defined as exactly 28.349523125 g under the international yard and pound agreement of 1959 signed by the united states and countries of the commonwealth of nations
in the avoirdupois system sixteen ounces make up a avoirdupois pound and the avoirdupois pound is defined as 7000 grains one avoirdupois ounce is therefore equal to 437.5 grains
the ounce is still a standard unit in the united states but in the united kingdom it is now only used informally having ceased to be a legal unit of measure in 2000
==== international troy ounce ====
a troy ounce is equal to 480 grains consequently the international troy ounce is equal to exactly 31.1034768 grams there are 12 troy ounces in the now obsolete troy pound
today the troy ounce is used only to express the mass of precious metals such as gold platinum palladium rhodium or silver bullion coins are the most common products produced and marketed in troy ounces but precious metal bars also exist in gram and kilogram (kg) sizes (a kilogram bullion bar contains 32.15074657 troy ounces.)
for historical measurement of gold
a fine ounce is a troy ounce of pure gold content in a gold bar computed as fineness multiplied by gross weight
a standard ounce is a troy ounce of 22 carat gold 91.66% pure (an 11 to 1 proportion of gold to alloy material)
in modern day an ounce of gold (1 troy ounce) is referred as a 99.99% pure gold piece or gold grains (gold shot)
==== metric ounces ====
the unit metric ounce is 25 grams and 20 make the metric pound of 500 grams
some countries have redefined their ounces in the metric system for example the german apothecaries ounce of 30 grams is very close to the previously widespread nuremberg ounce but the divisions and multiples come out in metric
in 1820 the dutch redefined their ounce (in dutch ons) as 100 grams dutch amendments to the metric system such as an ons or 100 grams has been inherited adopted and taught in indonesia beginning in elementary school it is also listed as standard usage in indonesia's national dictionary the kamus besar bahasa indonesia and the government's official elementaryschool curriculum
