formation orogen accomplished part tectonic processes subduction continent rides forcefully oceanic plate noncollisional orogens convergence two continents collisional orogens
orogeny usually produces long arcuate arcuare bend like bow structures known orogenic belts generally orogenic belts consist long parallel strips rock exhibiting similar characteristics along length belt orogenic belts associated subduction zones consume crust produce volcanoes build island arcs arcuate structure attributed rigidity descending plate island arc cusps related tears descending lithosphere island arcs may added continent orogenic event
