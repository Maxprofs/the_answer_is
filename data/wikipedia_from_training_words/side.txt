== history ==
strabo and arrian both record that side was founded by greek settlers from cyme in aeolis a region of western anatolia this most likely occurred in the 7th century bc its tutelary deity was athena whose head adorned its coinage
dating from the tenth century b.c. its coinage bore the head of athena (minerva) the patroness of the city with a legend its people a piratical horde quickly forgot their own language to adopt that of the aborigines
possessing a good harbour for small-craft boats side's natural geography made it one of the most important places in pamphylia and one of the most important trade centres in the region according to arrian when settlers from cyme came to side they could not understand the dialect after a short while the influence of this indigenous tongue was so great that the newcomers forgot their native greek and started using the language of side excavations have revealed several inscriptions written in this language the inscriptions dating from the 3rd and 2nd centuries bc remain undeciphered but testify that the local language was still in use several centuries after colonisation another object found in the excavations at side a basalt column base from the 7th century bc and attributable to the neo-hittites provides further evidence of the site's early history the name side may be anatolian in origin meaning pomegranate
next to no information exists concerning side under lydian and persian sovereignty
=== alexander the great ===
alexander the great occupied side without a struggle in 333 bc alexander left only a single garrison behind to occupy the city this occupation in turn introduced the people of side to hellenistic culture which flourished from the 4th to the 1st century bc after alexander's death side fell under the control of one of alexander's generals ptolemy i soter who declared himself king of egypt in 305 bc the ptolemaic dynasty controlled side until it was captured by the seleucid empire in the 2nd century bc yet despite these occupations side managed to preserve some autonomy grew prosperous and became an important cultural centre
in 190 bc a fleet from the greek island city-state of rhodes supported by rome and pergamum defeated the seleucid king antiochus the great's fleet which was under the command of the fugitive carthaginian general hannibal the defeat of hannibal and antiochus the great meant that side freed itself from the overlord-ship of the seleucid empire the treaty of apamea (188 bc) forced antiochus to abandon all european territories and to cede all of asia minor north of the taurus mountains to pergamum however the dominion of pergamum only reached de facto as far as perga leaving eastern pamphylia in a state of uncertain freedom this led attalus ii philadelphus to construct a new harbour in the city of attalia (the present antalya) although side already possessed an important harbour of its own between 188 and 36 bc side minted its own money tetradrachms showing nike and a laurel wreath (the sign of victory)

== ruins ==
the great ruins are among the most notable in asia minor they cover a large promontory where a wall and a moat separate it from the mainland during medieval times the wall and moat were repaired and the promontory houses a wealth of structures
there are colossal ruins of a theatre complex the largest of pamphylia built much like a roman amphitheatre that relies on arches to support the sheer verticals the roman style was adopted because side lacked a convenient hillside that could be hollowed out in the usual greek fashion more typical of asia minor the theatre is less preserved than the theatre at aspendos but it is almost as large seating 15,000 - 20,000 people with time and the shifting of the earth the scena wall has collapsed over the stage and the proscenium is in a cataract of loose blocks it was converted into an open-air sanctuary with two chapels during byzantine times (5th or 6th century)
the well-preserved city walls provide an entrance to the site through the hellenistic main gate (megale pyle) of the ancient city although this gate from the 2nd century bc is badly damaged next comes the colonnaded street whose marble columns are no longer extant all that remains are a few broken stubs near the old roman baths the street leads to the a public bath restored as a museum displaying statues and sarcophagi from the roman period next is the square agora with the remains of the round tyche and fortuna temple (2nd century bc) a periptery with twelve columns in the middle in later times it was used as a trading centre where pirates sold slaves the remains of the theatre which was used for gladiator fights and later as a church and the monumental gate date back to the 2nd century the early roman temple of dionysus is near the theatre the fountain gracing the entrance is restored at the left side are the remains of a byzantine basilica a public bath has also been restored
the remaining ruins of side include three temples an aqueduct and a nymphaeum side's nymphaeum a grotto with a natural water supply dedicated to the nymphs was an artificial grotto or fountain building of elaborate design
there is also a virtually unknown but expansive site up in the taurus foothills several miles inland known locally as seleucia virtually unknown to the outside world and not represented on the internet at all it is the roman garrison built by marc anthony to support the city of side it covers at least a couple of square miles and is almost completely unexcavated apart from two weeks in 1975 when the turkish government funded two weeks of excavations the site was apparently finally abandoned in the 7th century when an earthquake caused the spring which fed the site with water to dry up completely many of the buildings are in remarkably good shape particularly since due to the lack of available stone a significant quantity of the sites stonework contains egg and gravel based concrete blocks
turkish archaeologists have been excavating side since 1947 and intermittently continue to do so
