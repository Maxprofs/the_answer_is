a landform is a natural feature of the earth's surface landforms together make up a given terrain and their arrangement on the landscape or the study of same is known as topography typical landforms include hills mountains plateaus canyons valleys as well as shoreline features such as bays peninsulas and seas including submerged features such as mid-ocean ridges volcanoes and the great ocean basins
== physical characteristicsedit ==
landforms are categorized by characteristic physical attributes such as elevation slope orientation stratification rock exposure and soil type
gross physical features or landforms include intuitive elements such as berms mounds hills ridges cliffs valleys rivers peninsulas and numerous other structural and size-scaled (i.e ponds vs lakes hills vs mountains) elements including various kinds of inland and oceanic waterbodies and sub-surface features
== hierarchy of classesedit ==
oceans and continents exemplify the highest-order landforms landform elements are parts of a high-order landforms that can be further identified and systematically given a cohesive definition such as hill-tops shoulders saddles foreslopes and backslopes
some generic landform elements including pits peaks channels ridges passes pools and plains
terrain (or relief) is the third or vertical dimension of land surface topography is the study of terrain although the word is often used as a synonym for relief itself when relief is described underwater the term bathymetry is used in cartography many different techniques are used to describe relief including contour lines and tin (triangulated irregular network)
elementary landforms (segments facets relief units) are the smallest homogeneous divisions of the land surface at the given scale/resolution these are areas with relatively homogeneous morphometric properties bounded by lines of discontinuity a plateau or a hill can be observed at various scales ranging from few hundred meters to hundreds of kilometers hence the spatial distribution of landforms is often scale-dependent as is the case for soils and geological strata
a number of factors ranging from plate tectonics to erosion and deposition can generate and affect landforms biological factors can also influence landforms for example note the role of vegetation in the development of dune systems and salt marshes and the work of corals and algae in the formation of coral reefs
landforms do not include man-made features such as canals ports and many harbors and geographic features such as deserts forests and grasslands
many of the terms are not restricted to refer to features of the planet earth and can be used to describe surface features of other planets and similar objects in the universe examples are mountains hills polar caps and valleys which are found on all of the terrestrial planets
== recent developmentsedit ==
landforms may be extracted from a digital elevation model using some automated techniques where the data has been gathered by modern satellites and stereoscopic aerial surveillance cameras until recently compiling the data found in such data sets required time consuming and expensive techniques involving many man-hours the most detailed dems available are measured directly using lidar techniques in 2013 bangs et al demonstrated the inherent differences in so-called 5 meter resolution dems using sources of higher and lower resolution
