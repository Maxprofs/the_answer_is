enthalpy fusion also known latent heat fusion change enthalpy resulting heating given quantity substance change state solid liquid temperature occurs melting point
enthalpy fusion latent heat melting introduction heat cannot observed temperature change temperature remains constant process latent heat fusion enthalpy change amount substance melts heat fusion referenced unit mass usually called specific heat fusion molar heat fusion refers enthalpy change per amount substance moles
liquid phase higher internal energy solid phase means energy must supplied solid order melt energy released liquid freezes molecules liquid experience weaker intermolecular forces higher potential energy kind bonddissociation energy intermolecular forces
liquid water cooled temperature falls steadily drops line freezing point c temperature remains constant freezing point water crystallizes water completely frozen temperature continues fall
enthalpy fusion almost always positive quantity helium known exception helium negative enthalpy fusion temperatures k helium also slightly negative enthalpy fusion k means appropriate constant pressures substances freeze addition heat

solubility predictionedit
heat fusion also used predict solubility solids liquids provided ideal solution obtained mole fraction solute saturation function heat fusion melting point solid temperature solution
r gas constant example solubility paracetamol water k predicted
equals solubility grams per liter
deviation real solubility gl error reduced additional heat capacity parameter taken account
proofedit
equilibrium chemical potentials pure solvent pure solid identical
gas constant temperature
rearranging gives
since
heat fusion difference chemical potential pure liquid pure solid follows
application gibbshelmholtz equation
ultimately gives
integration
end result obtained
