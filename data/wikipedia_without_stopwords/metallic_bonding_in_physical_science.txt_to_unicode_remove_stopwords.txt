history
chemistry developed science became clear metals formed large majority periodic table elements great progress made description salts formed reactions acids advent electrochemistry became clear metals generally go solution positively charged ions oxidation reactions metals became well understood electrochemical series picture emerged metals positive ions held together ocean negative electrons
advent quantum mechanics picture given formal interpretation form free electron model extension nearly free electron model models electrons seen gas traveling lattice solid energy essentially isotropic depends square magnitude direction momentum vector k threedimensional kspace set points highest filled levels fermi surface therefore sphere nearly free correction model boxlike brillouin zones added kspace periodic potential experienced ionic lattice thus mildly breaking isotropy
advent xray diffraction thermal analysis made possible study structure crystalline solids including metals alloys construction phase diagrams became accessible despite progress nature intermetallic compounds alloys largely remained mystery study often empirical chemists generally steered away anything seem follow daltons laws multiple proportions problem considered domain different science metallurgy
almostfree electron model eagerly taken researchers field notably humerothery attempt explain certain intermetallic alloys certain compositions would form others would initially attempts quite successful idea add electrons inflate spherical fermiballoon inside series brillouinboxes determine certain box would full indeed predicted fairly large number observed alloy compositions unfortunately soon cyclotron resonance became available shape balloon could determined found assumption balloon spherical hold except perhaps case caesium reduced many conclusions examples model sometimes give whole series correct predictions yet still wrong
freeelectron debacle showed researchers model assuming ions sea free electrons needed modification number quantum mechanical models band structure calculations based molecular orbitals density functional theory developed models one either departs atomic orbitals neutral atoms share electrons case density functional theory departs total electron density freeelectron picture nevertheless remained dominant one education
electronic band structure model became major focus study metals even study semiconductors together electronic states vibrational states also shown form bands rudolf peierls showed case onedimensional row metallic atoms say hydrogen instability arise would lead breakup chain individual molecules sparked interest general question collective metallic bonding stable localized form bonding take place much research went study clustering metal atoms
powerful concept band structure proved description metallic bonding drawback remains oneelectron approximation multitudinous manybody problem words energy states electron described electrons simply form homogeneous background researchers like mott hubbard realized perhaps appropriate strongly delocalized pelectrons delectrons even felectrons interaction electrons atomic displacements local environment may become stronger delocalization leads broad bands thus transition localized unpaired electrons itinerant ones partaking metallic bonding became comprehensible
nature metallic bonding
combination two phenomena gives rise metallic bonding delocalization electrons availability far larger number delocalized energy states delocalized electrons latter could called electron deficiency
d
graphene example twodimensional metallic bonding metallic bonds similar aromatic bonding benzene naphthalene anthracene ovalene
atomthick layer hexagonal boron nitride bn obtained isoelectronic graphene material boron nitrogen atoms alternate semiconductor exemplifying delocalization necessary sufficient requirement conductivity electrical conductivity occur graphene like bands overlap making semimetal partly filled bands fulfilling requirement conductivity
d
metal aromaticity metal clusters another example delocalization time often threedimensional entities metals take delocalization principle extreme one could say crystal metal represents single molecule conduction electrons delocalized three dimensions means inside metal one generally distinguish molecules metallic bonding neither intra intermolecular nonmolecular would perhaps better term metallic bonding mostly nonpolar even alloys little difference among electronegativities atoms participating bonding interaction pure elemental metals none thus metallic bonding extremely delocalized communal form covalent bonding sense metallic bonding new type bonding therefore describes bonding present chunk condensed matter crystalline solid liquid even glass metallic vapors contrast often atomic hg times contain molecules like na held together conventional covalent bond correct speak single metallic bond
delocalization pronounced pelectrons caesium strong electrons virtually free caesium atoms form gas constrained surface metal caesium therefore picture cs ions held together negatively charged electron gas inaccurate elements electrons less free still experience potential metal atoms sometimes quite strongly require intricate quantum mechanical treatment eg tight binding atoms viewed neutral much like carbon atoms benzene d especially felectrons delocalization strong explains electrons able continue behaving unpaired electrons retain spin adding interesting magnetic properties metals
electron deficiency mobility
metal atoms contain electrons valence shells relative periods energy levels electron deficient elements communal sharing change remain far available energy states shared electrons requirements conductivity therefore fulfilled strong delocalization partly filled energy bands electrons therefore easily change one energy state slightly different one thus become delocalized forming sea electrons permeating lattice also able migrate lattice external electrical field imposed leading electrical conductivity without field electrons moving equally directions field adjust state slightly adopting different wave vector consequence moving one way net current result
freedom conduction electrons migrate also give metal atoms layers capacity slide past locally bonds easily broken replaced new ones deformation process affect communal metallic bonding much gives rise metals typical characteristic phenomena malleability ductility particularly true pure elements presence dissolved impurities defects lattice function cleavage points may get blocked material becomes harder gold example soft pure form karat jewellery alloys karat lower preferred
metals typically also good conductors heat conduction electrons contribute partly phenomenon collective ie delocalized vibrations atoms known phonons travel solid wave contribute strongly
however latter also holds substance like diamond conducts heat quite well electricity latter consequence fact delocalization absent diamond simply carbon electron deficient electron deficiency important point distinguishing metallic conventional covalent bonding thus amend expression given metallic bonding extremely delocalized communal form electron deficient covalent bonding
metallic radius
metallic radius defined onehalf distance two adjacent metal ions metallic lattice radius depends nature atom well environmentspecifically coordination number cn turn depends temperature applied pressure
comparing periodic trends size atoms often desirable apply socalled goldschmidt correction converts radii values atoms would coordinated since metallic radii always biggest highest coordination number correction less dense coordinations involves multiplying x x specifically cn x cn x cn x correction named victor goldschmidt obtained numerical values quoted
radii follow general periodic trends decrease across period due increase effective nuclear charge offset increased number valence electrons radii also increase group due increase principal quantum number rows lanthanide contraction observed little increase radius group due presence poorly shielding f orbitals
strength bond
atoms metals strong attractive force much energy required overcome therefore metals often high boiling points tungsten k extremely high remarkable exception elements zinc group zn cd hg electron configuration ends ns comes resemble noble gas configuration like helium going periodic table energy distance empty np orbitals becomes larger metals therefore relatively volatile avoided ultrahigh vacuum systems
otherwise metallic bonding strong even molten metals gallium even though gallium melt heat ones hand room temperature boiling point far copper molten gallium therefore nonvolatile liquid thanks strong metallic bonding
strong bonding metals liquid form demonstrates energy metallic bond strong function direction metallic bond lack bond directionality direct consequence electron delocalization best understood contrast directional bonding covalent bonds energy metallic bond thus mostly function amount electrons surround metallic atom exemplified embedded atom model typically results metals assuming relatively simple closepacked crystal structures fcc bcc hcp
given high enough cooling rates appropriate alloy composition metallic bonding occur even glasses amorphous structure
much biochemistry mediated weak interaction metal ions biomolecules interactions associated conformational change measured using dual polarisation interferometry
solubility compound formation
metals insoluble water organic solvents unless undergo reaction typically oxidation reaction robs metal atoms itinerant electrons destroying metallic bonding however metals often readily soluble retaining metallic character bonding gold example dissolves easily mercury even room temperature even solid metals solubility extensive structures two metals even complete solid solubility case electrum alloys silver gold times however two metals form alloys different structures either two parents one could call materials metal compounds materials metallic bonding typically molecular daltons law integral proportions valid often range stoichiometric ratios achieved better abandon concepts pure substance solute cases speak phases instead study phases traditionally domain metallurgy chemistry although two fields overlap considerably
localization clustering bonding bonds
metallic bonding complicated compounds necessarily involve constituent elements equally quite possible element partake one could picture conduction electrons flowing around like river around island big rock possible observe elements partake eg looking core levels xray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectrum element partakes peaks tend skewed
intermetallic materials eg exhibit metal clusters reminiscent molecules compounds topic chemistry metallurgy formation clusters could seen way condense localize electron deficient bonding bonds localized nature hydrogen extreme example form condensation high pressures metal core planet jupiter could said held together combination metallic bonding high pressure induced gravity lower pressures however bonding becomes entirely localized regular covalent bond localization complete familiar h gas results similar argument holds element like boron though electron deficient compared carbon form metal instead number complicated structures icosahedral b clusters dominate charge density waves related phenomenon
phenomena involve movement atoms towards away interpreted coupling electronic vibrational states ie phonons material different electronphonon interaction thought cause different result low temperatures superconductivity rather blocking mobility charge carriers forming electron pairs localized bonds cooperpairs formed longer experience resistance mobility
optical properties
