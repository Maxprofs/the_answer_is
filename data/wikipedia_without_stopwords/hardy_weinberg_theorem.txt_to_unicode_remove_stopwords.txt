principle named g h hardy wilhelm weinberg first demonstrated mathematically
derivation
consider population monoecious diploids organism produces male female gametes equal frequency two alleles gene locus organisms reproduce random union gametes gene pool population model locus population two alleles occur initial frequencies fa p fa q respectively allele frequencies generation obtained pooling together alleles genotype generation according expected contribution homozygote heterozygote genotypes respectively
different ways form genotypes next generation shown punnett square proportion genotype equal product row column allele frequencies current generation
sum entries p pq q genotype frequencies must sum one
note p q binomial expansion p q p pq q gives relationships
summing elements punnett square binomial expansion obtain expected genotype proportions among offspring single generation
frequencies define hardyweinberg equilibrium mentioned genotype frequencies first generation need equal genotype frequencies initial generation eg faa faa however genotype frequencies future times equal hardyweinberg frequencies eg ftaa faa follows since genotype frequencies next generation depend allele frequencies current generation calculated equations preserved initial generation
general case dioecious diploids organisms either male female reproduce random mating individuals necessary calculate genotype frequencies nine possible matings parental genotype aa aa aa either sex weighted expected genotype contributions mating equivalently one considers six unique diploiddiploid combinations
constructs punnett square calculate contribution next generations genotypes contributions weighted according probability diploiddiploid combination follows multinomial distribution k example probability mating combination aaaa ftaaftaa result aa genotype overall resulting genotype frequencies calculated
one show allele frequencies time equal time constant time similarly genotype frequencies depend allele frequencies time also constant time
either monoecious dioecious organisms either allele genotype proportions initially unequal either sex shown constant proportions obtained one generation random mating dioecious organisms heterogametic gene locus located x chromosome shown allele frequencies initially unequal two sexes eg xx females xy males humans fa heterogametic sex chases fa homogametic sex previous generation equilibrium reached weighted average two initial frequencies
deviations hardyweinberg equilibrium
seven assumptions underlying hardyweinberg equilibrium follows
organisms diploid
sexual reproduction occurs
generations non overlapping
mating random
population size infinitely large
allele frequencies equal sexes
migration mutation selection
violations hardyweinberg assumptions cause deviations expectation affects population depends assumptions violated
random mating hwp states population given genotypic frequencies called hardyweinberg proportions single generation random mating within population random mating assumption violated population hardyweinberg proportions common cause nonrandom mating inbreeding causes increase homozygosity genes
population violates one following four assumptions population may continue hardyweinberg proportions generation allele frequencies change time
selection general causes allele frequencies change often quite rapidly directional selection eventually leads loss alleles except favored one forms selection balancing selection lead equilibrium without loss alleles
mutation subtle effect allele frequencies mutation rates order change allele frequency order recurrent mutation maintain alleles population even strong selection
migration genetically links two populations together general allele frequencies become homogeneous among populations models migration inherently include nonrandom mating wahlund effect example models hardyweinberg proportions normally valid
small population size cause random change allele frequencies due sampling effect called genetic drift sampling effects important allele present small number copies
sex linkage
gene sex linked heterogametic sex eg mammalian males avian females one copy gene termed hemizygous homogametic sex eg human females two copies genotype frequencies equilibrium p q heterogametic sex p pq q homogametic sex
example humans redgreen colorblindness xlinked recessive trait western european males trait affects q whereas affects females compared q close hardyweinberg proportions
population brought together males females different allele frequency subpopulation males females allele frequency male population next generation follow female population son receives x chromosome mother population converges equilibrium quickly
generalizations
simple derivation generalized two alleles polyploidy

generalization polyploidy
hardyweinberg principle may also generalized polyploid systems organisms two copies chromosome consider two alleles diploid case binomial expansion
therefore polyploid case polynomial expansion
c ploidy example tetraploid c

application cases complete dominance
suppose phenotypes aa aa indistinguishable ie complete dominance assuming hardyweinberg principle applies population still calculated faa

history
mendelian genetics rediscovered however remained somewhat controversial several years known could cause continuous characteristics udny yule argued mendelism thought dominant alleles would increase population american william e castle showed without selection genotype frequencies would remain stable karl pearson found one equilibrium position values p q reginald punnett unable counter yules point introduced problem g h hardy british mathematician played cricket hardy pure mathematician held applied mathematics contempt view biologists use mathematics comes across paper describes simple
editor science reluctant intrude discussion concerning matters expert knowledge expected simple point wish make familiar biologists however remarks mr udny yule mr r c punnett called attention suggest may still worth making
suppose aa pair mendelian characters dominant given generation number pure dominants aa heterozygotes aa pure recessives aa pqr finally suppose numbers fairly large mating may regarded random sexes evenly distributed among three varieties equally fertile little mathematics multiplicationtable type enough show next generation numbers p qp qq rq r pqr say
interesting question circumstances distribution generation easy see condition q pr since q pr whatever values p q r may distribution case continue unchanged second generation
principle thus known hardys law englishspeaking world curt stern pointed first formulated independently german physician wilhelm weinberg william castle also derived ratios special case equal allele frequencies sometimes rarely called hardyweinbergcastle law
derivation hardys equations
derivation hardys equations illustrative begins population genotypes consisting pure dominants aa heterozygotes aa pure recessives aa relative proportions pqr conditions noted
rewriting p q q r squaring sides yields hardys result
hardys equivalence condition
generations first
prove hardys statement successor generations proportions equal equivalence condition holds
equivalence condition holds shows equal proportions imply equivalence condition suppose equivalence condition holds
symmetry finally
shows thus proportions equal shows equivalence condition implies proportions equal therefore proportions equal equivalence condition holds claimed
since equivalence condition always holds second generation succeeding generations proportions

checks distribution compute
