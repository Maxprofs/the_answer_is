plant morphology represents study development form structure plants implication attempt interpret basis similarity plan origin four major areas investigation plant morphology overlaps another field biological sciences
first morphology comparative meaning morphologist examines structures many different plants different species draws comparisons formulates ideas similarities structures different species believed exist develop result common inherited genetic pathways structures termed homologous example leaves pine oak cabbage look different share certain basic structures arrangement parts homology leaves easy conclusion make plant morphologist goes discovers spines cactus also share basic structure development leaves plants therefore cactus spines homologous leaves well aspect plant morphology overlaps study plant evolution paleobotany
secondly plant morphology observes vegetative somatic structures plants well reproductive structures vegetative structures vascular plants includes study shoot system composed stems leaves well root system reproductive structures varied usually specific particular group plants flowers seeds fern sori moss capsules detailed study reproductive structures plants led discovery alternation generations found plants algae area plant morphology overlaps study biodiversity plant systematics
thirdly plant morphology studies plant structure range scales smallest scales ultrastructure general structural features cells visible aid electron microscope cytology study cells using optical microscopy scale plant morphology overlaps plant anatomy field study largest scale study plant growth habit overall architecture plant pattern branching tree vary species species appearance plant tree herb grass
fourthly plant morphology examines pattern development process structures originate mature plant grows animals produce body parts ever early life plants constantly produce new tissues structures throughout life living plant always embryonic tissues way new structures mature produced may affected point plants life begin develop well environment structures exposed morphologist studies process causes result area plant morphology overlaps plant physiology ecology
comparative scienceedit
plant morphologist makes comparisons structures many different plants different species making comparisons similar structures different plants tackles question structures similar quite likely similar underlying causes genetics physiology response environment led similarity appearance result scientific investigation causes lead one two insights underlying biology
homology structure similar two species shared ancestry common genetics
convergence structure similar two species independent adaptation common environmental pressures
understanding characteristics structures belong type important part understanding plant evolution evolutionary biologist relies plant morphologist interpret structures turn provides phylogenies plant relationships may lead new morphological insights
homologyedit
structures different species believed exist develop result common inherited genetic pathways structures termed homologous example leaves pine oak cabbage look different share certain basic structures arrangement parts homology leaves easy conclusion make plant morphologist goes discovers spines cactus also share basic structure development leaves plants therefore cactus spines homologous leaves well
convergenceedit
structures different species believed exist develop result common adaptive responses environmental pressure structures termed convergent example fronds bryopsis plumosa stems asparagus setaceus feathery branching appearance even though one alga one flowering plant similarity overall structure occurs independently result convergence growth form many cacti species euphorbia similar even though belong widely distant families similarity results common solutions problem surviving hot dry environment
vegetative reproductive characteristicsedit
plant morphology treats vegetative structures plants well reproductive structures
vegetative somatic structures vascular plants include two major organ systems shoot system composed stems leaves root system two systems common nearly vascular plants provide unifying theme study plant morphology
contrast reproductive structures varied usually specific particular group plants structures flowers fruits found angiosperms sori found ferns seed cones found conifers gymnosperms reproductive characters therefore regarded useful classification plants vegetative characters
use identificationedit
plant biologists use morphological characters plants compared measured counted described assess differences similarities plant taxa use characters plant identification classification descriptions
characters used descriptions identification called diagnostic key characters either qualitative quantitative
quantitative characters morphological features counted measured example plant species flower petals mm wide
qualitative characters morphological features leaf shape flower color pubescence
kinds characters useful identification plants
alternation generationsedit
detailed study reproductive structures plants led discovery alternation generations found plants algae german botanist wilhelm hofmeister discovery one important made plant morphology since provides common basis understanding life cycle plants
pigmentation plantsedit
primary function pigments plants photosynthesis uses green pigment chlorophyll along several red yellow pigments help capture much light energy possible pigments also important factor attracting insects flowers encourage pollination
plant pigments include variety different kinds molecule including porphyrins carotenoids anthocyanins betalains biological pigments selectively absorb certain wavelengths light reflecting others light absorbed may used plant power chemical reactions reflected wavelengths light determine color pigment appear eye
developmentedit
plant development process structures originate mature plant grows subject studies plant anatomy plant physiology well plant morphology
process development plants fundamentally different seen vertebrate animals animal embryo begins develop early produce body parts ever life animal born hatches egg body parts point grow larger mature contrast plants constantly produce new tissues structures throughout life meristems located tips organs mature tissues thus living plant always embryonic tissues
properties organization seen plant emergent properties sum individual parts assembly tissues functions integrated multicellular organism yields characteristics separate parts processes also quite new set characteristics would predictable basis examination separate parts words knowing everything molecules plant enough predict characteristics cells knowing properties cells predict properties plants structure
growthedit
vascular plant begins single celled zygote formed fertilisation egg cell sperm cell point begins divide form plant embryo process embryogenesis happens resulting cells organize one end becomes first root end forms tip shoot seed plants embryo develop one seed leaves cotyledons end embryogenesis young plant parts necessary begin life
embryo germinates seed parent plant begins produce additional organs leaves stems roots process organogenesis new roots grow root meristems located tip root new stems leaves grow shoot meristems located tip shoot branching occurs small clumps cells left behind meristem yet undergone cellular differentiation form specialized tissue begin grow tip new root shoot growth meristem tip root shoot termed primary growth results lengthening root shoot secondary growth results widening root shoot divisions cells cambium
addition growth cell division plant may grow cell elongation occurs individual cells groups cells grow longer plant cells grow length cells one side stem grow longer faster cells side stem bend side slower growing cells result directional growth occur via plants response particular stimulus light phototropism gravity gravitropism water hydrotropism physical contact thigmotropism
plant growth development mediated specific hormones plant growth regulators pgrs ross et al endogenous hormone levels influenced plant age cold hardiness dormancy metabolic conditions photoperiod drought temperature external environmental conditions exogenous sources pgrs eg externally applied rhizospheric origin
morphological variationedit
plants exhibit natural variation form structure organisms vary individual individual plants exhibit additional type variation within single individual parts repeated may differ form structure similar parts variation easily seen leaves plant though organs stems flowers may show similar variation three primary causes variation positional effects environmental effects juvenility
positional effectsedit
although plants produce numerous copies organ lives copies particular organ identical variation among parts mature plant resulting relative position organ produced example along new branch leaves may vary consistent pattern along branch form leaves produced near base branch differ leaves produced tip plant difference consistent branch branch given plant given species difference persists leaves ends branch matured result leaves younger others
environmental effectsedit
way new structures mature produced may affected point plants life begin develop well environment structures exposed seen aquatic plants emergent plants
temperatureedit
temperature multiplicity effects plants depending variety factors including size condition plant temperature duration exposure smaller succulent plant greater susceptibility damage death temperatures high low temperature affects rate biochemical physiological processes rates generally within limits increasing temperature however vant hoff relationship monomolecular reactions states velocity reaction doubled trebled temperature increase c strictly hold biological processes especially low high temperatures
water freezes plants consequences plant depend much whether freezing occurs intracellularly within cells outside cells intercellular extracellular spaces intracellular freezing usually kills cell regardless hardiness plant tissues intracellular freezing seldom occurs nature moderate rates decrease temperature eg c chour cause intercellular ice form extraorgan ice may may lethal depending hardiness tissue
freezing temperatures water intercellular spaces plant tissues freezes first though water may remain unfrozen temperatures fall c initial formation ice intercellularly cells shrink water lost segregated ice cells undergo freezedrying dehydration basic cause freezing injury
rate cooling shown influence frost resistance tissues actual rate freezing depend cooling rate also degree supercooling properties tissue sakai demonstrated ice segregation shoot primordia alaskan white black spruces cooled slowly c c freezedehydrated buds survived immersion liquid nitrogen slowly rewarmed floral primordia responded similarly extraorgan freezing primordia accounts ability hardiest boreal conifers survive winters regions air temperatures often fall c lower hardiness winter buds conifers enhanced smallness buds evolution faster translocation water ability tolerate intensive freeze dehydration boreal species picea pinus frost resistance yearold seedlings par mature plants given similar states dormancy
juvenilityedit
organs tissues produced young plant seedling often different produced plant older phenomenon known juvenility example young trees produce longer leaner branches grow upwards branches produce fully grown tree addition leaves produced early growth tend larger thinner irregular leaves adult plant specimens juvenile plants may look completely different adult plants species egglaying insects recognize plant food young differences seen rootability flowering seen mature tree juvenile cuttings taken base tree form roots much readily cuttings originating mid upper crown flowering close base tree absent less profuse flowering higher branches especially young tree first reaches flowering age
