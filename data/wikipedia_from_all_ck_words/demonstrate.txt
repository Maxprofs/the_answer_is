cake is a form of sweet dessert that is typically baked in its oldest forms cakes were modifications of breads but now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate and share features with other desserts such as pastries meringues custards and pies
typical cake ingredients are flour sugar eggs butter or oil a liquid and leavening agents such as baking soda and/or baking powder common additional ingredients and flavourings include dried candied or fresh fruit nuts cocoa and extracts such as vanilla with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces (like pastry cream) iced with buttercream or other icings and decorated with marzipan piped borders or candied fruit
cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions for example weddings anniversaries and birthdays there are countless cake recipes some are bread-like some rich and elaborate and many are centuries old cake making is no longer a complicated procedure while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams) baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur cook may bake a cake
== history ==
the term cake has a long history the word itself is of viking origin from the old norse word kaka
although clear examples of the difference between cake and bread are easy to find the precise classification has always been elusive for example banana bread may be properly considered either a quick bread or a cake
the greeks invented beer as a leavener frying fritters in olive oil and cheesecakes using goat's milk in ancient rome basic bread dough was sometimes enriched with butter eggs and honey which produced a sweet and cake-like baked good latin poet ovid refers to the birthday of him and his brother with party and cake in his first book of exile tristia
early cakes in england were also essentially bread the most obvious differences between a cake and bread were the round flat shape of the cakes and the cooking method which turned cakes over once while cooking while bread was left upright throughout the baking process
sponge cakes leavened with beaten eggs originated during the renaissance possibly in spain
=== cake mixes ===
during the great depression there was a surplus of molasses and the need to provide easily made food to millions of economically depressed people in the us one company patented a cake-bread mix in order to deal with this economic situation and thereby established the first line of cake in a box in so doing cake as it is known today became a mass-produced good rather than a home- or bakery-made specialty
later during the post-war boom other american companies (notably general mills) developed this idea further marketing cake mix on the principle of convenience especially to housewives when sales dropped heavily in the 1950s marketers discovered that the cake in a box rendered the cake-making function of housewives relatively dispiriting this was a time when women retired from the war-time labor force and in a critical ideological period in american history were confined to the domestic sphere and oriented towards the freshly blossoming consumerism in the us in order to compensate for this situation the marketing psychologist ernest dichter ushered in the solution to the cake mix problem frosting deprived of the creativity involved in making their own cake within consumerist culture housewives and other in-home cake makers could compensate by cake decoration inspired by among other things photographs in magazines of elaborately decorated cakes
ever since cake in a box has become a staple of supermarkets and is complemented with frosting in a can
== varieties ==
cakes are broadly divided into several categories based primarily on ingredients and mixing techniques
butter cakes are made from creamed butter sugar eggs and four they rely on the combination of butter and sugar beaten for an extended time to incorporate air into the batter a classic pound cake is made with a pound each of butter sugar eggs and flour baking powder is in many butter cakes such as victoria sponge the ingredients are sometimes mixed without creaming the butter using recipes for simple and quick cakes
sponge cakes (or foam cakes) are made from whipped eggs sugar and flour they rely primarily on trapped air in a protein matrix (generally of beaten eggs) to provide leavening sometimes with a bit of baking powder or other chemical leaven added as insurance sponge cakes are thought to be the oldest cakes made without yeast an angel food cake is a white sponge cake that uses only the whites of the eggs and is traditionally baked in a tube pan the french gnoise is a sponge cake that includes clarified butter highly decorated sponge cakes with lavish toppings are sometimes called gateau the french word for cake
chiffon cakes are sponge cakes with vegetable oil which adds moistness
chocolate cakes are butter cakes sponge cakes or other cakes flavored with melted chocolate or cocoa powder german chocolate cake is a variety of chocolate cake fudge cakes are chocolate cakes that contains fudge
coffee cake is generally thought of as a cake to serve with coffee or tea at breakfast or at a coffee break some types use yeast as a leavening agent while others use baking soda and/or baking powder these cakes often have a crumb topping called streusel and/or a light glaze drizzle
baked flourless cakes include baked cheesecakes and flourless chocolate cakes cheesecakes despite their name aren't really cakes at all cheesecakes are in fact custard pies with a filling made mostly of some form of cheese (often cream cheese mascarpone ricotta or the like) and have very little flour added although a flour-based or graham cracker crust may be used cheesecakes are also very old with evidence of honey-sweetened cakes dating back to ancient greece
butter or oil layer cakes include most of the traditional cakes used as birthday cakes etc. and those sold as packaged cakes baking powder or bicarbonate of soda are used to provide both lift and a moist texture many flavorings and ingredients may be added examples include devil's food cake carrot cake and banana bread
yeast cakes are the oldest and are very similar to yeast breads such cakes are often very traditional in form and include such pastries as babka and stollen
some varieties of cake are widely available in the form of cake mixes wherein some of the ingredients (usually flour sugar flavoring baking powder and sometimes some form of fat) are premixed and the cook needs add only a few extra ingredients usually eggs water and sometimes vegetable oil or butter while the diversity of represented styles is limited cake mixes do provide an easy and readily available homemade option for cooks who are not accomplished bakers

== cake flour ==
special cake flour with a high starch-to-gluten ratio is made from fine-textured soft low-protein wheat it is strongly bleached and compared to all-purpose flour cake flour tends to result in cakes with a lighter less dense texture therefore it is frequently specified or preferred in cakes meant to be soft light and/or bright white such as angel food cake however if cake flour is called for a substitute can be made by replacing a small percentage of all-purpose flour with cornstarch or removing two tablespoons from each cup of all-purpose flour some recipes explicitly specify or permit all-purpose flour notably where a firmer or denser cake texture is desired
== cooking ==
a cake can fall whereby parts of it sink or flatten when baked at a temperature that is too low or too hot when it has been underbaked and when placed in an oven that is too hot at the beginning of the baking process the use of excessive amounts of sugar flour fat or leavening can also cause a cake to fall a cake can also fall when subjected to cool air that enters an oven when the oven door is opened during the cooking process
== cake decorating ==
a finished cake is often enhanced by covering it with icing or frosting and toppings such as sprinkles which are also known as jimmies in certain parts of the united states and hundreds and thousands in the united kingdom frosting is usually made from powdered (icing) sugar sometimes a fat of some sort milk or cream and often flavorings such as vanilla extract or cocoa powder some decorators use a rolled fondant icing commercial bakeries tend to use lard for the fat and often whip the lard to introduce air bubbles this makes the icing light and spreadable home bakers either use lard butter margarine or some combination thereof sprinkles are small firm pieces of sugar and oils that are colored with food coloring in the late 20th century new cake decorating products became available to the public these include several specialized sprinkles and even methods to print pictures and transfer the image onto a cake
special tools are needed for more complex cake decorating such as piping bags and various piping tips syringes and embossing mats to use a piping bag or syringe a piping tip is attached to the bag or syringe using a coupler the bag or syringe is partially filled with icing which is sometimes colored using different piping tips and various techniques a cake decorator can make many different designs basic decorating tips include open star closed star basketweave round drop flower leaf multi petal and specialty tips an embossing mat is used to create embossed effects a cake turntable that cakes are spun upon may be used in cake decoration
royal icing marzipan (or a less sweet version known as almond paste) fondant icing (also known as sugarpaste) and buttercream are used as covering icings and to create decorations floral sugarcraft or wired sugar flowers are an important part of cake decoration cakes for special occasions such as wedding cakes are traditionally rich fruit cakes or occasionally madeira cakes that are covered with marzipan and iced using royal icing or sugar-paste they are finished with piped borders (made with royal icing) and adorned with a piped message wired sugar flowers hand-formed fondant flowers marzipan fruit piped flowers or crystallized fruits or flowers such as grapes or violets
