chemistry law definite proportions sometimes called prousts law law definite composition states chemical compound always contains exactly proportion elements mass equivalent statement law constant composition states samples given chemical compound elemental composition mass example oxygen makes mass sample pure water hydrogen makes remaining mass along law multiple proportions law definite proportions forms basis stoichiometry
history
observation first made french chemist joseph proust based several experiments conducted based observations proust made statements like one
shall conclude deducing experiments principle established commencement memoir viz iron like many metals subject law nature presides every true combination say unites two constant proportions oxygen respect differ tin mercury lead word almost every known combustible
law definite proportions might seem obvious modern chemist inherent definition chemical compound end th century however concept chemical compound yet fully developed law novel fact first proposed controversial statement opposed chemists notably prousts fellow frenchman claude louis berthollet argued elements could combine proportion existence debate demonstrates time distinction pure chemical compounds mixtures yet fully developed
law definite proportions contributed placed firm theoretical basis atomic theory john dalton promoted beginning explained matter consisting discrete atoms one type atom element compounds made combinations different types atoms fixed proportions
related early idea prouts hypothesis formulated english chemist william prout proposed hydrogen atom fundamental atomic unit hypothesis derived whole number rule rule thumb atomic masses whole number multiples mass hydrogen later rejected following refined measurements atomic mass notably jns jacob berzelius revealed particular atomic mass chlorine incompatible hypothesis since discrepancy explained presence isotopes atomic mass isotope close satisfying whole number rule mass defect caused differing binding energies significantly smaller
nonstoichiometric compounds
although useful foundation modern chemistry law definite proportions universally true exist nonstoichiometric compounds whose elemental composition vary sample sample example iron oxide wstite contain iron atoms every oxygen atom thus contain anywhere oxygen mass ideal formula feo due crystallographic vacancies reduced feo general prousts measurements accurate enough detect variations
addition isotopic composition element vary depending source hence contribution mass even pure stoichiometric compound may vary variation used geochemical dating since astronomical atmospheric oceanic crustal deep earth processes may concentrate lighter heavier isotopes preferentially exception hydrogen isotopes effect usually small measurable modern instrumentation
additional note many natural polymers vary composition instance dna proteins carbohydrates even pure polymers generally considered pure chemical compounds except molecular weight uniform monodisperse stoichiometry constant unusual case still may violate law due isotopic variations
