allopatric speciation ancient greek allos greek patris fatherland geographic speciation speciation occurs biological populations species become vicariant isolated extent prevents interferes genetic interchange result population dispersal leading emigration geographical changes mountain formation island formation large scale human activities example agricultural civil engineering developments vicariant populations undergo genotypic phenotypic divergence become subjected different selective pressures b independently undergo genetic drift c different mutations arise gene pools populations
separate populations time may evolve distinctly different characteristics geographical barriers later removed members two populations may unable successfully mate point genetically isolated groups emerged different species allopatric isolation key factor speciation common process new species arise adaptive radiation observed charles darwin galapagos finches consequence allopatric speciation among island populations
isolating mechanismsedit
allopatric speciation may occur species subdivided geographically isolated populations separation commonly referred vicariance allopatric allopatry terms biogeography referring organisms whose ranges entirely separate occur one place together organisms closely related eg sister species distribution usually result allopatric speciation separation may attributed either geological processes population dispersal
geological processesedit
geological processes fragment population events emergence mountain ranges canyon formation glacial processes formation destruction land bridges subsidence large bodies water global scale plate tectonics major geological factors leading separation populations resulting distribution species
approximately years ago death valley region western united states rainy climate produced interconnecting system freshwater rivers lakes climatic changes resulted drying trend continued last years lakes rivers shrank fish populations became geologically isolated remaining separated springs currently home variety fish many sharing close common ancestor yet uniquely adapted particular pool
extent geological barrier effectively isolate population correlates mobility organism offspring example physical barriers canyons may effectively block migration dispersal small mammals however little impact flying birds windborne seeds
population dispersaledit
population dispersal used describe migratory events either form range expansion natural movement away parents jump dispersal crossing barriers may lead genetic isolation smaller population fragment becomes genetically isolated parental group may subjected unique mutations selection forces genetic drift effects thus follow evolutionary pathway migrations accidental relocations birds blown course may lead population fragments whereby groups merely become separated distance gene flow two groups disrupted speciation becomes possibility
allopatric speciation peripheral populationsedit
populations become genetically isolated heritable variations may accumulate become different parental population given sufficient time variations may lead reproductive isolation
portions populations exist along edges parent populations geographic territory higher likelihood developing reproductive isolation peripheral populations likely possess genes different parental population isolation founding population less likely represent gene pool parent population addition peripheral isolates likely represent small number individuals meaning gene pool susceptible effects genetic drift random chance furthermore likely peripheral population inhabit environment different ancestral gene pool likely causing subjected different selective pressures colonizes new areas outer periphery populations habitat tends extreme hence reason range expansion kept check peripheral isolates likely die rather survive speciate
genesis reproductive barriersedit
adaptive divergence may occur population becomes geographically divided followed accumulation genetic differences adapt unique environments reproductive barriers evolve consequence external forces drive populations toward speciation rather evolution reproductive isolation leading speciation generally thought incidental byproduct genetic divergence particularly adaptive changes evolve natural selection response different environmental conditions separate geographic areas
biological species concept proposed ernst mayr emphasizes reproductive isolation basis defining species definition states species defined population group populations whose members potential interbreed one another nature produce viable offspring cannot produce viable fertile offspring members species mayr proponent allopatric speciation hypothesized adaptive genetic changes accumulate allopatric populations cause negative epistasis hybrids resulting sterility offspring
considerable genetic phenotypic change without loss capacity interbreeding hybridization simply prevented geographical separation populations case populations normally regarded subspecies
frequency types speciation sympatric speciation parapatric speciation heteropatric speciation debated proponents peripatric speciation contend small population size peripheral isolate sometimes referred splinter population increases genetic drift powerful force natural selection small populations deconstructs complex genotypes allowing creation novel gene combinations forms need mutually exclusive practice passive isolation fragmentation well active dispersal seem play role many cases speciation
alternative modes speciationedit
sympatric speciation represents alternative method speciation require physical separation instead speciation occurs within population sharing geographic boundaries example development polyploidy plant species lead new species arising within geographic range parent population
parapatric speciation physical barrier gene exchange within population instead population continuous however mating random individuals mate closest neighbors rather individuals distant location divergence may occur consequence reduced gene flow natural selection imposed large distance individuals within populations habitat
allopatric speciation thought dominant mode speciation
examplesedit
african elephant always regarded single species morphological dna differences scientists classify three subspecies researchers university california san diego argued divergence due geographical isolation gone elephants west africa regarded separate species savanna elephants central eastern southern africa forest elephants central africa similar situation exists asian elephant four distinct living subspecies definition causes two organisms different species quite ambiguous simplest definition two organisms cannot interbreed different species
cases arise two populations quite distinct morphologically native different continents classified different species members one species introduced others range found interbreed freely showing fact geographically isolated subspecies found case mallard introduced new zealand interbred freely native grey duck classified separate species controversial whether specific status retained mallards interbreed similarly aggressively southern african yellowbilled duck
