spinal nerves take origins spinal cord control functions rest body humans pairs spinal nerves cervical thoracic lumbar sacral coccygeal cervical region spinal nerve roots come corresponding vertebrae ie nerve root skull st cervical vertebrae called spinal nerve c thoracic region coccygeal region spinal nerve roots come corresponding vertebrae important note method creates problem naming spinal nerve root c called spinal nerve root c lumbar sacral region spinal nerve roots travel within dural sac travel level l cauda equina
cervical spinal nerves cc
first cervical spinal nerves c c split recombine produce variety nerves subserve neck back head
spinal nerve c called suboccipital nerve provides motor innervation muscles base skull c c form many nerves neck providing sensory motor control include greater occipital nerve provides sensation back head lesser occipital nerve provides sensation area behind ears greater auricular nerve lesser auricular nerve see occipital neuralgia phrenic nerve arises nerve roots c c c innervates diaphragm enabling breathing spinal cord transected c spontaneous breathing possible see myelopathy
brachial plexus ct
last four cervical spinal nerves c c first thoracic spinal nerve combine form brachial plexus plexus brachialis tangled array nerves splitting combining recombining form nerves subserve upperlimb upper back although brachial plexus may appear tangled highly organized predictable little variation people see brachial plexus injuries

pudendal plexus
neurotransmitters
main neurotransmitters peripheral nervous system acetylcholine noradrenaline however several neurotransmitters well jointly labeled nonnoradrenergic noncholinergic nanc transmitters examples transmitters include nonpeptides atp gaba dopamine peptides neuropeptide y vip gnrh substance p cgrp
