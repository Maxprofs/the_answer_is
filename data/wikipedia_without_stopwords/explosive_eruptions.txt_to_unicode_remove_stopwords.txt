explosive eruption volcanic term describe violent explosive type eruption mount st helens example eruptions result sufficient gas dissolved pressure within viscous magma expelled lava violently froths volcanic ash pressure suddenly lowered vent sometimes lava plug block conduit summit occurs eruptions violent explosive eruptions send rocks dust gas pyroclastic material km atmosphere rate tonnes per second traveling several hundred meters per second cloud collapse creating pyroclastic flow hot volcanic matter
stages explosive eruptionedit
explosive eruption always begins form blockage crater volcano prevents release gases trapped highly viscous andesitic rhyolitic magma high viscosity forms magma prevents release trapped gases type magma flows towards surface pressure builds eventually causing blockage blasted explosive eruption pressure magma gases released weakest point cone usually crater however case eruption mount st helens pressure released side volcano rather crater
sudden release pressure causes gases magma suddenly froth create volcanic ash pumice ejected volcanic vent create signature eruption column commonly associated explosive eruptions size duration column depends volume magma released much pressure magma
