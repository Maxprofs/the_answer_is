== history ==
the world's oldest preserved garment discovered by flinders petrie is a highly sophisticated linen shirt from a first dynasty egyptian tomb at tarkan c 3000 bc the shoulders and sleeves have been finely pleated to give form-fitting trimness while allowing the wearer room to move the small fringe formed during weaving along one edge of the cloth has been placed by the designer to decorate the neck opening and side seam.
the shirt was an item of men's underwear until the twentieth century although the woman's chemise was a closely related garment to the man's it is the man's garment that became the modern shirt in the middle ages it was a plain undyed garment worn next to the skin and under regular garments in medieval artworks the shirt is only visible (uncovered) on humble characters such as shepherds prisoners and penitents in the seventeenth century men's shirts were allowed to show with much the same erotic import as visible underwear today in the eighteenth century instead of underpants men relied on the long tails of shirts  to serve the function of drawers eighteenth-century costume historian joseph strutt believed that men who did not wear shirts to bed were indecent even as late as 1879 a visible shirt with nothing over it was considered improper
the shirt sometimes had frills at the neck or cuffs in the sixteenth century men's shirts often had embroidery and sometimes frills or lace at the neck and cuffs and through the eighteenth century long neck frills or jabots were fashionable coloured shirts began to appear in the early nineteenth century as can be seen in the paintings of george caleb bingham they were considered casual wear for lower-class workers only until the twentieth century for a gentleman to wear a sky-blue shirt was unthinkable in 1860 but had become standard by 1920 and in 1980 constituted the most commonplace event.
european and american women began wearing shirts in 1860 when the garibaldi shirt a red shirt as worn by the freedom fighters under giuseppe garibaldi was popularized by empress eugnie of france at the end of the nineteenth century the century dictionary described an ordinary shirt as of cotton with linen bosom wristbands and cuffs prepared for stiffening with starch the collar and wristbands being usually separate and adjustable
