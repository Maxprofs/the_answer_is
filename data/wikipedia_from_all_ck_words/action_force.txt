action force was a brand of european action figures initially based on action man in the 1980s it was also used to introduce g.i joe a real american hero toys to european markets several publishing companies have produced comic books based on the figures
== history ==
=== first generation (1982) ===
the action figures were first produced in 1982 by palitoy limited and released in two waves they were a response to falling sales of the company's larger action man and the comparative success of the smaller star wars action figures which the company was licensed to sell in europe
called action force the figures were a mixture of historical military figures (e.g desert rat and german storm trooper characters) and more contemporary soldiers (e.g arctic and naval assault characters) in contrast to g.i joe figures the toys were kept international by including british german australian and american soldiers unlike later releases however the first figures were not accompanied by file cards giving back-stories nor were they featured in comic books (other than a series of mini-comics that were packaged with some of the vehicles notably the af-3 and af-5)

=== second generation (1983) ===
following the success of the first range of figures a second much larger group was launched in 1983 action force sales were about one million over six months in 1983 and the offering was expanded with a new wave of figures and vehicles released in 1984
==== characterisation ====
palitoy limited took a different approach with this second range of figures by grouping the allied action figures and enemies each with accompanying weaponry and vehicles (see below) at this stage the figures were given comic book identities and were featured in a new range of stories in the battle action force comic (see battle action force tie-in below) the toys were also supplied with file cards giving a brief profile of the character for key figures these profiles were in turn expanded in battle action force comics with their own multi-issue story lines (e.g - the black major.)

===== special weapons force =====
according to research undertaken by collectors at the blood for the baron website a fifth team of five figures was initially planned but was never released the fifth team was to have been characterised as a special weapons unit initially believed to be called f-force but later research revealed a pair of photos from a toy catalogue which showed the figures in different colour schemes along with vehicles featuring a sws logo the catalogue photos also showed us g.i joe vehicles which were released as part of the sas force and z force groups these vehicles were a white and grey jeep a white artillery piece and a white missile battery
==== toys ====
both the action figures and the vehicles borrowed elements from the first generation models and the new casts licensed from the g i joe toy line from hasbro at this time the action force toy line was marketed heavily and branched out into atari video games (see action force) audio stories on cassette tapes stationery and toiletries there was also an action force fan club promoted both on the figures packaging and in the battle action force comic book in 1984 additional figures and vehicles were cast borrowing heavily from the g.i joe and cobra ranges
=== third generation (1985) ===

in 1985 palitoy ceded control of the european market to hasbro following the death of one of palitoy's owners (alfred pallett) and the winding-up of operations at their leicester factory hasbro purchased the palitoy factory copyrights and moulds and began to package g.i joe figures under the action force brand in characterisation terms this move marked the end of the sub-grouping of the action force team and a new unified action force (or af) also faced a new enemy in the name of cobra
the parallel comic book story lines also maintained continuity with a number of plot lines that blended elements of the second range of figures with the third featuring the new characters as an international elite anti-terrorist unit of a wider action force the force was still backed up by the z force sas other units fighting cobra the red shadows and even a re-animated adolf hitler and the nazis (despite being ostensibly set in the present day) over time however the range evolved into an unreconstructed g.i joe force and its enemy cobra
the g.i joe animated series was re-titled and re-dubbed for release in the uk any mention of g.i joe was replaced with action force however the g.i joe logo remained on vehicles and equipment shown in the cartoon
== battle action force tie-in ==

during july 1983 the action force characters initially guest-featured in a comic strip serial in battle the strip proved to be so popular that a further five promotional mini-comics were included free with every ipc publication in the weeks to follow on 8 october 1983 action force joined the pages of battle full-time and the magazine was retitled battle action force
the comic took on the role of providing back-stories and plot lines to the popular action figures and helped maintain the continuity of hasbros move to marketing the g.i joe range in britain in addition the yearly annuals mail-in offers advertisements and free gifts were all focused towards adding detail and context to the action force universe
following the closure of palitoy in 1986 and hasbro acquiring the various intellectual property rights to the action force toy line the action force strip was cancelled the battle action force magazine was subsequently merged with eagle
== marvel uk's action force comic ==
following the demise of the battle action force strips a weekly action force comic was launched by marvel uk on 8 march 1987 consisting of reprints of the us g.i joe comic book and new uk-exclusive short strips the g.i joe comics were adjusted to fit into the uk strip's continuity and had all references to g.i joe replaced with action force and the uk-exclusive strips maintained a separate continuity from the us g.i joe comic the action force comic was cancelled in 1988 after fifty issues due to low sales and was replaced with action force monthly which was itself cancelled after fifteen issues the action force monthly title printed new stories as well as reprinting stories from the weekly title the magazine was released in the us under the title g.i joe european missions
in late 1989 the g.i joe story reprints were continued in the uk transformers comic under the name g.i joe the action force to conform to the toy line the reprints changed back to g.i joe until they were dropped in 1991 in 1995 panini comics obtained the marvel uk licence and began publishing an action man comic the following year without reference to action force or g.i joe
== distinction from g.i joe ==
the characters created by battle action force were altered in the european market to have mixed nationalities in contrast to the us-centric g.i joe characters
in late 1989 the toy line and accompanying merchandise were renamed g.i joe the action force in a mini-comic distributed free in stores and in issue #245 of the transformers comic it was explained that the european action force had merged with its us counterpart g.i joe this story however did not match all previous portrayals of action force as an international team with branches in europe and america
in 1991 the name was further changed to just g.i joe
== action force canon ==
due to its split comic book heritage there are some irreconcilable difficulties regarding the continuity of action force story lines the battle action force universe should be regarded as stand-alone while the marvel uk stories were designed to coincide with marvel us continuity
the battle action force creators retconned several aspects of the series to smooth over the transition to g.i joe-influenced characters and vehicles due to fan pressure however the first wave of palitoy releases and characters returned to the pages of the comic time and time again (see above)
several fan attempts have been made to establish an official action force canon building on accepted official works (such as the battle action force publications and palitoy endorsed releases the most comprehensive of these to date is the action force data files
== action force in germany ==
the second-generation action force figures were also released in west germany during the 1980s albeit without the benefit of a comic book tie-in the german toys went under the title of action force and fought the terror-bande (roughly translated as terror gang") the german release only extended to the first wave of second-generation figures and characters (some 30 figures and vehicles) however the characters and vehicles were still grouped in their sub-units anti-terror team (or att) corresponding to z-force the special anti-terror team (or satt) corresponding to sas force the deep-sea anti-terror team (or tsatt) corresponding to q force and the space anti-terror team (or watt) corresponding to space force
without comic back-stories the figures were given context by the following statement (translated) which was retrospectively attached to the german packaging
the world of action force the story of action force takes place in the year 2011 the world population has for a long time lived in peace and liberty united under the rule of a democratic world regime baron ironblood the last criminal strikes terror with a gang of enslaved adventurers with intelligent robots and the world's most innovative weapons his goal to take over the world action force was set up by the world government and fights this dangerous enemy with various special units att satt tsatt and watt their orders all terrorists must be captured no one shall be killed.
in a country still concerned by its destructive past german toy distributors modified certain aspects of the action force range to appear less violent according to researchers of the german palitoy range most of the guns supplied with the figures were replaced by less violent stun-weapons laser-weapons or knives also the human skull on the red shadow (or terror-bande) figures was removed from the toy line
