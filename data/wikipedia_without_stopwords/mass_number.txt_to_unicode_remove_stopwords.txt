mass number also called atomic mass number nucleon number total number protons neutrons together known nucleons atomic nucleus determines atomic mass atoms protons neutrons baryons mass number identical baryon number b nucleus whole atom ion mass number different different isotope chemical element atomic number z denotes number protons nucleus thus uniquely identifies element hence difference mass number atomic number gives number neutrons n given nucleus naz
mass number written either element name superscript left elements symbol example common isotope carbon carbon c protons neutrons full isotope symbol would also atomic number z subscript left element symbol directly mass number
c technically redundant element defined atomic number often omitted
mass number changes radioactive decay
different types radioactive decay characterized changes mass number well atomic number according radioactive displacement law fajans soddy example uranium usually decays alpha decay nucleus loses two neutrons two protons form alpha particle thus atomic number number neutrons decrease z n mass number decreases result atom thorium alpha particle
hand carbon naturally decays radioactive beta decay whereby one neutron transmuted proton emission electron antineutrino thus atomic number increases z mass number remains number neutrons decreases n resulting atom nitrogen seven protons seven neutrons
another type radioactive decay without change mass number emission gamma ray nuclear isomer metastable excited state atomic nucleus since protons neutrons remain nucleus unchanged process mass number also unchanged
mass number isotopic mass
mass number gives estimate isotopic mass measured atomic mass units u c isotopic mass exactly since atomic mass unit defined mass c isotopes isotopic mass usually within u mass number example cl mass number isotopic mass
two reasons difference mass number isotopic mass known mass defect
neutron slightly heavier proton increases mass nuclei neutrons protons relative atomic mass unit scale based c equal numbers protons neutrons
nuclear binding energy varies nuclei nucleus greater binding energy lower total energy therefore lower mass according einsteins massenergy equivalence relation e mc cl isotopic mass less must dominant factor
relative atomic mass element
mass number also confused relative atomic mass also called atomic weight element ratio average atomic mass different isotopes element weighted abundance unified atomic mass unit weighted average quite different nearinteger values individual isotopic masses
instance two main isotopes chlorine chlorine chlorine given sample chlorine subjected mass separation roughly chlorine atoms chlorine chlorine atoms chlorine gives chlorine relative atomic mass actually gmol
moreover weighted average mass nearinteger time corresponding mass natural isotope example bromine two stable isotopes br br naturally present approximately equal fractions leads standard atomic mass bromine close gmol even though isotope br mass unstable
