ethanol fermentation also called alcoholic fermentation biological process converts sugars glucose fructose sucrose cellular energy producing ethanol carbon dioxide sideeffect yeasts perform conversion absence oxygen alcoholic fermentation considered anaerobic process
ethanol fermentation many uses including production alcoholic beverages production ethanol fuel bread baking
biochemical process fermentation sucroseedit
chemical equations summarize fermentation sucrose cho ethanol choh alcoholic fermentation converts one mole sucrose two moles ethanol two moles carbon dioxide producing two moles atp process
overall chemical formula alcoholic fermentation
cho zymase choh co
sucrose dimer glucose fructose molecules first step alcoholic fermentation enzyme invertase cleaves glycosidic linkage glucose fructose molecules
cho ho invertase cho
next glucose molecule broken two pyruvate molecules process known glycolysis glycolysis summarized equation
cho adp pi nad chcocoo atp nadh ho h
chemical formula pyruvate chcocoo pi stands inorganic phosphate
enzyme step pyruvate decarboxylase
shown reaction equation glycolysis causes reduction two molecules nad nadh two adp molecules also converted two atp two water molecules via substratelevel phosphorylation
related processesedit
fermentation sugar ethanol co also done zymomonas mobilis however path slightly different since formation pyruvate happen glycolysis instead entnerdoudoroff pathway microorganisms produce ethanol sugars fermentation often side product examples
heterolactic acid fermentation leuconostoc bacterias produce lactate ethanol co
mixed acid fermentation escherichia produce ethanol mixed lactate acetate succinate formate co h
butanediol fermentation enterobacter producing ethanol butanediol lactate formate co h

effect oxygenedit
fermentation require oxygen oxygen present species yeast eg kluyveromyces lactis kluyveromyces lipolytica oxidize pyruvate completely carbon dioxide water process called cellular respiration species yeast produce ethanol anaerobic environment cellular respiration
however many yeasts commonly used bakers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe prefer fermentation respiration yeasts produce ethanol even aerobic conditions provided right kind nutrition batch fermentation rate ethanol production per milligram cell protein maximal brief period early process declines progressively ethanol accumulates surrounding broth studies demonstrate removal accumulated ethanol immediately restore fermentative activity provide evidence decline metabolic rate due physiological changes including possible ethanol damage rather presence ethanol several potential causes decline fermentative activity investigated viability remained internal ph remained near neutrality specific activities glycolytic alcohologenic enzymes measured vitro remained high throughout batch fermentation none factors appears causally related fall fermentative activity batch fermentation
bread bakingedit
ethanol fermentation causes bread dough rise yeast organisms consume sugars dough produce ethanol carbon dioxide waste products carbon dioxide forms bubbles dough expanding something foam nearly ethanol evaporates dough bread baked
alcoholic beveragesedit
ethanol contained alcoholic beverages including ethanol produced carbonic maceration produced means fermentation induced yeast
wine produced fermentation natural sugars present grapes cider perry produced similar fermentation natural sugar apples pears respectively fruit wines produced fermentation sugars kinds fruit brandy eaux de vie eg slivovitz produced distillation fruitfermented beverages
mead produced fermentation natural sugars present honey
beer whiskey vodka produced fermentation grain starches converted sugar enzyme amylase present grain kernels malted ie germinated sources starch eg potatoes unmalted grain may added mixture amylase act starches well whiskey vodka also distilled gin related beverages produced addition flavoring agents vodkalike feedstock distillation
rice wines including sake produced fermentation grain starches converted sugar mold aspergillus oryzae baijiu soju shch distilled product fermentation
rum beverages produced fermentation distillation sugarcane rum usually produced sugarcane product molasses
cases fermentation must take place vessel allows carbon dioxide escape prevents outside air coming exposure oxygen would prevent formation ethanol buildup carbon dioxide creates risk vessel rupture fail catastrophically causing injury property damage
feedstocks fuel productionedit
yeast fermentation various carbohydrate products also used produce ethanol added gasoline
dominant ethanol feedstock warmer regions sugarcane temperate regions corn sugar beets used
united states main feedstock production ethanol currently corn approximately gallons ethanol produced one bushel corn liter per kilogram much corn turns ethanol corn also yields byproducts ddgs distillers dried grains solubles used feed livestock bushel corn produces pounds ddgs kilograms ddgs per metric ton maize although fermentation plants built cornproducing regions sorghum also important feedstock ethanol production plains states pearl millet showing promise ethanol feedstock southeastern us potential duckweed studied
parts europe particularly france italy grapes become de facto feedstock fuel ethanol distillation surplus wine japan proposed use rice normally made sake ethanol source
cassava ethanol feedstockedit
ethanol made mineral oil sugars starches starches cheapest starchy crop highest energy content per acre cassava grows tropical countries
thailand already large cassava industry use cattle feed cheap admixture wheat flour nigeria ghana already establishing cassavatoethanol plants production ethanol cassava currently economically feasible crude oil prices us per barrel
new varieties cassava developed future situation remains uncertain currently cassava yield tonnes per hectare irrigation fertilizer tonne cassava roots circa liters ethanol produced assuming cassava starch content liter ethanol contains circa mj energy overall energy efficiency cassavaroot ethanol conversion circa
yeast used processing cassava endomycopsis fibuligera sometimes used together bacterium zymomonas mobilis
