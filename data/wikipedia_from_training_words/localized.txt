a falcon (/flkn fl-/) is any one of 37 species of raptors in the genus falco widely distributed on all continents of the world except antarctica
adult falcons have thin tapered wings which enable them to fly at high speed and to change direction rapidly fledgling falcons in their first year of flying have longer flight feathers which make their configuration more like that of a general-purpose bird such as a broadwing this makes it easier to fly while learning the exceptional skills required to be effective hunters as adults
the falcons are the largest genus in the falconinae subfamily of falconidae which itself also includes another subfamily comprising caracaras and a few other species all these birds kill with their beaks using a tooth on the side of their beaks unlike the hawks eagles and other birds of prey in accipitridae which use their feet
peregrine falcons have been recorded diving at speeds of 200 miles per hour (320 km/h) making them the fastest-moving creatures on earth other falcons include the gyrfalcon lanner falcon and merlin some small falcons with long narrow wings are called hobbies and some which hover while hunting are called kestrels
as is the case with many birds of prey falcons have exceptional powers of vision the visual acuity of one species has been measured at 2.6 times that of a normal human
the traditional term for a male falcon is tercel (british spelling) or tiercel (american spelling) from latin tertius = third because of the belief that only one in three eggs hatched a male bird some sources give the etymology as deriving from the fact that a male falcon is about one-third smaller than the female (old french tiercelet) a falcon chick especially one reared for falconry still in its downy stage is known as an eyas (sometimes spelt eyass') the word arose by mistaken division of old french un niais from latin presumed nidiscus ("nestling from nidus = nest) the technique of hunting with trained captive birds of prey is known as falconry
== systematics and evolutionedit ==
compared to other birds of prey the fossil record of the falcons is not well distributed in time the oldest fossils tentatively assigned to this genus are from the late miocene less than 10 million years ago this coincides with a period in which many modern genera of birds became recognizable in the fossil record the falcon lineage may however be somewhat older than this and given the distribution of fossil and living falco taxa is probably of north american african or possibly middle eastern or european origin
=== overviewedit ===
falcons are roughly divisible into three or four groups the first contains the kestrels (probably excepting the american kestrel) usually small and stocky falcons of mainly brown upperside color and sometimes sexually dimorphic three african species that are generally grey in color stand apart from the typical members of this group kestrels feed chiefly on terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates of appropriate size such as rodents reptiles or insects
the second group contains slightly larger (on average) and more elegant species the hobbies and relatives these birds are characterized by considerable amounts of dark slate-grey in their plumage their malar areas are nearly always black they feed mainly on smaller birds
third are the peregrine falcon and its relatives variably sized powerful birds that also have a black malar area (except some very light color morphs) and often a black cap as well otherwise they are somewhat intermediate between the other groups being chiefly medium grey with some lighter or brownish colors on their upper sides they are on average more delicately patterned than the hobbies and if the hierofalcons are excluded (see below) this group typically contains species with horizontal barring on their undersides as opposed to the other groups where tail color varies much in general but little according to evolutionary relatedness the tails of the large falcons are quite uniformly dark grey with rather inconspicuous black banding and small white tips though this is probably plesiomorphic these large falco species feed on mid-sized birds and terrestrial vertebrates
very similar to these and sometimes included therein are the four or so species of hierofalcons (literally hawk-falcons") they represent taxa with usually more phaeomelanins which impart reddish or brown colors and generally more strongly patterned plumage reminiscent of hawks notably their undersides have a lengthwise pattern of blotches lines or arrowhead marks while these three or four groups loosely circumscribed are an informal arrangement they probably contain several distinct clades in their entirety a study of mtdna cytochrome b sequence data of some kestrels identified a clade containing the common kestrel and related malar-striped species to the exclusion of such taxa as the greater kestrel (which lacks a malar stripe) the lesser kestrel (which is very similar to the common but also has no malar stripe) and the american kestrel the latter species has a malar stripe but its color patternapart from the brownish backand notably also the black feathers behind the ear which never occur in the true kestrels are more reminiscent of some hobbies the malar-striped kestrels apparently split from their relatives in the gelasian roughly 2.5-2 mya and are apparently of tropical east african origin the entire true kestrel groupexcluding the american speciesis probably a distinct and quite young clade as also suggested by their numerous apomorphies
other studies have confirmed that the hierofalcons are a monophyletic groupand incidentally that hybridization is quite frequent at least in the larger falcon species initial studies of mtdna cytochrome b sequence data suggested that the hierofalcons are basal among living falcons the discovery of a numt proved this earlier theory erroneous in reality the hierofalcons are a rather young group originating maybe at the same time as the start of the main kestrel radiation about 2 million years ago very little fossil history exists for this lineage however the present diversity of very recent origin suggests that this lineage may have nearly gone extinct in the recent past
the phylogeny and delimitations of the peregrine and hobbies groups are more problematic molecular studies have only been conducted on a few species and the morphologically ambiguous taxa have often been little researched the morphology of the syrinx which contributes well to resolving the overall phylogeny of the falconidae is not very informative in the present genus nonetheless a core group containing the peregrine and barbary falcons which in turn group with the hierofalcons and the more distant prairie falcon (which was sometimes placed with the hierofalcons though it is entirely distinct biogeographically) as well as at least most of the typical hobbies are confirmed to be monophyletic as suspected
given that the american falco species of today belong to the peregrine group or are apparently more basal species the initially most successful evolutionary radiation seemingly was a holarctic one that originated possibly around central eurasia or in (northern) africa one or several lineages were present in north america by the early pliocene at latest
the origin of today's major falco groupsthe typical hobbies and kestrels for example or the peregrine-hierofalcon complex or the aplomado falcon lineagecan be quite confidently placed from the miocene-pliocene boundary through the zanclean and piacenzian and just into the gelasian that is from about 8 to 2.4 million years ago when the malar-striped kestrels diversified some groups of falcons such as the hierofalcon complex or the peregrine-barbary superspecies have only evolved in more recent times the species of the former seem to be a mere 120,000 years old or so

falco bulgaricus (late miocene of hadzhidimovo bulgaria)
several more paleosubspecies of extant species also been described see species accounts for these
sushkinia pliocaena from the early pliocene of pavlodar (kazakhstan) appears to be a falcon of some sort it might belong in this genus or a closely related one in any case the genus name sushkinia is invalid for this animal because it had already been allocated to a prehistoric dragonfly relative
the supposed falco pisanus was actually a pigeon of the genus columba possibly the same as columba omnisanctorum which in that case would adopt the older species name of the falcon the eocene fossil falco falconellus (or f. falconella) from wyoming is a bird of uncertain affiliations maybe a falconid maybe not it certainly does not belong in this genus falco readei is now considered a paleosubspecies of the yellow-headed caracara (milvago chimachima)
