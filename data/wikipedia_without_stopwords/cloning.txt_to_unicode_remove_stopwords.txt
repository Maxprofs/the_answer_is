natural cloning
cloning natural form reproduction allowed life forms spread thousand years reproduction method used plants fungi bacteria also way clonal colonies reproduce examples organisms include blueberry plants hazel trees pando trees kentucky coffeetree myricas american sweetgum
molecular cloning
molecular cloning refers process making multiple molecules cloning commonly used amplify dna fragments containing whole genes also used amplify dna sequence promoters noncoding sequences randomly fragmented dna used wide array biological experiments practical applications ranging genetic fingerprinting large scale protein production occasionally term cloning misleadingly used refer identification chromosomal location gene associated particular phenotype interest positional cloning practice localization gene chromosome genomic region necessarily enable one isolate amplify relevant genomic sequence amplify dna sequence living organism sequence must linked origin replication sequence dna capable directing propagation linked sequence however number features needed variety specialised cloning vectors small piece dna foreign dna fragment inserted exist allow protein expression tagging single stranded rna dna production host manipulations
cloning dna fragment essentially involves four steps
fragmentation breaking apart strand dna
ligation gluing together pieces dna desired sequence
transfection inserting newly formed pieces dna cells
screeningselection selecting cells successfully transfected new dna
although steps invariable among cloning procedures number alternative routes selected summarized cloning strategy
initially dna interest needs isolated provide dna segment suitable size subsequently ligation procedure used amplified fragment inserted vector piece dna vector frequently circular linearised using restriction enzymes incubated fragment interest appropriate conditions enzyme called dna ligase following ligation vector insert interest transfected cells number alternative techniques available chemical sensitivation cells electroporation optical injection biolistics finally transfected cells cultured aforementioned procedures particularly low efficiency need identify cells successfully transfected vector construct containing desired insertion sequence required orientation modern cloning vectors include selectable antibiotic resistance markers allow cells vector transfected grow additionally cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers provide bluewhite screening alphafactor complementation xgal medium nevertheless selection steps absolutely guarantee dna insert present cells obtained investigation resulting colonies must required confirm cloning successful may accomplished means pcr restriction fragment analysis andor dna sequencing
cell cloning

scnt donor cells genetic information transferred donor cells mitochondria contain mitochondrial dna left behind resulting hybrid cells retain mitochondrial structures originally belonged egg consequence clones dolly born scnt perfect copies donor nucleus
organism cloning
organism cloning also called reproductive cloning refers procedure creating new multicellular organism genetically identical another essence form cloning asexual method reproduction fertilization intergamete contact take place asexual reproduction naturally occurring phenomenon many species including plants see vegetative reproduction insects scientists made major achievements cloning including asexual reproduction sheep cows lot ethical debate whether cloning used however cloning asexual propagation common practice horticultural world hundreds years
horticultural
term clone used horticulture refer descendants single plant produced vegetative reproduction apomixis many horticultural plant cultivars clones derived single individual multiplied process sexual reproduction example european cultivars grapes represent clones propagated two millennia examples potato banana grafting regarded cloning since shoots branches coming graft genetically clone single individual particular kind cloning come ethical scrutiny generally treated entirely different kind operation
many trees shrubs vines ferns herbaceous perennials form clonal colonies naturally parts individual plant may become detached fragmentation grow become separate clonal individuals common example vegetative reproduction moss liverwort gametophyte clones means gemmae vascular plants eg dandelion certain viviparous grasses also form seeds asexually termed apomixis resulting clonal populations genetically identical individuals
parthenogenesis
clonal derivation exists nature animal species referred parthenogenesis reproduction organism without mate asexual form reproduction found females insects crustaceans nematodes fish example hammerhead shark komodo dragon lizards growth development occurs without fertilization male plants parthenogenesis means development embryo unfertilized egg cell component process apomixis species use xy sexdetermination system offspring always female example little fire ant wasmannia auropunctata native central south america spread throughout many tropical environments
