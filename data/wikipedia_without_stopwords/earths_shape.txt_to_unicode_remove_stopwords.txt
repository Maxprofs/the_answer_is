earth approximately spherical single value serves natural radius distances points surface center range km km mi several different ways modeling earth sphere yield mean radius kilometers mi regardless model radius falls polar minimum km equatorial maximum km mi difference kilometers mi correspond polar radius approximately shorter equator radius
ellipsoid revolution
since earth flattened poles bulges equator geodesy represents shape earth oblate spheroid oblate spheroid oblate ellipsoid ellipsoid revolution obtained rotating ellipse shorter axis regular geometric shape nearly approximates shape earth spheroid describing figure earth celestial body called reference ellipsoid reference ellipsoid earth called earth ellipsoid
ellipsoid revolution uniquely defined two numbers two dimensions one dimension number representing difference two dimensions geodesists convention use semimajor axis flattening size represented radius equator semimajor axis crosssectional ellipse designated letter shape ellipsoid given flattening indicates much ellipsoid departs spherical practice two defining numbers usually equatorial radius reciprocal flattening rather flattening wgs spheroid used todays gps systems reciprocal flattening set exactly
difference sphere reference ellipsoid earth small one part historically flattening computed grade measurements nowadays geodetic networks satellite geodesy used practice many reference ellipsoids developed centuries different surveys flattening value varies slightly one reference ellipsoid another reflecting local conditions whether reference ellipsoid intended model entire earth portion
sphere single radius curvature simply radius sphere complex surfaces radii curvature vary surface radius curvature describes radius sphere best approximates surface point oblate ellipsoids constant radius curvature east west along parallels graticule drawn surface varying curvature direction oblate ellipsoid polar radius curvature larger equatorial
pole flattened flatter surface larger sphere must approximate conversely ellipsoids northsouth radius curvature equator smaller polar
distance center ellipsoid equator semimajor axis distance center pole semiminor axis
complicated shapes
