hazardous waste waste poses substantial potential threats public health environment united states treatment storage disposal hazardous waste regulated resource conservation recovery act rcra hazardous wastes defined rcra cfr divided two major categories characteristic wastes listed wastes
characteristic hazardous wastes materials known tested exhibit one following four hazardous traits
ignitability
reactivity
corrosivity
toxicity
listed hazardous wastes materials specifically listed regulatory authorities hazardous waste nonspecific sources specific sources discarded chemical products
requirements rcra apply companies generate hazardous waste well companies store dispose hazardous waste united states many types businesses generate hazardous waste example dry cleaners automobile repair shops hospitals exterminators photo processing centers may generate hazardous waste hazardous waste generators larger companies chemical manufacturers electroplating companies oil refineries
wastes may found different physical states gaseous liquids solids hazardous waste special type waste cannot disposed common means like byproducts everyday lives depending physical state waste treatment solidification processes might required

hazardous waste mapping systems
us government provides several tools mapping hazardous wastes particular locations tools also allow user view additional information

universal wastes
universal wastes special category hazardous wastes us
generally pose lower threat relative hazardous wastes
ubiquitous produced large quantities large number generators
common universal wastes fluorescent light bulbs specialty batteries eg lithium lead containing batteries cathode ray tubes mercurycontaining devices
universal wastes subject somewhat less stringent regulatory requirements small quantity generators universal wastes may classified conditionally exempt small quantity generators cesqgs releases regulatory requirements handling storage hazardous wastes
universal wastes must still disposed properly information see overview requirements conditionally exempt small quantity generators
household hazardous waste
household hazardous waste hhw also referred domestic hazardous waste home generated special materials waste generated residential households hhw applies wastes result use materials labeled sold home use wastes generated company industrial setting hhw
following list includes categories often applied hhw important note many categories overlap many household wastes fall multiple categories
paints solvents
automotive wastes used motor oil antifreeze etc
pesticides insecticides herbicides fungicides etc
mercurycontaining wastes thermometers switches fluorescent lighting etc
electronics computers televisions cell phones
aerosols propane cylinders
caustics cleaning agents
refrigerantcontaining appliances
specialty batteries eg lithium nickel cadmium button cell batteries
ammunition
radioactive waste home smoke detectors classified radioactive waste contain small amounts radioactive isotope americium see disposing smoke detectors
final disposal hazardous waste
historically hazardous wastes disposed regular landfills resulted unfavorable amounts hazardous materials seeping ground chemicals eventually entered natural hydrologic systems many landfills require countermeasures groundwater contamination example installing barrier along foundation landfill contain hazardous substances may remain disposed waste currently hazardous wastes must often stabilized solidified order enter landfill many hazardous wastes undergo different treatments order stabilize dispose flammable materials recycled one example recycled industrial fuel materials hazardous constituents recycled lead acid batteries one example
recycling
many hazardous wastes recycled new products examples might include leadacid batteries electronic circuit boards heavy metals types ashes go proper treatment could bind pollutants convert easiertodispose solids could used pavement filling treatments reduce level threat harmful chemicals like fly bottom ash also recycling safe product
portland cement
another commonly used treatment cement based solidification stabilization cement used treat range hazardous wastes improving physical characteristics decreasing toxicity transmission contaminants cement produced categorized different divisions depending strength components process converting sludge cement might include addition ph adjustment agents phosphates sulfur reagents reduce settling curing time increase compressive strength reduce leach ability contaminants
incineration destruction wastetoenergy
hw may destroyed example incinerating high temperature flammable wastes sometimes burned energy sources example many cement kilns burn hws like used oils solvents today incineration treatments reduce amount hazardous waste also generate energy gases released process known particular waste treatment releases toxic gases produced combustion byproduct materials affect environment however current technology developed efficient incinerator units control emissions point treatment considered beneficial option different types incinerators vary depending characteristics waste starved air incineration another method used treat hazardous wastes like common incineration burning occurs however controlling amount oxygen allowed proves significant reduce amount harmful byproducts produced starved air incineration improvement traditional incinerators terms air pollution using technology possible control combustion rate waste therefore reduce air pollutants produced process
hazardous waste landfill sequestering isolation etc
hw may sequestered hw landfill permanent disposal facility terms hazardous waste landfill defined disposal facility part facility hazardous waste placed land pile land treatment facility surface impoundment underground injection well salt dome formation salt bed formation underground mine cave corrective action management unit cfr
pyrolysis
hazardous waste types may eliminated using pyrolysis ultra high temperature electrical arc inert conditions avoid combustion treatment method may preferable high temperature incineration circumstances destruction concentrated organic waste types including pcbs pesticides persistent organic pollutants
