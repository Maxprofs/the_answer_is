=== temple shrinesedit ===
many shrines are located within buildings and in the temples designed specifically for worship such as a church in christianity or a mandir in hinduism a shrine here is usually the centre of attention in the building and is given a place of prominence in such cases adherents of the faith assemble within the building in order to venerate the deity at the shrine in classical temple architecture the shrine may be synonymous with the cella
=== household shrinesedit ===
historically in hinduism buddhism and roman catholicism and also in modern faiths such as neopaganism a shrine can commonly be found within the home or shop this shrine is usually a small structure or a setup of pictures and figurines dedicated to a deity that is part of the official religion to ancestors or to a localised household deity
small household shrines are very common among the chinese and people from south and southeast asia whether hindu buddhist or christian usually a small lamp and small offerings are kept daily by the shrine buddhist household shrines must be on a shelf above the head chinese shrines must stand directly on the floor
=== yard shrinesedit ===

in the united states some christians have small yard shrines some of these resemble side altars since they are composed of a statue placed in a niche or grotto this type is colloquially referred to as a bathtub madonna
== religious shrinesedit ==
shrines are found in most though not all religions as distinguished from a temple a shrine usually houses a particular relic or cult image which is the object of worship or veneration or is constructed to set apart a site which is thought to be particularly holy as opposed to being placed for the convenience of worshippers shrines therefore attract the practice of pilgrimage
=== christianityedit ===
shrines are found in many though not all forms of christianity roman catholicism the largest denomination of christianity has many shrines as do orthodox christianity and anglicanism
in the roman catholic code of canon law canons 1230 and 1231 read the term shrine means a church or other sacred place which with the approval of the local ordinary is by reason of special devotion frequented by the faithful as pilgrims for a shrine to be described as national the approval of the episcopal conference is necessary for it to be described as international the approval of the holy see is required.
another use of the term shrine in colloquial catholic terminology is a niche or alcove in most especially larger churches used by parishioners when praying privately in the church they were also called devotional altars since they could look like small side altars or bye-altars shrines were always centered on some image of christ or a saint for instance a statue painting mural or mosaic and may have had a reredos behind them (without a tabernacle built in)
however mass would not be celebrated at them they were simply used to aid or give a visual focus for prayers side altars where mass could actually be celebrated were used in a similar way to shrines by parishioners side altars were specifically dedicated to the virgin mary saint joseph as well as other saints
a nativity set could also be viewed as a shrine as the definition of a shrine is any holy or sacred place

==== sunni islamedit ====
according to the classical chief sources of legislation and jurisprudence in orthodox sunni islam primarily the quran and hadith texts (and notably the practice of the sunni school of thought and early muslims) it is understood to be allowed to build shrine over graves however the salafi based on the legal evidence where muhammad ordered to demolish all the structures over graves and forbade acts of worship at the graveyards.* it was narrated that abul-hayaaj al-asadi said ali ibn abi taalib said to me shall i not send you on the same mission as the messenger of allah sent me do not leave any statue without erasing it and do not leave any raised grave without leveling it yet the sunni and most islamic scholars say that this is a wrong interpretation of the hadith
