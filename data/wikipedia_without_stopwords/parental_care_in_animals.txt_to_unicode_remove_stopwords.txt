parental investment pi evolutionary biology evolutionary psychology parental expenditure time energy etc benefits one offspring cost parents ability invest components fitness thus form sexual selection components fitness include wellbeing existing offspring parents future sexual reproduction inclusive fitness aid kin parental investment may performed male female biparental care mother alone exclusive maternal care father alone exclusive paternal care
initially introduced english biologist statistician ronald fisher parental care found broad range taxonomic groups including ectothermic invertebrates fish amphibians reptiles endothermic birds mammals species care provided stage offsprings life prenatal care including behaviours egg guarding preparation nest brood carrying incubation placental nourishment mammals postnatal care including food provisioning protection offspring
parental investment parental care
parental investment theory branch life history theory earliest consideration parental investment given ronald fisher book genetical theory natural selection wherein fisher argued parental expenditure sexes offspring equal cluttonbrock expanded concept pi include costs component parental fitness
reproduction costly individuals limited degree devote time resources producing raising young expenditure may also detrimental future condition survival reproductive output however expenditure typically beneficial offspring enhancing condition survival reproductive success differences may lead parentoffspring conflict parental investment provided female female uniparental care male male uniparental care biparental care parents naturally selected maximise difference benefits costs parental care tend exist benefits substantially greater costs
penguins prime example species drastically sacrifices health wellbeing exchange survival offspring overall fitness population altruistic behavior one necessarily benefit individual population whole seen king penguin although animals exhibit altruistic behaviors towards individuals direct relation many behaviors appear mostly parentoffspring relationships breeding males remain fastingperiod breeding site five weeks waiting female return incubation shift however time period males may decide abandon egg female delayed return breeding grounds interesting case shows penguins initially show tradeoff health hopes increasing survivorship egg comes point male penguins costs become high comparison gain successful breeding season study olof olsson investigated correlation many experiences breeding individual duration individual wait abandoning egg proposed experienced individual better individual replenishing exhausted body reserves allowing remain egg longer period time males sacrifice body weight possible survivorship order increase offsprings chance survival tradeoff current reproductive success parents future survival tradeoff makes sense examples kinbased altruism clear example use altruism attempt increase overall fitness population expense individuals fitness
study found male dunnocks tend discriminate young another male polyandrous polygynandrous systems however increase reproductive success feeding offspring relation access female throughout mating period generally good predictor paternity indiscriminative parental care males also observed redlip blennies
iteroparous species individuals may go several reproductive bouts lifetime tradeoff may exist investment current offspring future reproduction parents need balance offsprings demands selfmaintenance potential negative effect parental care explicitly formalised trivers originally defined term parental investment mean investment parent individual offspring increases offsprings chance surviving hence reproductive success cost parents ability invest offspring
benefits parental investment offspring large associated effects condition growth survival ultimately reproductive success offspring example cichlid fish tropheus moorii female high parental investment young mouthbroods young mouthbrooding nourishment takes goes feed young effectively starves young larger heavier faster would without benefits advantageous since lowers risk eaten predators size usually determining factor conflicts resources however benefits come cost parents ability reproduce future eg increased risk injury defending offspring predators loss mating opportunities whilst rearing offspring increase time interval next reproduction
special case parental investment young need nourishment protection genetic parents actually contribute effort raise offspring example bombus terrestris often times sterile female workers reproduce raise mothers brood instead common social hymenoptera due haplodiploidy whereby males haploid females diploid ensures sisters related ever would offspring incentivizing help raise mothers young
overall parents selected maximise difference benefits costs parental care likely evolve benefits exceed costs
specificity offspring situations
parental care requires behaviors effectively enhances offsprings chances survival require underlying mechanisms potentially continuum generalizable empathy appliceable adults even situations involving young specific reactions require offspring altruistic back way total ungeneralizability adults evolvability advantage making parentally caring individuals vulnerable exploited adults
sexual selection parental investment
many species sexual selection closely linked parental investment theory male species produce large number offspring course life minimizing parental investment favor investing time instead impregnating reproductiveage female fertile contrast female said species typically much smaller number offspring reproductive life partly due obligatory nonnil parental investment ie gestation delivery suggests females selective choosy mates males choosing males good fitness eg genes high status resources etc help offset lack direct parental investment male therefore increase reproductive success robert trivers theory parental investment predicts sex making largest investment lactation nurturing protecting offspring discriminating mating sex invests less offspring compete access higherinvesting sex see batemans principle
species sexes invest highly parental care mutual choosiness expected arise example seen crested auklets parents share equal responsibility incubating single egg raising chick crested auklets sexes ornamented
importance parental investment seen especially species offspring altricial ie unable fend earliest ages many bird species modern humans leads males spending time caring offspring male parents precocial species since reproductive success would otherwise suffer higher parental investment humans result extended childhood required order develop unusually large human brain time parental investment comes form feeding teaching protection example
however human parental investment starts point sperm fertilizes egg minimal obligatory parental investment male zero effort minimal obligatory investment female nine months pregnancy followed delivery difference minimal obligatory investment males females suggests amount investment effort put mating parenting differ
insects male parental investment given form nuptial gift instance ornate moth females receive spermatophore containing nutrients sperm defensive toxins male copulation gift account males body mass constitutes total parental investment male provides
