prehistory
precambrian fossils known arkansas states fossil record begin paleozoic paleozoic northern central western arkansas covered seawater ordovician life inhabiting modern arkansas diverse remains life period fossilized east lafferty creek cushman areas independence county silurian arkansas also home great diversity life remains period like ordovician preserved cushman area independence county ensuing devonian period conodonts sporangites preserved caddo gap montgomery county

southwestern arkansas part coastline western interior seaway cretaceous dinosaurs roamed ancient shorelines individuals groups many footprints left coastal sauropods preserved southwestern part state theropod arkansaurus fridayi lived time known remains foot since preserved foot bones arkansaurus provide little direct evidence creature like life much known arkansaurus inferred analogy dinosaurs similar anatomy
arkansaurus may distant relative ostrich dinosaur ornithomimus arkansaurus probably fast moving omnivore feet m tall long arms would likely ended three fingered grasping hands dinosaurs ankylosaurs carnosaurs probably lived alongside arkansaurus trackleaving sauropods early cretaceous

history
august j b friday discovered dinosaur bones sevier county gravel pit near lockesburg fossils friday discovered cleaned compared related dinosaurs university arkansas professor james harrison quinn course research harrison made hypothetical clay models missing bones animals foot duplicated actual fossils plaster cast latex molds harrison published description bones nicknamed animal arkansaurus fridayi paper first scientific description dinosaur bones ever found arkansas
gypsum quarry southwestern arkansas preserves dinosaur tracks hindered quarry operations called briar site areas quarry rough due appeared large potholes frustrated drivers excavation equipment however potholes recognized dinosaur footprints jeff pittman responsible correct identification tracks time studying quarrys sedimentology visited purgatoire tracksite colorado noticed local sauropod tracks resembled potholes seen briar site arkansas pittman later performed aerial survey found evidence parallel sauropod trackways rock surface also extensively trampled
briar quarry two separate surfaces preserve thousands dinosaur tracks operations quarry continue uncover destroy dinosaur footprints pittman successfully dated dinosaur tracks briar quarry equal age lower glen rose formations megatracksites miles away
fall senior paleontologist dinamation international james kirkland examined arkansaurus foot found larger otherwise nearly identical new species found two years prior utah rocks early cretaceous age kirkland concurred arkansaurus likely related ornithomimus would oldest known member group dinosaurs future clues arkansaurus may come similar dinosaur discovery maryland yet described
