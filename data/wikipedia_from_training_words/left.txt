cytosine /satsn/ (c) is one of the four main bases found in dna and rna along with adenine guanine and thymine (uracil in rna) it is a pyrimidine derivative with a heterocyclic aromatic ring and two substituents attached (an amine group at position 4 and a keto group at position 2) the nucleoside of cytosine is cytidine in watson-crick base pairing it forms three hydrogen bonds with guanine
== history ==
cytosine was discovered and named by albrecht kossel and albert neumann in 1894 when it was hydrolyzed from calf thymus tissues a structure was proposed in 1903 and was synthesized (and thus confirmed) in the laboratory in the same year
cytosine recently found use in quantum computation the first time any quantum mechanical properties were harnessed to process information took place on august 1 in 1998 when researchers at oxford implemented david deutsch's algorithm on a two qubit nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer (nmrqc) based on cytosine
in march 2015 nasa scientists reported that for the first time complex dna and rna organic compounds of life including uracil cytosine and thymine have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions using starting chemicals such as pyrimidine found in meteorites pyrimidine like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds according to the scientists
== chemical reactions ==
cytosine can be found as part of dna as part of rna or as a part of a nucleotide as cytidine triphosphate (ctp) it can act as a co-factor to enzymes and can transfer a phosphate to convert adenosine diphosphate (adp) to adenosine triphosphate (atp)
in dna and rna cytosine is paired with guanine however it is inherently unstable and can change into uracil (spontaneous deamination) this can lead to a point mutation if not repaired by the dna repair enzymes such as uracil glycosylase which cleaves a uracil in dna
when found third in a codon of rna cytosine is synonymous with uracil as they are interchangeable as the third base when found as the second base in a codon the third is always interchangeable for example ucu ucc uca and ucg are all serine regardless of the third base
cytosine can also be methylated into 5-methylcytosine by an enzyme called dna methyltransferase or be methylated and hydroxylated to make 5-hydroxymethylcytosine active enzymatic deamination of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine by the apobec family of cytosine deaminases could have both beneficial and detrimental implications on various cellular processes as well as on organismal evolution the implications of deamination on 5-hydroxymethylcytosine on the other hand remains less understood
