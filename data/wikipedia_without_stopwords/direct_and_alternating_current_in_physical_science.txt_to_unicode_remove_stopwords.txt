transmission distribution domestic power supplyedit
reason electric power distributed alternating current ac voltage may increased decreased transformer allows power transmitted power lines efficiently high voltage reduces power lost heat due resistance wire voltage reduced safe levels use customer use higher voltage leads significantly efficient transmission power power losses conductor product square current resistance r conductor described formula
means transmitting fixed power given wire current doubled power loss four times greater
power transmitted equal product current voltage assuming phase difference
thus amount power transmitted lower current increasing voltage therefore advantageous transmitting large amounts power distribute power high voltages often hundreds kilovolts

effects high frequenciesedit
direct current flows uniformly throughout crosssection uniform wire alternating current frequency forced away wires center toward outer surface acceleration electric charge alternating current produces waves electromagnetic radiation cancel propagation electricity toward center materials high conductivity phenomenon called skin effect
high frequencies current longer flows wire effectively flows surface wire within thickness skin depths skin depth thickness current density reduced even relatively low frequencies used power transmission hz nonuniform distribution current still occurs sufficiently thick conductors example skin depth copper conductor approximately mm hz high current conductors usually hollow reduce mass cost
since current tends flow periphery conductors effective crosssection conductor reduced increases effective ac resistance conductor since resistance inversely proportional crosssectional area ac resistance often many times higher dc resistance causing much higher energy loss due ohmic heating also called ir loss
