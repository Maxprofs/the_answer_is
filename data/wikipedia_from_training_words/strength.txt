forced is an action role-playing game having a top-down view for up to four players in the combat arena players have to select a weapon which have 16 unlockable abilities each similar to a character class though single player mode is also available the game is mostly about cooperative gameplay by selecting a weapon class and abilities which complement the other players while combating demons of various sizes and solving environmental puzzlesusing a will-o-wisp-like companion called balfus the spirit mentor
there are four weapon classes the storm bow the volcanic hammer the spirit knives and the frost shield each have the tactical roles of a long range attacker slow melee attacker fast melee attacker and a tank respectively the active and passive abilities available for each class allow some form of customization the weapon class and selected abilities (which also have cooldowns) can be changed before the start of any arena level each player must choose a different weapon class balfus can be made to interact with the environment's spiritual plane by ordering him to activate or trigger props like healing pedestals or set off a stunning blast from traps he can travel with the characters float in space or can be called to their location good positioning and communication will help the players use balfus efficiently the need to do this while facing waves of enemies makes the game more challenging
gems are rewarded after completion of each arena trial they can be used to enhance the weapons by unlocking more ability slots and new abilities at regular intervals each trial contains three gems as a reward the first requires completion the second is a specific challenge and the third is a time trial if the arena boss is too difficult it is possible to complete all these challenges to earn extra gems forced has a mark combat system where weapons cause marks on the enemies greater number of marks cause certain abilities to have better effects thus making it more effective to hit a group of enemies a few times before using an ability rather than using it at the start though the difficulty increases in proportion to the number of players and sharing balfus needs communication between them multiplayer is easier and lets the player focus on specific abilities and tactical roles instead of being forced to cover every possibility in single player also if a player dies the trial can be completed as long as another survives till the end

forced won the level up 2013 intel award and betadwarf received the danish developer of the year at the 2013 spilprisen game awards held by the danish producers association it received moderate to favorable reviews brittany vincent of hardcore gamer gave the game a 4/5 calling it a gleeful return to form for cooperative play. jim rossignol from rock paper shotgun called it a competently produced game but said that it simply lacks flair and combined with the slightly awkward mechanics in co-op play means it never feels wholly convincing. lena leray from indiegames.com felt the voice acting was mediocre and acknowledged the lack of depth in the plot but said that the engaging gameplay compensated it bob richardson from rpgfan also highlighted these issues in addition to various technical glitches in multiplayer richardson praised the gameplay the puzzle system and the skill customization giving the game 80% rating he said forced is purely an intrinsic experience defeat is the result of lack of cooperation and skill and victory is directly related to teamwork communication and aptitude.
zach welhouse from rpgamer gave it a 3/5 calling the combat complex and rewarding and multiplayer a good balance of tactics and adrenaline. he also praised the music balfus's character and called the puzzle-solving system unique but noted the bare plot and game difficulty as its negative highlights welhouse commented the sheer number of ways to die makes it difficult to tell how much of forced is unfair and how much is a series of lessons in avoiding dangerous situations to unlock a new ability is a compelling system for squeezing the most effort out of a player. jason venter from gamespot gave it 5/10 and said it's a challenging game with built-in reasons to revisit familiar areas but it's also too demanding for its own good and the results are more frustrating than satisfying. mike gunn from nzgamer.com gave it 8.6/10 and said such a simple game but one with a lot of tactical and strategic depth.
