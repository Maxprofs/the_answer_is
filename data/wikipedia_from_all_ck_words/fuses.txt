february is the third month of meteorological winter in the northern hemisphere in the southern hemisphere february is the third month of summer (the seasonal equivalent of august in the northern hemisphere in meteorological reckoning)
== history ==
the roman month februarius was named after the latin term februum which means purification via the purification ritual februa held on february 15 (full moon) in the old lunar roman calendar january and february were the last two months to be added to the roman calendar since the romans originally considered winter a monthless period they were added by numa pompilius about 713 bc february remained the last month of the calendar year until the time of the decemvirs (c 450 bc) when it became the second month at certain intervals february was truncated to 23 or 24 days and a 27-day intercalary month intercalaris was inserted immediately after february to realign the year with the seasons
under the reforms that instituted the julian calendar intercalaris was abolished leap years occurred regularly every fourth year and in leap years february gained a 29th day thereafter it remained the second month of the calendar year meaning the order that months are displayed (january february march  december) within a year-at-a-glance calendar even during the middle ages when the numbered anno domini year began on march 25 or december 25 the second month was february whenever all twelve months were displayed in order the gregorian calendar reforms made slight changes to the system for determining which years were leap years and thus contained a 29-day february
historical names for february include the old english terms solmonath (mud month) and kale-monath (named for cabbage) as well as charlemagne's designation hornung in finnish the month is called helmikuu meaning month of the pearl when snow melts on tree branches it forms droplets and as these freeze again they are like pearls of ice in polish and ukrainian respectively the month is called luty or  meaning the month of ice or hard frost in macedonian the month is sechko () meaning month of cutting [wood] in czech it is called nor meaning month of submerging [of river ice] croatians call the month veljaa whose meaning is unknown but may come from the word for greater, a possible reference to the days increasing in length
in slovene february is traditionally called svean related to icicles or candlemas this name originates from sian written as svian in the new carniolan almanac from 1775 and changed to its final form by franc metelko in his new almanac from 1824 the name was also spelled sean meaning the month of cutting down of trees in 1848 a proposal was put forward in kmetijske in rokodelske novice by the slovene society of ljubljana to call this month talnik (related to ice melting) but it did not stick the idea was proposed by the priest and patriot bla potonik another name of february in slovene was vesnar after the mythological character vesna
== pronunciation ==
february may be pronounced either as (/fbjuri/ or /fbruri/ feb-ew-err-ee or feb-roo-err-ee) many people pronounce it as (/ju/ ew rather than /ru/ roo) as if it were spelled feb-u-ary this comes about by analogy with january (which ends in -uary but not -ruary") as well as by a dissimilation effect whereby having two r"s close to each other causes one to change for ease of pronunciation
== patterns ==
february starts on the same day of the week as both march and november in common years and as august in leap years february ends on the same day of the week as october every year and on the same day of the week as january in common years only february starts on the same day of the week as june of the previous year in all years february ends on the same day of the week as may of the previous year in common years and august and november of the previous year in leap years february ends on the same day of the week as july of the following year in years immediately before common years and april and december of the following year in years immediately before leap years february starts on the same day of the week as may of the following year in leap years and years immediately before leap years in leap years it is the only month that ends on the same weekday it began
having only 28 days in common years it is the only month of the year that can pass without a single full moon this last happened in 1999 and will next happen in 2018
february is also the only month of the calendar that once every six years and twice every 11 years consecutively either back into the past or forward into the future will have four full 7-day weeks in countries that start their week on a monday it occurs as part of a common year starting on friday in which february 1st is a monday and the 28th is a sunday this was observed in 2010 and can be traced back 11 years to 1999 6 years back to 1993 11 years back to 1982 11 years back to 1971 and 6 years back to 1965 and will be observed in 2021 in countries that start their week on a sunday it occurs in a common year starting on thursday with the next occurrence in 2026 and previous occurrences in 2015 (11 years earlier than 2026) 2009 (6 years earlier than 2015) 1998 (11 years earlier than 2009) and 1987 (11 years earlier than 1998) this works unless the pattern is broken by a skipped leap year but no leap year has been skipped since 1900 and no others will be skipped until 2100
