boiling rapid vaporization liquid occurs liquid heated boiling point temperature vapor pressure liquid equal pressure exerted liquid surrounding environmental pressure
typesedit
nucleateedit
nucleate boiling characterized growth bubbles pops heated surface rise discrete points surface whose temperature slightly liquids general number nucleation sites increased increasing surface temperature
irregular surface boiling vessel ie increased surface roughness additives fluid ie surfactants andor nanoparticles create additional nucleation sites exceptionally smooth surface plastic lends superheating conditions heated liquid may show boiling delay temperature may go somewhat boiling point without boiling
critical heat fluxedit
boiling surface heated critical temperature film vapor forms surface since vapor film much less capable carrying heat away surface temperature rises rapidly beyond point transition boiling regime point occurs dependent characteristics boiling fluid heating surface question
transitionedit
transition boiling may defined unstable boiling occurs surface temperatures maximum attainable nucleate minimum attainable film boiling
formation bubbles heated liquid complex physical process often involves cavitation acoustic effects broadspectrum hiss one hears kettle yet heated point bubbles boil surface
filmedit
surface heating liquid significantly hotter liquid film boiling occur thin layer vapor low thermal conductivity insulates surface condition vapor film insulating surface liquid characterizes film boiling
distillation boiling used separating mixtures possible vapor rising boiling fluid generally ratio components different liquid
usesedit
making water potableedit
method disinfecting water bringing boiling point c f oldest effective way since affect taste effective despite contaminants particles present single step process eliminates microbes responsible causing intestine related diseases places proper water purification system recommended emergency treatment method obtaining potable water wilderness rural areas cannot remove chemical toxins impurities
elimination microorganisms boiling follows firstorder kineticsat high temperatures achieved less time lower temperatures time heat sensitivity microorganisms varies c f giardia species causes giardiasis take ten minutes complete inactivation intestine affecting microbes e coli gastroenteritis take less minute boiling point vibrio cholerae cholera takes ten seconds hepatitis virus causes symptom jaundice one minute boiling ensure elimination microorganisms bacterial spores clostridium survive c f waterborne intestine affecting thus human health complete sterilization water required
traditional advice boiling water ten minutes mainly additional safety since microbes start getting eliminated temperatures greater c f bringing boiling point also useful indication seen without help thermometer time water disinfected though boiling point decreases increasing altitude enough affect disinfecting process
cookingedit
boiling method cooking food boiling water waterbased liquids stock milk simmering gentle boiling poaching cooking liquid moves scarcely bubbles
boiling point water typically considered c f pressure change composition liquid may alter boiling point liquid reason high elevation cooking generally takes longer since boiling point function atmospheric pressure denver colorado usa elevation one mile water boils approximately c f depending type food elevation boiling water may hot enough cook food properly similarly increasing pressure pressure cooker raises temperature contents open air boiling point
adding water soluble substance salt sugar also increases boiling point called boilingpoint elevation palatable concentrations salt effect small boiling point elevation difficult notice however making thick sugar syrup gulab jamun one notice boiling point elevation due variations composition pressure boiling point water almost never exactly c rather close enough cooking
foods suitable boiling include vegetables starchy foods rice noodles potatoes eggs meats sauces stocks soups
boiling several advantages safe simple appropriate largescale cookery older tougher cheaper cuts meat poultry made digestible nutritious well flavored stock produced also maximum color nutritive value retained cooking green vegetables provided boiling time kept minimum
hand several disadvantages loss soluble vitamins foods water water discarded boiling also slow method cooking food
boiling done several ways food placed already rapidly boiling water left cook heat turned food simmered food also placed pot cold water may added pot may boiled food satisfactory
water outside pot ie wet pot increases time takes pot water boil pot heat normal rate excess water outside pot evaporates
boiling also often used remove salt certain foodstuffs bacon less saline product required
boilinthebagedit
also known boilinbag involves heating cooking readymade foods sealed thick plastic bag bag containing food often frozen submerged boiling water prescribed time resulting dishes prepared greater convenience pots pans dirtied process meals available camping well home dining
contrast evaporation
given temperature molecules liquid kinetic energy high energy particles liquid surface may enough energy escape inter molecular forces attraction liquid become gas called evaporation
evaporation happens surface boiling happens throughout liquid
