sulfide (systematically named sulfanediide and sulfide(2)) is an inorganic anion of sulfur with the chemical formula s2 it contributes no color to sulfide salts as it is classified as a strong base even dilute solutions of salts such as sodium sulfide (na2s) are corrosive and can attack the skin sulfide is the simplest sulfur anion
== nomenclatureedit ==
the systematic names sulfanediide and sulfide(2) valid iupac names are determined according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures respectively however the name sulfide is also used in compositional iupac nomenclature which does not take the nature of bonding involved examples of such naming are selenium disulfide and titanium sulfide which contains no sulfide ions whatsoever
sulfide is also used non-systematically to describe compounds which release hydrogen sulfide upon acidification or a compound that otherwise incorporates sulfur in some form such as dimethyl sulfide hydrogen sulfide is itself an example of a non-systematic name of this nature however it is also a trivial name and the preferred iupac name for sulfane
== chemical propertiesedit ==
sulfide does not exist in appreciable concentrations even in highly alkaline water being undetectable at ph < ~15 (8 m naoh)
=== basicityedit ===
the sulfide anion can assimilate a proton by recombination
s2 + h+ sh
because of this capture of a proton (h+) sulfide has basic character in aqueous solution it has a pkb value of less than 0 its conjugate acid is bisulfide (sh) in aqueous solution most sulfide ions are neutralized
s2 + h2o sh + oh
=== chemical reactionsedit ===
upon treatment with a standard acid sulfide converts to hydrogen sulfide (h2s) and a metal salt oxidation of sulfide gives sulfur or sulfate metal sulfides are mildly corroded by nonmetals including iodine bromine and chlorine forming sulfur and metal salts

sulfur can also be prepared from a sulfide and an appropriate oxidizer
16 hno3 + 24 h2s 16 no + 3 s8 + 32 h2o
== metal derivativesedit ==
aqueous solutions of transition metals cations react with sulfide sources (h2s nahs na2s) to precipitate solid sulfides such inorganic sulfides typically have very low solubility in water and many are related to minerals with the same composition (see below) one famous example is the bright yellow species cds or cadmium yellow the black tarnish formed on sterling silver is ag2s such species are sometimes referred to as salts in fact the bonding in transition metal sulfides is highly covalent which gives rise to their semiconductor properties which in turn is related to the deep colors several have practical applications as pigments in solar cells and as catalysts aspergillus niger plays a role in the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides
== geologyedit ==
many important metal ores are sulfides significant examples include argentite (silver sulfide) cinnabar (mercury) galena (lead sulfide) molybdenite (molybdenum sulfide) pentlandite (nickel sulfide]) realgar (arsenic sulfide) and stibnite (antimony) sphalerite (zinc sulfide) and pyrite (iron disulfide) and chalcopyrite (iron-copper sulfide)
== corrosion induced by sulfideedit ==
dissolved free sulfides (h2s hs and s2) are very aggressive species for the corrosion of many metals such as steel stainless steel and copper sulfides present in aqueous solution are responsible for stress corrosion cracking (scc) of steel and is also known as sulfide stress cracking corrosion is a major concern in many industrial installations processing sulfides sulfide ore mills deep oil wells pipeline transporting soured oil kraft paper factories
microbially-induced corrosion (mic) or biogenic sulfide corrosion are also caused by sulfate reducing bacteria producing sulfide that is emitted in the air and oxidized in sulfuric acid by sulfur oxidizing bacteria biogenic sulfuric acid reacts with sewerage materials and most generally causes mass loss cracking of the sewer pipes and ultimately structural collapse this kind of deterioration is a major process affecting sewer systems worldwide and leading to very high rehabilitation costs
oxidation of sulfide can also form thiosulfate (s2o32) an intermediate species responsible for severe problems of pitting corrosion of steel and stainless steel while the medium is also acidified by the production of sulfuric acid when oxidation is more advanced
== organic chemistryedit ==
in organic chemistry sulfide usually refers to the linkage c-s-c although the term thioether is less ambiguous for example the thioether dimethyl sulfide is ch3-s-ch3 polyphenylene sulfide (see below) has the empirical formula c6h4s occasionally the term sulfide refers to molecules containing the -sh functional group for example methyl sulfide can mean ch3-sh the preferred descriptor for such sh-containing compounds is thiol or mercaptan i.e methanethiol or methyl mercaptan
== disulfidesedit ==
confusion arises from the different meanings of the term disulfide molybdenum disulfide (mos2) consists of separated sulfide centers in association with molybdenum in the formal 4+ oxidation state (mo4+) iron disulfide (pyrite fes2) on the other hand consists of s22 or ss dianion in association with divalent iron in the formal 2+ oxidation state (ferrous ion fe2+) dimethyldisulfide has the chemical binding ch3-ss-ch3 whereas carbon disulfide has no ss bond being s=c=s (linear molecule analog to co2) most often in sulfur chemistry and in biochemistry the disulfide term is commonly ascribed to the sulfur analogue of the peroxide oo bond the disulfide bond (ss) plays a major role in the conformation of proteins and in the catalytic activity of enzymes
== examplesedit ==
== preparationedit ==
sulfide compounds can be prepared in several different ways
1 direct combination of elements
example fe(s) + s(s) --> fes(s)
2 reduction of a sulfate
example mgso4(s) + 4c(s) --> mgs(s) + 4co(g)
3 precipitation of an insoluble sulfide
example m2+ + h2s(g) --> ms(s) + 2h+(aq)
== safetyedit ==
many metal sulfides are so insoluble in water that they are probably not very toxic some metal sulfides when exposed to a strong mineral acid including gastric acids will release toxic hydrogen sulfide
organic sulfides are highly flammable when a sulfide burns it produces sulfur dioxide (so2) gas
hydrogen sulfide some of its salts and almost all organic sulfides have a strong and putrid stench rotting biomass releases these
