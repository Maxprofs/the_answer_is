mesosphere msosfr greek mesos middle sphaira ball layer earths atmosphere directly stratopause directly mesopause mesosphere temperature decreases altitude increases upper boundary mesosphere mesopause coldest naturally occurring place earth temperatures k f c exact upper lower boundaries mesosphere vary latitude season lower boundary mesosphere usually located heights kilometres ft mi earths surface mesopause usually heights near kilometres mi except middle high latitudes summer descends heights kilometres mi
stratosphere mesosphere lowest part thermosphere collectively referred middle atmosphere spans heights approximately kilometres ft kilometres mi mesopause altitude km mi separates mesosphere thermospherethe secondoutermost layer earths atmosphere also around altitude turbopause different chemical species well mixed due turbulent eddies level atmosphere becomes nonuniform scale heights different chemical species differ molecular masses
temperature
within mesosphere temperature decreases increasing height due decreasing solar heating increasing cooling co radiative emission top mesosphere called mesopause coldest part earths atmosphere temperatures upper mesosphere fall low c k f varying according latitude season
