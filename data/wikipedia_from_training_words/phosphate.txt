a phosphate (po43) is an inorganic chemical and a salt of phosphoric acid in organic chemistry a phosphate or organophosphate is an ester of phosphoric acid of the various phosphoric acids and phosphates organic phosphates are important in biochemistry and biogeochemistry (ecology) and inorganic phosphates are mined to obtain phosphorus for use in agriculture and industry at elevated temperatures in the solid state phosphates can condense to form pyrophosphates
the addition and removal of phosphates from proteins in all cells is a pivotal strategy in the regulation of metabolic processes phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are important ways that energy is stored and released in living systems
== chemical properties ==
the phosphate ion is a polyatomic ion with the empirical formula po43 and a molar mass of 94.97 g/mol it consists of one central phosphorus atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement the phosphate ion carries a negative-three formal charge and is the conjugate base of the hydrogen phosphate ion hpo42 which is the conjugate base of h2po4 the dihydrogen phosphate ion which in turn is the conjugate base of h

4 phosphoric acid a phosphate salt forms when a positively charged ion attaches to the negatively charged oxygen atoms of the ion forming an ionic compound many phosphates are not soluble in water at standard temperature and pressure the sodium potassium rubidium caesium and ammonium phosphates are all water-soluble most other phosphates are only slightly soluble or are insoluble in water as a rule the hydrogen and dihydrogen phosphates are slightly more soluble than the corresponding phosphates the pyrophosphates are mostly water-soluble
aqueous phosphate exists in four forms in strongly basic conditions the phosphate ion (po43) predominates whereas in weakly basic conditions the hydrogen phosphate ion (hpo42) is prevalent in weakly acid conditions the dihydrogen phosphate ion (h2po4) is most common in strongly acidic conditions trihydrogen phosphate (h

however phosphates are most commonly found in the form of adenosine phosphates (amp adp and atp) and in dna and rna and can be released by the hydrolysis of atp or adp similar reactions exist for the other nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates phosphoanhydride bonds in adp and atp or other nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates contain high amounts of energy which give them their vital role in all living organisms they are generally referred to as high-energy phosphate as are the phosphagens in muscle tissue compounds such as substituted phosphines have uses in organic chemistry but do not seem to have any natural counterparts
the addition and removal of phosphate from proteins in all cells is a pivotal strategy in the regulation of metabolic processes phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are important ways that energy is stored and released in living systems for example atp provides energy this way
phosphate is useful in animal cells as a buffering agent phosphate salts that are commonly used for preparing buffer solutions at cell phs include na2hpo4 nah2po4 and the corresponding potassium salts
an important occurrence of phosphates in biological systems is as the structural material of bone and teeth these structures are made of crystalline calcium phosphate in the form of hydroxyapatite the hard dense enamel of mammalian teeth consists of fluoroapatite a hydroxy calcium phosphate where some of the hydroxyl groups have been replaced by fluoride ions
plants take up phosphorus through several pathways the arbuscular mycorrhizal pathway and the direct uptake pathway
== occurrence and mining ==
phosphates are the naturally occurring form of the element phosphorus found in many phosphate minerals in mineralogy and geology phosphate refers to a rock or ore containing phosphate ions inorganic phosphates are mined to obtain phosphorus for use in agriculture and industry
the largest phosphorite or rock phosphate deposits in north america lie in the bone valley region of central florida the soda springs region of idaho and the coast of north carolina smaller deposits are located in montana tennessee georgia and south carolina near charleston along ashley phosphate road the small island nation of nauru and its neighbor banaba island which used to have massive phosphate deposits of the best quality have been mined excessively rock phosphate can also be found in egypt israel morocco navassa island tunisia togo and jordan countries that have large phosphate-mining industries
phosphorite mines are primarily found in
north america united states especially florida with lesser deposits in north carolina idaho and tennessee
africa algeria egypt morocco mainly near khouribga and youssoufia niger senegal togo tunisia and western sahara at the town of bu craa

in 2007 at the current rate of consumption the supply of phosphorus was estimated to run out in 345 years however some scientists believed that a peak phosphorus will occur in 30 years and dana cordell from institute for sustainable futures said that at current rates reserves will be depleted in the next 50 to 100 years. reserves refer to the amount assumed recoverable at current market prices and in 2012 the usgs estimated 71 billion tons of world reserves while 0.19 billion tons were mined globally in 2011 phosphorus comprises 0.1% by mass of the average rock (while for perspective its typical concentration in vegetation is 0.03% to 0.2%) and consequently there are quadrillions of tons of phosphorus in earth's 3 * 1019 ton crust albeit at predominantly lower concentration than the deposits counted as reserves from being inventoried and cheaper to extract if it is assumed that the phosphate minerals in phosphate rock are hydroxyapatite and fluoroapatite phosphate minerals contain roughly 18.5 % phosphorus by weight and if phosphate rock contains around 20 % of these minerals the average phosphate rock has roughly 3.7 % phosphorus by weight
some phosphate rock deposits are notable for their inclusion of significant quantities of radioactive uranium isotopes this syndrome is noteworthy because radioactivity can be released into surface waters in the process of application of the resultant phosphate fertilizer (e.g in many tobacco farming operations in the southeast us)
in december 2012 cominco resources announced an updated jorc compliant resource of their hinda project in congo-brazzaville of 531 mt making it the largest measured and indicated phosphate deposit in the world
== ecology ==
in ecological terms because of its important role in biological systems phosphate is a highly sought after resource once used it is often a limiting nutrient in environments and its availability may govern the rate of growth of organisms this is generally true of freshwater environments whereas nitrogen is more often the limiting nutrient in marine (seawater) environments addition of high levels of phosphate to environments and to micro-environments in which it is typically rare can have significant ecological consequences for example blooms in the populations of some organisms at the expense of others and the collapse of populations deprived of resources such as oxygen (see eutrophication) can occur in the context of pollution phosphates are one component of total dissolved solids a major indicator of water quality but not all phosphorus is in a molecular form which algae can break down and consume
calcium hydroxyapatite and calcite precipitates can be found around bacteria in alluvial topsoil as clay minerals promote biomineralization the presence of bacteria and clay minerals resulted in calcium hydroxyapatite and calcite precipitates
phosphate deposits can contain significant amounts of naturally occurring heavy metals mining operations processing phosphate rock can leave tailings piles containing elevated levels of cadmium lead nickel copper chromium and uranium unless carefully managed these waste products can leach heavy metals into groundwater or nearby estuaries uptake of these substances by plants and marine life can lead to concentration of toxic heavy metals in food products
