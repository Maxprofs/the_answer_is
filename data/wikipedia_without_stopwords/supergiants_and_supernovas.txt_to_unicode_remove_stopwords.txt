formation
supergiants evolved highmass stars larger luminous mainsequence stars o class early b class stars initial masses around m evolve away main sequence million years hydrogen consumed heavy elements start appear near surface star stars usually become blue supergiants although possible evolve directly wolfrayet stars expansion supergiant stage occurs hydrogen core star depleted hydrogen shell burning starts may also caused heavy elements dredged surface convection mass loss due radiation pressure increase
blue supergiants newly evolved main sequence extremely high luminosities high mass loss rates generally unstable many become luminous blue variables episodes extreme mass loss lower mass blue supergiants continue expand become red supergiants process obviously must spend time yellow supergiants yellow hypergiants expansion occurs thousand years stars rare higher mass red supergiants blow away outer atmospheres evolve back blue supergiants possibly onwards wolfrayet stars depending exact mass composition red supergiant execute number blue loops either exploding type ii supernova finally dumping enough outer layers become blue supergiant less luminous first time unstable star pass yellow evolutionary void expected becomes one lower luminosity lbvs
massive blue supergiants luminous retain extensive atmosphere never expand red supergiant dividing line approximately m although coolest largest red supergiants develop stars initial masses m isnt clear whether massive blue supergiants lose enough mass evolve safely comfortable old age wolf rayet star finally white dwarf reach wolf rayet stage explode supernovae explode supernovae blue supergiants

blue supergiants fast stellar winds generally show emission lines spectra luminous spectra dominated emission lines indicating strong continuum driven mass loss called hypergiants blue supergiants show varying quantities heavy elements spectra depending age efficiency products nucleosynthesis core convected surface quickly rotating supergiants highly mixed show high proportions helium even heavier elements still burning hydrogen core stars show spectra similar wolf rayet star
stellar wind red supergiant dense slow wind blue supergiant fast sparse red supergiant becomes blue supergiant faster wind produces impacts already emitted slow wind causes outflowing material condense thin shell cases several concentric faint shells seen successive episodes mass loss either previous blue loops red supergiant stage eruptions lbv outbursts
