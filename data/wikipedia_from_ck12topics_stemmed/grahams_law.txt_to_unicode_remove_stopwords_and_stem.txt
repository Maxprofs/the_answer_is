time graham work concept molecular weight establish larg part measur gase italian physicist amedeo avogadro suggest equal volum differ gase contain equal number molecul thus relat molecular weight two gase equal ratio weight equal volum gase avogadro insight togeth studi gas behaviour provid basi later theoret work scottish physicist jame clerk maxwel explain properti gase collect small particl move larg empti space
perhap greatest success kinet theori gase came call discoveri gase temperatur measur kelvin absolut temperatur scale direct proport averag kinet energi gas molecul kinet energi object equal onehalf mass time squar veloc thus equal kinet energi veloc two differ molecul would invers proport squar root mass rate effus determin number molecul enter apertur per unit time henc averag molecular veloc graham law diffus could thus understood consequ molecular kinet energi equal temperatur
