previous question in parliamentary procedure (also known as calling for the question calling the question close debate calling for a vote or other similar forms) is a motion to end debate and the moving of amendments on any debatable or amendable motion and bring that motion to an immediate vote
== explanation and use ==
it is often invoked by a member saying i call [for] the question. in the house of commons of the united kingdom the chair should respond with the question is that the question be not now put. the select committee on the modernisation of the house of commons criticized this procedure as totally incomprehensible and proposed in its place a simplified motion to proceed to the next business
under robert's rules of order newly revised (ronr) when a motion for the previous question is made (whether formally or in a nonstandard form such as calling the question close debate or calling for a vote") a two-thirds vote (or unanimous consent) is required to end debate this motion is not debatable because having debate on such a motion would defeat its purpose
the standard code of parliamentary procedure criticizes the previous question terminology as being confusing and instead calls this motion the motion to close debate the motion to vote immediately or the motion to close debate and vote immediately regardless of the terminology a two-thirds vote is required to end debate
in ordinary societies using one of these two codes of procedure the rationale for the two-thirds vote to end debate and move to a vote on the pending (previous) question is to protect the rights of the minority (on that issue) to be heard and have the opportunity to debate against the tyranny of majority who may attempt to force its will by quickly ending debate and further amendments on a contentious issue enough voting members may be swayed by debate or placated by amendments to change the outcome of the vote should debate be allowed to continue
it should be noted however that both houses of the united states congress and most legislative bodies throughout the world have their own unique codes of procedure that vary significantly from the two parliamentary authorities mentioned above and were written for use by ordinary societies (social groups small boards professional associations etc.)
instead of a motion for the previous question the united states senate uses a motion to limit debate called cloture this requires three-fifths of the total number of senators it does not immediately end debate on the pending question but rather imposes strict limitations on debate in the united states house every resolution comes to the floor under a special rule approved by the rules committee which defines the terms and limits of debate for that resolution
