lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption the resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called lava the molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets including earth and some of their satellites the source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy when first erupted from a volcanic vent lava is a liquid at temperatures from 700 to 1,200 c (1,292 to 2,192 f)
a lava flow is a moving outpouring of lava which is created during a non-explosive effusive eruption when it has stopped moving lava solidifies to form igneous rock the term lava flow is commonly shortened to lava although lava can be up to 100,000 times more viscous than water lava can flow great distances before cooling and solidifying because of its thixotropic and shear thinning properties
explosive eruptions produce a mixture of volcanic ash and other fragments called tephra rather than lava flows the word lava comes from italian and is probably derived from the latin word labes which means a fall or slide the first use in connection with extruded magma (molten rock below the earth's surface) was apparently in a short account written by francesco serao on the eruption of vesuvius between may 14 and june 4 1737 serao described a flow of fiery lava as an analogy to the flow of water and mud down the flanks of the volcano following heavy rain
== lava composition ==
the composition of almost all lava of the earth's crust is dominated by silicate minerals mostly feldspars olivine pyroxenes amphiboles micas and quartz
=== silicate lavas ===
igneous rocks which form lava flows when erupted can be classified into three chemical types felsic intermediate and mafic (four if one includes the super-heated ultramafic) these classes are primarily chemical however the chemistry of lava also tends to correlate with the magma temperature its viscosity and its mode of eruption
==== felsic lava ====
felsic or silicic lavas such as rhyolite and dacite typically form lava spines lava domes or coulees (which are thick short lava flows) and are associated with pyroclastic (fragmental) deposits most silicic lava flows are extremely viscous and typically fragment as they extrude producing blocky autobreccias the high viscosity and strength are the result of their chemistry which is high in silica aluminium potassium sodium and calcium forming a polymerized liquid rich in feldspar and quartz and thus has a higher viscosity than other magma types felsic magmas can erupt at temperatures as low as 650 to 750 c (1,202 to 1,382 f) unusually hot (>950 c >1,740 f) rhyolite lavas however may flow for distances of many tens of kilometres such as in the snake river plain of the northwestern united states
==== intermediate lava ====
intermediate or andesitic lavas are lower in aluminium and silica and usually somewhat richer in magnesium and iron intermediate lavas form andesite domes and block lavas and may occur on steep composite volcanoes such as in the andes poorer in aluminium and silica than felsic lavas and also commonly hotter (in the range of 750 to 950 c (1,380 to 1,740 f)) they tend to be less viscous greater temperatures tend to destroy polymerized bonds within the magma promoting more fluid behaviour and also a greater tendency to form phenocrysts higher iron and magnesium tends to manifest as a darker groundmass and also occasionally amphibole or pyroxene phenocrysts
==== mafic lava ====
mafic or basaltic lavas are typified by their high ferromagnesian content and generally erupt at temperatures in excess of 950 c (1,740 f) basaltic magma is high in iron and magnesium and has relatively lower aluminium and silica which taken together reduces the degree of polymerization within the melt owing to the higher temperatures viscosities can be relatively low although still thousands of times higher than water the low degree of polymerization and high temperature favors chemical diffusion so it is common to see large well-formed phenocrysts within mafic lavas basalt lavas tend to produce low-profile shield volcanoes or flood basalt fields because the fluidal lava flows for long distances from the vent the thickness of a basalt lava particularly on a low slope may be much greater than the thickness of the moving lava flow at any one time because basalt lavas may inflate by supply of lava beneath a solidified crust most basalt lavas are of a or phoehoe types rather than block lavas underwater they can form pillow lavas which are rather similar to entrail-type pahoehoe lavas on land
==== ultramafic lava ====
ultramafic lavas such as komatiite and highly magnesian magmas that form boninite take the composition and temperatures of eruptions to the extreme komatiites contain over 18% magnesium oxide and are thought to have erupted at temperatures of 1,600 c (2,910 f) at this temperature there is no polymerization of the mineral compounds creating a highly mobile liquid with viscosity as low as that of water most if not all ultramafic lavas are no younger than the proterozoic with a few ultramafic magmas known from the phanerozoic no modern komatiite lavas are known as the earth's mantle has cooled too much to produce highly magnesian magmas
=== unusual lavas ===
some lavas of unusual composition have erupted onto the surface of the earth these include
carbonatite and natrocarbonatite lavas are known from ol doinyo lengai volcano in tanzania which is the sole example of an active carbonatite volcano
iron oxide lavas are thought to be the source of the iron ore at kiruna sweden which formed during the proterozoic iron oxide lavas of pliocene age occur at the el laco volcanic complex on the chile-argentina border iron oxide lavas are thought to be the result of immisible separation of iron oxide magma from a parental magma of calc-alkaline or alkaline composition
sulfur lava flows up to 250 metres (820 feet) long and 10 metres (33 feet) wide occur at lastarria volcano chile they were formed by the melting of sulfur deposits at temperatures as low as 113 c (235 f)
olivine nephelinite lavas are thought to have come from much deeper in the mantle of the earth than other lavas
the term lava can also be used to refer to molten ice mixtures in eruptions on the icy satellites of the solar system's gas giants (see cryovolcanism)
== lava behavior ==
in general the composition of a lava determines its behavior more than the temperature of its eruption the viscosity of lava is important because it determines how the lava will behave lavas with high viscosity are rhyolite dacite andesite and trachyte with cooled basaltic lava also quite viscous those with low viscosities are freshly erupted basalt carbonatite and occasionally andesite
highly viscous lava shows the following behaviors
tends to flow slowly clog and form semi-solid blocks which resist flow
tends to entrap gas which form vesicles (bubbles) within the rock as they rise to the surface
correlates with explosive or phreatic eruptions and is associated with tuff and pyroclastic flows
highly viscous lavas do not usually flow as liquid and usually form explosive fragmental ash or tephra deposits however a degassed viscous lava or one which erupts somewhat hotter than usual may form a lava flow
lava with low viscosity shows the following behaviors
tends to flow easily forming puddles channels and rivers of molten rock
tends to easily release bubbling gases as they are formed
eruptions are rarely pyroclastic and are usually quiescent
volcanoes tend to form broad shields rather than steep cones
lavas also may contain many other components sometimes including solid crystals of various minerals fragments of exotic rocks known as xenoliths and fragments of previously solidified lava
== lava morphology ==
the physical behavior of lava creates the physical forms of a lava flow or volcano more fluid basaltic lava flows tend to form flat sheet-like bodies whereas viscous rhyolite lava flows forms knobbly blocky masses of rock
general features of volcanology can be used to classify volcanic edifices and provide information on the eruptions which formed the lava flow even if the sequence of lavas have been buried or metamorphosed
the ideal lava flow will have a brecciated top either as pillow lava development autobreccia and rubble typical of a and viscous flows or a vesicular or frothy carapace such as scoria or pumice the top of the lava will tend to be glassy having been flash frozen in contact with the air or water
the centre of a lava flow is commonly massive and crystalline flow banded or layered with microscopic groundmass crystals the more viscous lava forms tend to show sheeted flow features and blocks or breccia entrained within the sticky lava the crystal size at the centre of a lava will in general be greater than at the margins as the crystals have more time to grow
the base of a lava flow may show evidence of hydrothermal activity if the lava flowed across moist or wet substrates the lower part of the lava may have vesicles perhaps filled with minerals (amygdules) the substrate upon which the lava has flowed may show signs of scouring it may be broken or disturbed by the boiling of trapped water and in the case of soil profiles may be baked into a brick-red terracotta
discriminating between an intrusive sill and a lava flow in ancient rock sequences can be difficult however some sills do not usually have brecciated margins and may show a weak metamorphic aureole on both the upper and lower surface whereas a lava will only bake the substrate beneath it however it is often difficult in practice to identify these metamorphic phenomenon because they are usually weak and restricted in size peperitic sills intruded into wet sedimentary rocks commonly do not bake upper margins and have upper and lower autobreccias closely similar to lavas
=== a ===
a is one of three basic types of flow lava a is basaltic lava characterized by a rough or rubbly surface composed of broken lava blocks called clinker the hawaiian word was introduced as a technical term in geology by clarence dutton
the loose broken and sharp spiny surface of an a flow makes hiking difficult and slow the clinkery surface actually covers a massive dense core which is the most active part of the flow as pasty lava in the core travels downslope the clinkers are carried along at the surface at the leading edge of an a flow however these cooled fragments tumble down the steep front and are buried by the advancing flow this produces a layer of lava fragments both at the bottom and top of an a flow
accretionary lava balls as large as 3 metres (10 feet) are common on a flows a is usually of higher viscosity than phoehoe phoehoe can turn into a if it becomes turbulent from meeting impediments or steep slopes
the sharp angled texture makes a a strong radar reflector and can easily be seen from an orbiting satellite (bright on magellan pictures)
a lavas typically erupt at temperatures of 1,000 to 1,100 c (1,830 to 2,010 f)
the word is also spelled aa aa aa and a-aa and pronounced /./ or // it originates from hawaiian where it is pronounced [a] meaning stony rough lava but also to burn or blaze
=== phoehoe ===
phoehoe (/pho.iho.i/ from hawaiian [pahowehowe] meaning smooth unbroken lava") also spelled pahoehoe is basaltic lava that has a smooth billowy undulating or ropy surface these surface features are due to the movement of very fluid lava under a congealing surface crust the hawaiian word was introduced as a technical term in geology by clarence dutton
a phoehoe flow typically advances as a series of small lobes and toes that continually break out from a cooled crust it also forms lava tubes where the minimal heat loss maintains low viscosity the surface texture of phoehoe flows varies widely displaying all kinds of bizarre shapes often referred to as lava sculpture with increasing distance from the source phoehoe flows may change into a flows in response to heat loss and consequent increase in viscosity pahoehoe lavas typically have a temperature of 1,100 to 1,200 c (2,010 to 2,190 f)
most lava flows on the earth are less than 10 km (6.2 mi) long but some phoehoe flows are more than 50 km (31 mi) long
the rounded texture makes phoehoe a poor radar reflector and is difficult to see from an orbiting satellite (dark on magellan picture)
=== block lava flows ===
block lava flows are typical of andesitic lavas from stratovolcanoes they behave in a similar manner to a flows but their more viscous nature causes the surface to be covered in smooth-sided angular fragments (blocks) of solidified lava instead of clinkers like in a flows the molten interior of the flow which is kept insulated by the solidified blocky surface overrides the rubble that falls off the flow front they also move much more slowly downhill and are thicker in depth than a flows
=== domes and coules ===
lava domes and coules are associated with felsic lava flows ranging from dacite to rhyolite the very viscous nature of these lava cause them to not flow far from the vent causing the lava to form a lava dome at the vent when a dome forms on an inclined surface its can flow in short thick flows called coules (dome flow) these flows often only travel a few kilometers from the vent
=== pillow lava ===
pillow lava is the lava structure typically formed when lava emerges from an underwater volcanic vent or subglacial volcano or a lava flow enters the ocean however pillow lava can also form when lava is erupted beneath thick glacial ice the viscous lava gains a solid crust on contact with the water and this crust cracks and oozes additional large blobs or pillows as more lava emerges from the advancing flow since water covers the majority of earth's surface and most volcanoes are situated near or under bodies of water pillow lava is very common
== lava landforms ==
because it is formed from viscous molten rock lava flows and eruptions create distinctive formations landforms and topographical features from the macroscopic to the microscopic
=== volcanoes ===
volcanoes are the primary landforms built by repeated eruptions of lava and ash over time they range in shape from shield volcanoes with broad shallow slopes formed from predominantly effusive eruptions of relatively fluid basaltic lava flows to steeply-sided stratovolcanoes (also known as composite volcanoes) made of alternating layers of ash and more viscous lava flows typical of intermediate and felsic lavas
a caldera which is a large subsidence crater can form in a stratovolcano if the magma chamber is partially or wholly emptied by large explosive eruptions the summit cone no longer supports itself and thus collapses in on itself afterwards such features may include volcanic crater lakes and lava domes after the event however calderas can also form by non-explosive means such as gradual magma subsidence this is typical of many shield volcanoes
=== cinder and spatter cones ===
cinder cones and spatter cones are small-scale features formed by lava accumulation around a small vent on a volcanic edifice cinder cones are formed from tephra or ash and tuff which is thrown from an explosive vent spatter cones are formed by accumulation of molten volcanic slag and cinders ejected in a more liquid form
=== kpukas ===
another hawaiian english term derived from the hawaiian language a kpuka denotes an elevated area such as a hill ridge or old lava dome inside or downslope from an area of active volcanism new lava flows will cover the surrounding land isolating the kpuka so that it appears as a (usually) forested island in a barren lava flow
=== lava domes ===
lava domes are formed by the extrusion of viscous felsic magma they can form prominent rounded protuberances such as at valles caldera as a volcano extrudes silicic lava it can form an inflation dome gradually building up a large pillow-like structure which cracks fissures and may release cooled chunks of rock and rubble the top and side margins of an inflating lava dome tend to be covered in fragments of rock breccia and ash
examples of lava dome eruptions include the novarupta dome and successive lava domes of mount st helens
=== lava tubes ===
lava tubes are formed when a flow of relatively fluid lava cools on the upper surface sufficiently to form a crust beneath this crust which being made of rock is an excellent insulator the lava can continue to flow as a liquid when this flow occurs over a prolonged period of time the lava conduit can form a tunnel-like aperture or lava tube which can conduct molten rock many kilometres from the vent without cooling appreciably often these lava tubes drain out once the supply of fresh lava has stopped leaving a considerable length of open tunnel within the lava flow
lava tubes are known from the modern day eruptions of klauea and significant extensive and open lava tubes of tertiary age are known from north queensland australia some extending for 15 kilometres (9 miles)
=== lava fountains ===
a lava fountain is a volcanic phenomenon in which lava is forcefully but non-explosively ejected from a crater vent or fissure the highest lava fountains recorded were during the 1999 eruption of mount etna in italy which reached heights of 2,000 m (6,562 ft) however lava fountains observed during mount vesuvius 1779 eruption are believed to have reached at least 3,000 m (9,843 ft) lava fountains may occur as a series of short pulses or a continuous jet of lava they are commonly associated with hawaiian eruptions
=== lava lakes ===
rarely a volcanic cone may fill with lava but not erupt lava which pools within the caldera is known as a lava lake lava lakes do not usually persist for long either draining back into the magma chamber once pressure is relieved (usually by venting of gases through the caldera) or by draining via eruption of lava flows or pyroclastic explosion
there are only a few sites in the world where permanent lakes of lava exist these include
mount erebus antarctica
puu and halemaumau crater on kilauea volcano hawaii
erta ale ethiopia
nyiragongo democratic republic of congo
ambrym vanuatu
=== lava delta ===
lava deltas form wherever sub-aerial flows of lava enter standing bodies of water the lava cools and breaks up as it encounters the water with the resulting fragments filling in the seabed topography such that the sub-aerial flow can move further offshore lava deltas are generally associated with large-scale effusive type basaltic volcanism
== hazards ==
lava flows are enormously destructive to property in their path however casualties are rare since flows are usually slow enough for people and animals to escape though this is dependent on the viscosity of the lava nevertheless injuries and deaths have occurred either because they had their escape route cut off because they got too close to the flow or more rarely if the lava flow front travels too quickly this notably happened during the eruption of nyiragongo in zaire (now democratic republic of the congo) on the night of 10 january 1977 a crater wall was breached and a fluid lava lake drained out in under an hour the resulting flow sped down the steep slopes at up to 100 km/h (62 mph) and overwhelmed several villages while residents were asleep as a result of this disaster the mountain was designated a decade volcano in 1991
deaths attributed to volcanoes frequently have a different cause for example volcanic ejecta pyroclastic flow from a collapsing lava dome lahars poisonous gases that travel ahead of lava or explosions caused when the flow comes into contact with water a particularly dangerous area is called a lava bench this very young ground will typically break-off and fall into the sea
areas of recent lava flows continue to represent a hazard long after the lava has cooled where young flows have created new lands land is more unstable and can break-off into the sea flows often have deep cracks and any fall against fresh lava is similar to falling against broken glass rugged hiking boots long pants and gloves are recommended when crossing lava flows
