polyatomic ion also known molecular ion charged chemical species ion composed two atoms covalently bonded metal complex considered acting single unit prefix poly means many greek even ions two atoms commonly referred polyatomic older literature polyatomic ion also referred radical less commonly radical group contemporary usage term radical refers free radicals necessarily charged species unpaired electron
example polyatomic ion hydroxide ion consisting one oxygen atom one hydrogen atom hydroxide charge chemical formula oh ammonium ion made one nitrogen atom four hydrogen atoms charge chemical formula nh
polyatomic ions often useful context acidbase chemistry formation salts polyatomic ion often considered conjugate acidbase neutral molecule example conjugate base sulfuric acid hso polyatomic hydrogen sulfate anion hso removal another hydrogen ion yields sulfate anion
nomenclature polyatomic anionsedit
two rules used learning nomenclature polyatomic anions first prefix bi added name hydrogen added ions formula charge increased latter consequence hydrogen ions charge alternative bi prefix use word hydrogen place anion derived h co
hco
called either bicarbonate hydrogen carbonate
note many common polyatomic anions conjugate bases acids derived oxides nonmetallic elements example sulfate anion derived h
regarded
h
o
second rule looks number oxygens ion consider chlorine oxoanion family
first think ate ion base name case addition per prefix adds oxygen changing ate suffix ite reduce oxygens one keeping suffix ite adding prefix hypo reduces number oxygens one situations charge affected naming pattern follows within many different oxyanion series based standard root particular series ite one less oxygen ate different ate anions might different numbers oxygen atoms
rules work polyatomic anions work common ones sulfate phosphate nitrate chlorate
