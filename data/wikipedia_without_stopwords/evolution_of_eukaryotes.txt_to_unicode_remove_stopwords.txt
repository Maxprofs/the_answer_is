cell featuresedit
eukaryotic cells typically much larger prokaryotes variety internal membranebound structures called organelles cytoskeleton composed microtubules microfilaments intermediate filaments play important role defining cells organization shape eukaryotic dna divided several linear bundles called chromosomes separated microtubular spindle nuclear division
internal membraneedit
eukaryote cells include variety membranebound structures collectively referred endomembrane system simple compartments called vesicles vacuoles form budding membranes many cells ingest food materials process endocytosis outer membrane invaginates pinches form vesicle probable membranebound organelles ultimately derived vesicles
nucleus surrounded double membrane commonly referred nuclear envelope pores allow material move various tube sheetlike extensions nuclear membrane form called endoplasmic reticulum er involved protein transport maturation includes rough er ribosomes attached synthesize proteins enter interior space lumen subsequently generally enter vesicles bud smooth er eukaryotes proteincarrying vesicles released modified stacks flattened vesicles called golgi bodies dictyosomes
vesicles may specialized various purposes instance lysosomes contain enzymes break contents food vacuoles peroxisomes used break peroxide toxic otherwise many protozoa contractile vacuoles collect expel excess water extrusomes expel material used deflect predators capture prey higher plants cells volume taken central vacuole primarily maintains osmotic pressure
mitochondria plastidsedit
mitochondria organelles found nearly eukaryotesthey powerbank powerhouse cell provide energy cell form atp surrounded two membranes phospholipid bilayer inner folded invaginations called cristae aerobic respiration takes place mitochondria contain dna generally held developed endosymbiotic prokaryotes probably proteobacteria protozoa lack mitochondria found contain mitochondrionderived organelles hydrogenosomes mitosomes thus probably lost mitochondria secondarily
plants various groups algae also plastids plastids dna developed endosymbionts case cyanobacteria usually take form chloroplasts like cyanobacteria contain chlorophyll produce organic compounds glucose photosynthesis others involved storing food although plastids probably single origin plastidcontaining groups closely related instead eukaryotes obtained others secondary endosymbiosis ingestion
endosymbiotic origins also proposed nucleus see eukaryotic flagella supposed developed spirochaetes generally accepted lack cytological evidence difficulty reconciling cellular reproduction
cytoskeletal structuresedit
many eukaryotes long slender motile cytoplasmic projections called flagella similar structures called cilia flagella cilia sometimes referred undulipodia variously involved movement feeding sensation composed mainly tubulin entirely distinct prokaryotic flagellae supported bundle microtubules arising basal body also called kinetosome centriole characteristically arranged nine doublets surrounding two singlets flagella also may hairs mastigonemes scales connecting membranes internal rods interior continuous cells cytoplasm
microfilamental structures composed actin actin binding proteins eg actinin fimbrin filamin present submembraneous cortical layers bundles well motor proteins microtubules eg dynein kinesin actin eg myosins provide dynamic character network
centrioles often present even cells groups flagella conifers flowering plants neither generally occur groups one two called kinetids give rise various microtubular roots form primary component cytoskeletal structure often assembled course several cell divisions one flagellum retained parent derived centrioles may also associated formation spindle nuclear division
significance cytoskeletal structures underlined determination shape cells well essential components migratory responses like chemotaxis chemokinesis protists various microtubulesupported organelles include radiolaria heliozoa produce axopodia used flotation capture prey haptophytes peculiar flagellumlike organelle called haptonema
cell walledit
cells plants fungi chromalveolates cell wall layer outside cell membrane providing cell structural support protection filtering mechanism cell wall also prevents overexpansion water enters cell
major polysaccharides making primary cell wall land plants cellulose hemicellulose pectin cellulose microfibrils linked via hemicellulosic tethers form cellulosehemicellulose network embedded pectin matrix common hemicellulose primary cell wall xyloglucan
differences among eukaryotic cellsedit
many different types eukaryotic cells though animals plants familiar eukaryotes thus provide excellent starting point understanding eukaryotic structure fungi many protists substantial differences however
animal celledit
animal cell form eukaryotic cell makes many tissues animals animal cells distinct eukaryotes notably plant cells lack cell walls chloroplasts also smaller vacuoles due lack cell wall animal cells adopt variety shapes phagocytic cell even engulf structures
many different types cell instance approximately distinct cell types adult human body
plant celledit
plant cells quite different cells eukaryotic organisms distinctive features
large central vacuole enclosed membrane tonoplast maintains cells turgor controls movement molecules cytosol sap
primary cell wall containing cellulose hemicellulose pectin deposited protoplast outside cell membrane contrasts cell walls fungi contain chitin cell envelopes prokaryotes peptidoglycans main structural molecules
plasmodesmata linking pores cell wall allow plant cell communicate adjacent cells different functionally analogous system gap junctions animal cells

reproductionedit
cell division generally takes place asexually mitosis process allows daughter nucleus receive one copy chromosome eukaryotes also process sexual reproduction typically involving alternation haploid generations wherein one copy chromosome present diploid generations wherein two copies chromosome present occurring meiosis considerable variation pattern
eukaryotes smaller surface area volume ratio prokaryotes thus lower metabolic rates longer generation times multicellular organisms cells specialized metabolism enlarged surface areas intestinal vili
evolution sexual reproduction may primordial fundamental characteristic eukaryotes based phylogenetic analysis dacks roger proposed facultative sex present common ancestor eukaryotes core set genes function meiosis present trichomonas vaginalis giardia intestinalis two organisms previously thought asexual since two species descendants lineages diverged early eukaryotic evolutionary tree inferred core meiotic genes hence sex likely present common ancestor eukaryotes studies eukaryotic species thought asexual revealed evidence sexual cycle instance parasitic protozoa genus leishmania recently shown sexual cycle also evidence indicates amoeba previously regarded asexual anciently sexual majority presentday asexual groups likely arose recently independently
classificationedit
antiquity two clades animals plants recognized given taxonomic rank kingdom linnaeus though included fungi plants reservations later realized quite distinct warrant separate kingdom composition entirely clear various singlecell eukaryotes originally placed plants animals became known german biologist georg goldfuss coined word protozoa refer organisms ciliates group expanded encompassed singlecelled eukaryotes given kingdom protista ernst haeckel eukaryotes thus came composed four kingdoms
kingdom protista
kingdom plantae
kingdom fungi
kingdom animalia
protists understood primitive forms thus evolutionary grade united primitive unicellular nature disentanglement deep splits tree life really got going dna sequencing leading system domains rather kingdoms top level rank put forward carl woese uniting eukaryote kingdoms eukaryote domain time work protist tree intensified still actively going today several alternative classifications forwarded though consensus field
classification produced international society protistologists reflected consensus time divided eukaryotes six supposedly monophyletic supergroups however year doubts expressed whether supergroups monophyletic particularly chromalveolata review noted lack evidence several supposed six supergroups revised classification recognizes five supergroups
also smaller groups eukaryotes whose position uncertain seems fall outside major groups particular haptophyta cryptophyta centrohelida telonemia picozoa apusomonadida ancyromonadida breviatea genus collodictyon overall seems although progress made still significant uncertainties evolutionary history classification eukaryotes roger simpson said current pace change understanding eukaryote tree life proceed caution

relationship archaeaedit
eukaryotes closely related archaea bacteria least terms nuclear dna genetic machinery one controversial idea place archaea clade neomura however respects membrane composition eukaryotes similar bacteria three main explanations proposed
eukaryotes resulted complete fusion two cells wherein cytoplasm formed eubacterium nucleus archaeon virus precell
eukaryotes developed archaea acquired eubacterial characteristics protomitochondrion
eukaryotes archaea developed separately modified eubacterium
chronocyte hypothesis origin eukaryotic cell postulates primitive eukaryotic cell formed endosymbiosis archaea bacteria third type cell termed chronocyte
endomembrane system mitochondriaedit
origins endomembrane system mitochondria also unclear phagotrophic hypothesis proposes eukaryotictype membranes lacking cell wall originated first development endocytosis whereas mitochondria acquired ingestion endosymbionts syntrophic hypothesis proposes protoeukaryote relied protomitochondrion food ultimately grew surround membranes originated engulfment mitochondrion part thanks mitochondrial genes hydrogen hypothesis one particular version

hypotheses origin eukaryotesedit
different hypotheses proposed eukaryotic cells came existence hypotheses classified two distinct classes autogenous models chimeric models
autogenous modelsedit
autogenous models propose protoeukaryotic cell containing nucleus existed first later acquired mitochondria according model large prokaryote developed invaginations plasma membrane order obtain enough surface area service cytoplasmic volume invaginations differentiated function became separate compartmentsgiving rise endomembrane system including endoplasmic reticulum golgi apparatus nuclear membrane single membrane structures lysosomes mitochondria proposed come endosymbiosis aerobic proteobacterium assumed eukaryotic lineages acquire mitochondria went extinct chloroplasts came another endosymbiotic event involving cyanobacteria since eukaryotes mitochondria chloroplasts mitochondria thought come first serial endosymbiosis theory
models propose origins double layered organelles mitochondria chloroplasts protoeukaryotic cell due compartmentalization dna vesicles formed secondary invaginations detailed infoldings cellular membrane
chimeric modelsedit
chimeric models claim two prokaryotic cells existed initially archaeon bacterium cells underwent merging process either physical fusion endosymbiosis thereby leading formation eukaryotic cell within chimeric models studies claim mitochondria originated bacterial ancestor others emphasize role endosymbiotic processes behind origin mitochondria
based process mutualistic symbiosis hypotheses categorized serial endosymbiotic theory set hydrogen hypothesis mostly process symbiosis hydrogen transfer takes place among different species syntrophy hypothesis
according serial endosymbiotic theory championed dr lynn margulis union motile anaerobic bacterium like spirochaeta thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon like thermoplasma sulfidogenic nature gave rise present day eukaryotes union established motile organism capable living already existing acidic sulfurous waters oxygen known cause toxicity organisms lack required metabolic machinery thus archaeon provided bacterium highly beneficial reduced environment sulfur sulfate reduced sulfide microaerophilic conditions oxygen reduced water thereby creating mutual benefit platform bacterium hand contributed necessary fermentation products electron acceptors along motility feature archaeon thereby gaining swimming motility organism consortium bacterial archaeal dna originated nuclear genome eukaryotic cells spirochetes gave rise motile features eukaryotic cells endosymbiotic unifications ancestors alphaproteobacteria cyanobacteria led origin mitochondria plastids respectively example thiodendron known originated via ectosymbiotic process based similar syntrophy sulfur existing two types bacteria desulphobacter spirochaeta however association based motile symbiosis never observed practically also evidence archaeans spirochetes adapting intense acidbased environments
hydrogen hypothesis symbiotic linkage anaerobic autotrophic methanogenic archaeon host alphaproteobacterium symbiont gave rise eukaryotes host utilized hydrogen h carbon dioxide co produce methane symbiont capable aerobic respiration expelled h co byproducts anaerobic fermentation process hosts methanogenic environment worked sink h resulted heightened bacterial fermentation endosymbiotic gene transfer egt acted catalyst host acquire symbionts carbohydrate metabolism turn heterotrophic nature subsequently hosts methane forming capability lost thus origins heterotrophic organelle symbiont identical origins eukaryotic lineage hypothesis presence h represents selective force forged eukaryotes prokaryotes
syntrophy hypothesis developed contrast hydrogen hypothesis proposes existence two symbiotic events according theory eukaryogenesis ie origin eukaryotic cells occurred based metabolic symbiosis syntrophy methanogenic archaeon deltaproteobacterium syntrophic symbiosis initially facilitated h transfer different species anaerobic environments earlier stages alphaproteobacterium became member integration later developed mitochondrion gene transfer deltaproteobacterium archaeon led methanogenic archaeon developing nucleus archaeon constituted genetic apparatus deltaproteobacterium contributed towards cytoplasmic features theory incorporates two selective forces needed considered time nucleus evolution presence metabolic partitioning order avoid harmful effects coexistence anabolic catabolic cellular pathways b prevention abnormal biosynthesis proteins occur due vast spread introns archaeal genes acquiring mitochondrion loss methanogenesis
thus origin eukaryotes endosymbiotic processes broadly recognized accepted far mitochondria plastids known originate bacterial ancestor parallel adaptation anaerobiosis however still remains greater need assessing question much eukaryotic complexity originated via implementation symbiogenetic theories
