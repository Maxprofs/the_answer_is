plant pathology (also phytopathology) is the scientific study of diseases in plants caused by pathogens (infectious organisms) and environmental conditions (physiological factors) organisms that cause infectious disease include fungi oomycetes bacteria viruses viroids virus-like organisms phytoplasmas protozoa nematodes and parasitic plants not included are ectoparasites like insects mites vertebrate or other pests that affect plant health by consumption of plant tissues plant pathology also involves the study of pathogen identification disease etiology disease cycles economic impact plant disease epidemiology plant disease resistance how plant diseases affect humans and animals pathosystem genetics and management of plant diseases
== overview ==
control of plant diseases is crucial to the reliable production of food and it provides significant reductions in agricultural use of land water fuel and other inputs plants in both natural and cultivated populations carry inherent disease resistance but there are numerous examples of devastating plant disease impacts (see irish potato famine chestnut blight) as well as recurrent severe plant diseases (see rice blast soybean cyst nematode citrus canker) however disease control is reasonably successful for most crops disease control is achieved by use of plants that have been bred for good resistance to many diseases and by plant cultivation approaches such as crop rotation use of pathogen-free seed appropriate planting date and plant density control of field moisture and pesticide use across large regions and many crop species it is estimated that diseases typically reduce plant yields by 10% every year in more developed settings but yield loss to diseases often exceeds 20% in less developed settings continuing advances in the science of plant pathology are needed to improve disease control and to keep up with changes in disease pressure caused by the ongoing evolution and movement of plant pathogens and by changes in agricultural practices plant diseases cause major economic losses for farmers worldwide the food and agriculture organization estimates indeed that pests and diseases are responsible for about 25% of crop loss to solve this issue new methods are needed to detect diseases and pests early such as novel sensors that detect plant odours and spectroscopy and biophotonics that are able to diagnostic plant health and metabolism
== plant pathogens ==
=== fungi ===
the majority of phytopathogenic fungi belong to the ascomycetes and the basidiomycetes
the fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually via the production of spores and other structures spores may be spread long distances by air or water or they may be soil borne many soil inhabiting fungi are capable of living saprotrophically carrying out the part of their life cycle in the soil these are known as facultative saprotrophs
fungal diseases may be controlled through the use of fungicides and other agriculture practices however new races of fungi often evolve that are resistant to various fungicides
biotrophic fungal pathogens colonize living plant tissue and obtain nutrients from living host cells necrotrophic fungal pathogens infect and kill host tissue and extract nutrients from the dead host cells see powdery mildew and rice blast images below
significant fungal plant pathogens include:
==== ascomycetes ====
fusarium spp (causal agents of fusarium wilt disease)
thielaviopsis spp (causal agents of: canker rot black root rot thielaviopsis root rot)
verticillium spp
magnaporthe grisea (causal agent of rice blast)
sclerotinia sclerotiorum (causal agent of cottony rot)
==== basidiomycetes ====
ustilago spp (causal agents of smut)
rhizoctonia spp
phakospora pachyrhizi (causal agent of soybean rust)
puccinia spp (causal agents of severe rusts of virtually all cereal grains and cultivated grasses)
armillaria spp (the so-called honey fungus species which are virulent pathogens of trees and produce edible mushrooms)
=== fungus-like organisms ===
==== oomycetes ====
the oomycetes are not true fungi but are fungus-like organisms they include some of the most destructive plant pathogens including the genus phytophthora which includes the causal agents of potato late blight and sudden oak death particular species of oomycetes are responsible for root rot
despite not being closely related to the fungi the oomycetes have developed very similar infection strategies oomycetes are capable of using effector proteins to turn off a plant's defenses in its infection process plant pathologists commonly group them with fungal pathogens
significant oomycete plant pathogens
pythium spp
phytophthora spp. including the causal agent of the great irish famine (18451849)
==== phytomyxea ====
some slime molds in phytomyxea cause important diseases includind club root in cabbage and its relatives and powdery scab in potatoes these are caused by species of plasmodiophora and spongospora respectively
=== bacteria ===
most bacteria that are associated with plants are actually saprotrophic and do no harm to the plant itself however a small number around 100 known species are able to cause disease bacterial diseases are much more prevalent in sub-tropical and tropical regions of the world
most plant pathogenic bacteria are rod-shaped (bacilli) in order to be able to colonize the plant they have specific pathogenicity factors five main types of bacterial pathogenicity factors are known: uses of cell wall-degrading enzymes toxins effector proteins phytohormones and exopolysaccharides
pathogens such as erwinia use cell wall-degrading enzymes to cause soft rot agrobacterium changes the level of auxins to cause tumours with phytohormones exopolysaccharides are produced by bacteria and block xylem vessels often leading to the death of the plant
bacteria control the production of pathogenicity factors via quorum sensing
significant bacterial plant pathogens:
burkholderia
proteobacteria
xanthomonas spp
pseudomonas spp
pseudomonas syringae pv tomato causes tomato plants to produce less fruit and it "continues to adapt to the tomato by minimizing its recognition by the tomato immune system."
==== phytoplasmas ('mycoplasma-like organisms') and spiroplasmas ====
phytoplasma and spiroplasma are a genre of bacteria that lack cell walls and are related to the mycoplasmas which are human pathogens together they are referred to as the mollicutes they also tend to have smaller genomes than most other bacteria they are normally transmitted by sap-sucking insects being transferred into the plants phloem where it reproduces
=== viruses viroids and virus-like organisms ===
there are many types of plant virus and some are even asymptomatic under normal circumstances plant viruses cause only a loss of crop yield therefore it is not economically viable to try to control them the exception being when they infect perennial species such as fruit trees
most plant viruses have small single-stranded rna genomes however some plant viruses also have double stranded rna or single or double stranded dna genomes these genomes may encode only three or four proteins: a replicase a coat protein a movement protein in order to allow cell to cell movement through plasmodesmata and sometimes a protein that allows transmission by a vector plant viruses can have several more proteins and employ many different molecular translation methods
plant viruses are generally transmitted from plant to plant by a vector but mechanical and seed transmission also occur vector transmission is often by an insect (for example aphids) but some fungi nematodes and protozoa have been shown to be viral vectors in many cases the insect and virus are specific for virus transmission such as the beet leafhopper that transmits the curly top virus causing disease in several crop plants
=== nematodes ===
nematodes are small multicellular wormlike animals many live freely in the soil but there are some species that parasitize plant roots they are a problem in tropical and subtropical regions of the world where they may infect crops potato cyst nematodes (globodera pallida and g rostochiensis) are widely distributed in europe and north and south america and cause $300 million worth of damage in europe every year root knot nematodes have quite a large host range whereas cyst nematodes tend to be able to infect only a few species nematodes are able to cause radical changes in root cells in order to facilitate their lifestyle
=== protozoa and algae ===
there are a few examples of plant diseases caused by protozoa (e.g. phytomonas a kinetoplastid) they are transmitted as zoospores that are very durable and may be able to survive in a resting state in the soil for many years they have also been shown to transmit plant viruses
when the motile zoospores come into contact with a root hair they produce a plasmodium and invade the roots
some colourless parasitic algae (e.g. cephaleuros) also cause plant diseases
=== parasitic plants ===
parasitic plants such as mistletoe and dodder are included in the study of phytopathology dodder for example is used as a conduit either for the transmission of viruses or virus-like agents from a host plant to a plant that is not typically a host or for an agent that is not graft-transmissible
== common pathogenic infection methods ==
cell wall-degrading enzymes: these are used to break down the plant cell wall in order to release the nutrients inside
toxins: these can be non-host-specific which damage all plants or host-specific which cause damage only on a host plant
effector proteins: these can be secreted into the extracellular environment or directly into the host cell often via the type three secretion system some effectors are known to suppress host defense processes this can include: reducing the plants internal signaling mechanisms or reduction of phytochemicals production bacteria fungus and oomycetes are known for this function
== physiological plant disorders ==
significant abiotic disorders can be caused by:
natural
drought
frost damage and breakage by snow and hail
flooding and poor drainage
nutrient deficiency
salt deposition and other soluble mineral excesses (e.g. gypsum)
wind (windburn and breakage by hurricanes and tornadoes)
lightning and wildfire (also often man-made)
man-made (arguably not abiotic but usually regarded as such)
soil compaction
pollution of air soil or both
salt from winter road salt application or irrigation
herbicide over-application
poor education and training of people working with plants (e.g lawnmower damage to trees)
vandalism
== epidemiology ==
== disease resistance ==
== management ==
quarantine
wherein a diseased patch of vegetation or individual plants are isolated from other healthy growth specimens may be destroyed or relocated into a greenhouse for treatment/study another option is to avoid introduction of harmful non-native organisms by controlling all human traffic and activity (e.g. aqis) although legislation and enforcement are key in order to ensure lasting effectiveness
cultural
farming in some societies is kept on a small scale tended by peoples whose culture includes farming traditions going back to ancient times (an example of such traditions would be lifelong training in techniques of plot terracing weather anticipation and response fertilization grafting seed care and dedicated gardening.) plants that are intently monitored often benefit from not only active external protection but also a greater overall vigor while primitive in the sense of being the most labor-intensive solution by far where practical or necessary it is more than adequate
plant resistance
sophisticated agricultural developments now allow growers to choose from among systematically cross-bred species to ensure the greatest hardiness in their crops as suited for a particular region's pathological profile breeding practices have been perfected over centuries but with the advent of genetic manipulation even finer control of a crop's immunity traits is possible the engineering of foodplants may be less rewarding however as higher output is frequently offset by popular suspicion and negative opinion about this "tampering" with nature
chemical
(see: pesticide application) many natural and synthetic compounds that could be employed to combat the above threats exist this method works by directly eliminating disease-causing organisms or curbing their spread; however it has been shown to have too broad an effect typically to be good for the local ecosystem from an economic standpoint all but the simplest natural additives may disqualify a product from "organic" status potentially reducing the value of the yield
biological
crop rotation may be an effective means to prevent a parasitic population from becoming well-established as an organism affecting leaves would be starved when the leafy crop is replaced by a tuberous type etc other means to undermine parasites without attacking them directly may exist
integrated
the use of two or more of these methods in combination offers a higher chance of effectiveness
