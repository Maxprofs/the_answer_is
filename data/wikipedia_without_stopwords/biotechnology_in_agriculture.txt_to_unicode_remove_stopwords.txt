history
although normally first comes mind many forms humanderived agriculture clearly fit broad definition utilizing biotechnological system make products indeed cultivation plants may viewed earliest biotechnological enterprise
agriculture theorized become dominant way producing food since neolithic revolution early biotechnology earliest farmers selected bred best suited crops highest yields produce enough food support growing population crops fields became increasingly large difficult maintain discovered specific organisms byproducts could effectively fertilize restore nitrogen control pests throughout history agriculture farmers inadvertently altered genetics crops introducing new environments breeding plants one first forms biotechnology
processes also included early fermentation beer processes introduced early mesopotamia egypt china india still use basic biological methods brewing malted grains containing enzymes convert starch grains sugar adding specific yeasts produce beer process carbohydrates grains broken alcohols ethanol later cultures produced process lactic acid fermentation allowed fermentation preservation forms food soy sauce fermentation also used time period produce leavened bread although process fermentation fully understood louis pasteurs work still first use biotechnology convert food source another form
time charles darwins work life animal plant scientists already used selective breeding darwin added body work scientific observations ability science change species accounts contributed darwins theory natural selection
thousands years humans used selective breeding improve production crops livestock use food selective breeding organisms desirable characteristics mated produce offspring characteristics example technique used corn produce largest sweetest crops
early twentieth century scientists gained greater understanding microbiology explored ways manufacturing specific products chaim weizmann first used pure microbiological culture industrial process manufacturing corn starch using clostridium acetobutylicum produce acetone united kingdom desperately needed manufacture explosives world war
biotechnology also led development antibiotics alexander fleming discovered mold penicillium work led purification antibiotic compound formed mold howard florey ernst boris chain norman heatley form today know penicillin penicillin became available medicinal use treat bacterial infections humans

examples
biotechnology applications four major industrial areas including health care medical crop production agriculture non food industrial uses crops products eg biodegradable plastics vegetable oil biofuels environmental uses
example one application biotechnology directed use organisms manufacture organic products examples include beer milk products another example using naturally present bacteria mining industry bioleaching biotechnology also used recycle treat waste clean sites contaminated industrial activities bioremediation also produce biological weapons
series derived terms coined identify several branches biotechnology example
bioinformatics interdisciplinary field addresses biological problems using computational techniques makes rapid organization well analysis biological data possible field may also referred computational biology defined conceptualizing biology terms molecules applying informatics techniques understand organize information associated molecules large scale bioinformatics plays key role various areas functional genomics structural genomics proteomics forms key component biotechnology pharmaceutical sector
blue biotechnology term used describe marine aquatic applications biotechnology use relatively rare
green biotechnology biotechnology applied agricultural processes example would selection domestication plants via micropropagation another example designing transgenic plants grow specific environments presence absence chemicals one hope green biotechnology might produce environmentally friendly solutions traditional industrial agriculture example engineering plant express pesticide thereby ending need external application pesticides example would bt corn whether green biotechnology products ultimately environmentally friendly topic considerable debate

medicine
medicine modern biotechnology finds applications areas pharmaceutical drug discovery production pharmacogenomics genetic testing genetic screening
pharmacogenomics combination pharmacology genomics technology analyses genetic makeup affects individuals response drugs deals influence genetic variation drug response patients correlating gene expression singlenucleotide polymorphisms drugs efficacy toxicity pharmacogenomics aims develop rational means optimize drug therapy respect patients genotype ensure maximum efficacy minimal adverse effects approaches promise advent personalized medicine drugs drug combinations optimized individuals unique genetic makeup
biotechnology contributed discovery manufacturing traditional small molecule pharmaceutical drugs well drugs product biotechnology biopharmaceutics modern biotechnology used manufacture existing medicines relatively easily cheaply first genetically engineered products medicines designed treat human diseases cite one example genentech developed synthetic humanized insulin joining gene plasmid vector inserted bacterium escherichia coli insulin widely used treatment diabetes previously extracted pancreas abattoir animals cattle andor pigs resulting genetically engineered bacterium enabled production vast quantities synthetic human insulin relatively low cost biotechnology also enabled emerging therapeutics like gene therapy application biotechnology basic science example human genome project also dramatically improved understanding biology scientific knowledge normal disease biology increased ability develop new medicines treat previously untreatable diseases increased well
genetic testing allows genetic diagnosis vulnerabilities inherited diseases also used determine childs parentage genetic mother father general persons ancestry addition studying chromosomes level individual genes genetic testing broader sense includes biochemical tests possible presence genetic diseases mutant forms genes associated increased risk developing genetic disorders genetic testing identifies changes chromosomes genes proteins time testing used find changes associated inherited disorders results genetic test confirm rule suspected genetic condition help determine persons chance developing passing genetic disorder several hundred genetic tests use since genetic testing may open ethical psychological problems genetic testing often accompanied genetic counseling
agriculture
genetically modified crops gm crops biotech crops plants used agriculture dna modified genetic engineering techniques cases aim introduce new trait plant occur naturally species
examples food crops include resistance certain pests diseases stressful environmental conditions resistance chemical treatments eg resistance herbicide reduction spoilage improving nutrient profile crop examples nonfood crops include production pharmaceutical agents biofuels industrially useful goods well bioremediation
farmers widely adopted gm technology total surface area land cultivated gm crops increased factor square kilometers acres km million acres worlds crop lands planted gm crops different transgenic crops grown commercially million acres million hectares countries usa brazil argentina india canada china paraguay pakistan south africa uruguay bolivia australia philippines myanmar burkina faso mexico spain
genetically modified foods foods produced organisms specific changes introduced dna methods genetic engineering techniques allowed introduction new crop traits well far greater control foods genetic structure previously afforded methods selective breeding mutation breeding commercial sale genetically modified foods began calgene first marketed flavr savr delayed ripening tomato date genetic modification foods primarily focused cash crops high demand farmers soybean corn canola cotton seed oil engineered resistance pathogens herbicides better nutrient profiles gm livestock also experimentally developed although november none currently market
broad scientific consensus food market derived gm crops poses greater risk human health conventional food gm crops also provide number ecological benefits used excess however opponents objected gm crops per se several grounds including environmental concerns whether food produced gm crops safe whether gm crops needed address worlds food needs economic concerns raised fact organisms subject intellectual property law
