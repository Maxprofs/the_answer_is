the caribbean (/krbin/ or /krbin/ spanish caribe dutch caraben  caribbean hindustani (kairibiyana) french carabe or more commonly antilles) is a region that consists of the caribbean sea its islands (some surrounded by the caribbean sea and some bordering both the caribbean sea and the north atlantic ocean) and the surrounding coasts the region is southeast of the gulf of mexico and the north american mainland east of central america and north of south america
situated largely on the caribbean plate the region comprises more than 700 islands islets reefs and cays (see the list.) these islands generally form island arcs that delineate the eastern and northern edges of the caribbean sea the caribbean islands consisting of the greater antilles on the north and the lesser antilles on the south and east (including the leeward antilles) are part of the somewhat larger west indies grouping which also includes the lucayan archipelago (comprising the bahamas and turks and caicos islands) north of the greater antilles and caribbean sea in a wider sense the mainland countries of belize venezuela guyana suriname and french guiana are also included
geopolitically the caribbean islands are usually regarded as a subregion of north america and are organized into 30 territories including sovereign states overseas departments and dependencies from december 15 1954 to october 10 2010 there was a country known as the netherlands antilles composed of five states all of which were dutch dependencies while from january 3 1958 to may 31 1962 there was also a short-lived country called the federation of the west indies composed of ten english-speaking caribbean territories all of which were then british dependencies the west indies cricket team continues to represent many of those nations
== etymology and pronunciationedit ==
the region takes its name from that of the caribs an ethnic group present in the lesser antilles and parts of adjacent south america at the time of the spanish conquest
the two most prevalent pronunciations of caribbean are karr--bee-n with the primary accent on the third syllable and k-rib-ee-n with the accent on the second the former pronunciation is the older of the two although the stressed-second-syllable variant has been established for over 75 years it has been suggested that speakers of british english prefer karr--bee-n while north american speakers more typically use k-rib-ee-n although not all sources agree usage is split within caribbean english itself
== definitionedit ==
the word caribbean has multiple uses its principal ones are geographical and political the caribbean can also be expanded to include territories with strong cultural and historical connections to slavery european colonisation and the plantation system
the united nations geoscheme for the americas accords the caribbean as a distinct region within the americas
physiographically the caribbean region is mainly a chain of islands surrounding the caribbean sea to the north the region is bordered by the gulf of mexico the straits of florida and the northern atlantic ocean which lies to the east and northeast to the south lies the coastline of the continent of south america
politically the caribbean may be centred on socio-economic groupings found in the region for example the bloc known as the caribbean community (caricom) contains the co-operative republic of guyana the republic of suriname in south america and belize in central america as full members bermuda and the turks and caicos islands which are in the atlantic ocean are associate members of the caribbean community the commonwealth of the bahamas is also in the atlantic and is a full member of the caribbean community
alternatively the organisation called the association of caribbean states (acs) consists of almost every nation in the surrounding regions that lie on the caribbean plus el salvador which lies solely on the pacific ocean according to the acs the total population of its member states is 227 million people
== geography and geologyedit ==
the geography and climate in the caribbean region varies some islands in the region have relatively flat terrain of non-volcanic origin these islands include aruba (possessing only minor volcanic features) barbados bonaire the cayman islands saint croix the bahamas and antigua others possess rugged towering mountain-ranges like the islands of cuba hispaniola puerto rico jamaica dominica montserrat saba saint kitts saint lucia saint thomas saint john tortola grenada saint vincent guadeloupe martinique and trinidad & tobago
definitions of the terms greater antilles and lesser antilles often vary the virgin islands as part of the puerto rican bank are sometimes included with the greater antilles the term lesser antilles is often used to define an island arc that includes grenada but excludes trinidad and tobago and the leeward antilles
the waters of the caribbean sea host large migratory schools of fish turtles and coral reef formations the puerto rico trench located on the fringe of the atlantic ocean and caribbean sea just to the north of the island of puerto rico is the deepest point in all of the atlantic ocean
the region sits in the line of several major shipping routes with the panama canal connecting the western caribbean sea with the pacific ocean
=== climateedit ===
the climate of the area is tropical to subtropical in cuba the bahamas and puerto rico rainfall varies with elevation size and water currents (cool upwellings keep the abc islands arid) warm moist tradewinds blow consistently from the east creating rainforest/semidesert divisions on mountainous islands occasional northwesterlies affect the northern islands in the winter the region enjoys year-round sunshine divided into dry and wet seasons with the last six months of the year being wetter than the first half
hurricane season is from june to november but they occur more frequently in august and september and more common in the northern islands of the caribbean.hurricanes that sometimes batter the region usually strike northwards of grenada and to the west of barbados the principal hurricane belt arcs to northwest of the island of barbados in the eastern caribbean
water temperatures vary from 31c(88f) to 22c (72f) all around the year the air temperature is warm in the 20's and 30's celsius (70's,80's and 90'sf) during the year only varies from winter to summer about 2-5 degrees on the southern islands and about 10-20 degrees difference can occur in the northern islands of the caribbean the northern islands like bahamas,cuba puerto rico and the dominican republic) during winters months may be influenced by continental masses such as cold fronts

== biodiversityedit ==
the caribbean islands are remarkable for the diversity of their animals fungi and plants and have been classified as one of conservation international's biodiversity hotspots because of their exceptionally diverse terrestrial and marine ecosystems ranging from montane cloud forests to cactus scrublands the region also contains about 8% (by surface area) of the world's coral reefs along with extensive seagrass meadows both of which are frequently found in the shallow marine waters bordering island and continental coasts off the region
for the fungi there is a modern checklist based on nearly 90,000 records derived from specimens in reference collections published accounts and field observations that checklist includes more than 11250 species of fungi recorded from the region as its authors note the work is far from exhaustive and it is likely that the true total number of fungal species already known from the caribbean is higher the true total number of fungal species occurring in the caribbean including species not yet recorded is likely far higher given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have been discovered though the amount of available information is still small a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to some caribbean islands for cuba 2200 species of fungi have been tentatively identified as possible endemics of the island for puerto rico the number is 789 species for the dominican republic the number is 699 species for trinidad and tobago the number is 407 species
many of the ecosystems of the caribbean islands have been devastated by deforestation pollution and human encroachment the arrival of the first humans is correlated with extinction of giant owls and dwarf ground sloths the hotspot contains dozens of highly threatened animals (ranging from birds to mammals and reptiles) fungi and plants examples of threatened animals include the puerto rican amazon two species of solenodon (giant shrews) in cuba and the hispaniola island and the cuban crocodile
the region's coral reefs which contain about 70 species of hard corals and between 500700 species of reef-associated fishes have undergone rapid decline in ecosystem integrity in recent years and are considered particularly vulnerable to global warming and ocean acidification according to a unep report the caribbean coral reefs might get extinct in next 20 years due to population explosion along the coast lines overfishing the pollution of coastal areas and global warming
some caribbean islands have terrain that europeans found suitable for cultivation for agriculture tobacco was an important early crop during the colonial era but was eventually overtaken by sugarcane production as the region's staple crop sugar was produced from sugarcane for export to europe cuba and barbados were historically the largest producers of sugar the tropical plantation system thus came to dominate caribbean settlement other islands were found to have terrain unsuited for agriculture for example dominica which remains heavily forested the islands in the southern lesser antilles aruba bonaire and curaao are extremely arid making them unsuitable for agriculture however they have salt pans that were exploited by the dutch sea water was pumped into shallow ponds producing coarse salt when the water evaporated
the natural environmental diversity of the caribbean islands has led to recent growth in eco-tourism this type of tourism is growing on islands lacking sandy beaches and dense human populations

== demographicsedit ==
at the time of european contact the dominant ethnic groups in the caribbean included the tano of the greater antilles and northern lesser antilles the island caribs of the southern lesser antilles and smaller distinct groups such as the guanajatabey of western cuba and the ciguayo of western hispaniola the population of the caribbean is estimated to have been around 750,000 immediately before european contact although lower and higher figures are given after contact social disruption and epidemic diseases such as smallpox and measles (to which they had no natural immunity) led to a decline in the amerindian population from 1500 to 1800 the population rose as slaves arrived from west africa such as the kongo igbo akan fon and yoruba as well as military prisoners and captured slaves from ireland who were deported during the cromwellian reign in england immigrants from britain italy france spain the netherlands portugal and denmark also arrived although the mortality rate was high for both groups
the population is estimated to have reached 2.2 million by 1800 immigrants from india china and other countries arrived in the 19th century after the ending of the atlantic slave trade the population increased naturally the total regional population was estimated at 37.5 million by 2000
the majority of the caribbean has populations of mainly africans in the french caribbean anglophone caribbean and dutch caribbean there are minorities of mixed-race and european peoples of dutch english french italian and portuguese ancestry asians especially those of chinese and indian descent form a significant minority in the region and also contribute to multiracial communities all of their ancestors arrived in the 19th century as indentured laborers
the spanish-speaking caribbean have primarily mixed race african or european majorities puerto rico has a european majority with a mixture of european-african (mulatto) and a large west african minority one third of cuba's (largest caribbean island) population is of african descent with a sizable mulatto (mixed africaneuropean) population and european majority the dominican republic has the largest mixed race population primarily descended from europeans west africans and amerindians
larger islands such as jamaica have a very large african majority in addition to a significant mixed race chinese europeans indian lebanese latin american and syrian populations this is a result of years of importation of slaves and indentured labourers and migration most multi-racial jamaicans refer to themselves as either mixed race or brown the situation is similar for the caricom states of belize guyana suriname and trinidad and tobago trinidad and tobago has a multi-racial cosmopolitan society due to the arrival of the africans indians chinese syrians lebanese native amerindians and europeans this multi-racial mix has created sub-ethnicities that often straddle the boundaries of major ethnicities and include chindian mulatto and dougla

=== regionalismedit ===
caribbean societies are very different from other western societies in terms of size culture and degree of mobility of their citizens the current economic and political problems the states face individually are common to all caribbean states regional development has contributed to attempts to subdue current problems and avoid projected problems from a political and economic perspective regionalism serves to make caribbean states active participants in current international affairs through collective coalitions in 1973 the first political regionalism in the caribbean basin was created by advances of the english-speaking caribbean nations through the institution known as the caribbean common market and community (caricom) which is located in guyana
certain scholars have argued both for and against generalizing the political structures of the caribbean on the one hand the caribbean states are politically diverse ranging from communist systems such as cuba toward more capitalist westminster-style parliamentary systems as in the commonwealth caribbean other scholars argue that these differences are superficial and that they tend to undermine commonalities in the various caribbean states contemporary caribbean systems seem to reflect a blending of traditional and modern patterns yielding hybrid systems that exhibit significant structural variations and divergent constitutional traditions yet ultimately appear to function in similar ways. the political systems of the caribbean states share similar practices
the influence of regionalism in the caribbean is often marginalized some scholars believe that regionalism cannot exist in the caribbean because each small state is unique on the other hand scholars also suggest that there are commonalities amongst the caribbean nations that suggest regionalism exists proximity as well as historical ties among the caribbean nations has led to cooperation as well as a desire for collective action. these attempts at regionalization reflect the nations desires to compete in the international economic system
furthermore a lack of interest from other major states promoted regionalism in the region in recent years the caribbean has suffered from a lack of u.s interest with the end of the cold war u.s security and economic interests have been focused on other areas as a result there has been a significant reduction in u.s aid and investment to the caribbean. the lack of international support for these small relatively poor states helped regionalism prosper
following the cold war another issue of importance in the caribbean has been the reduced economic growth of some caribbean states due to the united states and european union's allegations of special treatment toward the region by each other
==== united states effects on regionalismedit ====
the united states under president bill clinton launched a challenge in the world trade organization against the eu over europe's preferential program known as the lom convention which allowed banana exports from the former colonies of the group of african caribbean and pacific states (acp) to enter europe cheaply the world trade organization sided in the united states favour and the beneficial elements of the convention to african caribbean and pacific states has been partially dismantled and replaced by the cotonou agreement
during the us/eu dispute the united states imposed large tariffs on european union goods (up to 100%) to pressure europe to change the agreement with the caribbean nations in favour of the cotonou agreement
farmers in the caribbean have complained of falling profits and rising costs as the lom convention weakens some farmers have faced increased pressure to turn towards the cultivation of illegal drugs which has a higher profit margin and fills the sizable demand for these illegal drugs in north america and europe
==== european union effects on regionalismedit ====
the european union has also taken issue with us based taxation extended to us companies via the caribbean countries the united states has not been in favor of shutting off the practice yet mainly due to the higher costs that would be passed on to us companies via taxation caribbean countries have largely countered the allegations by the oecd by signing more bilateral information sharing deals with oecd members thus reducing the dangerous aspects of secrecy and they have strengthened their legislation against money laundering and on conditions under which companies can be based in their nations the caribbean nations have also started to more closely cooperate in the caribbean financial action task force and other instruments to add oversight of the offshore industry
one of the most important associations that deal with regionalism amongst the nations of the caribbean basin has been the association of caribbean states (acs) proposed by caricom in 1992 the acs soon won the support of the other countries of the region it was founded in july 1994 the acs maintains regionalism within the caribbean on issues unique to the caribbean basin through coalition building like the acs and caricom regionalism has become an undeniable part of the politics and economics of the caribbean the successes of region-building initiatives are still debated by scholars yet regionalism remains prevalent throughout the caribbean
==== venezuela's effects on regionalismedit ====
the president of venezuela hugo chavez launched an economic group called the bolivarian alliance for the americas (alba) which several eastern caribbean islands joined in 2012 the nation of haiti with 9 million people became the largest caricom nation that sought to join the union
