b or b (pronounced /bi/ bee) is the 2nd letter in the iso basic latin alphabet in english it represents the voiced bilabial stop although it sometimes represents other bilabial sounds when used in other languages
== history ==
old english was originally written in runes whose equivalent letter was beorc  meaning birch beorc dates to at least the 2nd-century elder futhark which is now thought to have derived from the old italic alphabets either directly or via latin 
the uncial and half-uncial introduced by the gregorian and irish missions gradually developed into the insular scripts  these old english latin alphabets supplanted the earlier runes whose use was fully banned under king canute in the early 11th century the norman conquest popularized the carolingian half-uncial forms which latter developed into blackletter  around 1300 letter case was increasingly distinguished with upper- and lower-case b taking separate meanings following the advent of printing in the 15th century germany and scandinavia continued to use forms of blackletter (particularly fraktur) while england eventually adopted the humanist and antiqua scripts developed in renaissance italy from a combination of roman inscriptions and carolingian texts the present forms of the english cursive b were developed by the 17th century
the roman b derived from the greek capital beta via its etruscan and cumaean variants the greek letter was an adaptation of the phoenician letter bt  the egyptian hieroglyph for the consonant /b/ had been an image of a foot and calf  but bt (phoenician for house") was a modified form of a proto-sinaitic glyph probably adapted from the separate hieroglyph pr meaning house the hebrew letter beth is a separate development of the phoenician letter
by byzantine times the greek letter came to be pronounced /v/ so that it is known in modern greek as vta (still written ) the cyrillic letter ve represents the same sound so a modified form known as be was developed to represent the slavic languages /b/ (modern greek continues to lack a letter for the voiced bilabial plosive and transliterates such sounds from other languages using the consonant cluster  mp.)
== use in writing systems ==
in english most other languages that use the latin alphabet and the international phonetic alphabet b denotes the voiced bilabial stop /b/ as in bib in english it is sometimes silent this occurs particularly in words ending mb such as lamb and bomb some of which originally had a /b/ sound while some had the letter b added by analogy (see reduction of /mb/) the b in debt doubt subtle and related words was added in the 16th century as an etymological spelling intended to make the words more like their latin originals (debitum dubito subtilis)
in estonian icelandic and chinese pinyin b does not denote a voiced consonant instead it represents a voiceless /p/ that contrasts with either a geminated /p:/ (in estonian) or an aspirated /p/ (in pinyin danish and icelandic) which are all represented by p in fijian b represents a prenasalized /mb/ whereas in zulu and xhosa it represents an implosive // in contrast to the digraph bh which represents /b/ finnish uses b only in loanwords
as /b/ is one of the sounds subject to grimm's law words which have b in english and other germanic languages may find their cognates in other indo-european languages appearing with bh p f or instead for example compare the various cognates of the word brother
