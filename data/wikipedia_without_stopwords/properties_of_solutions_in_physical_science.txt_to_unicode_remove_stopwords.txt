western philosophy earliest discussions dualist ideas writings plato maintained humans intelligence faculty mind soul could identified explained terms physical body however bestknown version dualism due ren descartes holds mind nonextended nonphysical substance res cogitans descartes first clearly identify mind consciousness selfawareness distinguish brain seat intelligence therefore first formulate mindbody problem form still exists today
arguments dualismedit
frequently used argument favour dualism appeals commonsense intuition conscious experience distinct inanimate matter asked mind average person would usually respond identifying self personality soul entity would almost certainly deny mind simply brain vice versa finding idea one ontological entity play mechanistic simply unintelligible many modern philosophers mind think intuitions misleading use critical faculties along empirical evidence sciences examine assumptions determine whether real basis
another important argument favor dualism mental physical seem quite different perhaps irreconcilable properties mental events subjective quality whereas physical events example one reasonably ask burnt finger feels like blue sky looks like nice music sounds like person meaningless least odd ask surge uptake glutamate dorsolateral portion hippocampus feels like
philosophers mind call subjective aspects mental events qualia raw feels something like feel pain see familiar shade blue qualia involved mental events seem particularly difficult reduce anything physical david chalmers explains argument stating could conceivably know objective information something brain states wavelengths light involved seeing color red still know something fundamental situation like see color red
consciousness mind exist independently physical reality brain one must explain physical memories created concerning consciousness dualism must therefore explain consciousness affects physical reality one possible explanation miracle proposed arnold geulincx nicolas malebranche mindbody interactions require direct intervention god
another possible argument proposed c lewis argument reason monism implies thoughts effects physical causes reason assuming also consequent reasonable ground knowledge however apprehended reasoning ground consequent therefore monism correct would way knowing thisor anything elsewe could even suppose except fluke
zombie argument based thought experiment proposed todd moody developed david chalmers book conscious mind basic idea one imagine ones body therefore conceive existence ones body without conscious states associated body chalmers argument seems possible could exist needed things physical sciences describe zombie must true since none concepts involved sciences make reference consciousness mental phenomena physical entity definition described scientifically via physics move conceivability possibility large one others dennett argued notion philosophical zombie incoherent unlikely concept argued physicalism one must either believe anyone including oneself might zombie one zombiefollowing assertion ones conviction zombie product physical world therefore different anyone elses argument expressed dennett argues zombies think conscious think qualia think suffer painsthey wrong according lamentable tradition ways neither could ever discover see also problem minds
interactionist dualismedit
interactionist dualism simply interactionism particular form dualism first espoused descartes meditations th century major defenders karl popper john carew eccles view mental states beliefs desires causally interact physical states
descartes famous argument position summarized follows seth clear distinct idea mind thinking thing spatial extension ie cannot measured terms length weight height also clear distinct idea body something spatially extended subject quantification able think follows mind body identical radically different properties
time however clear seths mental states desires beliefs etc causal effects body vice versa child touches hot stove physical event causes pain mental event makes yell physical event turn provokes sense fear protectiveness caregiver mental event
descartes argument crucially depends premise seth believes clear distinct ideas mind necessarily true many contemporary philosophers doubt example joseph agassi suggests several scientific discoveries made since early th century undermined idea privileged access ones ideas freud claimed psychologicallytrained observer understand persons unconscious motivations better person duhem shown philosopher science know persons methods discovery better person malinowski shown anthropologist know persons customs habits better person whose customs habits also asserts modern psychological experiments cause people see things provide grounds rejecting descartes argument scientists describe persons perceptions better person weakness common arguments interactionism put introspective insight doubt know people make mistakes world including anothers internal states always therefore logically absurd assume persons always error mental states judgements nature mind

property dualism view world constituted one kind substance physical kind exist two distinct kinds properties physical properties mental properties words view nonphysical mental properties beliefs desires emotions inhere physical bodies least brains mental physical properties relate causally depends variety property dualism question always clear issue subvarieties property dualism include
strong emergentism asserts matter organized appropriate way ie way living human bodies organized mental properties emerge way fully accountable physical laws hence form emergent materialism emergent properties independent ontological status cannot reduced explained terms physical substrate emerge dependent physical properties emerge opinions vary coherence topdown causation ie causal effectiveness properties form property dualism espoused david chalmers concept undergone something renaissance recent years already suggested th century william james
epiphenomenalism doctrine first formulated thomas henry huxley consists view mental phenomena causally ineffectual one mental states influence physical states mental phenomena effects causes physical phenomena physical events cause physical events physical events cause mental events mental events cannot cause anything since causally inert byproducts ie epiphenomena physical world view defended strongly recent times frank jackson
nonreductive physicalism view mental properties form separate ontological class physical properties mental states qualia reducible physical states ontological stance towards qualia case nonreductive physicalism imply qualia causally inert distinguishes epiphenomenalism
panpsychism view matter mental aspect alternatively objects unified center experience point view superficially seems form property dualism since regards everything mental physical properties however panpsychists say mechanical behaviour derived primitive mentality atoms moleculesas sophisticated mentality organic behaviour difference attributed presence absence complex structure compound object long reduction nonmental properties mental ones place panpsychism strong form property dualism otherwise

behaviorismedit
behaviorism dominated philosophy mind much th century especially first half psychology behaviorism developed reaction inadequacies introspectionism introspective reports ones interior mental life subject careful examination accuracy cannot used form predictive generalizations without generalizability possibility thirdperson examination behaviorists argued psychology cannot scientific way therefore eliminate idea interior mental life hence ontologically independent mind altogether focus instead description observable behavior
parallel developments psychology philosophical behaviorism sometimes called logical behaviorism developed characterized strong verificationism generally considers unverifiable statements interior mental life pointless behaviorist mental states interior states one make introspective reports descriptions behavior dispositions behave certain ways made third parties explain predict anothers behavior
philosophical behaviorism fallen favor since latter half th century coinciding rise cognitivism cognitivists reject behaviorism due several perceived problems example behaviorism could said counterintuitive maintains someone talking behavior event person experiencing painful headache
identity theoryedit
type physicalism typeidentity theory developed john smart ullin place direct reaction failure behaviorism philosophers reasoned mental states something material behavioral mental states probably identical internal states brain simplified terms mental state m nothing brain state b mental state desire cup coffee would thus nothing firing certain neurons certain brain regions
despite initial plausibility identity theory faces strong challenge form thesis multiple realizability first formulated hilary putnam obvious humans many different species animals example experience pain however seems highly unlikely diverse organisms pain experience identical brain state case pain cannot identical specific brain state identity theory thus empirically unfounded

different varieties functionalism share common thesis mental states characterized causal relations mental states sensory inputs behavioral outputs functionalism abstracts away details physical implementation mental state characterizing terms nonmental functional properties example kidney characterized scientifically functional role filtering blood maintaining certain chemical balances point view really matter whether kidney made organic tissue plastic nanotubes silicon chips role plays relations organs define kidney
nonreductive physicalismedit
nonreductionist philosophers hold firmly two essential convictions regard mindbody relations physicalism true mental states must physical states reductionist proposals unsatisfactory mental states cannot reduced behavior brain states functional states hence question arises whether still nonreductive physicalism donald davidsons anomalous monism attempt formulate physicalism
davidson uses thesis supervenience mental states supervene physical states reducible supervenience therefore describes functional dependence change mental without change physicalcausal reducibility mental physical without ontological reducibility
nonreductive physicalist theories attempt retain ontological distinction mind body try solve surfeit explanations puzzle way critics often see paradox point similarities epiphenomenalism brain seen root cause mind mind seems rendered inert
epiphenomenalism regards one mental states byproduct physical brain states influence physical states interaction oneway solving surfeit explanations puzzle leaving us nonreducible mental states byproduct brain states causally reducible ontologically irreducible physical states pain would seen epiphenomenaliasts caused brain state effects brain states though might effects mental states ie cause distress
weak emergentismedit
weak emergentism form nonreductive physicalism involves layered view nature layers arranged terms increasing complexity corresponding special science philosophers hold emergent properties causally interact fundamental levels others maintain higherorder properties simply supervene lower levels without direct causal interaction latter group therefore holds less strict weaker definition emergentism rigorously stated follows property p composite object o emergent metaphysically impossible another object lack property p object composed parts intrinsic properties identical o parts identical configuration
sometimes emergentists use example water new property hydrogen h oxygen o combine form ho water example emerges new property transparent liquid would predicted understanding hydrogen oxygen gases analogous physical properties brain giving rise mental state emergentists try solve notorious mindbody gap way one problem emergentism idea causal closure world allow mindtobody causation
eliminative materialismedit
one materialist believes aspects commonsense psychology find reduction mature cognitive neuroscience nonreductive materialism mistaken one adopt final radical position eliminative materialism
several varieties eliminative materialism maintain commonsense folk psychology badly misrepresents nature aspect cognition eliminativists patricia paul churchland argue folk psychology treats cognition fundamentally sentencelike nonlinguistic vectormatrix model neural network theory connectionism prove much accurate account brain works
churchlands often invoke fate erroneous popular theories ontologies arisen course history example ptolemaic astronomy served explain roughly predict motions planets centuries eventually model solar system eliminated favor copernican model churchlands believe eliminative fate awaits sentencecruncher model mind thought behavior result manipulating sentencelike states called propositional attitudes

mysterianismedit
philosophers take epistemic approach argue mindbody problem currently unsolvable perhaps always remain unsolvable human beings usually termed new mysterianism colin mcginn holds human beings cognitively closed regards minds according mcginn human minds lack conceptforming procedures fully grasp mental properties consciousness arise causal basis example would elephant cognitively closed regards particle physics
moderate conception expounded thomas nagel holds mind body problem currently unsolvable present stage scientific development might take future scientific paradigm shift revolution bridge explanatory gap nagel posits future sort objective phenomenology might able bridge gap subjective conscious experience physical basis
linguistic criticism mindbody problemedit
attempt answer mindbody problem encounters substantial problems philosophers argue underlying conceptual confusion philosophers ludwig wittgenstein followers tradition linguistic criticism therefore reject problem illusory argue error ask mental biological states fit together rather simply accepted human experience described different waysfor instance mental biological vocabulary illusory problems arise one tries describe one terms others vocabulary mental vocabulary used wrong contexts case instance one searches mental states brain brain simply wrong context use mental vocabularythe search mental states brain therefore category error sort fallacy reasoning
today position often adopted interpreters wittgenstein peter hacker however hilary putnam originator functionalism also adopted position mindbody problem illusory problem dissolved according manner wittgenstein

qualiaedit
many mental states seem experienced subjectively different ways different individuals characteristic mental state experiential quality eg pain hurts however sensation pain two individuals may identical since one perfect way measure much something hurts describing exactly feels hurt philosophers scientists therefore ask experiences come existence cerebral events cannot explain accompanied corresponding qualitative experiences puzzle many cerebral processes occur accompanying experiential aspect consciousness seems impossible explain
yet also seems many science eventually explain experiences follows assumption possibility reductive explanations according view attempt successfully made explain phenomenon reductively eg water explained phenomenon properties eg fluidity transparency case mental states means needs explanation property experienced certain way
