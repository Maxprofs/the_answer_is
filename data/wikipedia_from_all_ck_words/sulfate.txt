the sulfate or sulphate (see spelling differences) ion is a polyatomic anion with the empirical formula so42 sulfate is the spelling recommended by iupac but sulphate is used in british english salts acid derivatives and peroxides of sulfate are widely used in industry sulfates occur widely in everyday life sulfates are salts of sulfuric acid and many are prepared from that acid
== structureedit ==
the anion consists of a central sulfur atom surrounded by four equivalent oxygen atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement the symmetry is the same as that of methane the sulfur atom is in the +6 oxidation state while the four oxygen atoms are each in the 2 state the sulfate ion carries a negative two charge and is the conjugate base of the bisulfate (or hydrogen sulfate) ion hso4 which is the conjugate base of h
2so
4 sulfuric acid organic sulfate esters such as dimethyl sulfate are covalent compounds and esters of sulfuric acid the tetrahedral molecular geometry of the sulfate ion is as predicted by vsepr theory
== bondingedit ==
the first description of the bonding in modern terms was by gilbert lewis in his groundbreaking paper of 1916 where he described the bonding in terms of electron octets around each atom that is no double bonds and a formal charge of 2+ on the sulfur atom
later linus pauling used valence bond theory to propose that the most significant resonance canonicals had two bonds involving d orbitals his reasoning was that the charge on sulfur was thus reduced in accordance with his principle of electroneutrality the s-o bond length of 149 pm is shorter than the bond lengths in sulfuric acid of 157 pm for s-oh the double bonding was taken by pauling to account for the shortness of the s-o bond pauling's use of d orbitals provoked a debate on the relative importance of bonding and bond polarity (electrostatic attraction) in causing the shortening of the s-o bond the outcome was a broad consensus that d orbitals play a role but are not as significant as pauling had believed
a widely accepted description involving p - d bonding was initially proposed by d.w.j cruickshank in this model fully occupied p orbitals on oxygen overlap with empty sulfur d orbitals (principally the dz2 and dx2-y2) however in this description despite there being some character to the s-o bonds the bond has significant ionic character for sulfuric acid computational analysis (with natural bond orbitals) confirms a clear positive charge on sulfur (theoretically +2.45) and a low 3d occupancy therefore the representation with four single bonds is the optimal lewis structure rather than the one with two double bonds (thus the lewis model not the pauling model) in this model the structure obeys the octet rule and the charge distribution is in agreement with the electronegativity of the atoms the discrepancy between the s-o bond length in the sulfate ion and the s-oh bond length in sulfuric acid is explained by donation of p-orbital electrons from the terminal s=o bonds in sulfuric acid into the anti-bonding s-oh orbitals weakening them resulting in the longer bond length of the latter
however the bonding representation of pauling for sulfate and other main group compounds with oxygen is still a common way of representing the bonding in many textbooks the apparent contradiction can be cleared if one realizes that the covalent double bonds in the lewis structure in reality represent bonds that are strongly polarized by more than 90% towards the oxygen atom on the other hand in the structure with an ionic bond the charge is localized as a lone pair on the oxygen
== preparationedit ==
methods of preparing metal sulfates include
treating metal metal hydroxide or metal oxide with sulfuric acid
oxidation of metal sulfides or sulfites
== propertiesedit ==
many examples of ionic sulfates are known and many of these are highly soluble in water exceptions include calcium sulfate strontium sulfate lead(ii) sulfate and barium sulfate which are poorly soluble radium sulfate is the most insoluble sulfate known the barium derivative is useful in the gravimetric analysis of sulfate if one adds a solution of perhaps barium chloride to a solution containing sulfate ions the appearance of a white precipitate which is barium sulfate indicates that sulfate anions are present
the sulfate ion can act as a ligand attaching either by one oxygen (monodentate) or by two oxygens as either a chelate or a bridge an example is the neutral metal complex ptso4(p(c6h5)3)2 where the sulfate ion is acting as a bidentate ligand the metal-oxygen bonds in sulfate complexes can have significant covalent character

=== commercial applicationsedit ===
sulfates are widely used industrially major compounds include
gypsum the natural mineral form of hydrated calcium sulfate is used to produce plaster about 100 mtons/y are used by the construction industry
copper sulfate a common algaecide
iron sulfate a common form of iron in mineral supplements for humans animals and soil for plants
magnesium sulfate (commonly known as epsom salts) used in therapeutic baths
sodium laureth sulfate or sodium lauryl ether sulfate (sles) a detergent and surfactant found in many personal care products (soaps shampoos toothpaste etc.)
lead(ii) sulfate produced on both plates during the discharge of a leadacid battery
=== occurrence in natureedit ===
sulfate-reducing bacteria some anaerobic microorganisms such as those living in sediment or near deep sea thermal vents use the reduction of sulfates coupled with the oxidation of organic compounds or hydrogen as an energy source for chemosynthesis
== historyedit ==
some sulfates were known to alchemists the vitriol salts from the latin vitreolum glassy were so-called because they were some of the first transparent crystals known green vitriol is ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso47h2o blue vitriol is copper sulfate pentahydrate cuso45h2o and white vitriol is zinc sulfate heptahydrate znso47h2o alum a double sulfate with the formula k2al2(so4)424h2o figured in the development of the chemical industry
== environmental effectsedit ==
sulfates occur as microscopic particles (aerosols) resulting from fossil fuel and biomass combustion they increase the acidity of the atmosphere and form acid rain the anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria desulfovibrio desulfuricans and d vulgaris can remove the black sulfate crust that often tarnishes buildings
=== main effects on climateedit ===
the main direct effect of sulfates on the climate involves the scattering of light effectively increasing the earth's albedo this effect is moderately well understood and leads to a cooling from the negative radiative forcing of about 0.4 w/m2 relative to pre-industrial values partially offsetting the larger (about 2.4 w/m2) warming effect of greenhouse gases the effect is strongly spatially non-uniform being largest downstream of large industrial areas
the first indirect effect is also known as the twomey effect sulfate aerosols can act as cloud condensation nuclei and this leads to greater numbers of smaller droplets of water lots of smaller droplets can diffuse light more efficiently than just a few larger droplets
the second indirect effect is the further knock-on effects of having more cloud condensation nuclei it is proposed that these include the suppression of drizzle increased cloud height to facilitate cloud formation at low humidities and longer cloud lifetime sulfate may also result in changes in the particle size distribution which can affect the clouds radiative properties in ways that are not fully understood chemical effects such as the dissolution of soluble gases and slightly soluble substances surface tension depression by organic substances and accommodation coefficient changes are also included in the second indirect effect
the indirect effects probably have a cooling effect perhaps up to 2 w/m2 although the uncertainty is very large sulfates are therefore implicated in global dimming

the conjugate base of sulfuric acid (h2so4)a dense colourless oily corrosive liquidis the hydrogen sulfate ion (hso4) also called the bisulfate ion sulfuric acid is classified as a strong acid in aqueous solutions it ionizes completely to form hydronium ions (h3o+) and hydrogen sulfate (hso4) in other words the sulfuric acid behaves as a brnsted-lowry acid and is deprotonated bisulfate has a molar mass of 97.078 g/mol it has a valency of 1 an example of a salt containing the hso4 group is sodium bisulfate nahso4 in dilute solutions the hydrogen sulfate ions also dissociate forming more hydronium ions and sulfate ions (so42) the cas registry number for hydrogen sulfate is 14996-02-2
