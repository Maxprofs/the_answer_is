electron configurationedit
main group element number valence electrons may depends electron configuration simple way however transition metal relationship complex
main group element valence electron defined electron resides electronic shell highest principal quantum number n example electronic configuration phosphorus p p p valence electrons p corresponding maximum valence p molecule pf configuration normally abbreviated ne p ne signifies core electrons whose configuration identical noble gas neon
however simple method work transition metals incomplete d ie d d d subshells whose energy normally comparable electron instead valence electron transition metal defined electron resides outside noblegas core example manganese mn configuration p p d abbreviated ar d ar denotes core configuration identical noble gas argon atom d electron energy similar electron much higher p electron effect possibly seven valence electrons d outside argonlike core consistent chemical fact manganese oxidation state high permanganate ion mno
farther right transition metal series lower energy electron d subshell less electron properties valence electron thus although nickel atom principle ten valence electrons d oxidation state never exceeds four zinc d subshell complete behaves similarly core electrons
number valence electrons actually participate chemical reactions difficult predict concept valence electron less useful transition metal main group element d electron count alternative tool understanding chemistry transition metal

reactive kind metallic element alkali metal group eg sodium potassium atom single valence electron formation ionic bond provides necessary ionization energy one valence electron easily lost form positive ion cation closed shell eg na k alkaline earth metal group eg magnesium somewhat less reactive atom must lose two valence electrons form positive ion closed shell eg mg
within group periodic table column metals reactivity increases lower row table light element heavier element heavier element electron shells lighter element heavier elements valence electrons exist higher principal quantum numbers farther away nucleus atom thus higher potential energies means less tightly bound
nonmetal atom tends attract additional valence electrons attain full valence shell achieved one two ways atom either share electrons neighboring atom covalent bond remove electrons another atom ionic bond reactive kind nonmetal element halogen eg fluorine f chlorine cl atom following electron configuration sp requires one additional valence electron form closed shell form ionic bond halogen atom remove electron another atom order form anion eg f cl etc form covalent bond one electron halogen one electron another atom form shared pair eg molecule hf line represents shared pair valence electrons one h one f
within group nonmetals reactivity decreases lower rows table light element heavy element periodic table valence electrons progressively higher energies thus progressively less tightly bound fact oxygen lightest element group reactive nonmetal fluorine even though halogen valence shell halogen higher principal quantum number
simple cases octet rule obeyed valence atom equals number electrons gained lost shared order form stable octet however also many molecules exceptions valence less clearly defined
