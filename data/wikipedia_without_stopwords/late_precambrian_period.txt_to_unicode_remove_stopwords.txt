history
prehistory
native americans likely hunting great smoky mountains years numerous archaic period c bc artifacts found within national parks boundaries including projectile points uncovered along likely animal migration paths woodland period c bc ad sites found within park contained yearold ceramics evidence primitive agriculture
increasing reliance upon agriculture mississippian period c ad lured native americans away gamerich forests smokies fertile river valleys outer fringe range substantial mississippianperiod villages uncovered citico toqua named cherokee villages later thrived sites along little tennessee river fortified mississippianperiod villages excavated mcmahan indian mounds sevierville recently townsend villages part minor chiefdom centered large village known chiaha located island submerged douglas lake expedition hernando de soto expedition juan pardo passed french broad river valley north smokies spending considerable amount time chiaha pardo expedition followed trail across flanks chilhowee mountain mississippianperiod villages chilhowee citico pardos notary called muskogean names chalahume satapo

european settlement
european explorers settlers began arriving western north carolina east tennessee midth century influx settlers end french indian war brought conflict cherokee still held legal title much land cherokee aligned british outbreak american revolution american forces launched invasion cherokee territory middle towns including kittuwa burned general griffith rutherford several overhill towns burned john sevier cherokee ceded control great smokies us government although much tribe forced west along trail tears largely efforts william holland thomas managed retain land qualla boundary today comprise eastern band cherokee indians
several frontier outposts established along outskirts smokies namely whitsons fort cosby wears fort pigeon forge permanent settlers began arriving areas whaley brothers william john moved north carolina become first settlers greenbrier section park following year edgefield south carolina resident william ogle arrived white oak flats cut prepared logs cabin construction although ogle died shortly returning edgefield wife martha jane huskey eventually returned family several families white oak flats becoming first permanent settlers would eventually become gatlinburg children grandchildren spread southward sugarlands roaring fork areas cades cove settled largely families purchased lots land speculator william fighting billy tipton first settlers john lucretia oliver arrived two cades cove settlers moses patience proctor crossed north carolina side smokies become first euroamerican settlers hazel creek area cataloochee area first settled caldwell family migrated valley

major engagements took place smokies minor skirmishes fairly common cherokee chief william holland thomas formed confederate legion made mostly cherokee soldiers thomas legion crossed smokies occupied gatlinburg several months protect salt peter mines atop mount le conte residents predominantly union cades cove predominantly confederate hazel creek routinely crossed mountains steal one anothers livestock residents cosby cataloochee likewise one notable civil war incident smokies murder longtime cades cove resident russell gregory gregory bald named carried bushwhackers shortly gregory led ambush routed band confederates seeking wreak havoc cove another incident george kirks raid cataloochee kirk killed wounded union soldiers recovering makeshift hospital
logging
selective logging occurred great smoky mountains throughout th century general inaccessibility ranges forests prevented major logging operations lumber firms relied lowland forests northeastern united states mississippi delta southeast timber resources regions became exhausted demand lumber skyrocketed civil war entrepreneurs began looking ways reach virgin forests southern appalachia first logging operations smokies began used splash dams booms float logs rivers lumber mills nearby cities notable splash dam boom operations included english lumber company little river taylor crate operations along hazel creek ambitious operations alexander arthur pigeon river three operations failed within first years however dams boom systems destroyed floods
innovations logging railroads band saw technology late th century made largescale logging possible mountainous areas southern appalachia largest logging operation smokies little river lumber company logged little river watershed company also established company towns townsend named companys chief owner manager wilson b townsend elkmont tremont secondlargest operation ritter lumber company logged hazel creek watershed ruins ritters lumbering operations still visible along hazel creek trail lumbering operations included three m lumber champion fibre logged oconaluftee watershed time operations ceased logging firms removed twothirds virgin forests smokies
national park
wilson b townsend head little river lumber began advertising elkmont tourist destination within years wonderland hotel appalachian club established cater elite knoxvillians seeking summer mountain getaways early several appalachian club members among knoxville businessman colonel david chapman began seriously considering movement establish national park great smokies head great smoky mountains park commission chapman largely responsible raising funds land purchases coordinating park efforts local state federal entities
creation great smoky mountains national park proved much complex creation predecessors yellowstone yosemite already federally owned along convincing logging firms sell lucrative lumber rights park commission negotiate purchase thousands small farms remove entire communities commission also deal tennessee north carolina legislatures times opposed spending taxpayer money park efforts spite difficulties park commission completed major land purchases national park officially opened president franklin d roosevelt presiding opening ceremony newfound gap
culture tourism
culture area southern appalachia previously cherokee people tourism key areas economy particularly cities like pigeon forge gatlinburg tennessee cherokee north carolina great smoky mountains heritage center opened townsend tennessee mission preserving various aspects regions culture
