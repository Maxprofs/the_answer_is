a concerto (from the italian concerto plural concerti or often the anglicised form concertos) is a musical composition usually composed in three parts or movements in which (usually) one solo instrument (for instance a piano violin cello or flute) is accompanied by an orchestra or concert band
the etymology is uncertain but the word seems to have originated from the conjunction of the two latin words conserere (meaning to tie to join to weave) and certamen (competition fight) the idea is that the two parts in a concerto the soloist and the orchestra or concert band alternate episodes of opposition cooperation and independence in the creation of the music flow
the concerto as understood in this modern way arose in the baroque period side by side with the concerto grosso which contrasted a small group of instruments with the rest of the orchestra the popularity of the concerto grosso form declined after the baroque period and the genre was not revived until the 20th century the solo concerto however has remained a vital musical force from its inception to this day
== early baroque concertoedit ==
the term concerto was initially used to denote works involving voices and instruments in which the instruments had independent partsas opposed to the renaissance common practice in which the instruments that accompanied voices only doubled the voice parts examples of this earlier form of concerto include giovanni gabrieli's in ecclesiis or heinrich schtz's saul saul was verfolgst du mich.
== late baroque concertoedit ==
the concerto began to take its modern shape in the late baroque period starting from a form called concerto grosso popularized by arcangelo corelli it evolved into the form we understand today as performance of a soloist with/against an orchestra
the main composers of concerti of the baroque were tommaso albinoni antonio vivaldi georg philipp telemann johann sebastian bach george frideric handel pietro locatelli giuseppe tartini francesco geminiani and johann joachim quantz the concerto was intended as a composition typical of the italian style of the time and all the composers were studying how to compose in the italian fashion (all'italiana)
the baroque concerto was mainly for a string instrument (violin viola cello seldom viola d'amore or harp) or a wind instrument (oboe trumpet flute or horn)
during the baroque period before the invention of the piano keyboard concertos were comparatively rare with the exception of the organ and some harpsichord concertos by johann sebastian bach as the harpsichord evolved into the fortepiano and in the end to the modern piano the increased volume and the richer sound of the new instrument allowed the keyboard instrument to better compete with a full orchestra
cello concertos have been written since the baroque era if not earlier among the works from that period those by antonio vivaldi and giuseppe tartini are still part of the standard repertoire today
== classical concertoedit ==
the concerti of the sons of johann sebastian bach are perhaps the best links between those of the baroque period and those of the classical era
it is conventional to state that the first movements of concerti from the classical period onwards follow the structure of sonata form final movements are often in rondo form as in j.s bach's e major violin concerto
=== violin concertosedit ===
mozart wrote five violin concertos in quick succession they show a number of influences notably italian and austrian several passages have leanings towards folk music as manifested in austrian serenades
haydn wrote four violin concerti
beethoven wrote only one violin concerto
=== cello concertosedit ===
haydn wrote at least two cello concertos which are the most important works in that genre of the classical era however c.p.e bachs three cello concertos are also noteworthy
=== keyboard concertosedit ===
c.p.e bachs keyboard concertos contain some brilliant soloistic writing some of them have movements that run into one another without a break and there are frequent cross-movement thematic references
mozart as a boy made arrangements for harpsichord and orchestra of three sonata movements by johann christian bach by the time he was twenty mozart was able to write concerto ritornelli that gave the orchestra admirable opportunity for asserting its character in an exposition with some five or six sharply contrasted themes before the soloist enters to elaborate on the material some of his twenty-seven piano are considered central in the instrument's repertoire
haydn wrote a dozen keyboard concertos although a couple of them are considered spurious
=== concertos for other instrumentsedit ===
c.p.e bach wrote four flute concertos and two oboe concertos
mozart wrote one concerto each for flute oboe (later rearranged for flute and known as flute concerto no 2) clarinet and bassoon four for horn a concerto for flute harp and orchestra a sinfonia concertante for violin viola and orchestra and exsultate jubilate a de facto concerto for soprano voice they all exploit and explore the characteristics of the solo instrument
haydn wrote an important trumpet concerto and a sinfonia concertante for violin cello oboe and bassoon as well as two horn concertos
== romantic concertoedit ==
=== violin concertosedit ===
in the 19th century the concerto as a vehicle for virtuosic display flourished as never before it was the age in which the artist was seen as hero to be worshipped and adulated with rapture early romantic traits can be found in the violin concertos of viotti but it is spohrs twelve violin concertos written between 1802 and 1827 that truly embrace the romantic spirit with their melodic as well as their dramatic qualities
beethovens violin concerto is unique in its scale and melodic qualities recitative elements are often incorporated showing the influence of italian opera on purely instrumental forms
mendelssohn opens his violin concerto (1844) with the singing qualities of the violin solo even later passage work is dramatic and recitative-like rather than merely virtuosic the wind instruments state the lyrical second subject over a low pedal g on the violin certainly an innovation the cadenza placed at the end of the development and acting as a link to the recapitulation is fully written out and integrated into the structure
the great violin virtuoso niccol paganini was a legendary figure who as a composer exploited the technical potential of his instrument to its very limits each one exploits rhapsodic ideas but is unique in its own form the belgian violinist henri vieuxtemps himself a major virtuoso contributed several works to this form
douard lalo's symphonie espagnole (1875) displays virtuoso writing with a spanish flavor
max bruch wrote three violin concertos but it is the first in g minor that has remained a firm favorite in the repertoire the opening movement relates so closely to the two remaining movements that it functions like an operatic prelude
tchaikovskys violin concerto (1878) is a powerful work which succeeds in being lyrical as well as superbly virtuosic
in the same year brahms wrote his violin concerto for the virtuoso joseph joachim this work makes new demands on the player so much so that when it was first written it was referred to as a concerto against the violin the first movement brings the concerto into the realm of symphonic development the second movement is traditionally lyrical and the finale is based on a lively hungarian theme
=== cello concertosedit ===
since the romantic era the cello has received as much attention as the piano and violin as a concerto instrument and many great romantic and even more 20th-century composers left examples
antonn dvoks cello concerto ranks among the supreme examples from the romantic era while robert schumann's focuses on the lyrical qualities of the instrument the instrument was also popular with composers of the franco-belgian tradition saint-sans and vieuxtemps wrote two cello concertos each and lalo and jongen one elgar's popular concerto while written in the early 20th century belongs to the late romantic period stylistically
beethoven contributed to the repertoire with a triple concerto for piano violin cello and orchestra while later in the century brahms wrote a double concerto for violin cello and orchestra
tchaikovskys contribution to the genre is a series of variations on a rococo theme he also left very fragmentary sketches of a projected cello concerto cellist yuriy leonovich and tchaikovsky researcher brett langston published their completion of the piece in 2006
carl reinecke david popper and julius klengel also wrote cello concertos that were popular in their time and are still played occasionally nowadays
today's core repertoire which is performed the most of any cello concertos are by elgar dvok saint-sans haydn shostakovich and schumann but there are many more concertos which are performed nearly as often (see below cello concertos in the 20th century)
=== piano concertosedit ===
beethovens five piano concertos increase the technical demands made on the soloist the last two are particularly remarkable integrating the concerto into a large symphonic structure with movements that frequently run into one another his piano concerto no 4 starts against tradition with a statement by the piano after which the orchestra enters in a foreign key to present what would normally have been the opening tutti the work has an essentially lyrical character the slow movement is a dramatic dialogue between the soloist and the orchestra his piano concerto no 5 has the basic rhythm of a viennese military march there is no lyrical second subject but in its place a continuous development of the opening material he also wrote a triple concerto for piano violin cello and orchestra
the piano concertos of cramer field dssek woelfl and hummel provide a link from the classical concerto to the romantic concerto
chopin wrote two piano concertos in which the orchestra is very much relegated to an accompanying role schumann despite being a pianist-composer wrote a piano concerto in which virtuosity is never allowed to eclipse the essential lyrical quality of the work the gentle expressive melody heard at the beginning on woodwind and horns (after the pianos heralding introductory chords) bears the material for most of the argument in the first movement in fact argument in the traditional developmental sense is replaced by a kind of variation technique in which soloist and orchestra interweave their ideas
liszt's mastery of piano technique matched that of paganini for the violin his concertos no 1 and no 2 left a deep impression on the style of piano concerto writing influencing rubinstein and especially tchaikovsky whose first piano concerto's rich chordal opening is justly famous griegs concerto likewise begins in a striking manner after which it continues in a lyrical vein
brahms's first piano concerto in d minor (pub 1861) was the result of an immense amount of work on a mass of material originally intended for a symphony his second piano concerto in b major (1881) has four movements and is written on a larger scale than any earlier concerto like his violin concerto it is symphonic in proportions
fewer piano concertos were written in the late romantic period but sergei rachmaninoff wrote 4 piano concertos between 1891 and 1926 his 2nd and 3rd being the most popular of the 4 went on to become among the most famous in piano repertoire
other romantic piano concertos like those by kalkbrenner henri herz moscheles and thalberg were also very popular in the romantic era but not today
=== small-scale worksedit ===
besides the usual three-movement works with the title concerto many 19th-century composers wrote shorter pieces for solo instrument and orchestra often bearing descriptive titles from around 1800 such pieces were often called konzertstck or phantasie by german composers
liszt wrote the totentanz for piano and orchestra a paraphrase of the dies irae max bruch wrote a popular scottish fantasy for violin and orchestra csar franck wrote les djinns and variations symphoniques and gabriel faur wrote a ballade for piano and orchestra rachmaninoff's rhapsody on a theme of paganini is widely considered to be structured similarly to a piano concerto
tchaikovsky's variations on a rococo theme for cello and orchestra have an important place in the instrument's repertoire
== 20th centuryedit ==
many of the concertos written in the early 20th century belong more to the late romantic school than to any modernistic movement masterpieces were written by edward elgar (a violin concerto and a cello concerto) sergei rachmaninoff and nikolai medtner (four and three piano concertos respectively) jean sibelius (a violin concerto) frederick delius (a violin concerto a cello concerto a piano concerto and a double concerto for violin and cello) karol szymanowski (two violin concertos and a symphonie concertante for piano) and richard strauss (two horn concertos a violin concerto don quixote a tone poem which features the cello as a soloist and among later works an oboe concerto)
however in the first decades of the 20th century several composers such as debussy schoenberg berg hindemith stravinsky prokofiev and bartk started experimenting with ideas that were to have far-reaching consequences for the way music is written and in some cases performed some of these innovations include a more frequent use of modality the exploration of non-western scales the development of atonality the wider acceptance of dissonances the invention of the twelve-tone technique of composition and the use of polyrhythms and complex time signatures
these changes also affected the concerto as a musical form beside more or less radical effects on musical language they led to a redefinition of the concept of virtuosity in order to include new and extended instrumental techniques as well as a focus on aspects of sound that had been neglected or even ignored before such as pitch timbre and dynamics in some cases they also brought about a new approach to the role of the soloist and its relation to the orchestra
=== violin concertosedit ===
two great innovators of early 20th-century music schoenberg and stravinsky both wrote violin concertos the material in schoenbergs concerto like that in bergs is linked by the twelve-tone serial method bartk another major 20th-century composer wrote two important concertos for violin russian composers prokofiev and shostakovich both wrote two concertos while khachaturian wrote a concerto and a concerto-rhapsody for the instrument hindemiths concertos hark back to the forms of the 19th century even if the harmonic language which he used was different
three violin concertos from david diamond show the form in neoclassical style
more recently dutilleux's l'arbre des songes has proved an important addition to the repertoire and a fine example of the composer's atonal yet melodic style
other composers of major violin concertos include jean sibelius ralph vaughan williams samuel barber walton benjamin britten frank martin carl nielsen paul hindemith alfred schnittke gyrgy ligeti philip glass dmitri shostakovich sergei prokofiev aram khachaturian bla bartk and john adams
=== cello concertosedit ===
in the 20th century particularly after the second world war the cello enjoyed an unprecedented popularity as a result its concertante repertoire caught up with those of the piano and the violin both in terms of quantity and quality
an important factor in this phenomenon was the rise of virtuoso cellist mstislav rostropovich his outstanding technique and passionate playing prompted dozens of composers to write pieces for him first in his native soviet union and then abroad his creations include such masterpieces as sergei prokofiev's symphony-concerto dmitri shostakovich's two cello concertos benjamin britten's cello-symphony (which emphasizes as its title suggests the equal importance of soloist and orchestra) henri dutilleux tout un monde lointain... witold lutosawski's cello concerto dmitri kabalevsky's two cello concertos aram khachaturian's concerto-rhapsody arvo prt's pro et contra alfred schnittke andr jolivet and krzysztof penderecki second cello concertos sofia gubaidulina's canticles of the sun luciano berio's ritorno degli snovidenia leonard bernstein's three meditations james macmillan's cello concerto and olivier messiaen's concert quatre (a quadruple concerto for cello piano oboe flute and orchestra)
in addition several important composers who were not directly influenced by rostropovich wrote cello concertos gyrgy ligeti alexander glazunov paul hindemith toru takemitsu darius milhaud arthur honegger nikolai myaskovsky samuel barber joaqun rodrigo elliot carter erich wolfgang korngold william walton heitor villa-lobos hans werner henze bernd alois zimmermann and einojuhani rautavaara for instance
=== piano concertosedit ===
igor stravinsky wrote three works for solo piano and orchestra concerto for piano and wind instruments capriccio for piano and orchestra and movements for piano and orchestra sergei prokofiev another russian composer wrote no less than five piano concertos which he himself performed dmitri shostakovich composed two fellow soviet composer aram khachaturian contributed to the repertoire with a piano concerto and a concerto-rhapsody
arnold schoenbergs piano concerto is a well-known example of a dodecaphonic piano concerto
bla bartk also wrote three piano concertos like their violin counterparts they show the various stages in his musical development bartok's also rearranged his chamber piece sonata for two pianos and percussion into a concerto for two pianos and percussion adding orchestral accompaniment
ralph vaughan williams wrote a concerto for piano (in fact a reworking of a concerto for two pianos - both versions have been recorded) while benjamin britten's concerto for piano (1938) is a prominent work from his early period
gyrgy ligeti's concerto (1988) has a synthetic quality it mixes complex rhythms the composer's hungarian roots and his experiments with micropolyphony from the 1960s and 70's witold lutoslawski's piano concerto completed in the same year alternates between playfulness and mystery it also displays a partial return to melody after the composer's aleatoric period
russian composer rodion shchedrin has written six piano concertos finnish composer einojuhani rautavaara wrote three piano concertos the third one dedicated to vladimir ashkenazy who played and conducted the world premire
=== concertos for other instrumentsedit ===
the 20th century also witnessed a growth of the concertante repertoire of instruments some of which had seldom or never been used in this capacity as a result almost all classical instruments now have a concertante repertoire examples include
