ha ho ho
acid stronger ho react ho form ho therefor acid stronger ho exist ho similar ammonia solvent strongest acid ammonium nh thus hcl super acid exert acidifi effect
argument appli base water oh strongest base thus even though sodium amid nanh except base pka nh water good sodium hydroxid hand nanh far basic reagent ammonia naoh
ph rang allow particular solvent call acidbas discrimin window
level differenti solvent
differenti solvent various acid dissoci differ degre thus differ strength level solvent sever acid complet dissoci thus strength weak basic solvent less tendenc strong basic one accept proton similar weak acid less tendenc donat proton strong acid result strong acid perchlor acid exhibit strong acid properti weak acid acet acid dissolv weak basic solvent hand acid tend becom indistinguish strength dissolv strong basic solvent owe greater affin strong base proton call level effect strong base level solvent acid weak base differenti solvent acid level effect common solvent studi super acid conduct solvent weak basic sulfur dioxid liquefi soclf

protophil solvent solvent greater tendenc accept proton ie water alcohol liquid ammonia etc
