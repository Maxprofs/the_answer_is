lizards diverse group reptilesthere nearly different lizard species excluding snakes come shapes sizes colors also vary widely many aspects behavior reproduce forage food addition extraordinary diversity physical behavioral characteristics lizards evolved many interesting ways communicate
lizards rely many different sensory systems including visual olfactory auditory systems sensory systems become sophisticated lizards developed different modes communication incorporate sensory systems including visual chemical tactile vocal communication different modes communication well suited different lizard habitatsfor example function well wet habitats others suitable habitats low precipitation modes associates particular physical behavioral traits allow lizards use welldeveloped vision different lizard species unique communication needs evolved fascinating solutions well suited species accommodate needs
communication lizards use itedit
process communication refers transfer information individuals see animal communication additional discussion one individual signaler sends information another individual receiver receiver modifies behavior response information received important note animals communicating vocally many humans arent speaking sentences however mean information transferred
consider moment humans communicate using body language even without speaking gain lot information another person simply observing persons posture behavior physical appearance assess various characteristics decide interact person observed instance might choose avoid person adopts aggressive stance flushed face characteristic someone angry upset alternatively different set postures behaviors indicate person friendly welcoming might choose approach person assessing characteristics
similar scenario body language humans lizards animals gain information individuals around paying attention various characteristics exhibited individuals lizards use many different physical behavioral traits communicate traits vary depending mode communication lizard using
lizards communicateedit
like humans many animals lizards need able communicate variety different scenarios lizards need able communicate members species type communication called intraspecific communication includes communication associated finding appropriate mates called courtship competing resources food habitat lizards may consider subtle variation traits shared members species choosing mates sometimes results particular individuals mating others phenomenon associated sexual selection discussed see sexual selection lizards
many cases lizards also communicating members different species called interspecific communication lizards compete lizard species access resources need ways communicate one another process lizards use interspecific communication predatorprey interactions lizard anolis cristatellus example exhibits predator deterrence communicationa cristatellus perform behavior communicates information lizards physiological condition potential predators lizards better condition may likely outrun predator perform behavior frequently may communicate predator difficult catch thus predator may choose avoid lizards good condition likely outrun choose instead pursue individuals seem good condition case interspecific communication lizard communicating information predator predator modifies behavior response
modes lizard communicationedit
lizards many different communication needs evolved several modes communication accommodate needs modes include visual chemical tactile vocal communication chemical visual communication modes widespread among lizards tactile vibrational modes seem occur handful lizard species species use combination several communication modes others seem rely entirely one visual communication well studied mode lizard communication modern scientific techniques making easier study modes thus may find lizards traditionally thought rely one mode communication may also using another mode
visual communicationedit
many lizards use visual communication lizards use visual communication gather information observing various physical behavioral characteristics lizards somewhat like humans communicating using body language lizards use visual communication often highly developed visual systemsmost see different colors even see uv light many different physical behavioral traits used lizards visual communication obviously designed draw visual attention lizards
sorts traits draw visual attention lizards use visual communication often possess specialized structures used communication structures often incorporate vibrant colors striking patterns accompanied wacky behaviors intended display traits intended draw attention communication many cases structures hidden view except use communicationcolors draw attention lizards may also draw attention unwanted audiences predators competitors thus colors may located flap skin visible lizard extends surface body like belly exposed unless lizard intends common lizards many species anolis lizards dewlaps vibrantly colored throat fans extend behavioral interactions like attracting mates dueling competitors anolis lizards tend fairly well camouflaged apart vibrant dewlap color often go unnoticed extend dewlaps many sceloporous lizard species also hidden colors many sceloporous develop vibrant blue black coloration bellies breeding season color visible lizards unless lizard engages behavior called dorsal ventral flattening lizard flattens body expose colorful parts belly behavioral interactions
lizards use visual communication rely able see lizards visual communication common among species live relatively high population densities frequently come close contact visual communication well suited use many different habitats modified lizards accommodate changing habitat conditions eg long individuals come contact frequently enough
chemical communicationedit
another mode communication used many lizards chemical communication lizards use chemical communication produce chemicals deposit environment pheromones chemicals elicit changes behavior sometimes physiology individuals encounter chemicals contain unique combinations chemical compound ingredients different combinations ingredients provide information individual produced chemical many cases chemical composition differs considerably species allows lizards tell whether lizard deposited chemical member different species even interesting lizard species iberian rocklizards lacerta monticola chemical secretions differ based individual produced chemicals different enough lizards detecting chemicals determine whether individual produced chemical familiar much like human knows whether theyve met person based unique facial characteristics
lizards use chemical communication highly developed olfactory systems essentially give lizards well developed sense smell enable detect chemicals environment several physical behavioral characteristics common among lizards use chemical communication lizards produce chemicals often femoral glands femoral pores back legs chemicals produced inside lizard released via pores lizards use chemical communication often observed drag back legs lower half body surface walking across spreading chemical secretions across area much like might seen dog marking territory another behavior common among lizards use chemical communication tongue flicking similar see snakes lizards use chemical communication stick tongues taste chemicals present air various surfaces rocks logs another lizard might sitting chemicals also deposited feces lizards observed defecate systematically throughout area live suggesting may placing chemicals particular areas marking boundaries territory
one unique aspect chemical communication differentiates modes lizards need come direct contact order communicate using chemicals chemical released onto surface used communication washed away otherwise removed lizards may come contact chemicals placed lizard hours even days depending long chemical lasts environment thus lizards live relatively low population densities come close contact often use chemical communication lizards use chemical communication rely chemicals remaining environment amount time chemical communication usually better suited use dry environments wet environment high chance precipitation might wash away chemical
recent advances ability detect measure compounds present chemicals dramatically increased understanding lizard chemical communication finding many lizards thought rely modes communication also use chemical communication continue analyze composition chemicals find convey wealth information individual produced function many different communication contexts
tactile communicationedit
lizards use tactile communication term tactile means touch lizards use tactile communication either use direct indirect touch form communication species come direct contact one another nudging licking biting bumping another lizard type direct contact may associated courtship ie attracting mate aggressionin many lizards fights escalate direct physical contact biting bumping one another species engage physical conflicts often rely forms communication visual chemical resort physical contact methods deterring potential rivals failed case courtship lizards male komodo dragon varanus komodoensis lick females determine whether sexually receptive direct touch also incorporates chemical communication male detecting different chemicals present females body addition directly touching
also forms tactile communication involve direct touch including vibrational communication come chameleon species communicate one another vibrating substrate standing tree branch leaf animals use vibrational communication exhibit unique adaptations morphology ie body form enable detect vibration use communication include unique adaptations ear jaw morphology give animal direct contact surface standing enable detect subtle vibrations lizards live substrates easily moved thin tree branches leaves probably likely use vibrational communication lizards live substrates transmit vibrations easily ground thick tree trunks
vocal communicationedit
finally lizards communicate using vocalizations mode communication primarily limited nocturnal geckos many produce vocalizations behavioral interactions male competition lizards produce vocalizations observed wild instance lizards vocalize handled heard undisturbed wild possible vocalizations used communication observations behavior natural populations would needed make assertion lizards use vocal communication need produce vocalizations need appropriate auditory system process sounds vocal communication would well suited lizards live habitats make hard see individuals vocal communication may also particularly well suited lizards behave night vocal communication would useful settings used communicate without needing come contact lizards able see
