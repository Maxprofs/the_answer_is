summary darwins theory
darwins theory evolution based key facts inferences drawn biologist ernst mayr summarised follows
every species fertile enough offspring survived reproduce population would grow fact
despite periodic fluctuations populations remain roughly size fact
resources food limited relatively stable time fact
struggle survival ensues inference
individuals population vary significantly one another fact
much variation heritable fact
individuals less suited environment less likely survive less likely reproduce individuals suited environment likely survive likely reproduce leave heritable traits future generations produces process natural selection inference
slowly effected process results populations changing adapt environments ultimately variations accumulate time form new species inference

variation domestication nature
chapter covers animal husbandry plant breeding going back ancient egypt darwin discusses contemporary opinions origins different breeds cultivation argue many produced common ancestors selective breeding illustration artificial selection describes fancy pigeon breeding noting diversity breeds something astonishing yet descended one species rock pigeon darwin saw two distinct kinds variation rare abrupt changes called sports monstrosities example ancon sheep short legs ubiquitous small differences example slightly shorter longer bill pigeons types hereditary changes used breeders however darwin small changes important evolution
chapter ii darwin specifies distinction species varieties arbitrary experts disagreeing changing decisions new forms found concludes wellmarked variety may justly called incipient species species strongly marked permanent varieties argues ubiquity variation nature historians noted naturalists long aware individuals species differed one another generally considered variations limited unimportant deviations archetype species archetype fixed ideal mind god darwin wallace made variation among individuals species central understanding natural world
struggle existence natural selection divergence
chapter iii darwin asks varieties called incipient species become distinct species answer introduces key concept calls natural selection fifth edition adds expression often used mr herbert spencer survival fittest accurate sometimes equally convenient
owing struggle life variation however slight whatever cause proceeding degree profitable individual species infinitely complex relations organic beings external nature tend preservation individual generally inherited offspring called principle slight variation useful preserved term natural selection order mark relation mans power selection
notes p de candolle charles lyell stated organisms exposed severe competition darwin emphasizes used phrase struggle existence large metaphorical sense including dependence one another gives examples ranging plants struggling drought plants competing birds eat fruit disseminate seeds describes struggle resulting population growth doctrine malthus applied manifold force whole animal vegetable kingdoms discusses checks increase including complex ecological interdependencies notes competition severe closely related forms fill nearly place economy nature
chapter iv details natural selection infinitely complex closefitting mutual relations organic beings physical conditions life darwin takes example country change conditions led extinction species immigration others suitable variations occurred descendants species became adapted new conditions remarks artificial selection practised animal breeders frequently produced sharp divergence character breeds suggests natural selection might saying
may asked analogous principle apply nature believe apply efficiently simple circumstance diversified descendants one species become structure constitution habits much better enabled seize many widely diversified places polity nature enabled increase numbers
historians remarked darwin anticipated modern concept ecological niche suggest every favourable variation must selected favoured animals better higher merely adapted surroundings
darwin proposes sexual selection driven competition males mates explain sexually dimorphic features lion manes deer antlers peacock tails bird songs bright plumage male birds analysed sexual selection fully descent man selection relation sex natural selection expected work slowly forming new species given effectiveness artificial selection could see limit amount change beauty infinite complexity coadaptations organic beings one another physical conditions life may effected long course time natures power selection using tree diagram calculations indicates divergence character original species new species genera describes branches falling extinction occurred new branches formed great tree life ever branching beautiful ramifications
variation heredity
darwins time agreedupon model heredity chapter darwin admitted laws governing inheritance quite unknown accepted version inheritance acquired characteristics darwins death came called lamarckism chapter v discusses called effects use disuse wrote thought little doubt use domestic animals strengthens enlarges certain parts disuse diminishes modifications inherited also applied nature darwin stated changes commonly attributed use disuse loss functional wings island dwelling insects might produced natural selection later editions origin darwin expanded role attributed inheritance acquired characteristics darwin also admitted ignorance source inheritable variations speculated might produced environmental factors however one thing clear whatever exact nature causes new variations darwin knew observation experiment breeders able select variations produce huge differences many generations selection observation selection works domestic animals destroyed lack understanding underlying hereditary mechanism
breeding animals plants showed related varieties varying similar ways tending revert ancestral form similar patterns variation distinct species explained darwin demonstrating common descent recounted lord mortons mare apparently demonstrated telegony offspring inheriting characteristics previous mate female parent accepted process increasing variation available natural selection
detail given darwins book variation animals plants domestication tried explain heredity hypothesis pangenesis although darwin privately questioned blending inheritance struggled theoretical difficulty novel individual variations would tend blend population however inherited variation could seen darwins concept selection working population range small variations workable modern evolutionary synthesis model heredity became completely integrated model variation modern evolutionary synthesis dubbed neo darwinian evolution encompasses charles darwins theories evolution gregor mendels theories genetic inheritance
difficulties theory
chapter vi begins saying next three chapters address possible objections theory first often intermediate forms closely related species found though theory implies forms must existed darwin noted firstly species descended species insensibly fine gradations everywhere see innumerable transitional forms nature confusion instead species see well defined darwin attributed competition different forms combined small number individuals intermediate forms often leading extinction forms difficulty referred absence rarity transitional varieties habitat space
another difficulty related first one absence rarity transitional varieties time darwin commented theory natural selection innumerable transitional forms must existed wondered find embedded countless numbers crust earth discussion difficulties see speciationdarwins dilemma bernstein et al michod
rest chapter deals whether natural selection could produce complex specialised structures behaviours use would difficult imagine intermediate forms could functional darwin said
secondly possible animal instance structure habits bat could formed modification animal wholly different habits believe natural selection could produce one hand organs trifling importance tail giraffe serves flyflapper hand organs wonderful structure eye hardly yet fully understand inimitable perfection
answer many cases animals exist intermediate structures functional presented flying squirrels flying lemurs examples bats might evolved nonflying ancestors discussed various simple eyes found invertebrates starting nothing optic nerve coated pigment examples vertebrate eye could evolved darwin concludes could demonstrated complex organ existed could possibly formed numerous successive slight modifications theory would absolutely break find case
chapter vii first edition addresses evolution instincts examples included two investigated experimentally slavemaking ants construction hexagonal cells honey bees darwin noted species slavemaking ants dependent slaves others observed many ant species collect store pupae species food thought reasonable species extreme dependency slave workers evolved incremental steps suggested bees make hexagonal cells evolved steps bees made round cells pressure natural selection economise wax darwin concluded
finally may logical deduction imagination far satisfactory look instincts young cuckoo ejecting fosterbrothers ants making slaves larv ichneumonid feeding within live bodies caterpillars specially endowed created instincts small consequences one general law leading advancement organic beings namely multiply vary let strongest live weakest die
chapter viii addresses idea species special characteristics prevented hybrids fertile order preserve separately created species darwin said far constant difficulty producing hybrids related species viability fertility hybrids varied greatly especially among plants sometimes widely considered separate species produced fertile hybrid offspring freely cases considered mere varieties species could crossed difficulty darwin concluded finally facts briefly given chapter seem opposed even rather support view fundamental distinction species varieties
sixth edition darwin inserted new chapter vii renumbering subsequent chapters respond criticisms earlier editions including objection many features organisms adaptive could produced natural selection said features could byproducts adaptive changes features often features seemed nonadaptive function unknown shown book fertilisation orchids explained elaborate structures facilitated pollination insects much chapter responds george jackson mivarts criticisms including claim features baleen filters whales flatfish eyes one side camouflage stick insects could evolved natural selection intermediate stages would adaptive darwin proposed scenarios incremental evolution feature
geologic record
chapter ix deals fact geologic record appears show forms life suddenly arising without innumerable transitional fossils expected gradual changes darwin borrowed charles lyells argument principles geology record extremely imperfect fossilisation rare occurrence spread vast periods time since areas geologically explored could fragmentary knowledge geological formations fossil collections poor evolved local varieties migrated wider area would seem sudden appearance new species darwin expect able reconstruct evolutionary history continuing discoveries gave well founded hope new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms show enough time natural selection work slowly cited principles geology observations based sedimentation erosion including estimate erosion weald taken million years initial appearance entire groups well developed organisms oldest fossilbearing layers known cambrian explosion posed problem darwin doubt earlier seas swarmed living creatures stated satisfactory explanation lack fossils fossil evidence precambrian life since found extending history life back billions years
chapter x examines whether patterns fossil record better explained common descent branching evolution natural selection individual creation fixed species darwin expected species change slowly rate organisms lingula unchanged since earliest fossils pace natural selection would depend variability change environment distanced theory lamarckian laws inevitable progress argued anticipated punctuated equilibrium hypothesis scholars preferred emphasise darwins commitment gradualism cited richard owens findings earliest members class simple generalised species characteristics intermediate modern forms followed increasingly diverse specialised forms matching branching common descent ancestor patterns extinction matched theory related groups species continued existence extinction reappearing recently extinct species similar living species earlier eras seen south america william clift shown australia fossils recent geological periods resembled species still living area
geographic distribution
chapter xi deals evidence biogeography starting observation differences flora fauna separate regions cannot explained environmental differences alone south america africa australia regions similar climates similar latitudes regions different plants animals species found one area continent closely allied species found regions continent species found continents darwin noted barriers migration played important role differences species different regions coastal sea life atlantic pacific sides central america almost species common even though isthmus panama miles wide explanation combination migration descent modification went say principle inheritance modification understand sections genera whole genera even families confined areas commonly notoriously case darwin explained volcanic island formed hundred miles continent might colonised species continent species would become modified time would still related species found continent darwin observed common pattern darwin discussed ways species could dispersed across oceans colonise islands many investigated experimentally
chapter xii continues discussion biogeography brief discussion freshwater species returns oceanic islands peculiarities example islands roles played mammals continents played animals flightless birds reptiles summary chapters says
think grand leading facts geographical distribution explicable theory migration generally dominant forms life together subsequent modification multiplication new forms thus understand high importance barriers whether land water separate several zoological botanical provinces thus understand localisation subgenera genera families different latitudes instance south america inhabitants plains mountains forests marshes deserts mysterious manner linked together affinity likewise linked extinct beings formerly inhabited continent principles understand endeavoured show oceanic islands inhabitants great number endemic peculiar
classification morphology embryology rudimentary organs
chapter xiii starts observing classification depends species grouped together multilevel system groups sub groups based varying degrees resemblance discussing classification issues darwin concludes
foregoing rules aids difficulties classification explained greatly deceive view natural system founded descent modification characters naturalists consider showing true affinity two species inherited common parent far true classification genealogical community descent hidden bond naturalists unconsciously seeking
darwin discusses morphology including importance homologous structures says curious hand man formed grasping mole digging leg horse paddle porpoise wing bat constructed pattern include bones relative positions notes animals class often extremely similar embryos darwin discusses rudimentary organs wings flightless birds rudiments pelvis leg bones found snakes remarks rudimentary organs teeth baleen whales found embryonic stages
concluding remarks
final chapter reviews points earlier chapters darwin concludes hoping theory might produce revolutionary changes many fields natural history although avoids controversial topic human origins rest book prejudice readers theory ventures cautious hint psychology would put new foundation light thrown origin man darwin ends passage became well known much quoted

structure style
nature structure darwins argument
darwins aims twofold show species separately created show natural selection chief agent change knew readers already familiar concept transmutation species vestiges introduction ridicules work failing provide viable mechanism therefore first four chapters lay case selection nature caused struggle existence analogous selection variations domestication accumulation adaptive variations provides scientifically testable mechanism evolutionary speciation
later chapters provide evidence evolution occurred supporting idea branching adaptive evolution without directly proving selection mechanism darwin presents supporting facts drawn many disciplines showing theory could explain myriad observations many fields natural history inexplicable alternate concept species individually created structure darwins argument showed influence john herschel whose philosophy science maintained mechanism could called vera causa true cause three things could demonstrated existence nature ability produce effects interest ability explain wide range observations
