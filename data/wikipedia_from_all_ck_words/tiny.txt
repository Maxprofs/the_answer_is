3 (three /ri/) is a number numeral and glyph it is the natural number following 2 and preceding 4
== evolution of the glyph ==
three is the largest number still written with as many lines as the number represents (the ancient romans usually wrote 4 as iiii but this was almost entirely replaced by the subtractive notation iv in the middle ages.) to this day 3 is written as three lines in roman and chinese numerals this was the way the brahmin indians wrote it and the gupta made the three lines more curved the nagari started rotating the lines clockwise and ending each line with a slight downward stroke on the right eventually they made these strokes connect with the lines below and evolved it to a character that looks very much like a modern 3 with an extra stroke at the bottom it was the western ghubar arabs who finally eliminated the extra stroke and created our modern 3 (the extra stroke however was very important to the eastern arabs and they made it much larger while rotating the strokes above to lie along a horizontal axis and to this day eastern arabs write a 3 that looks like a mirrored 7 with ridges on its top line)
while the shape of the 3 character has an ascender in most modern typefaces in typefaces with text figures the character usually has a descender as for example in  in some french text-figure typefaces though it has an ascender instead of a descender
=== flat top 3 ===
a common variant of the digit 3 has a flat top similar to the character (ezh) this form is sometimes used to prevent people from fraudulently changing a 3 into an 8 it is usually found on upc-a barcodes and standard 52-card decks

according to pythagoras and the pythagorean school the number 3 which they called triad is the noblest of all digits as it is the only number to equal the sum of all the terms below it and the only number whose sum with those below equals the product of them and itself
three is the second triangular number and it is the only prime triangular number three is the only prime which is one less than a perfect square any other number which is n2 1 for some integer n is not prime since it is (n 1)(n + 1) this is true for 3 as well (with n=2) but in this case the smaller factor is 1 if n is greater than 2 both n 1 and n + 1 are greater than 1 so their product is not prime

vulgar fractions with 3 in the denominator have a single digit repeating sequences in their decimal expansions 0.000... 0.333... 0.666 (see also 0.999... which = 1.)
a natural number is divisible by three if the sum of its digits in base 10 is divisible by 3 for example the number 21 is divisible by three (3 times 7) and the sum of its digits is 2 + 1 = 3 because of this the reverse of any number that is divisible by three (or indeed any permutation of its digits) is also divisible by three for instance 1368 and its reverse 8631 are both divisible by three (and so are 1386 3168 3186 3618 etc.) see also divisibility rule this works in base 10 and in any positional numeral system whose base divided by three leaves a remainder of one (bases 4 7 10 etc.)

there is some evidence to suggest that early man may have used counting systems which consisted of one two three and thereafter many to describe counting limits early peoples had a word to describe the quantities of one two and three but any quantity beyond was simply denoted as many this is most likely based on the prevalence of this phenomena among people in such disparate regions as the deep amazon and borneo jungles where western civilization's explorers have historical records of their first encounters with these indigenous people
