knowledge is a familiarity awareness or understanding of someone or something such as facts information descriptions or skills which is acquired through experience or education by perceiving discovering or learning
knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject it can be implicit (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding of a subject) it can be more or less formal or systematic in philosophy the study of knowledge is called epistemology the philosopher plato famously defined knowledge as justified true belief though well-justified true belief is more complete as it accounts for the gettier problems however several definitions of knowledge and theories to explain it exist
knowledge acquisition involves complex cognitive processes perception communication and reasoning while knowledge is also said to be related to the capacity of acknowledgment in human beings
== theories of knowledge ==
the eventual demarcation of philosophy from science was made possible by the notion that philosophy's core was theory of knowledge, a theory distinct from the sciences because it was their foundation without this idea of a theory of knowledge, it is hard to imagine what philosophy could have been in the age of modern science
the definition of knowledge is a matter of ongoing debate among philosophers in the field of epistemology the classical definition described but not ultimately endorsed by plato specifies that a statement must meet three criteria in order to be considered knowledge it must be justified true and believed some claim that these conditions are not sufficient as gettier case examples allegedly demonstrate there are a number of alternatives proposed including robert nozick's arguments for a requirement that knowledge tracks the truth and simon blackburn's additional requirement that we do not want to say that those who meet any of these conditions through a defect flaw or failure have knowledge richard kirkham suggests that our definition of knowledge requires that the evidence for the belief necessitates its truth
in contrast to this approach ludwig wittgenstein observed following moore's paradox that one can say he believes it but it isn't so, but not he knows it but it isn't so. he goes on to argue that these do not correspond to distinct mental states but rather to distinct ways of talking about conviction what is different here is not the mental state of the speaker but the activity in which they are engaged for example on this account to know that the kettle is boiling is not to be in a particular state of mind but to perform a particular task with the statement that the kettle is boiling wittgenstein sought to bypass the difficulty of definition by looking to the way knowledge is used in natural languages he saw knowledge as a case of a family resemblance following this idea knowledge has been reconstructed as a cluster concept that points out relevant features but that is not adequately captured by any definition
== communicating knowledge ==
symbolic representations can be used to indicate meaning and can be thought of as a dynamic process hence the transfer of the symbolic representation can be viewed as one ascription process whereby knowledge can be transferred other forms of communication include observation and imitation verbal exchange and audio and video recordings philosophers of language and semioticians construct and analyze theories of knowledge transfer or communication
while many would agree that one of the most universal and significant tools for the transfer of knowledge is writing and reading (of many kinds) argument over the usefulness of the written word exists nonetheless with some scholars skeptical of its impact on societies in his collection of essays technopoly neil postman demonstrates the argument against the use of writing through an excerpt from plato's work phaedrus (postman neil (1992) technopoly vintage new york pp 73) in this excerpt the scholar socrates recounts the story of thamus the egyptian king and theuth the inventor of the written word in this story theuth presents his new invention writing to king thamus telling thamus that his new invention will improve both the wisdom and memory of the egyptians (postman neil (1992) technopoly vintage new york pp 74) king thamus is skeptical of this new invention and rejects it as a tool of recollection rather than retained knowledge he argues that the written word will infect the egyptian people with fake knowledge as they will be able to attain facts and stories from an external source and will no longer be forced to mentally retain large quantities of knowledge themselves (postman neil (1992) technopoly vintage new york,pp 74)
classical early modern theories of knowledge especially those advancing the influential empiricism of the philosopher john locke were based implicitly or explicitly on a model of the mind which likened ideas to words this analogy between language and thought laid the foundation for a graphic conception of knowledge in which the mind was treated as a table (a container of content) that had to be stocked with facts reduced to letters numbers or symbols this created a situation in which the spatial alignment of words on the page carried great cognitive weight so much so that educators paid very close attention to the visual structure of information on the page and in notebooks
media theorists like andrew robinson emphasise that the visual depiction of knowledge in the modern world was often seen as being truer than oral knowledge this plays into a longstanding analytic notion in the western intellectual tradition in which verbal communication is generally thought to lend itself to the spread of falsehoods as much as written communication it is harder to preserve records of what was said or who originally said it usually neither the source nor the content can be verified gossip and rumors are examples prevalent in both media as to the value of writing the extent of human knowledge is now so great and the people interested in a piece of knowledge so separated in time and space that writing is considered central to capturing and sharing it
major libraries today can have millions of books of knowledge (in addition to works of fiction) it is only recently that audio and video technology for recording knowledge have become available and the use of these still requires replay equipment and electricity verbal teaching and handing down of knowledge is limited to those who would have contact with the transmitter or someone who could interpret written work writing is still the most available and most universal of all forms of recording and transmitting knowledge it stands unchallenged as mankind's primary technology of knowledge transfer down through the ages and to all cultures and languages of the world
== situated knowledge ==
situated knowledge is knowledge specific to a particular situation it is a term coined by donna haraway as an extension of the feminist approaches of successor science suggested by sandra harding one which offers a more adequate richer better account of a world in order to live in it well and in critical reflexive relation to our own as well as others practices of domination and the unequal parts of privilege and oppression that makes up all positions. this situation partially transforms science into a narrative which arturo escobar explains as neither fictions nor supposed facts. this narrative of situation is historical textures woven of fact and fiction and as escobar explains further even the most neutral scientific domains are narratives in this sense, insisting that rather than a purpose dismissing science as a trivial matter of contingency it is to treat (this narrative) in the most serious way without succumbing to its mystification as the truth or to the ironic skepticism common to many critiques.
haraway's argument stems from the limitations of the human perception as well as the overemphasis of the sense of vision in science according to haraway vision in science has been used to signify a leap out of the marked body and into a conquering gaze from nowhere. this is the gaze that mythically inscribes all the marked bodies that makes the unmarked category claim the power to see and not be seen to represent while escaping representation. this causes a limitation of views in the position of science itself as a potential player in the creation of knowledge resulting in a position of modest witness this is what haraway terms a god trick or the aforementioned representation while escaping representation in order to avoid this haraway perpetuates a tradition of thought which emphasizes the importance of the subject in terms of both ethical and political accountability
some methods of generating knowledge such as trial and error or learning from experience tend to create highly situational knowledge one of the main attributes of the scientific method is that the theories it generates are much less situational than knowledge gained by other methods situational knowledge is often embedded in language culture or traditions this integration of situational knowledge is an allusion to the community and its attempts at collecting subjective perspectives into an embodiment of views from somewhere.
knowledge generated through experience is called knowledge a posteriori meaning afterwards the pure existence of a term like a posteriori means this also has a counterpart in this case that is knowledge a priori meaning before the knowledge prior to any experience means that there are certain assumptions that one takes for granted for example if you are being told about a chair it is clear to you that the chair is in space that it is 3d this knowledge is not knowledge that one can forget even someone suffering from amnesia experiences the world in 3d
even though haraway's arguments are largely based on feminist studies this idea of different worlds as well as the skeptic stance of situated knowledge is present in the main arguments of post-structuralism fundamentally both argue the contingency of knowledge on the presence of history power and geography as well as the rejection of universal rules or laws or elementary structures and the idea of power as an inherited trait of objectification
== partial knowledge ==
one discipline of epistemology focuses on partial knowledge in most cases it is not possible to understand an information domain exhaustively our knowledge is always incomplete or partial most real problems have to be solved by taking advantage of a partial understanding of the problem context and problem data unlike the typical math problems one might solve at school where all data is given and one is given a complete understanding of formulas necessary to solve them
this idea is also present in the concept of bounded rationality which assumes that in real life situations people often have a limited amount of information and make decisions accordingly
intuition is the ability to acquire partial knowledge without inference or the use of reason an individual may know about a situation and be unable to explain the process that led to their knowledge
== scientific knowledge ==
the development of the scientific method has made a significant contribution to how knowledge of the physical world and its phenomena is acquired to be termed scientific a method of inquiry must be based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning and experimentation the scientific method consists of the collection of data through observation and experimentation and the formulation and testing of hypotheses science and the nature of scientific knowledge have also become the subject of philosophy as science itself has developed knowledge has developed a broader usage which has been developing within biology/psychologydiscussed elsewhere as meta-epistemology or genetic epistemology and to some extent related to theory of cognitive development note that epistemology is the study of knowledge and how it is acquired science is the process used everyday to logically complete thoughts through inference of facts determined by calculated experiments. sir francis bacon was critical in the historical development of the scientific method his works established and popularized an inductive methodology for scientific inquiry his famous aphorism knowledge is power is found in the meditations sacrae (1597)
until recent times at least in the western tradition it was simply taken for granted that knowledge was something possessed only by humans and probably adult humans at that sometimes the notion might stretch to (ii) society-as-such as in (e.g.) the knowledge possessed by the coptic culture (as opposed to its individual members) but that was not assured either nor was it usual to consider unconscious knowledge in any systematic way until this approach was popularized by freud
other biological domains where knowledge might be said to reside include (iii) the immune system and (iv) in the dna of the genetic code see the list of four epistemological domains popper (1975) and traill (2008 table s page 31)also references by both to niels jerne
such considerations seem to call for a separate definition of knowledge to cover the biological systems for biologists knowledge must be usefully available to the system though that system need not be conscious thus the criteria seem to be
the system should apparently be dynamic and self-organizing (unlike a mere book on its own)
the knowledge must constitute some sort of representation of the outside world or ways of dealing with it (directly or indirectly)
some way must exist for the system to access this information quickly enough for it to be useful
scientific knowledge may not involve a claim to certainty maintaining skepticism means that a scientist will never be absolutely certain when they are correct and when they are not it is thus an irony of proper scientific method that one must doubt even when correct in the hopes that this practice will lead to greater convergence on the truth in general
== religious meaning of knowledge ==
in many expressions of christianity such as catholicism and anglicanism knowledge is one of the seven gifts of the holy spirit
the old testament's tree of the knowledge of good and evil contained the knowledge that separated man from god and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil... (genesis 3:22)
in gnosticism divine knowledge or gnosis is hoped to be attained
(vidya daan) i.e knowledge sharing is a major part of daan a tenet of all dharmic religions hindu scriptures present two kinds of knowledge paroksh gyan and prataksh gyan paroksh gyan (also spelled paroksha-jnana) is secondhand knowledge knowledge obtained from books hearsay etc prataksh gyan (also spelled prataksha-jnana) is the knowledge borne of direct experience i.e. knowledge that one discovers for oneself jnana yoga ("path of knowledge") is one of three main types of yoga expounded by krishna in the bhagavad gita (it is compared and contrasted with bhakti yoga and karma yoga.)
in islam knowledge (arabic  ilm) is given great significance the knowing (al-alm) is one of the 99 names reflecting distinct attributes of god the qur'an asserts that knowledge comes from god (2:239) and various hadith encourage the acquisition of knowledge muhammad is reported to have said seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave and verily the men of knowledge are the inheritors of the prophets islamic scholars theologians and jurists are often given the title alim meaning knowledgable
in jewish tradition knowledge (hebrew da'ath) is considered one of the most valuable traits a person can acquire observant jews recite three times a day in the amidah favor us with knowledge understanding and discretion that come from you exalted are you existent-one the gracious giver of knowledge. the tanakh states a wise man gains power and a man of knowledge maintains power and knowledge is chosen above gold
=== as a measure of religiosity (in sociology of religion) ===
according to the sociologist mervin verbit knowledge may be understood as one of the key components of religiosity religious knowledge itself may be broken down into four dimensions
content
frequency
intensity
centrality
the content of one's religious knowledge may vary from person to person as will the degree to which it may occupy the person's mind (frequency) the intensity of the knowledge and the centrality of the information (in that religious tradition or to that individual)
