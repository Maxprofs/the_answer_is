human development is the process of growing to maturity in biological terms this entails growth from a one-celled zygote to an adult human being
== biological development ==
=== general aspects ===
fertilization occurs when the sperm successfully enters the ovum's membrane the genetical material of the sperm and egg that combine to form a single cell called a zygote and the germinal stage of prenatal development commences the germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization through the development of the early embryo up until implantation the germinal stage is over at about 10 days of gestation
the zygote contains a full complement of genetic material and develops into the embryo briefly embryonic developments have four stages the morula stage the bastula stage the gastrula stage and the neurula stage prior to implantation the embryo remains in a protein shell the zona pellucida and undergoes a series of cell divisions called mitosis a week after fertilization the embryo still has not grown in size but hatches from the zona pellucida and adheres to the lining of the mother's uterus this induces a decidual reaction wherein the uterine cells proliferate and surround the embryo thus causing it to become embedded within the uterine tissue the embryo meanwhile proliferates and develops both into embryonic and extra-embryonic tissue the latter forming the fetal membranes and the placenta in humans the embryo is referred to as a fetus in the later stages of prenatal development the transition from embryo to fetus is arbitrarily defined as occurring 8 weeks after fertilization in comparison to the embryo the fetus has more recognizable external features and a set of progressively developing internal organs a nearly identical process occurs in other species
=== physical stages ===
the following are some approximate age ranges for physical development stages
prenatal (sperm fertilizes egg - birth)
embryo - fertilization - 8 weeks after fertilization)
zygote the single cell stage which occurs after fertilization
blastocyst the stage prior to implantation when the embryo is a hollow sphere
post-implantation embryo the period 1 8 weeks after fertilization (3 to 10 weeks gestation)
fetus (10th week of pregnancy - birth)
childhood/juvenile (childbirth)(0 - 19)
neonate (newborn) (0 28 days)
infant (baby) (0 month - 12 months)
toddler (1 3 years)
play age (3 5 years)
primary school age (middle childhood also called prepubescence) (3 - 11)
elementary school age (5 - 11)
preadolescence (the child in this and the previous phase are called schoolchild (schoolboy or schoolgirl) when still of primary school age.) (9 11 years)
adolescence (12 19 years)
peripuberty (8-10 until 15-17)
adulthood (20+ years)
young adulthood (20 39 years)
middle adulthood (40 60 years)
elder/senior citizen (60+ years)
death (unpredictable)
decomposition (breakdown of the body after death)
also sometimes used are terms that specify one's age in numbers such as
baby (0)
toddler (1 - 2)
preschooler (3 - 4)
main childhood (5 - 9)
pre-teenager (10-12)
teenager (13-19)
twentysomething (20-29)
thirtysomething (30-39)
fortysomething (40-49)
fiftysomething (50-59)
sixtysomething (60-69)
seventysomething (70-79)
eightysomething (80-89)
ninetysomething (90-99)
centenarian (100-109)
supercentenarian (110+)
the tanner stages can be used to approximately judge a child's age based on physical development
