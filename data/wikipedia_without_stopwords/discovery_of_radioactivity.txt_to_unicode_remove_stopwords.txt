phosphorescence specific type photoluminescence related fluorescence unlike fluorescence phosphorescent material immediately reemit radiation absorbs slower time scales reemission associated forbidden energy state transitions quantum mechanics transitions occur slowly certain materials absorbed radiation may reemitted lower intensity several hours original excitation
commonly seen examples phosphorescent materials glowinthedark toys paint clock dials glow time charged bright light normal reading room light typically glowing slowly fades within minutes hours dark room
study phosphorescent materials led discovery radioactivity
ironically white phosphorus phosphorescence takes name actually exhibit property rather chemiluminescence

simpleedit
simple terms phosphorescence process energy absorbed substance released relatively slowly form light cases mechanism used glowinthedark materials charged exposure light unlike relatively swift reactions fluorescence seen common fluorescent tube phosphorescent materials store absorbed energy longer time processes required reemit energy occur less often
quantum mechanicaledit
photoluminescent events chemical substrate absorbs reemits photon light fast order nanoseconds light absorbed emitted fast time scales cases energy photons involved matches available energy states allowed transitions substrate special case phosphorescence absorbed photon energy undergoes unusual intersystem crossing energy state higher spin multiplicity see term symbol usually triplet state result energy become trapped triplet state forbidden transitions available return lower energy state transitions although forbidden still occur quantum mechanics kinetically unfavored thus progress significantly slower time scales phosphorescent compounds still relatively fast emitters triplet lifetimes order milliseconds however compounds triplet lifetimes minutes even hours allowing substances effectively store light energy form slowly degrading excited electron states phosphorescent quantum yield high substances release significant amounts light long time scales creating socalled glowinthedark materials
equationedit
singlet triplet whose subscripts denote states ground state excited state transitions also occur higher energy levels first excited state denoted simplicity
chemiluminescenceedit
examples glowinthedark materials glow phosphorescence example glow sticks glow due chemiluminescent process commonly mistaken phosphorescence chemiluminescence excited state created via chemical reaction light emission tracks kinetic progress underlying chemical reaction excited state transfer dye molecule also known sensitizer fluorophor subsequently fluoresce back ground state
