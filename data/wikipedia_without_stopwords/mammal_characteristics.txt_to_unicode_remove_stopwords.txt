evolution
many nontherapsid eupelycosaurs dominant land animals latest carboniferous end early permian epoch ophiacodontids common appearance late carboniferous pennsylvanian early permian became progressively smaller early permian progressed edaphosaurids along caseids dominant herbivores early part permian ranging size pig size rhinoceros renowned edaphosaurid edaphosaurus large footlong m herbivore sail back probably used thermoregulation mating sphenacodontids family carnivorous eupelycosaurs included famous dimetrodon sometimes mistaken dinosaur largest predator period like edaphosaurus dimetrodon also distinctive sail back probably served purpose regulating heat varanopid family passingly resembled todays monitor lizards may lifestyle
therapsids descended clade closely related sphenacodontids became succeeding dominant land animals rest permian latter part triassic therapsids gave rise first true mammals nontherapsid pelycosaurs well many life forms became extinct end permian period
