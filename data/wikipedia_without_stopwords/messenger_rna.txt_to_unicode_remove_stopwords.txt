synthesis processing functionedit
brief existence mrna molecule begins transcription ultimately ends degradation life mrna molecule may also processed edited transported prior translation eukaryotic mrna molecules often require extensive processing transport prokaryotic molecules
transcriptionedit
transcription rna made dna transcription rna polymerase makes copy gene dna mrna needed process similar eukaryotes prokaryotes one notable difference however eukaryotic rna polymerase associates mrnaprocessing enzymes transcription processing proceed quickly start transcription shortlived unprocessed partially processed product termed precursor mrna premrna completely processed termed mature mrna
eukaryotic premrna processingedit
processing mrna differs greatly among eukaryotes bacteria archea noneukaryotic mrna essence mature upon transcription requires processing except rare cases eukaryotic premrna however requires extensive processing
cap additionedit
cap also termed rna cap rna methylguanosine cap rna mg cap modified guanine nucleotide added front end eukaryotic messenger rna shortly start transcription cap consists terminal methylguanosine residue linked triphosphate bond first transcribed nucleotide presence critical recognition ribosome protection rnases
