method initial rates
order reaction reactant estimated variation initial rate concentration reactant using natural logarithm typical rate equation
example initial rate measured series experiments different initial concentrations reactant concentrations b c kept constant
slope graph function corresponds order x respect reactant
however method always reliable
measurement initial rate requires accurate determination small changes concentration short times compared reaction halflife sensitive errors
rate equation completely determined rate also depends substances present beginning reaction intermediates products
integral method
tentative rate equation determined method initial rates therefore normally verified comparing concentrations measured longer time several halflives integrated form rate equation
