lactic acid fermentation biological process glucose sixcarbon sugars also disaccharides sixcarbon sugars eg sucrose lactose converted onto cellular energy metabolite lactate anaerobic fermentation reaction occurs bacteria animal cells muscle cells
oxygen present cell many organisms bypass fermentation undergo cellular respiration however facultative anaerobic organisms ferment undergo respiration presence oxygen sometimes even oxygen present aerobic metabolism happening mitochondria pyruvate building faster metabolized fermentation happen anyway
lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes interconversion pyruvate lactate concomitant interconversion nadh nad
homolactic fermentation one molecule glucose ultimately converted two molecules lactic acid heterolactic fermentation contrast yields carbon dioxide ethanol addition lactic acid process called phosphoketolase pathway
applicationsedit
lactic acid fermentation used many areas world produce foods cannot produced methods commercially important genus lactic acidfermenting bacteria lactobacillus though bacteria even yeast sometimes used two common applications lactic acid fermentation production yogurt sauerkraut
kimchiedit
kimchi also uses lactic acid fermentation
sauerkrautedit
lactic acid fermentation also used production sauerkraut main type bacteria used production sauerkraut genus leuconostoc
yogurt acidity rises due lactic acidfermenting organisms many pathogenic microorganisms killed bacteria produce lactic acid well simple alcohols hydrocarbons may combine form esters contributing unique flavor sauerkraut
sour beeredit
lactic acid component production sour beers including lambics berliner weisses
yogurtedit
main method producing yogurt lactic acid fermentation milk harmless bacteria primary bacteria used typically lactobacillus bulgaricus streptococcus thermophilus us law requires yogurts contain two cultures though others may added probiotic cultures bacteria produce lactic acid milk culture decreasing ph causing congeal bacteria also produce compounds give yogurt distinctive flavor additional effect lowered ph incompatibility acidic environment many types harmful bacteria
probiotic yogurt additional types bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus also added culture
