dance is a performance art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement this movement has aesthetic and symbolic value and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture dance can be categorized and described by its choreography by its repertoire of movements or by its historical period or place of origin
an important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance although these two categories are not always completely separate both may have special functions whether social ceremonial competitive erotic martial or sacred/liturgical others disciplines of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality including martial arts gymnastics figure skating synchronized swimming and many other forms of athletics
== performance and participationedit ==
theatrical dance also called performance or concert dance is intended primarily as a spectacle usually a performance upon a stage by virtuoso dancers it often tells a story perhaps using mime costume and scenery or else it may simply interpret the musical accompaniment which is often specially composed examples are western ballet and modern dance classical indian dance and chinese and japanese song and dance dramas most classical forms are centred upon dance alone but performance dance may also appear in opera and other forms of musical theatre
participatory dance on the other hand whether it be a folk dance a social dance a group dance such as a line circle chain or square dance or a partner dance such as is common in western western ballroom dancing is undertaken primarily for a common purpose such as social interaction or exercise of participants rather than onlookers such dance seldom has any narrative a group dance and a corps de ballet a social partner dance and a pas de deux differ profoundly even a solo dance may be undertaken solely for the satisfaction of the dancer participatory dancers often all employ the same movements and steps but for example in the rave culture of electronic dance music vast crowds may engage in free dance uncoordinated with those around them on the other hand some cultures lay down strict rules as to the particular dances in which for example men women and children may or must participate
