history
original methods used cladistic analysis school taxonomy derived work german entomologist willi hennig referred phylogenetic systematics also title book terms cladistics clade popularized researchers cladistics original sense refers particular set methods used phylogenetic analysis although sometimes used refer whole field
called cladistic method appeared early work peter chalmers mitchell birds subsequently robert john tillyard insects w zimmermann plants term clade introduced julian huxley coined lucien cunot cladogenesis cladistic cain harrison cladist adherent hennigs school mayr cladistics hennig referred approach phylogenetic systematics time original formulation end cladistics competed analytical philosophical approach phylogenetic inference phenetics socalled evolutionary taxonomy phenetics championed time numerical taxonomists peter sneath robert sokal evolutionary taxonomist ernst mayr
originally conceived essence willi hennig book published cladistics flourish translation english lewin today cladistics popular method constructing phylogenies morphological data also molecular unlike phenetics cladistics specifically aimed reconstructing evolutionary histories
development effective polymerase chain reaction techniques allowed application cladistic methods biochemical molecular genetic traits organisms well anatomical ones vastly expanding amount data available phylogenetics time cladistics rapidly became dominant set methods phylogenetics evolutionary biology computers made possible process large quantities data organisms characteristics
way computational phylogenetics paved phenetics set methods commonly used degree later phenetics try reconstruct phylogenetic trees rather tried build dendrograms similarity data algorithms required less computer power phylogenetic ones
methodology
cladistic method interprets character state transformation implied distribution shared character states among taxa terminals potential piece evidence grouping outcome cladistic analysis cladogram treeshaped diagram dendrogram interpreted represent best hypothesis phylogenetic relationships although traditionally cladograms generated largely basis morphological characters originally calculated hand genetic sequencing data computational phylogenetics commonly used phylogenetic analyses parsimony criterion abandoned many phylogeneticists favor sophisticated less parsimonious evolutionary models character state transformation cladists contend models unjustified
every cladogram based particular dataset analyzed particular method datasets tables consisting molecular morphological ethological andor characters list operational taxonomic units otus may genes individuals populations species larger taxa presumed monophyletic therefore form together one large clade phylogenetic analysis infers branching pattern within clade different datasets different methods mention violations mentioned assumptions often result different cladograms scientific investigation show likely correct
recently example cladograms like following generally accepted accurate representations ancestral relations among turtles lizards crocodilians birds
phylogenetic hypothesis correct last common ancestor turtles birds branch near lived earlier last common ancestor lizards birds near molecular evidence however produces cladograms like
accurate last common ancestor turtles birds lived later last common ancestor lizards birds since cladograms provide competing accounts real events one correct
cladogram right represents current universally accepted hypothesis primates including strepsirrhines like lemurs lorises common ancestor whose descendants primates form clade name primates therefore recognized clade within primates anthropoids monkeys apes humans hypothesized common ancestor whose descendants anthropoids form clade called anthropoidea prosimians hand form paraphyletic taxon name prosimii used phylogenetic nomenclature names clades prosimians instead divided clades strepsirhini haplorhini latter contains tarsiiformes anthropoidea
terminology character states
following terms coined hennig used identify shared distinct character states among groups
plesiomorphy close form ancestral state character state taxon retained ancestors two taxa nested within share plesiomorphy symplesiomorphy syn together symplesiomorphies mean taxa exhibit character state necessarily closely related example reptilia traditionally characterized among things coldblooded ie maintaining constant high body temperature whereas birds warmblooded since coldbloodedness plesiomorphy inherited common ancestor traditional reptiles birds thus symplesiomorphy turtles snakes crocodiles among others mean turtles snakes crocodiles form clade excludes birds
apomorphy separate form derived state innovation thus used diagnose clade even help define clade name phylogenetic nomenclature features derived individual taxa single species group represented single terminal given phylogenetic analysis called autapomorphies auto self autapomorphies express nothing relationships among groups clades identified defined synapomorphies syn together example possession digits homologous homo sapiens synapomorphy within vertebrates tetrapods singled consisting first vertebrate digits homologous homo sapiens together descendants vertebrate apomorphybased phylogenetic definition importantly snakes tetrapods digits nonetheless tetrapods characters amniotic eggs diapsid skulls indicate descended ancestors possessed digits homologous
character state homoplastic instance homoplasy shared two organisms absent common ancestor later ancestor lineage leading one organisms therefore inferred evolved convergence reversal mammals birds able maintain high constant body temperature ie warmblooded however accepted cladogram explaining significant features indicates common ancestor group lacking character state state must evolved independently two clades warmbloodedness separately synapomorphy mammals larger clade birds larger clade synapomorphy group including clades hennigs auxiliary principle states shared character states considered evidence grouping unless contradicted weight evidence thus homoplasy feature among members group may inferred phylogenetic hypothesis group established
terms plesiomorphy apomorphy relative application depends position group within tree example trying decide whether tetrapods form clade important question whether four limbs synapomorphy earliest taxa included within tetrapoda earliest members tetrapoda inherit four limbs common ancestor whereas vertebrates least homologously contrast group within tetrapods birds four limbs plesiomorphy using two terms allows greater precision discussion homology particular allowing clear expression hierarchical relationships among different homologous features
difficult decide whether character state fact thus classified synapomorphy may identify monophyletic group whether appears thus homoplasy cannot identify group danger circular reasoning assumptions shape phylogenetic tree used justify decisions character states used evidence shape tree phylogenetics uses various forms parsimony decide questions conclusions reached often depend dataset methods nature empirical science reason cladists refer cladograms hypotheses relationship cladograms supported large number variety different kinds characters viewed robust based limited evidence
terminology taxa
mono para polyphyletic taxa understood based shape tree done well based character states compared table
criticism
cladistics either generally specific applications criticized beginnings decisions whether particular character states homologous precondition synapomorphies challenged involving circular reasoning subjective judgements transformed cladistics arose late attempt resolve problems removing phylogeny cladistic analysis however remained unpopular
however homology usually determined analysis results evaluated homology measures mainly ci consistency index ri retention index claimed makes process objective also homology equated synapomorphy patterson done
disciplines biology
comparisons used acquire data cladograms based limited field biology group individuals classes hypothesized common ancestor set common characteristics may may apply compared pairwise cladograms used depict hypothetical descent relationships within groups items many different academic realms requirement items characteristics identified measured
anthropology archaeology cladistic methods used reconstruct development cultures artifacts using groups cultural traits artifact features
comparative mythology folktale use cladistic methods reconstruct protoversion many myths mythological phylogenies constructed mythemes clearly support low horizontal transmissions borrowings historical sometimes palaeolithic diffusions punctuated evolution also powerful way test hypotheses crosscultural relationships among folktales
literature cladistic methods used classification surviving manuscripts canterbury tales manuscripts sanskrit charaka samhita
historical linguistics cladistic methods used reconstruct phylogeny languages using linguistic features similar traditional comparative method historical linguistics explicit use parsimony allows much faster analysis large datasets computational phylogenetics
textual criticism stemmatics cladistic methods used reconstruct phylogeny manuscripts work reconstruct lost original using distinctive copying errors apomorphies differs traditional historicalcomparative linguistics enabling editor evaluate place genetic relationship large groups manuscripts large numbers variants would impossible handle manually also enables parsimony analysis contaminated traditions transmission would impossible evaluate manually reasonable period time
astrophysics infers history relationships galaxies create branching diagram hypotheses galaxy diversification
