singledisplacement reaction also named singlereplacement reaction type oxidationreduction chemical reaction element ion moves one compound another one element replaced another compound represented general reaction scheme
often occur reactive b
b must either
different metals hydrogens behavior cation renders metal case c represents anion
halogens case c represents cation
either case ac bc aqueous compounds usually case c spectator ion
activity reactivity series metals highest propensity donate electrons react listed first unreactive metals listed last therefore metal higher list able displace anything list order activity metals reactive least reactive li k sr na ca mg al zn cr fe cd co ni sn pb h sb bi cu hg ag pd pt au similarly halogens highest propensity acquire electrons reactive activity series halogens highest lowest f cl br
due free state nature b single displacement reactions also oxidationreduction reactions key event movement electrons one reactant another b metals always oxidized b always reduced since halogens prefer gain electrons reduced b oxidized b represent elements
b may different charge ions therefore balancing equation may necessary example reaction silver nitrate agno contains ag ion zinc zn forms silver ag zinc nitrate znno contains zn ion
agnoaq zns ags znnoaq
simple metal acid reactions single displacement reactions example reaction magnesium mg hydrochloric acid hcl forms magnesium chloride mgcl hydrogen h
mgs hclaq mgclaq hg
cation replacement
one cation replaces another cation positively charged ion metal written generic symbols written like
x yz xz y
element x replaced y compound yz become new compound xz free element y oxidationreduction reaction wherein element y reduced cation elemental form element x oxidized elemental form cation
examples
cu agno ag cuno
fe cuno feno cu
ca ho caoh h
zn hcl zncl h
note reactant elemental form reactive metal reaction occur examples would reverse reactions
ag cuno reaction
au hcl reaction
anion replacement
one anion replaces another anion negatively charged ion nonmetal written using generic symbol
xy xa y
element replaced y compound xy form new compound xa free element y oxidationreduction reaction wherein element reduced elemental form anion element y oxidized anion elemental form
examples involve halogens shown
cl nabr nacl br
br ki kbr
less reactive halogen cannot replace reactive halogen
