model atom composed electrons thomson still called corpuscles though g j stoney proposed atoms electricity called electrons surrounded soup positive charge balance electrons negative charges like negatively charged plums surrounded positively charged pudding electrons know today thought positioned throughout atom many structures possible positioning multiple electrons particularly rotating rings electrons see instead soup atom also sometimes said cloud positive charge model thomson abandoned earlier nebular atom hypothesis atom composed immaterial vortices least part atom composed thomsons particulate negative corpuscles although rest positively charged part atom remained somewhat nebulous illdefined
thomson model disproved gold foil experiment hans geiger ernest marsden interpreted ernest rutherford imply small nucleus atom containing high positive charge case gold enough balance electrons thus leading rutherford model atom although gold atomic number immediately rutherfords paper appeared antonius van den broek made intuitive suggestion atomic number nuclear charge matter required experiment decide henry moseleys work showed experimentally see moseleys law effective nuclear charge close atomic number moseley found one unit difference moseley referenced papers van den broek rutherford work culminated solarsystemlike quantumlimited bohr model atom year nucleus containing atomic number positive charge surrounded equal number electrons orbital shells bohr also inspired moseleys work
thomsons model compared though thomson british dessert called plum pudding hence name thomsons paper published march edition philosophical magazine leading british science journal day thomsons view
atoms elements consist number negatively electrified corpuscles enclosed sphere uniform positive electrification
model electrons free rotate within blob cloud positive substance orbits stabilized model fact electron moved farther center positive cloud felt larger net positive inward force material opposite charge inside orbit see gausss law thomsons model electrons free rotate rings stabilized interactions electrons spectra accounted energy differences different ring orbits thomson attempted make model account major spectral lines known elements notably successful still thomsons model along similar saturnian ring model atomic electrons also put forward nagaoka james clerk maxwells model saturns rings earlier harbingers later successful solarsystemlike bohr model atom
