sporophyte sprofat diploid multicellular stage life cycle plant alga develops zygote produced haploid egg cell fertilized haploid sperm sporophyte cell therefore double set chromosomes one set parent land plants multicellular algae life cycles multicellular diploid sporophyte phase alternates multicellular haploid gametophyte phase seed plants gymnosperms flowering plants angiosperms sporophyte phase prominent gametophyte familiar green plant roots stem leaves cones flowers flowering plants gametophytes reduced size represented pollen embryo sac
sporophyte produces spores hence name meiosis process also known reduction division reduces number chromosomes spore mother cell half resulting meiospores develop gametophyte spores resulting gametophyte haploid meaning one set chromosomes mature gametophyte produces male female gametes mitosis fusion male female gametes produces diploid zygote develops new sporophyte cycle known alternation generations alternation phases
bryophytes mosses liverworts hornworts dominant gametophyte phase adult sporophyte dependent nutrition embryo sporophyte develops cell division zygote within female sex organ archegonium early development therefore nurtured gametophyte embryonurturing feature life cycle common land plants known collectively embryophytes
algae dominant gametophyte generations species gametophytes sporophytes morphologically similar isomorphic independent sporophyte dominant form clubmosses horsetails ferns gymnosperms angiosperms flowering plants survived present day early land plants sporophytes produced identical spores isosporous homosporous ancestors gymnosperms evolved complex heterosporous life cycles spores producing male female gametophytes different sizes female megaspores tending larger fewer number male microspores
