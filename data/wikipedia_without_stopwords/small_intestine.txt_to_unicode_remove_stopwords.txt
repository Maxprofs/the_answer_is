small intestine small bowel part gastrointestinal tract stomach large intestine much digestion absorption food takes place small intestine three distinct regions duodenum jejunum ileum receives bile pancreatic juice pancreatic duct controlled sphincter oddi primary function small intestine absorption nutrients minerals food
article primarily human gastrointestinal tract information processes directly applicable placental mammals major exception digestive process ruminants notably cows invertebrates worms term large intestine often used describe entire gastrointestinal tract
structure
average length small intestine adult human male m ft m ft adult female vary greatly short m ft long m ft recent studies indicate small intestine may shorter around m ft length less affected age childhood expected
approximately cm diameter surface area human small intestinal mucosa averages square meters
small intestine divided three structural parts duodenum short structure cm long continuous stomach shaped like c surrounds head pancreas receives gastric chyme stomach together digestive juices pancreas digestive enzymes gall bladder bile digestive enzymes break proteins bile emulsify fats micelles duodenum contains brunners glands produce mucusrich alkaline secretion containing bicarbonate secretions combination bicarbonate pancreas neutralizes stomach acids contained gastric chyme
jejunum midsection small intestine connecting duodenum ileum m long contains plicae circulares villi increase surface area products digestion sugars amino acids fatty acids absorbed bloodstream suspensory muscle duodenum marks division duodenum jejunum
ileum final section small intestine m long contains villi similar jejunum absorbs mainly vitamin b bile acids well remaining nutrients ileum joins cecum large intestine ileocecal junction
jejunum ileum suspended abdominal cavity mesentery mesentery part peritoneum arteries veins lymph vessels nerves travel within mesentery
small intestine receives blood supply coeliac trunk superior mesenteric artery branches aorta duodenum receives blood coeliac trunk via superior pancreaticoduodenal artery superior mesenteric artery visa inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery two arteries anterior posterior branches meet midline anastaomose jejunum ileum receive blood superior mesenteric artery branches superior mesenteric artery form series arches within mesentery known arterial arcades may several layers deep straight blood vessels known vasa recta travel arcades closest ileum jejunum organs
histology
three sections small intestine look similar microscopic level important differences parts intestine follows
development
small intestine develops midgut primitive gut tube fifth week embryological life ileum begins grow longer fast rate forming ushaped fold called primary intestinal loop loop grows fast length outgrows abdomen protrudes umbilicus week loop retracts back abdomen weeks six ten small intestine rotates anticlockwise viewed front embryo rotates degrees moved back abdomen process creates twisted shape large intestine
function
food stomach allowed duodenum pylorus muscle called pyloric sphincter
digestion
small intestine chemical digestion takes place many digestive enzymes act small intestine secreted pancreas enter small intestine via pancreatic duct pancreatic enzymes bile gallbladder enter small intestine response hormone cholecystokinin produced small intestine response presence nutrients secretin another hormone produced small intestine causes additional effects pancreas promotes release bicarbonate duodenum order neutralize potentially harmful acid coming stomach
three major classes nutrients undergo digestion proteins lipids fats carbohydrates
proteins degraded small peptides amino acids absorption chemical breakdown begins stomach continues small intestine proteolytic enzymes including trypsin chymotrypsin secreted pancreas cleave proteins smaller peptides carboxypeptidase pancreatic brush border enzyme splits one amino acid time aminopeptidase dipeptidase free end amino acid products
lipids fats degraded fatty acids glycerol pancreatic lipase breaks triglycerides free fatty acids monoglycerides pancreatic lipase works help salts bile secreted liver stored gall bladder bile salts attach triglycerides help emulsify aids access pancreatic lipase occurs lipase watersoluble fatty triglycerides hydrophobic tend orient towards away watery intestinal surroundings bile salts emulsify triglycerides watery surroundings lipase break smaller components able enter villi absorption
carbohydrates degraded simple sugars monosaccharides eg glucose pancreatic amylase breaks carbohydrates notably starch oligosaccharides carbohydrates pass undigested large intestine handling intestinal bacteria brush border enzymes take important brush border enzymes dextrinase glucoamylase break oligosaccharides brush border enzymes maltase sucrase lactase lactase absent adult humans lactose like polysaccharides digested small intestine carbohydrates cellulose digested despite made multiple glucose units cellulose made betaglucose making intermonosaccharidal bindings different ones present starch consists alphaglucose humans lack enzyme splitting betaglucosebonds something reserved herbivores bacteria large intestine
absorption
digested food able pass blood vessels wall intestine either diffusion active transport small intestine site nutrients ingested food absorbed inner wall mucosa small intestine lined simple columnar epithelial tissue structurally mucosa covered wrinkles folds called plicae circulares considered permanent features wall organ distinct rugae considered nonpermanent temporary allowing distention contraction plicae circulares project microscopic fingerlike pieces tissue called villi latin shaggy hair individual epithelial cells also fingerlike projections known microvilli functions plicae circulares villi microvilli increase amount surface area available absorption nutrients limit loss said nutrients intestinal fauna
villus network capillaries fine lymphatic vessels called lacteals close surface epithelial cells villi transport nutrients lumen intestine capillaries amino acids carbohydrates lacteals lipids absorbed substances transported via blood vessels different organs body used build complex substances proteins required body material remains undigested unabsorbed passes large intestine
absorption majority nutrients takes place jejunum following notable exceptions
iron absorbed duodenum
vitamin b bile salts absorbed terminal ileum
water lipids absorbed passive diffusion throughout small intestine
sodium bicarbonate absorbed active transport glucose amino acid cotransport
fructose absorbed facilitated diffusion
immunological
small intestine supports bodys immune system presence probiotic gut flora appear contribute positively hosts immune system
clinical significance
small intestine complex organ large number possible conditions may affect function small bowel listed common people affected time lives others vanishingly rare
animals
small intestine found tetrapods also teleosts although form length vary enormously species teleosts relatively short typically around one half times length fishs body commonly number pyloric caeca small pouchlike structures along length help increase overall surface area organ digesting food ileocaecal valve teleosts boundary small intestine rectum marked end digestive epitheliu
tetrapods ileocaecal valve always present opening colon length small intestine typically longer tetrapods teleosts especially herbivores well mammals birds higher metabolic rate amphibians reptiles lining small intestine includes microscopic folds increase surface area vertebrates mammals develop true villi
boundaries duodenum jejunum ileum somewhat vague even humans distinctions either ignored discussing anatomy animals essentially arbitrary
small intestine nonteleost fish sharks sturgeons lungfish instead digestive part gut forms spiral intestine connecting stomach rectum type gut intestine relatively straight long fold running along inner surface spiral fashion sometimes dozens turns valve greatly increases surface area effective length intestine lining spiral intestine similar small intestine teleosts nonmammalian tetrapods
lampreys spiral valve extremely small possibly diet requires little digestion hagfish spiral valve digestion occurring almost entire length intestine subdivided different regions
