lactose is a disaccharide sugar derived from galactose and glucose that is found in milk lactose makes up around 28% of milk (by weight) although the amount varies among species and individuals and milk with a reduced amount of lactose also exists it is extracted from sweet or sour whey the name comes from lac or lactis the latin word for milk plus the -ose ending used to name sugars it has a formula of c12h22o11 and the hydrate formula c1211h2o making it an isomer of sucrose
== historyedit ==
the first crude isolation of lactose by italian physician fabrizio bartoletti (15761630) was published in 1633 in 1700 the venetian pharmacist lodovico testi (16401707) published a booklet of testimonials to the power of milk sugar (saccharum lactis) to relieve among other ailments the symptoms of arthritis in 1715 testi's procedure for making milk sugar was published by antonio vallisneri lactose was identified as a sugar in 1780 by carl wilhelm scheele
in 1812 heinrich vogel (1778-1867) recognized that glucose was a product of hydrolyzing lactose in 1856 louis pasteur crystallized the other component of lactose galactose by 1894 emil fischer had established the configurations of the component sugars
lactose was named by the french chemist jean baptiste andr dumas (1800-1884) in 1843
== structure and reactionsedit ==
lactose is a disaccharide derived from the condensation of galactose and glucose which form a -14 glycosidic linkage its systematic name is -d-galactopyranosyl-(14)-d-glucose the glucose can be in either the -pyranose form or the -pyranose form whereas the galactose can only have the -pyranose form hence -lactose and -lactose refer to the anomeric form of the glucopyranose ring alone
lactose is hydrolysed to glucose and galactose isomerised in alkaline solution to lactulose and catalytically hydrogenated to the corresponding polyhydric alcohol lactitol
lactose monohydrate crystals have a characteristic tomahawk shape that can be observed with a light microscope

several million tons are produced annually as a by-product of the dairy industry whey is made of up 6.5% solids of which 4.8% is lactose that may be purified by crystallisation whey or milk plasma is the liquid remaining after milk is curdled and strained for example in the production of cheese lactose makes up about 28% of milk by weight industrially lactose is produced from whey permeate that is whey filtrated for all major proteins the protein fraction is used in infant nutrition and sport nutrition while the permeate can be evaporated to 6065% solids and crystallized while cooling  lactose can also be precipitated from whey using ethanol since it is insoluble in ethanol lactose precipitates in about 65% yield

infant mammals nurse on their mothers to drink milk which is rich in lactose the intestinal villi secrete the enzyme called lactase (-d-galactosidase) to digest it this enzyme cleaves the lactose molecule into its two subunits the simple sugars glucose and galactose which can be absorbed since lactose occurs mostly in milk in most mammals the production of lactase gradually decreases with maturity due to a lack of continuing consumption
many people with ancestry in europe west asia south asia the sahel belt in west africa east africa and a few other parts of central africa maintain lactase production into adulthood in many of these areas milk from mammals such as cattle goats and sheep is used as a large source of food hence it was in these regions that genes for lifelong lactase production first evolved the genes of adult lactose tolerance have evolved independently in various ethnic groups by descent more than 70% of western europeans can drink milk as adults compared with less than 30% of people from areas of africa eastern and south-eastern asia and oceania in people who are lactose intolerant lactose is not broken down and provides food for gas-producing gut flora which can lead to diarrhea bloating flatulence and other gastrointestinal symptoms
== applicationsedit ==
food industry applications have markedly increased since the 1960s for example its bland flavor has lent to its use as a carrier and stabiliser of aromas and pharmaceutical products lactose is not added directly to many foods because its solubility is less than that of other sugars commonly used in food infant formula is a notable exception where the addition of lactose is necessary to match the composition of human milk
lactose is not fermented by most yeast during brewing which may be used to advantage for example lactose may be used to sweeten stout beer the resulting beer is usually called a milk stout or a cream stout
yeast belonging to the genus kluyveromyces have a unique industrial application as they are capable of fermenting lactose for ethanol production surplus lactose from the whey by-product of dairy operations is a potential source of alternative energy
another major use of lactose is in the pharmaceutical industry lactose is added to pills as a filler because of its physical properties i.e. compressibility and low price for similar reasons it can be used to dilute heroin
