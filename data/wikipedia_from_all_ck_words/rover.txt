insight is a robotic mars lander planned for launch in march 2016 the name is a backronym for interior exploration using seismic investigations geodesy and heat transport
the mission's objective is to place a stationary lander equipped with a seismometer and heat transfer probe on the surface of mars to study its early geological evolution this would bring new understanding of the solar system's terrestrial planets mercury venus earth mars and earths moon by reusing technology from the mars phoenix lander which successfully landed on mars in 2008 it is expected that the cost and risk will be reduced
insight was initially known as gems (geophysical monitoring station) but its name was changed in early 2012 at the request of nasa out of 28 proposals from 2010 it was one of the three discovery program finalists receiving us$3 million in may 2011 to develop a detailed concept study in august 2012 insight was selected for development and launch managed by nasas jet propulsion laboratory (jpl) with participation from scientists from several countries the mission is cost-capped at us$425 million not including launch vehicle funding on 19 may 2014 nasa announced that construction of the lander began later on 27 may 2015 nasa announced that testing of the lander began
== objectives ==
insight will place a single stationary lander on mars to study its deep interior and address a fundamental issue of planetary and solar system science understanding the processes that shaped the rocky planets of the inner solar system (including earth) more than four billion years ago
insight's primary objective is to study the earliest evolutionary history of the processes that shaped mars by studying the size thickness density and overall structure of mars core mantle and crust as well as the rate at which heat escapes from the planet's interior insight will provide a glimpse into the evolutionary processes of all of the rocky planets in the inner solar system the rocky inner planets share a common ancestry that begins with a process called accretion as the body increases in size its interior heats up and evolves to become a terrestrial planet containing a core mantle and crust despite this common ancestry each of the terrestrial planets is later shaped and molded through a poorly understood process called differentiation insight mission's goal is to improve understanding of this process and by extension terrestrial evolution by measuring the planetary building blocks shaped by differentiation a terrestrial planet's core mantle and crust
the mission will determine if there is any seismic activity measure the amount of heat flow from the interior estimate the size of mars core and whether the core is liquid or solid this data would be the first of its kind on mars the mission's secondary objective is to conduct an in-depth study of geophysics tectonic activity and the effect of meteorite impacts on mars which could provide knowledge about such processes on earth crust thickness mantle velocity core radius and density and seismic activity should experience a measured accuracy increase on the order 3x to 10x compared to current data
in terms of fundamental processes shaping planetary formation mars contains the most in-depth and accurate historical record because it is big enough to have undergone the earliest accretion and internal heating processes that shaped the terrestrial planets but small enough to have retained signs of those processes
== design ==
the mission further develops design heritage from the 2008 phoenix mars lander because insight is planned to be powered by a photovoltaic system it would land near the equator to enable a projected lifetime of 2 years (or 1 mars year)
=== specifications ===
mass
350 kg (770 lb)
dimensions
about 5.5 m (18 ft) long with the solar panels deployed the science deck is about 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in diameter
power
power is generated by two round photovoltaic arrays each 2.15 m (7.1 ft) in diameter and consisting of solaero ztj triple-junction solar cells made of ingap/ingaas/ge arranged on orbital atk ultraflex arrays after touchdown on the martian surface the arrays are deployed by opening up like a folding fan
cubesats
the mars cube one (marco) spacecraft a set of two 6u cubesats will piggyback with the insight mission to help relay communications during the probe's entry descent and landing phase the two 6u cubesats named marco a and b are identical they measure 30 cm 20 cm 10 cm (11.8 in 7.9 in 3.9 in) and will fly as a pair for redundancy they will fly by mars during the entry descent and landing (edl) phase of the insight mission and relay insight's telemetry in real time marco is a technology capability demonstration of communications relay system
== scientific payload ==
insight's science payload will consist of two main instruments
the seismic experiment for interior structure (seis) will take precise measurements of quakes and other internal activity on mars to better understand the planet's history and structure it will also investigate how the martian crust and mantle respond to the effects of meteorite impacts which gives clues to the planet's inner structure seis is provided by the french space agency (cnes) with the participation of the institut de physique du globe de paris (ipgp) the swiss federal institute of technology (eth) the max planck institute for solar system research (mps) imperial college institut suprieur de l'aronautique et de l'espace (isae) and jpl the seismometer is a sensitive broad-band instrument designed to detect sources including atmospheric excitation and tidal forces from phobos
the heat flow and physical properties package (hp3) instrument provided by the german space agency (dlr) is a self-penetrating heat flow probe nicknamed the mole also called a self-hammering nail it is being designed to burrow up to 5 m (16 ft) below the surface to measure how much heat is coming from mars core and thus help reveal the planet's thermal history it trails a tether containing precise temperature sensors every 10 cm (3.9 in) to measure the temperature profile of the subsurface
additionally the rotation and interior structure experiment (rise) led by the jet propulsion laboratory (jpl) will use the lander's x-band radio to provide precise measurements of planetary rotation to better understand the inside of mars x-band radio tracking capable of an accuracy under 2 cm will build on previous viking program and mars pathfinder data the previous data sets allowed the core size to be constrained but with a third data set from insight the nutation amplitude can be determined once spin axis direction precession and nutation amplitudes are better understood it should be possible to calculate the size and density of the martian core and mantle this would increase the understanding on the formation of terrestrial planets (e.g earth) and rocky exoplanets
wind and temperature sensors as well as a high-resolution (10 mpa) pressure sensor from spain's centro de astrobiologa will monitor weather at the landing site
a magnetometer will measure magnetic disturbances caused by the martian ionosphere
a camera mounted on the lander's arm can capture black and white images of the instruments on the lander's deck and a 3-d view of the ground where the seismometer and heat flow probe will be placed it will then be used to help engineers and scientists guide the deployment of the instruments to the ground with a 45-degree field of view the camera will also provide a panoramic view of the terrain surrounding the landing site a second similar camera with a wide-angle 120-degree field of view lens will be mounted under the edge of the lander's deck and will provide a complementary view of the instrument deployment area
a color camera was also considered but there is a lack of funding for this item an electromagnetic sounder to provide data on crustal thickness ground water and on the mantle lithosphere was considered as well technology to clean dust off the solar panels was considered for mars exploration rover's development in the years since their development others have proposed ways of cleaning off panels the effects of martian surface dust on solar cells was studied in the 1990s by the materials adherence experiment on mars pathfinder insight may represent possible piggy-back opportunity for metnet it may also be a chance to capitalize on previously funded technology development such as the urey mars organic and oxidant detector and mars organic molecule analyzer  in 2014 a color camera was considered to be a possibility if certain criteria for the mission is met such as being on schedule
== launch ==
the launch is being managed by nasa's launch services program the launch is scheduled for 4 march 2016 and will be on an atlas v 401 (4 meter fairing/zero (0) solid rocket boosters/single (1) engine centaur (sec)) from vandenberg air force base in california usa this is the first american interplanetary mission to launch from california
== landing site ==
as insight's science goals are not related to any particular surface of mars potential landing sites were chosen on the basis of practicality candidate sites needed to be near the equator of mars to provide sufficient sunlight for the solar panels year round have a low elevation to allow for sufficient atmospheric braking during edl flat relatively rock-free to reduce the probability of complications during landing and soft enough terrain to allow the heat flow probe to penetrate well into the ground an optimal area that meets all these requirements is elysium planitia so all 22 initial potential landing sites were located in this area the only two other areas on the equator and at low elevation isidis planitia and valles marineris are too rocky in addition valles marineris has too steep a gradient to allow safe landing
in september 2013 the initial 22 potential landing sites were narrowed to 4 the mars reconnaissance orbiter will then be used to gain more information on each of the 4 potential sites before a final decision is made each site consists of a landing ellipse that measures about 130 km (81 miles) long by 27 km (17 miles) wide
