the umbra penumbra and antumbra are three distinct parts of a shadow created by any light source after impinging on an opaque object for a point source only the umbra is cast
these names are most often used for the shadows cast by celestial bodies though they are sometimes used to describe levels of darkness such as in sunspots
== umbraedit ==
the umbra (latin for shadow") is the innermost and darkest part of a shadow where the light source is completely blocked by the occluding body an observer in the umbra experiences a total eclipse the umbra of a round body occluding a round light source forms a right circular cone to a viewer at the cone's apex the two bodies are equal i-=00980yy0,dyusdm rtysrm yserymertymsetymseryaem6ma347man apparent size the distance from the moon to the apex of its umbra is roughly equal to that between the moon and earth because the earth is 3.7 times wider than the moon its umbra extends correspondingly farther roughly 1.4 million kilometers
== penumbraedit ==
the penumbra (from the latin paene almost nearly and umbra shadow") is the region in which only a portion of the light source is obscured by the occluding body an observer in the penumbra experiences a partial eclipse an alternative definition is that the penumbra is the region where some or all of the light source is obscured (i.e. the umbra is a subset of the penumbra) for example nasa's navigation and ancillary information facility defines that a body in the umbra is also within the penumbra
== antumbraedit ==
the antumbra (from latin ante before") is the region from which the occluding body appears entirely contained within the disc of the light source an observer in this region experiences an annular eclipse in which a bright ring is visible around the eclipsing body if the observer moves closer to the light source the apparent size of the occluding body increases until it causes a full umbra
