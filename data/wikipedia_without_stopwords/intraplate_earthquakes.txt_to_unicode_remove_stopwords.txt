intraplate earthquake occurs interior tectonic plate whereas interplate earthquake one occurs plate boundary
intraplate earthquakes relatively rare interplate earthquakes occur plate boundaries common nonetheless large intraplate earthquakes inflict heavy damage particularly areas accustomed earthquakes buildings usually seismically retrofitted examples damaging intraplate earthquakes devastating gujarat earthquake indian ocean earthquakes earthquakes new madrid missouri earthquake charleston south carolina
fault zones within tectonic plates
surface earth made seven primary eight secondary tectonic plates plus dozens tertiary microplates large plates move slowly owing convection currents within mantle crust move direction plates often directly collide move laterally along tectonic environment makes earthquakes frequent relatively earthquakes occur intraplate environments occur faults near plate margins definition intraplate earthquakes occur near plate boundaries along faults normally stable interior plates earthquakes often occur location ancient failed rifts old structures may present weakness crust easily slip accommodate regional tectonic strain
compared earthquakes near plate boundaries intraplate earthquakes well understood hazards associated may difficult quantify
historic examples
historic examples intraplate earthquakes include mineral virginia estimated magnitude new madrid estimated magnitude high boston cape ann earthquake estimated magnitude earthquakes felt new york city quakes estimated magnitude charleston earthquake south carolina estimated magnitude charleston quake particularly surprising unlike boston new york area almost history even minor earthquakes
large intraplate earthquake devastated region gujarat india earthquake occurred far plate boundaries meant region epicenter unprepared earthquakes particular kutch district suffered tremendous damage death toll total death toll higher
causes
many cities live seismic risk rare large intraplate earthquake cause earthquakes often uncertain many cases causative fault deeply buried sometimes cannot even found circumstances difficult calculate exact seismic hazard given city especially one earthquake historical times progress made understanding fault mechanics driving earthquakes
prediction
scientists continue search causes earthquakes especially indication often recur best success come detailed microseismic monitoring involving dense arrays seismometers manner small earthquakes associated causative fault located great accuracy cases line patterns consistent faulting cryoseisms sometimes mistaken intraplate earthquakes
