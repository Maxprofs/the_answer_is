iberian ribbed newt spanish ribbed newt pleurodeles waltl newt endemic central southern iberian peninsula morocco known sharp ribs puncture sides also called sharpribbed newt
description
iberian ribbed newt tubercles running side sharp ribs puncture ribs act defense mechanism causing little harm newt mechanism could considered primitive rudimentary system inoculation completely harmless humans time pushing ribs newt begins secrete poison special glands body poison coated ribs create highly effective stinging mechanism injecting toxins thin skin predators mouths newts effective immune system collagen coated ribs mean pierced skin quickly regrows without infection
wild amphibian grows cm rarely cm captivity color dark gray dorsally lighter gray ventral side rustcolored small spots ribs protrude newt flat spadeshaped head long tail half body length males slender usually smaller females larvae bushy external gills usually paler color patterns adults
p waltl aquaticdwelling many european tailed amphibians though quite able walk land rarely leave water living usually ponds cisterns ancient village wells common portugal spain past prefer cool quiet deep waters feed insects worms tadpoles
sex determination
sex determination regulated sex chromosomes overridden temperature females sex chromosomes z w males two copies z chromosome zz however zw larvae reared c f particular stages development stage stage differentiate functional neomales hormones play important role sex determination process newts manipulated change sex adding hormones hormoneinhibitors water reared
aromatase estrogensynthesizing enzyme acts steroid hormone plays key role sex determination many nonmammalian vertebrates including iberian ribbed newt found higher levels gonadmesonephros complexes zw larvae zz counterparts although heattreated zw larvae increase occurs near final stages sex determined temperature stage
conservation
iucn listed iberian ribbed newt near threatened since red list received listing wild populations appear significant decline due widespread habitat loss effects invasive species thus making species close qualifying vulnerable previously species listed least concern lowest ranking species generally threatened loss aquatic habitats drainage agrochemical pollution impacts livestock north african dayas eutrophication domestic industrial contamination golf courses infrastructure development largely disappeared coastal areas iberia morocco close concentrations tourism highly populated areas madrids outskirts introduced fish largemouth bass crayfish procambarus clarkii known prey eggs larvae species implicated decline mortality roads reported serious threat populations
space experiments
pleurodeles waltl studied space least six missions first iberian ribbed newts space may board bion ten newts shared journey two rhesus macaques ten rats otherwise crewless soviet kosmos satellite bion also carried newts board bion
p waltl research continued later frenchled experiments mir space station mir cassiope expedition followup studies mir pgase expedition mir perseus expedition fotonm also carried iberian ribbed newt
newts chosen good model organism study microgravity good model organism females ability retain live sperm cloaca five months allowing inseminated earth later space fertilisation induced hormonal stimulation another advantage species development slow key stages ontogenesis observed oocyte swimming tailbud embryos larvae
studies looked newts ability regenerate faster space overall two times fast early stages well stages development reproduction space
ground studies hypergravity g p waltl fertilisation also conducted well fertility spaceborn newts arrived back earth fertile without problems
amphibian species travel space include newt species lissotriton vulgaris cynops pyrrhogaster african clawed frog japanese tree frog rana pipiens rana catesbeiana rana temporaria
