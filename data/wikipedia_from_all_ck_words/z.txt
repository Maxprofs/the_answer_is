z (named zed /zd/ or zee /zi/) is the 26th and final letter of the modern english alphabet and the iso basic latin alphabet
== name and pronunciationedit ==
in most english-speaking countries including britain canada india ireland and australia the letter's name is zed /zd/ reflecting its derivation from the greek zeta (this dates to latin which borrowed x y and z from greek along with their names) but in american english its name is zee /zi/ analogous to the names for b c d etc. and deriving from a late 17th century english dialectal form
another english dialectal form is izzard /zrd/ it dates from the mid-18th century and probably derives from occitan izda or the french zed whose reconstructed latin form would be *idzta perhaps a popular form with a prosthetic vowel
other languages spell the letter's name in a similar way zeta in italian basque spanish and icelandic (no longer part of its alphabet but found in personal names) zta in swedish zt in danish zet in dutch polish romanian and czech zett in german (capitalised as noun) zett in norwegian zde in french z in portuguese and zt in vietnamese several languages render it as /ts/ or /dz/ e.g zeta /tset/ or /tset/ in finnish in standard chinese pinyin the name of the letter z is pronounced [ts] although the english zed and zee have become very common
== historyedit ==
=== semiticedit ===
the semitic symbol was the seventh letter named zayin which possibly meant weapon it represented either the sound /z/ as in english and french or possibly more like /dz/ (as in italian zeta zero)
=== greekedit ===
the greek form of z was a close copy of the phoenician zen () and the greek inscriptional form remained in this shape throughout ancient times the greeks called it zeta a new name made in imitation of eta () and theta ()
in earlier greek of athens and northwest greece the letter seems to have represented /dz/ in attic from the 4th century bc onwards it seems to have stood for /zd/ and /dz/ and in fact there is no consensus concerning this issue in other dialects as elean and cretan the symbol seems to have been used for sounds resembling the english voiced and voiceless th (ipa // and // respectively) in the common dialect (koine) that succeeded the older dialects became /z/ as it remains in modern greek
=== etruscanedit ===
the etruscan letter z was derived from the phoenician alphabet most probably through the greek alphabet used in the island of ischia in etruscan this letter may have represented /ts/
=== latinedit ===
the letter z was part of the earliest form of the latin alphabet adopted from etruscan because the sound /z/ in latin changed to /r/ by rhotacism in the fifth century bc z was dropped and its place given to the new letter g in the 1st century bc z was introduced again at the end of the latin alphabet to represent the sound of the greek zeta /dz/ as the letter y was introduced to represent the sound of the greek upsilon /y/
before the reintroduction of z the sound of zeta was written s at the beginning of words and ss in the middle of words as in sna for belt and trapessita for banker
in vulgar latin orthography z represented a sound likely an affricate formed by the merging of the reflexes of classical latin /j/ /dj/ and /gj/ for example zanuariu for ianuariu january ziaconus for diaconus deacon and oze for hodie today likewise /di/ sometimes replaced /z/ in words like baptidiare for baptizare to baptize in modern italian z represents /ts/ or /dz/ whereas the reflexes of ianuarius and hodie are written with the letter g (representing /d/ when before i and e) gennaio oggi in other languages like spanish further evolution of the sound occurred
=== early englishedit ===
early english used s alone for both the unvoiced and the voiced sibilant the latin sound imported through french was new and was not written with z but with g or i the successive changes can be well seen in the double forms from the same original jealous and zealous both of these come from a late latin zelosus derived from the imported greek zlos the earlier form is jealous its initial sound is the [d] which developed to modern french [] john wycliffe wrote the word as gelows or ielous
z at the end of a word was pronounced ts as in english assets from old french asez enough (modern french assez) from vulgar latin ad satis ("to sufficiency")
=== last letter of the alphabetedit ===
in earlier times the english alphabets used by children terminated not with z but with & or related typographic symbols [1] in her 1859 novel adam bede george eliot refers to z being followed by & when her character jacob storey says he thought it [z] had only been put to finish off th alphabet like though ampusand would ha done as well for what he could see.
some latin based alphabets have extra letters such as the icelandic finnish and swedish making the last one or in case of the danish and norwegian alphabets in the german alphabet the umlauts ("/ / and /") and the letter  are regarded as modifications of the vowels a/o/u respectively and of the letter s, not as independent letters so they come after the unmodified letters in the alphabetical order the german alphabet ends with z
== variant and derived formsedit ==
a glyph variant of z originating in the medieval gothic minuscules and the early modern blackletter typefaces is the tailed z (german geschwnztes z also z mit unterschlinge) in some antiqua typefaces this letter is present as a standalone letter or in ligatures ligated with long s () it is part of the origin of the eszett () in the german alphabet
unicode assigns codepoints u+2128 black-letter capital z (html &#8488;) and u+1d537 fraktur small z (html &#120119;) in the letterlike symbols and mathematical alphanumeric symbols ranges respectively
there is also a variant with a stroke
== use in writing systemsedit ==
=== englishedit ===
in modern english orthography the letter z usually represents the sound /z/
it represents // in words like seizure more often this sound appears as su or si in words such as measure decision etc in all these words // developed from earlier /zj/ by yod-coalescence
few words in the basic english vocabulary begin with z though it occurs in words beginning with other letters it is the most rarely used letter in written english it is more common in american english than in british english due to the endings -ize vs -ise and -ization vs -isation where the american spelling is derived from greek and the british from french z is more common in the oxford spelling of british english as this variant prefers the more etymologically correct -ize endings to -ise endings -yse is preferred over -yze in oxford spelling though as it is closer to the original greek roots of words like analyse one native germanic english word that contains z freeze (past froze participle frozen') came to be spelled that way by convention even though it could have been spelled with s (as with choose chose chosen')
z is used in writing to represent the act of sleeping (sometimes as zzz or zzzz') it is used because closed-mouth human snoring often sounds like the pronunciation of this letter
=== other languagesedit ===
z stands for a voiced alveolar or voiced dental sibilant /z/ in albanian breton czech dutch french hungarian latvian lithuanian romanian serbo-croatian slovak and the international phonetic alphabet it stands for /ts/ in chinese pinyin finnish (occurs in loanwords only) and german and it likewise expressed /ts/ in old norse in italian it represents two phonemes /ts/ and /dz/ castilian spanish uses the letter to represent // (as english th in thing') though in other dialects (latin american andalusian) this sound has merged with /s/ in portuguese it stands for /z/ in most cases but also for /s/ or // (depending on the regional variant) at the end of syllables in basque it represents the sound /s/
in danish norwegian and swedish z usually stands for the sound /s/ and thus shares the value of s it normally occurs only in loanwords that are spelt with z in the source languages there is no minimal pair differentiated only by s and z
the letter z on its own represents /z/ in the polish language it is also used in four of the seven officially recognized digraphs cz (/t/) dz (/dz/ or /ts/) rz (// or // sometimes it represents a sequence /rz/) and sz (//) and is the most frequently used of the consonants in that language (other slavic languages avoid digraphs and mark the corresponding phonemes with the hek (caron) accent     this system has its origin in czech orthography of the hussite period.) two more polish digraphs include z with diacritical marks as accent and dot d (/d/ or /t/) and d (/d/ or /t/) z can also appear alone with diacritical marks namely or  similarly hungarian uses z in the digraphs sz (expressing /s/ as opposed to the value of s which is ) and zs (expressing )
among non-european languages that have adopted the latin alphabet z usually stands for [z] such as in azerbaijani igbo indonesian shona swahili tatar turkish turkmen and zulu z represents [dz] in northern sami and inari sami
in the kunrei-shiki and hepburn romanisations of japanese z stands for a phoneme whose allophones include [z] and [dz]
