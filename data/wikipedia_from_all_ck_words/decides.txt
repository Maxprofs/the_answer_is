endosperm is a tissue produced inside the seeds of most of the flowering plants around the time of fertilization it surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition in the form of starch though it can also contain oils and protein this can make endosperm a source of nutrition in human diet for example wheat endosperm is ground into flour for bread (the rest of the grain is included as well in whole wheat flour) while barley endosperm is the main source for beer production other examples of endosperm that forms the bulk of the edible portion are coconut meat and coconut water and corn some plants like the orchid lack endosperm in their seeds
== origin of endosperm ==
ancestral flowering plants have seeds that have small embryos and abundant endosperm and the evolutionary development of flowering plants tends to show a trend towards plants with mature seeds with little or no endosperm in more derived flowering plants the embryo occupies most of the seed and the endosperm is non developed or consumed before the seed matures
=== double fertilization ===
endosperm is formed when the two sperm nuclei inside a pollen grain reach the interior of an embryo sac or female gametophyte one sperm nucleus fertilizes the egg forming a zygote while the other sperm nucleus usually fuses with the two polar nuclei at the center of the embryo sac forming a primary endosperm cell (its nucleus is often called the triple fusion nucleus).that cell created in the process of double fertilization develops into the endosperm because it is formed by a separate fertilization the endosperm constitutes an organism separate from the growing embryo
about 70% of angiosperm species have endosperm cells that are polyploid these are typically triploid (containing three sets of chromosomes) but can vary widely from diploid (2n) to 15n
one species of flowering plant nuphar polysepala has endosperm that is diploid resulting from the fusion of a pollen nucleus with one rather than two maternal nuclei it is believed that early in the development of angiosperm lineages there was a duplication in this mode of reproduction producing seven-celled/eight-nucleate female gametophytes and triploid endosperms with a 2:1 maternal to paternal genome ratio
=== endosperm formation ===
there are three types of endosperm development
nuclear endosperm formation - where repeated free-nuclear divisions take place if a cell wall is formed it will form after free-nuclear divisions commonly referred to as liquid endosperm coconut water is an example of this
cellular endosperm formation - where a cell-wall formation is coincident with nuclear divisions coconut meat is cellular endosperm acoraceae has cellular endosperm development while other monocots are helobial
helobial endosperm formation - where a cell wall is laid down between the first two nuclei after which one half develops endosperm along the cellular pattern and the other half along the nuclear pattern
== evolutionary origins ==
the evolutionary origins of double fertilization and endosperm are unclear attracting researcher attention for over a century of research there are the two major hypothesis
the double fertilization initially used to produce two identical independent embryos ("twins") later these embryos acquired different roles one growing into mature organism and another merely supporting it hence the early endosperm was probably diploid same as another embryo some gymnosperms such as ephedra_(genus) may produce twin embryos by double fertilization any of these two embryos are capable of filling in the seed but normally only one develops further (the other eventually aborts) also most basal angiosperms still contain the four-cell embryo sac and produce diploid endosperms
endosperm is the evolutionary remnant of the actual gametophyte similar to the complex multicelular gametophytes found in gymnosperms in this case acquisition of the additional nucleus from the sperm cell is a later evolutionary step this nucleus may provide the parental (not only maternal) organism with some control over endosperm development becoming triploid or polyploid are later evolutionary steps of this primary gametophyte nonflowering seed plants (conifers cycads ginkgo ephedra) form a large homozygous female gametophyte to nourish the embryo within a seed
== the role of endosperm in seed development ==
in some groups (e.g grains of the family poaceae) the endosperm persists to the mature seed stage as a storage tissue in which case the seeds are called albuminous or endospermous and in others it is absorbed during embryo development (e.g. most members of the family fabaceae including the common bean phaseolus vulgaris) in which case the seeds are called exalbuminous or cotyledonous and the function of storage tissue is performed by enlarged cotyledons ("seed leaves") in certain species (e.g corn zea mays) the storage function is distributed between both endosperm and the embryo some mature endosperm tissues store fats (e.g castor bean ricinis communis) and others (including grains such as wheat and corn) store mainly starches
the dust-like seeds of orchids have no endosperm orchid seedlings are mycoheterotrophic in their early development in some other species such as coffee the endosperm also does not develop instead the nucellus produces a nutritive tissue termed perisperm the endosperm of some species is responsible for seed dormancy endosperm also mediates the transfer of nutrients from the mother plant to the embryo it acts as a location for gene imprinting and is responsible for aborting seeds produced from genetically mismatched parents in angiosperms the endosperm contain hormones such as cytokinins which regulate cellular differentiation and embryonic organ formation
== cereal grains ==
cereal crops are grown for their palatable fruit (grains or caryopses) which are primarily endosperm in the caryopsis the thin fruit wall is fused to the seed coat therefore the nutritious part of the grain is the seed and its endosperm in some cases (e.g wheat rice) the endosperm is selectively retained in food processing (commonly called white flour) and the embryo (germ) and seed coat (bran) removed endosperm thus has an important role within the human diet worldwide
the aleurone is a maternal tissue that is retained as part of the seed in many small grains the aleurone functions for both storage and digestion during germination it secretes the amylase enzyme that breaks down endosperm starch into sugars to nourish the growing seedling
