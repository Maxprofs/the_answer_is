in the classic style of stories where the action consists of a hero fighting a villain/enemy the two may be regarded as protagonist and antagonist respectively however the villain of the story is not always the same as the antagonist as some narratives cast the villain in the protagonist role with the opposing hero as the antagonist
an antagonist also may represent a threat or obstacle to the main character by its existence and not necessarily targeting him or her in a deliberate manner
examples in both film and theater include sauron the main antagonist in the lord of the rings who constantly battles the series protagonists and tybalt an antagonist in romeo and juliet who slays mercutio and whose later death results in the exiling of one of the play's protagonists romeo in stories a convention of antagonists is that their moral choices are less savory than those of protagonists this is often used by an author to create conflict within a story however this is merely a convention and the reversal of this can be seen in the character macduff from macbeth who is arguably morally correct in his desire to fight the tyrant macbeth
