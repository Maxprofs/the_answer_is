the ngstrm (swedish [strm]) or angstrom is a unit of length equal to 69901000000000000001010 m (one ten-billionth of a metre) or 69901000000000000000.1 nm its symbol is  a letter in the scandinavian alphabets
the natural sciences and technology often use ngstrm to express sizes of atoms molecules microscopic biological structures and lengths of chemical bonds arrangement of atoms in crystals wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation and dimensions of integrated circuit parts atoms of phosphorus sulfur and chlorine are 1 in covalent radius while a hydrogen atom is 0.5  see atomic radius
the unit is named after the swedish physicist anders jonas ngstrm (1814-1874) the symbol is always written with a ring diacritic as the letter in the swedish alphabet the unit's name is often written in english without the diacritics but the official definitions contain diacritics
== useedit ==
the ngstrm is used extensively in crystallography solid-state physics and chemistry as a unit for d-spacings (the distance between atomic planes in a crystal) cell parameters inter-atomic distances and x-ray wavelengths as these values are often in the 1-10 range for example the inorganic crystal structure database presents all these values using the ngstrm
== historyedit ==
anders jonas ngstrm was a pioneer in the field of spectroscopy and is also known for his studies of astrophysics heat transfer terrestrial magnetism and the aurora borealis
in 1852 ngstrm formulated in optiska underskningar in english translation optical researches a law of absorption later modified somewhat and known as kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation
in 1868 ngstrm created a chart of the spectrum of solar radiation that expressed the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum in multiples of one ten-millionth of a millimetre (or 6990100000000000000107 mm.) since the human eye is sensitive to wavelengths from about 70034000000000000004000 to 70037000000000000007000  what we commonly call visible light that unit supported sufficiently accurate measurements of visible wavelengths without resorting to fractional numbers the unit then spread to other sciences that deal with atomic-scale structures
though intended to correspond to 69901000000000000001010 metres for precise spectral analysis the ngstrm had to be defined more accurately than the metre which until 1960 was still defined based on the length of a bar of metal held in paris the use of metal bars had been involved in an early error in the value of the ngstrm of about one part in 6000 ngstrm took the precaution of having the standard bar he used checked against a standard in paris but the metrologist henri tresca reported it to be so much shorter than it really was that ngstrm's corrected results were more in error than the uncorrected ones
in 1907 the international astronomical union defined the international ngstrm by declaring the wavelength of the red line of cadmium in air equal to 6438.46963 international ngstrms and this definition was endorsed by the international bureau of weights and measures in 1927 from 1927 to 1960 the ngstrm remained a secondary unit of length for use in spectroscopy defined separately from the metre in 1960 the metre itself was redefined in spectroscopic terms and then the ngstrm was redefined as being exactly 0.1 nanometres
the ngstrm is internationally recognized but is not a formal part of the international system of units (si) the closest si unit is the nanometre (6991100000000000000109 m) the international committee for weights and measures officially discourages its use and it is not included in the european union's catalogue of units of measure that may be used within its internal market

unicode includes the formal symbol at u+212b angstrom sign (html &#8491;) however the ngstrm sign is also normalized into u+00c5 latin capital letter a with ring above (html &#197 &aring;)
before computers the ngstrm (or ngstrm unit) was written as a.u. this use is evident in bragg's paper on the structure of ice which states the c- and a-axis lattice constants to be 4.52 a.u and 7.34 a.u. respectively these values agree well with the currently accepted values of 4.519 and 7.357
