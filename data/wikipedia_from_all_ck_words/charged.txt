=== development ===
in 1998 when the wb began looking for a new drama series for the 199899 season they approached spelling television (which had produced the network's then-most successful series 7th heaven) to create it expanding on the popularity of supernatural-themed dramas such as the craft (1996) the production company explored different forms of mythology to find characters they could realize with contemporary storytelling
constance m burge was hired to create the series as she was under contract with 20th century fox and spelling television after conceiving the drama series savannah (199697) when the theme of witchcraft was first pitched to her she was aware of stereotypes of witches (flying brooms black cats and warts) after researching wicca she changed her perspective and aimed at telling a story of good witches who looked and acted like ordinary people with this her initial concept was a series set in boston massachusetts about three friends and roommates who were all witches however executive producer e duke vincent lacked confidence asking why would anybody want to watch a show about three witches? he proposed that the series focus on family values and developed the series-long mantra of it being about three sisters who happen to be witches not three witches who happen to be sisters. spelling warmed to burge's ideas and after the concept was re-crafted to be a series about three sisters (now living in san francisco) descended from a line of witches it was pitched to the wb's president of entertainment susanne daniels who liked it allowing the series to begin development
the series was retitled charmed after spelling's suggestion of house of sisters was dropped burge wrote the pilot script a 28-minute version was filmed (the unaired pilot never aired on network television) with which the series was picked up by the wb upon its debut charmed received the largest audience for a series premiere in the network's history the first season of twenty-two episodes was picked up by the wb after only two episodes had aired
=== casting ===
former beverly hills 90210 actress shannen doherty was cast as the eldest sister prue halliwell while her best friend and former picket fences actress holly marie combs played the role of the middle sister piper halliwell lori rom was originally cast as the youngest sister phoebe halliwell in the 28-minute unaired pilot episode however rom quit the series and a new pilot was filmed with former who's the boss actress alyssa milano in the role of phoebe doherty departed charmed at the end of the third season and was replaced in the fourth season by film actress rose mcgowan who played the long-lost younger half-sister paige matthews
in season one ted king was cast as the inspector andy trudeau dorian gregory was cast as his inspector partner darryl morris and brian krause was cast as the halliwell sisters whitelighter leo wyatt king departed charmed at the end of the first season while gregory remained on the show until the seventh season in season two greg vaughan joined the series as the halliwell sisters new next-door neighbor dan gordon while karis paige bryant was cast as his niece jenny gordon bryant left her role mid-way through the second season while vaughan left at the end of the season australian actor julian mcmahon joined the cast of charmed in season three as the half-demon cole turner he departed the show mid-way through season five drew fuller joined charmed at the end of the fifth season as piper and leo's second son from the future chris halliwell fuller left his role at the end of season six in the eighth and final season kaley cuoco joined the show as the young witch billie jenkins
=== executive producers ===
executive producers aaron spelling and e duke vincent maintained their roles until the series ended constance m burge became an executive producer when she was hired to create the series and write the pilot after the short unaired pilot was shown to the wb and the series was picked up by the network brad kern was recruited as the fourth executive producer and as the show runner in order to decipher how the series would develop over the course of its run while kern remained with the show until its end between the second and third seasons burge was not an executive producer she remained as executive consultant until the end of season four when she left charmed
=== writing and format ===

however as holly marie combs revealed in the women of charmed documentary the series aimed at following a mythology created by fantasy and not adhering to wiccan rules too closely for fear of coming under criticism for either not being technically correct enough or missing the truth completely between the second and the third season burge left leaving her former position to executive producer kern she remained as creative consultant until season four burge's departure resulted in changes in the story structure of the show from a demon of the week system to using third or half-season-long story arcs in addition more importance was given to the protagonists personal lives the serial connection of episodes culminated in the second half of season four despite the ratings increasing during season four's final story arc from 4.19 to 4.21 the wb asked kern to abandon the serial system this led to the largely episodic structure of season five and resulted in the two systems being balanced from the sixth season onwards

=== critical reception ===
the earlier seasons of charmed received mostly favorable reviews from television critics with its first season scoring a metacritic score of 61 out of 100 during the first season entertainment weekly writer ken tucker speaking on the comparisons between charmed and rival series argued spike-heeled where buffy is fleet-footed charmed is charlie's angels with an ouija board. as well as the show's action sequencesdescribing the halliwells as superheroes"he noted that the series plays up the stars separate-but-equal charms and admired both its casting and pop-culture timing. vanessa thorpe of the guardian agreed with alyssa milano's description of charmed as perfect post-feminist girl-power praising the balance between action and emotion as the three sibling sorceresses know mischief but are accessibly feminine. entertainment weekly critic karyn l barr in her retrospective review of the first season wrote that this supernatural spelling series remains spellbinding thanks to its proper balance of quirky humor [and] buffy-esque drama labelling it as a crafty cult classic.
during the third season michael abernethy of popmatters credited charmed as more enjoyable than most shows in the good vs evil genre largely due to the strength of the performers he also recognized the use of humor in creating unexpected turns in stock storylines [which are] more interesting than one might expect. the monster of the week format is frequent during the early-half of the series however abernethy stated that despite this the writers tend to explore the sibling dynamics to keep the show from growing redundant. christel loar from the same publication agreed that episodes go beyond the demon-of-the-week formula to tap into the relationships of the characters and their...flaws charmed...succeeded by combining sisterhood with the supernatural. she also claimed that the halliwells struggle for normal lives stability and a sense of self is one of the reasons charmed strikes such a chord with its viewers. during the sixth season gillian flynn of entertainment weekly stated that the charm of charmed is that it knows what it is a guilty-pleasure fantasy and gave credit to its mythology as well as the grounded characterisations of the sisters
the later seasons of charmed also received mixed reviews from some critics angelica bastien of bustle magazine commented that charmed got pretty bad in its last few seasons as she felt the show lost track of its core theme of witchcraft and sisterhood instead becoming obsessed with increasingly soap plots and the sister's love lives...in the five seasons that followed after prue died. similarly buzzfeed writer jarett wieselman agreed that after [shannen] dohertys exit charmed veered into slightly-absurd-yet-no-less-entertaining territory noting that the addition of rose mcgowan ushered in a wave of increasingly campy episodes. nick romano of screen crush wrote that the storylines became wicca ridiculous and the dialogue became too cheesy particularly in season eight jon langmead of popmatters believed that charmed slipped markedly in seasons seven and eight noting that the final season lost appealing elements such as smart casting and attention to relationship drama of the show's earlier seasons langmead also disliked the introduction of kaley cuoco and marnette patterson in the eighth season and felt that cuoco was consistently painful to watch. dvd verdict's ryan keefer also felt that cuoco joining the show was a poor choice by the producers and commented that season eight failed to recapture the glory days of the first few seasons.
