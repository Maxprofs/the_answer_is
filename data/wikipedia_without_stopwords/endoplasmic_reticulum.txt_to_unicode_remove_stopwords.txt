endoplasmic reticulum serves many general functions including folding protein molecules sacs called cisternae transport synthesized proteins vesicles golgi apparatus correct folding newly made proteins made possible several endoplasmic reticulum chaperone proteins including protein disulfide isomerase pdi erp hsp family member bipgrp calnexin calreticulin peptidylpropyl isomerase family properly folded proteins transported rough er golgi apparatus unfolded proteins cause unfolded protein response stress response er disturbances redox regulation calcium regulation glucose deprivation viral infection overexpression proteins lead endoplasmic reticulum stress response er stress state folding proteins slows leading increase unfolded proteins stress emerging potential cause damage hypoxiaischemia insulin resistance disorders
protein transport
