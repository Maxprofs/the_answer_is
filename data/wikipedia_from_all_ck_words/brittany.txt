brittany (/brtn/ french bretagne [b.ta] breton breizh pronounced [bjs] or [b] gallo bertayn pronounced [b.ta]) is a cultural region in the north-west of france covering the western part of armorica as it was known during the period of roman occupation brittany subsequently became an independent kingdom and then a duchy before being united with the kingdom of france in 1532 as a province governed as if it were a separate nation under the crown brittany has also been referred to as less lesser or little britain (as opposed to great britain) it is bordered by the english channel to the north the celtic sea and the atlantic ocean to the west and the bay of biscay to the south its land area is 34,023 km (13,136 sq mi)
the historical province of brittany is now split among five french departments finistre in the west ctes-d'armor in the north ille-et-vilaine in the north east loire-atlantique in the south east and morbihan in the south on the bay of biscay since reorganisation in 1956 the modern administrative region of brittany comprises only four of the five breton departments or 80% of historical brittany the remaining area of old brittany the loire-atlantique department around nantes now forms part of the pays de la loire region
at the 2010 census the population of historic brittany was estimated to be 4,475,295 of these 71% lived in the region of brittany while 29% lived in the loire-atlantique department in 2012 the largest metropolitan areas were nantes (897,713 inhabitants) rennes (690,467 inhabitants) and brest (314,844 inhabitants) brittany is the traditional homeland of the breton people and is recognised by the celtic league as one of the six celtic nations retaining a distinct cultural identity that reflects its history a nationalist movement seeks greater autonomy within the french republic
== etymology ==
the word brittany along with its french breton and gallo equivalents bretagne breizh and bertayn derive from the latin britannia which means britons land this word has been used by the romans since the 1st century to name great britain and more specifically the roman province of britain this word derives from a greek word (prettanike) or (brettaniai) used by pytheas an explorer from massalia who visited the british islands around 320 bc
the romans called brittany armorica together with a quite indefinite region that extended along the channel coast from the seine estuary to the loire estuary and according to several sources maybe along the atlantic coast to the garonne estuary this term probably comes from a gallic word aremorica which means close to the sea another name letauia (in english litavis") was used until the 12th century it possibly means wide and flat or to expand and it gave the welsh name for brittany llydaw
after the fall of the western roman empire many britons settled in the western part of armorica and the region started to be called brittania although this name only replaced armorica in the sixth century or perhaps by the end of the fifth later authors like geoffrey of monmouth used the terms britannia minor and britannia major to distinguish brittany from britain
breton speaking people may pronounce the word breizh in two different ways according to their region of origin breton can be divided into two main dialects the klt (kerne-leon-tregor) and the dialect of vannes klt speakers pronounce it [brjs] and would write it breiz while the vannetais speakers pronounce it [br] and would write it breih the official spelling is a compromise between both variants with a z and an h together in 1941 efforts to unify the dialects led to the creation of the so-called breton zh a standard which has never been widely accepted on its side gallo language has never had a widely accepted writing system and several ones coexist for instance the name of the region in that language can be written bertayn in elg script or bertgn in moga and a couple of other scripts also exist
== history ==
=== prehistoric origins ===
brittany has been inhabited by humans since the lower paleolithic the first settlers were neanderthals this population was scarce and very similar to the other neanderthals found in the whole of western europe their only original feature was a distinct culture called colombanian one of the oldest hearths in the world has been found in plouhinec finistre it is 450,000 years old
homo sapiens settled in brittany around 35,000 years ago they replaced or absorbed the neanderthals and developed local industries similar to the chtelperronian or to the magdalenian after the last glacial period the warmer climate allowed the area to become heavily wooded at that time brittany was populated by relatively large communities who started to change their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering to become settled farmers agriculture was introduced during the 5th millennium bc by migrants who came from the south and the east however the neolithic revolution in brittany did not happen because of a radical change of population but by slow immigration and exchange of skills
neolithic brittany is characterised by an important megalithic production and it is sometimes designated as the core area of megalithic culture the oldest monuments cairns were followed by princely tombs and stone rows the morbihan dpartement on the southern coast comprises a large share of these structures including the carnac stones and the broken menhir of er grah in locmariaquer the largest single stone erected by neolithic people
=== gallic era ===
during the protohistorical period brittany was inhabited by five celtic tribes
the curiosolitae who lived around the present town of corseul their territory encompassed parts of ctes-d'armor ille-et-vilaine and morbihan dpartements
the namnetes who lived in the current loire-atlantique dpartement (in today's administrative rgion of pays de la loire) north of the loire they gave their name to the city of nantes the south bank of the river was occupied by an allied tribe the ambilatres whose existence and territory remain unsure
the osismii who lived in the western part of brittany their territory comprised the finistre dpartement and the western extremity of ctes-d'armor and morbihan
the redones (or rhedones) who lived in the eastern part of the ille-et-vilaine dpartement they gave their name to the city of rennes (roazhon in breton language in the center of the dpartement) and to the town of redon (in the south of the dpartement bordering the dpartement of loire-atlantique in the administrative rgion of pays de la loire where its suburb town of saint-nicolas-de-redon is located however the city of redon was founded around ad 832 under the initial name of riedones long after the redones people were assimilated to bretons  the cultural link between riedones and the former redones people is highly probable but difficult to recover and the name of riedones may have been written from a local usage preserving the name of the former people in the vernacular oral language from a reading of an ancient greek othography)
the veneti who lived in the present morbihan dpartement and gave their name to the city of vannes despite confusion by the classical scholar strabo they were unrelated to the adriatic veneti
those people had strong economic ties to the insular celts especially for the tin trade several tribes also belonged to an armorican confederation which according to julius caesar gathered the curiosolitae the redones the osismii the unelli the caletes the lemovices and the ambibarii the last four peoples mentioned by j caesar were respectively located in cotentin (lower-normandy) pays de caux (upper-normandy) limousin (aquitany) and the location of the ambibarii is unknown the caletes are sometimes also considered as belgians and lemovices is probably a mistake for lexovii (lower-normandy)
=== gallo-roman era ===
the region became part of the roman republic in 51 bc it was included in the province of gallia lugdunensis in 13 bc gallic towns and villages were redeveloped according to roman standards and several cities were created these cities are condate (rennes) vorgium (carhaix) darioritum (vannes) and condevincum or condevicnum (nantes) together with fanum martis (corseul) they were the capitals of the local civitates they all had a grid plan and a forum and sometimes a temple a basilica thermae or an aqueduct like carhaix the romans also built three major roads through the region however most of the population remained rural the free peasants lived in small huts whereas the landowners and their employees lived in proper villae rusticae the gallic deities continued to be worshiped and were often assimilated to the roman gods only a small number of statues depicting roman gods were found in brittany and most of the time they combine celtic elements
during the 3rd century ad the region was attacked several times by franks alamanni and pirates at the same time the local economy collapsed and many rural exploitations were abandoned to face the invasions many towns and cities were fortified like nantes rennes and vannes
=== immigration of britons ===
toward the end of the 4th century the britons of what is now wales and the south-western peninsula of england began to emigrate to armorica the history behind such an establishment is unclear but medieval breton angevin and welsh sources connect it to a figure known as conan meriadoc welsh literary sources assert that conan came to armorica on the orders of the roman usurper magnus maximus who sent some of his british troops to gaul to enforce his claims and settled them in armorica this account was supported by the counts of anjou who claimed descent from a roman soldier expelled from lower brittany by conan on magnus's orders regardless of the truth of this story brythonic (british celtic) settlement probably increased during the anglo-saxon invasion of britain in the 5th and 6th centuries scholars such as lon fleuriot have suggested a two-wave model of migration from britain which saw the emergence of an independent breton people and established the dominance of the brythonic breton language in armorica their petty kingdoms are now known by the names of the french counties that succeeded themdomnone (devon) cornouaille (cornwall) lon (caerleon) but these names in breton and latin are in most cases identical to their british homelands (in breton and french however gwened or vannetais continued the name of the indigenous veneti.) although the details remain confused these colonies consisted of related and intermarried dynasties which repeatedly unified (as by the 7th-century saint judical) before splintering again according to celtic inheritance practices the area was finally consolidated in the 840s under nominoe in resistance to frankish control among the immigrant britons there were some clergymen who helped the evangelisation of the region which was still pagan particularly in rural areas
=== battle of the catalaunian plains ===
the army recruited for flavius aetius to combat attila the hun included romans visigoths franks alans and armoricans amongst others the alans were placed front and centre opposite the huns the armoricans supplied archers who attacked the huns front lines during the main battle and thwarted attila's night assault on the roman camp with a hail of arrows like rain after the battle was won aetius sent the alans to armorica and galicia
=== riothamus ===
the late 5th century armorican breton leader riotham received correspondence from the eminent roman jurist sidonius apollinaris and was called king of the britons by jordanes both historians describe riothamus's losing battle against king euric of the visigoths at dols around the year 470 in response to a plea from the roman emperor anthemius riothamus had led twelve thousand men to establish a military presence in bourges in central gaul but was betrayed by arvandus the praetorian prefect of gaul and subsequently ambushed by euric's army after a long battle the armorican surivivors escaped to avallon in burgundy after which they are lost to history according to breton king-lists riotham survived and reigned as prince of domnonia until his death sometime between 500 and 520
=== middle ages ===
at the beginning of the medieval era brittany was divided between three kingdoms domnonea cornouaille and brorec these realms eventually merged into a single state during the 9th century the unification of brittany was carried out by nominoe king between 845 and 851 and considered as the breton pater patriae his son erispoe secured the independence of the new kingdom of brittany and won the battle of jengland against charles the bald the bretons won another war in 867 and the kingdom reached then its maximum extent it received parts of normandy maine and anjou and the channel islands
brittany was heavily attacked by the vikings at the beginning of the 10th century the kingdom lost its eastern territories including normandy and anjou and the county of nantes was given to fulk i of anjou in 909 however nantes was seized by the vikings in 914 and was eventually liberated by alan ii of brittany in 937 with the support of his god-brother king thelstan of england alan ii totally expelled the vikings from brittany and recreated a strong breton state he paid homage to louis iv of france (who was thelstan's nephew and had returned from england in the same year as alan ii) and thus brittany ceased to be a kingdom and became a duchy
several breton lords helped william the conqueror to invade england and received large estates there (e.g william's double-second cousin alan rufus and the latter's brother brian of brittany) some of these lords were powerful rivals medieval brittany was far from being a united nation the french king maintained envoys in brittany alliances contracted by local lords often overlapped and there was no specific breton consciousness for example brittany replaced latin with french as its official language in the 13th century 300 years before france did so itself and the breton language never had any formal status the foreign policy of the duchy changed many times the dukes were usually independent but they often contracted alliances with england or france their support for each nation became very important during the 14th century because the english kings then started to claim the french throne
the breton war of succession a local episode of the hundred years war saw the house of blois backed by the french fighting with the house of montfort backed by the english the montforts won in 1364 and enjoyed a period of total independence until the end of the hundred years war because france was weakened and stopped sending royal envoys to the court of brittany english diplomatic failures led to the breton cavalry commanders arthur comte de richemont (later to become arthur iii duke of brittany) and his nephew peter ii duke of brittany playing key roles on the french side during the deciding stages of the war (the battle of patay the treaty of arras (1435) the battle of formigny and the battle of castillon) however brittany lost the mad war against france in 1488 mostly because of its internal divisions which were exacerbated by the corruption at the court of francis ii duke of brittany indeed some breton lords were fighting on the french side
=== union with the french crown and modern period ===
after the mad war the duke francis ii could not marry off his daughter anne without the king of france's consent nonetheless she married the holy roman emperor in 1490 but this led to a severe crisis with france charles viii of france besieged rennes and had the marriage cancelled he eventually married anne of brittany after he died childless the duchess had to marry his heir and cousin louis xii anne unsuccessfully tried to preserve breton independence but she died in 1514 and the union between the two crowns was formally carried out by francis i in 1532 he granted several privileges to brittany such as exemption from the gabelle a tax on salt which was very unpopular in france under the ancien rgime brittany and france were governed as separate countries under the same crown so breton aristocrats in the french royal court were classed as princes trangers (foreign princes)
from the 15th to the 18th century brittany reached an economic golden age the region was located on the seaways between spain england and the netherlands and it greatly benefited from the creation of a french colonial empire local seaports like brest and saint-brieuc quickly expanded and lorient first spelled l'orient was founded in the 17th century saint-malo was then known for its corsairs brest was a major base for the french navy and nantes flourished with the atlantic slave trade on its side the inland provided hemp ropes and canvas and linen sheets however colbertism which encouraged the creation of many factories did not favour the breton industry because most of the royal factories were opened in other provinces moreover several conflicts between france and england led the latter to restrain its trade and the breton economy went into recession during the 18th century
two significant revolts occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries the revolt of the papier timbr (1675) and the pontcallec conspiracy (1719) both arose from attempts to resist centralisation and assert breton constitutional exceptions to tax
many bretons crossed the atlantic to support the american war of independence these included many sailors such as armand de kersaint and soldiers such as charles armand tuffin marquis de la rouerie
=== since 1789 ===
despite early breton support for the ideals of the french revolution the duchy was legally abolished during the revolution in 1789 and divided into five departments brittany also lost all its privileges three years later the area became a centre of royalist and catholic resistance to the revolution during the chouannerie during the 19th century brittany remained in economic recession and many bretons emigrated to other french regions particularly to paris this trend remained strong until the beginning of the 20th century nonetheless the region was also modernising with new roads and railways being built and some places being industrialised nantes specialised in shipbuilding and food processing (sugar exotic fruits and vegetables fish...) fougres in glass and shoe production and metallurgy was practised in small towns such as chteaubriant and lochrist known for its labour movements
the region remained deeply catholic and during the second empire the conservative values were strongly reasserted when the republic was re-established in 1871 there were rumours that breton troops were mistrusted and mistreated at camp conlie during the franco-prussian war because of fears that they were a threat to the republic
during the 19th century the breton language started to decline precipitously mainly because of the francization policy conducted under the third republic on one hand children were not allowed to speak breton at school and were punished by teachers if they did famously signs in schools read it is forbidden to speak breton and to spit on the floor ("il est interdit de parler breton et de cracher par terre") on the other hand breton (like latin) was considered as a language that kept brittany in the hands of the roman catholic church and learning french was a way especially for women to free themselves from the influence of the church as a result a generation of native breton speakers were made to feel ashamed of their language and avoided speaking it or teaching it to their children these factors contributed to the decline of breton
at the same time the celtic revival led to the foundation of the breton regionalist union (urb) and later to independence movements linked to irish welsh and scottish independence parties in the uk and to pan-celticism however the audience of these movements remained very low and their ideas did not reach a large public until the 20th century the seiz breur movement created in 1923 permitted a breton artistic revival but its ties with nazism and the collaborationism of the breton national party during world war ii weakened breton nationalism in the post-war period
brittany lost 240,000 men during the first world war the second world war was also catastrophic for the region it was invaded by nazi germany in 1940 and freed after operation cobra in august 1944 however the areas around saint-nazaire and lorient only surrendered the 10 and 11 may 1945 several days after the german capitulation the two towns had been virtually destroyed by allied air raids like brest and saint-malo and other towns such as nantes and rennes had also suffered
in 1956 brittany was legally reconstituted as the region of brittany although the region excluded the ducal capital of nantes and the surrounding area nevertheless brittany retained its cultural distinctiveness and a new cultural revival emerged during the 1960s and 1970s bilingual schools were opened singers started to write songs in breton and ecological catastrophes such as the amoco cadiz oil spill or the erika oil spill and water pollution because of intensive pig farming favoured new movements to protect the natural heritage
== government and politics ==
=== traditional subdivisions ===
brittany as a political entity disappeared in 1790 when it was divided into five dpartements the breton dpartements more or less correspond to the nine catholic dioceses that appeared at the beginning of the middle ages they were often called pays or bro ("country in french and breton) and they also served as fiscal and military districts brittany is also divided between lower brittany ("basse bretagne and breizh izel") corresponding to the western half where breton is traditionally spoken and upper brittany ("haute bretagne and breizh uhel") corresponding to the eastern half where gallo is traditionally spoken the historical breton dioceses were
upper brittany
the pays nantais around nantes corresponding to the loire-atlantique dpartement
the pays rennais around rennes forming part of the ille-et-vilaine dpartement
the pays de dol around dol-de-bretagne corresponding to the northern part of the ille-et-vilaine dpartement
the pays de saint-brieuc around saint-brieuc forming part of the ctes-d'armor dpartement
the pays de saint-malo around saint-malo divided between ille-et-vilaine ctes-d'armor and morbihan
lower brittany
the pays vannetais around vannes corresponding to the morbihan dpartement
the cornouaille around quimper divided between finistre and ctes-d'armor
the lon around saint-pol-de-lon corresponding to the northern part of the finistre dpartement
the trgor around trguier forming part of the ctes-d'armor dpartement
during the french revolution four dioceses were suppressed and the five remaining ones were modified to have the same administrative borders as the dpartements
=== capital cities ===
brittany has several historical capital cities when it was an independent duchy the estates of brittany which can be compared to a parliament met in various towns dinan plormel redon rennes vitr gurande and most of all vannes where they met 19 times and nantes 17 times the court and the government were also very mobile and each dynasty favoured its own castles and estates the dukes mostly lived in nantes vannes redon rennes fougres dol-de-bretagne dinan and gurande it is interesting to notice that all these towns except vannes are located in upper brittany thus not in the breton speaking area
among all these towns only nantes rennes and vannes which were the biggest ones could really pretend to the capital status the dukes were crowned in rennes and they had a large castle there it was however destroyed during the 15th century vannes on its side was the seat of the chamber of accounts and of the parliament until the union with france the parliament was then transferred to rennes and the chamber of accounts to nantes nantes nicknamed the city of the dukes of brittany was also the permanent residence of the last dukes the chteau des ducs de bretagne still stands in the city centre nowadays rennes is the only official capital of the region of brittany it is also the seat of an ecclesiastical province encompassing brittany and the pays de la loire region
=== present subdivisions ===
during the french revolution brittany was divided into five dpartements each made up of three or four arrondissements the arrondissements are further divided in cantons which are themselves made up of one or several communes the communes and the dpartements have a local council elected by their citizens but arrondissements and cantons are not run by elected officials the cantons serve as an electoral district for the election of the dpartement councils and arrondissements are run by a subprefect appointed by the french president the president also appoints a prefect in each dpartement
because the dpartements are small and numerous the french government tried to create wider regions during the 20th century for the breton nationalists it was an occasion to recreate brittany as a political and administrative entity but the new region had to be economically efficient nantes and its dpartement loire-atlantique raised concerns because they were off-centered more integrated with the loire valley than with the breton peninsula the french government and local politicians also feared that nantes because of its population and its former breton capital status would have maintained a harmful competition with rennes to get the regional institutions and investments
several drafts for french regions had been proposed since the 1920s and the definitive regions were drawn in 1956 the new brittany had four dpartements and loire-atlantique formed the pays de la loire region together with parts of anjou maine and poitou in 1972 the regions received their present competencies with an elected regional council since then the region of brittany has had its own council and administrative bodies
=== the reunification question ===
when the region of brittany was created several local politicians opposed the exclusion of loire-atlantique and the question still remains
the obstacles to reunification are the same as in 1956 having nantes in brittany could harm the position of rennes and create an economic imbalance between lower and upper brittany moreover the pays de la loire region could not exist without loire-atlantique because it would lose its political and economic capital without loire-atlantique the other dpartements would not form an efficient region any more and would have to integrate neighbouring regions such as the centre region and poitou-charentes
however several institutions have backed the reunification such as the regional council of brittany since 2008 and the loire-atlantique council since 2001 some politicians like jean-marc ayrault the french prime minister and former mayor of nantes favour instead the creation of a greater west region which would encompass brittany and the pays de la loire region polls show that 58% of the bretons and 62% of the inhabitants in loire-atlantique favour the reunification
=== political tendencies ===
until the end of the 20th century brittany had been characterised by a strong catholic and conservative influence however some areas such as the industrial region around saint-nazaire and lorient and the surroundings of trguier are traditional socialist and communist strongholds left-wing parties mainly the socialist party and the greens have become more and more powerful after the 1970s and they have formed a majority in the regional council of brittany since 2004 the loire-atlantique and ille-et-vilaine councils have also been held by the left since 2004 the socialist party has held the ctes-d'armor council since 1976 and the finistre council since 1998 on its side morbihan remains a right-wing stronghold the local parties have a very small audience except the union dmocratique bretonne which has seats at the regional council and in other local assemblies it advocates more autonomy for the region and its positions are very close to the socialist parties it also has a strong ecological orientation the audience of far-right parties is lower in brittany than in the rest of france
== geography and natural history ==
brittany is the largest french peninsula it is around 34,030 km2 (13,140 sq mi) and stretches towards the northwest and the atlantic ocean it is bordered to the north by the english channel to the south by the bay of biscay and the waters located between the western coast and ushant island form the iroise sea
the breton coast is very indented with many cliffs rias and capes the gulf of morbihan is a vast natural harbour with some forty islands that is almost a closed sea in total around 800 islands lie off the mainland the largest being belle le in the south brittany has over 2,860 km (1,780 mi) of coastline it represents a third of the total french coastline
the region is generally hilly because it corresponds to the western end of the armorican massif a very old range that also extends in normandy and the pays de la loire region because of this continuity the breton border with the rest of france is not marked by any strong geographical landmark apart from the river couesnon which separates brittany from normandy
the armorican massif reaches its maximal elevation outside of brittany in neighbouring mayenne at 417 m and slopes towards the west before straightening on its western extremity with the montagnes noires and the monts d'arre the highest hill in brittany is the roc'h ruz in the monts d'arre at 385 m (1,263 ft) it is closely followed by several neighbouring hills culminating at around 384 m above sea level
coastal areas are usually named armor or arvor ("by the sea in breton) and the inland is called argoat ("by the forest") the best soils were primitively covered by large forests which had been progressively replaced by bocage during the middle ages the breton bocage with its small fields enclosed by thick hedgerows has almost disappeared since the 1960s to fit the modern agricultural needs and methods particularly mechanisation
several forests still exist such as the paimpont forest sometimes said to be the arthurian brocliande the poor and rocky areas are covered by large heathland and moorlands and brittany has several marshes like the brire included in a regional natural park another regional park encompasses the monts d'arre and the iroise seacoast the iroise sea is also a unesco biosphere reserve
=== geology ===
the breton peninsula appeared during the cadomian orogeny which formed its northern coastline between guingamp and fougres the southern part emerged during the hercynian orogeny at the same time an intense volcanic activity left large quantities of granite between the cadomian and hercynian periods the region was submerged several times and the sea left fossils and sedimentary rocks mostly schist and sandstone because of the absence of limestone soils in brittany are usually acid the armorican massif straightened and flattened several times during the formation of the pyrenees and the alps changes in sea levels and climate led to a strong erosion and to the formation of more sedimentary rocks metamorphism is responsible for the distinctive local blue schist and for the rich subsoil of the groix island which comprises glaucophane and epidote
during the quaternary glaciations brittany was covered by loess and rivers started to fill the valleys with alluvial deposits the valleys themselves were a result of a strong tectonic activity between the african and the eurasian plate the present breton landscape did not acquired its final shape before one million years ago the breton subsoil is characterised by a huge amount of fractures that form a large aquifer containing several millions square meters of water
=== climate ===
brittany lies within the north temperate zone it has a changeable maritime climate similar to cornwall rainfall occurs regularly but sunny cloudless days are also common in the summer months temperatures in the region can reach 30 c (86 f) yet the climate remains comfortable especially when compared to the french regions located south of the loire the temperature difference between summer and winter is about fifteen degrees but it varies depending on the proximity of the sea the weather is generally milder on the seacoast than inland but rainfall occurs with the same intensity on both the monts d'arre despite their low elevation have much more rainfall than the rest of the region the south coast between lorient and pornic enjoys more than 2,000 hours of sunshine per year
=== flora and fauna ===
brittany's wildlife is typical of france with several distinctions on one hand the region due to its long coastline has a rich oceanic fauna and some birds cannot be seen in other french regions on the other hand the species found in the inland are usually common for france and because brittany is a peninsula the number of species is lower in its western extremity than in the eastern part
a variety of seabirds can be seen close to the seaside which is home to colonies of cormorants gulls razorbills northern gannets common murres and atlantic puffins most of these birds breed on isolated islands and rocks and thus are hard to observe the inland is home to common european species pheasants swallows woodcocks common swifts partridges
like cornwall wales and ireland the waters of brittany attract marine animals including basking sharks grey seals leatherback turtles dolphins porpoises jellyfish crabs and lobsters bass is common along the coast small-spotted catsharks live on the continental shelf rattails and anglerfish populate the deep waters river fish of note include trouts atlantic salmons pikes shades and lampreys the breton rivers are also home to beavers and otters and to some invasive american species such as the coypu which destroys the ecosystem and accelerated the extinction of the european mink
among the invertebrates brittany is notably home to the escargot de quimper the freshwater pearl mussel and the white-clawed crayfish the larger breton mammals died out during the modern period including the wolf today mammals of note include roe deers wild boars foxes hares and several species of bat
brittany is widely known for the breton horse a local breed of draft horse and for the brittany gun dog the region also has its own breeds of cattle some of which are on the brink of extinction the bretonne pie noir the froment du lon the armorican and the nantaise
the breton forests dunes moorlands and marshes are home to several iconic plants such as endemic cistus aster and linaria varieties the horseshoe vetch and the lotus maritimus
== education ==
brittany has the same education system as the rest of france as in other french regions formal education before the 19th century was the preserve of the elite before 1460 brittany did not have a university and breton students had to go to angers poitiers or caen the university of nantes was founded under the duke francis ii who wanted to affirm the breton independence from france all the traditional disciplines were taught there arts theology law and medicine during the 17th century it had around 1,500 students it declined during the 18th century mostly because nantes was flourishing with the atlantic slave trade and paid no attention to its cultural institutions a mayor eventually asked the university to be relocated to rennes more devoted to culture and science and the faculties progressively moved there after 1735 the transfer was interrupted by the french revolution and all the french universities were dissolved in 1793
napoleon reorganised the french education system in 1808 he created new universities and invented two secondary education institutions the collges and the lyces which were opened in numerous towns to educate boys and form a new elite a new university of rennes was progressively recreated during the 19th century in the meantime several laws were promoted to open schools notably for girls in 1882 jules ferry succeeded in passing a law which made primary education in france free non-clerical (laque) and mandatory thus free schools were opened in almost every villages of brittany jules ferry also promoted education policies establishing french language as the language of the republic and mandatory education was a mean to eradicate regional languages and dialects in brittany it was forbidden for the pupils to speak breton or gallo and the two were strongly depreciated humiliating practices aimed at stamping out the breton language and culture prevailed in state schools until the late 1960s in response the diwan schools were founded in 1977 to teach breton by immersion they have taught a few thousand young people from elementary school to high school and they have gained more and more fame owing to their high level of results in school exams a bilingual approach has also been implemented in some state schools after 1979 and some catholic schools have done the same after 1990 besides brittany with the neighbouring pays de la loire region remains a stronghold for catholic private education with around 1,400 schools
during the 20th century tertiary education was developed with the creation of the cole centrale de nantes in 1919 the university of nantes in 1961 the esc bretagne brest in 1962 the university of western brittany in 1971 and the university of southern brittany in 1995 the catholic university of the west based in angers also opened classes in several breton towns in 1969 the university of rennes was divided between the university of rennes 1 and the university of rennes 2 upper brittany after the second world war the ecole spciale militaire de saint-cyr the foremost french military academy settled in cotquidan
== economy ==
brittany apart from some areas such as lorient nantes and saint-nazaire has never been heavily industrialised today fishing and agriculture remain important activities brittany has more than 40,000 agricultural exploitations mostly oriented towards cattle pig and poultry breeding and cereals and vegetables production the number of exploitations tends to diminish but as a result they are merged into very large estates brittany is the first producer in france for vegetables (green beans onions artichokes potatoes tomatoes...) cereals are mostly grown for cattle feeding wine especially muscadet is made in a small region south of nantes brittany is the first region in france for fishing the activity employs around 9,000 people and more than 60 firms work in fish and seafood processing
although relatively new the breton industry has been constantly growing since 1980 food processing (meat vegetables...) represents a third of the industrial jobs but other activities are also important for the local economy shipbuilding both commercial and military is implanted in saint-nazaire (chantiers de l'atlantique) lorient and brest airbus has plants in saint-nazaire and nantes and peugeot has a large factory in rennes brittany is the second french region for telecommunication and the fifth for electronics two activities mainly developed in rennes lannion and brest tourism is particularly important for the seacoast and brittany is one of the most visited regions in france
the unemployment rate in brittany is lower than in other french regions and it is usually around 6 or 7% of the active population because of the global financial crisis started in 2007 unemployment has arisen to 8.7% in the region brittany and 8.4% in loire-atlantique in late 2012 however these results remain under the french national rate (9.9% at the same period) some activities such as construction industry catering or transport usually have difficulties to find employees
in 2009 region brittany's gross domestic product reached 82 billion euros it was the seventh richest region in france and it produced 4.4% of the national gdp the breton gdp per capita was around 25,739 euros in 2009 it was lower than the french result 29,897 euros but higher than the european one 23,500 euros the gdp of the loire-atlantique dpartement is around 26 billion euros and the gdp of the five historical breton dpartements would be at around 108 billion euros
== demographics ==
in 2012 the population in region brittany was estimated to 3,195,317 and loire-atlantique had around 1,303,103 inhabitants thus historical brittany's population can be estimated at 4,552,918 the highest in its history the population in region brittany had grown by 0.9% between 1999 and 2000 and the growth rate reached more than 1% in ille-et-vilaine and morbihan the region around rennes and the south are the more attractive areas whereas the population is declining in the centre and in the westernmost parts while most of the metropolitan areas are growing the cities themselves tend to stagnate or regress such as for brest lorient saint-brieuc and saint-malo in 2008 ille-et-vilaine had 967,588 inhabitants it was followed by morbihan 710,034 inhabitants finistre 890,509 inhabitants and ctes-d'armor with 581,570 inhabitants the largest cities in region brittany were rennes with 206,655 brest 142,097 quimper 63,929 lorient 58,148 vannes 52,983 saint-malo 48,211 and saint-brieuc 45,879 all the other communes had under 20,000 inhabitants brittany is also characterised by a great number of small towns such as vitr concarneau morlaix or auray loire-atlantique has two major cities nantes with 283,288 inhabitants and an urban area encompassing 873,133 and saint-nazaire with 67,031 inhabitants loire-atlantique's population is more rapidly growing than region brittany's and it is the 12th most populated french dpartement nevertheless since the 1990s rennes has consistently ranked as one of france's fastest growing metropolitan areas
in 1851 brittany had around 2,7 million inhabitants and the demographic growth stayed low until the second half of the 20th century mainly because of an important emigration brittany had 3,2 million inhabitants in 1962 and the growth was mainly due to loire-atlantique and the steady growth of nantes without the loire-atlantique's figures the breton population only numbered 2,4 millions in 1962 and 2,3 in 1851 after the 1960s the whole region has had a strong demographic growth because of the decline of the traditional emigration to richer french regions instead brittany has become attractive particularly for families young retired persons and active people over 35 years old
brittany do not have a strong share of foreign residents together with naturalised french people they form approximately 2% of the total population they mainly come from european countries such as the united kingdom portugal and spain from former french colonies like morocco algeria vietnam ivory coast or senegal and from turkey brittany is the region of france that has the smallest proportion of immigrants
=== regional identity ===
breton political parties do not have wide support and their electoral success is small however bretons have a strong cultural identity according to a poll made in 2008 50% of the inhabitants of the region brittany consider themselves as much breton as french 22.5% feel more breton than french and 15.4% more french than breton a minority 1.5% considers itself breton but not french while 9.3% do not consider themselves to be breton at all

=== regional languages ===
french the only official language of the french republic is spoken today by everybody in brittany and it is the mother tongue of most people nonetheless french was not widely known before the 19th century and two regional languages exist in brittany breton and gallo they are separated by a language border that has constantly moved back since the middle ages the current border runs from plouha on the english channel to the rhuys peninsula on the bay of biscay because of their origins and practice breton and gallo can be compared to scottish gaelic and scots language in scotland both have been recognised as langues de bretagne ("languages of brittany") by the regional council of brittany since 2004
==== breton ====
breton is a celtic language derived from the historical common brittonic language and is most closely related to cornish and welsh it was imported in western armorica during the 5th century by britons fleeing the anglo-saxon invasion of britain since the 13th century long before the union of brittany and france the main administrative language of the duchy of brittany had been french which had replaced latin breton remained the language of the rural population but since the middle ages the bourgeoisie the nobility and the higher clergy have been speaking french
government policies in the 19th and 20th centuries made education compulsory and at the same time forbade the use of breton in schools to push non-french speakers into adopting the french language nevertheless until the 1960s breton was spoken or understood by many of the inhabitants of western brittany during the 1970s breton schools were opened and the local authorities started to promote the language which was on the brink of extinction because parents had stopped teaching it to their children
having declined from more than one million speakers around 1950 to about 200,000 in the first decade of the 21st century of whom 61% are more than 60 years old breton is classified as severely endangered by the unesco atlas of the world's languages in danger however the number of children attending bilingual classes has risen 33% between 2006 and 2012 to 14,709
the breton language has several dialects which have no precise limits but rather form a continuum most of them are very similar to each other with only some phonetic and lexical differences the three main dialects spoken in the western end of brittany the cornouillais around quimper the lonard around saint-pol-de-lon and the trgorrois around trguier are grouped into the klt group (kerne-leon-treger) in opposition to the vannetais spoken around vannes which is the most differentiated breton dialect
==== gallo ====
gallo is spoken on the eastern half of brittany it is one of the romance langues d'ol but has some celtic influences particularly in its vocabulary
unlike breton gallo does not have a long promotion history and it is still often perceived as a poor rural dialect moreover because of its similarities with gallo french imposed itself more easily as the main language in upper brittany than in breton speaking areas gallo was felt as a wrong way of speaking french more than as a proper dialect or language the gallo transmission from parents to children is extremely low and efforts to standardise and publish books in gallo did not reverse the decline of the language and its lack of prestige
gallo is also threatened by the breton language revival because breton is gaining ground in territories that were not previously part of the main breton-speaking area and most of all because breton appears as the national language of brittany thus leaving no place for gallo
gallo had never been written before the 20th century and several writing systems were created they are however rarely known by the population and signs in gallo are often unreadable even for fluent speakers in loire-atlantique where gallo is not promoted at all by the local authorities many people do not even know the word gallo and have no idea that it has writing systems and publications
the gallo speaking community is estimated between 28,300 and 200,000 locutors the language is taught on a non-compulsory basis in some schools high-schools and universities particularly in ille-et-vilaine
=== religion ===
bretons are mainly catholic and the christianisation occurred during the roman gaul and frank era during the briton emigration to brittany several christian missionaries mostly welsh came in the region and founded dioceses they are known as the seven founder saints
paol aoreliann at saint-pol-de-lon
tudwal at trguier
brieg at saint-brieuc
malo at saint-malo
samsun of dol at dol-de-bretagne
padarn at vannes
kaourintin at quimper
other notable early missionaries are gildas and the irish saint columbanus in total brittany numbers more than 300 saints (only a few recognised by the catholic church) and since the 19th century at least it has been known as one of the most devoutly catholic regions in france together with the neighbouring pays de la loire region the proportion of students attending catholic private schools is the highest in france the patron saint of brittany is saint anne the virgin's mother but ivo of kermartin a 13th-century priest called saint-yves in french and sant-erwan in breton can also be considered as a patron saint his feast the 19 may is brittany's national day
many distinctive traditions and customs have also been preserved in brittany among them the pardons are one of the most traditional demonstrations of popular catholicism these penitential ceremonies occur in some villages in lower brittany on the feast day of the parish's saint the penitents form a procession and they walk together to a shrine a church or any sacred place some pardons are reputed for their length and they all finish by large meals and popular feasts
there is a very old pilgrimage called the tro breizh (tour of brittany) where the pilgrims walk around brittany from the grave of one of the seven founder saints to another historically the pilgrimage was made in one trip (a total distance of around 600 km) for all seven saints nowadays however pilgrims complete the circuit over the course of several years in 2002 the tro breizh included a special pilgrimage to wales symbolically making the reverse journey of the welshmen sant paol sant brieg and sant samzun
the most powerful folk figure is the ankou or the reaper of death sometimes a skeleton wrapped in a shroud with the breton flat hat sometimes described as a real human being (the last dead of the year devoted to bring the dead to death) he makes his journeys by night carrying an upturned scythe which he throws before him to reap his harvest sometimes he is on foot but mostly he travels with a cart the karrig an ankou drawn by two oxen and a lean horse two servants dressed in the same shroud and hat as the ankou pile the dead into the cart and to hear it creaking at night means you have little time left to live
as official religious statistics are forbidden in france there are no official figures about religious practices in brittany however successive polls show that the region tends to be more and more nonreligious catholic religion has started to decline after the second world war during the urbanisation of brittany a poll conducted in 2006 showed that morbihan was the only dpartement to have a strong catholic population around 70% of its inhabitants belonging to that religion loire-atlantique and ctes-d'armor were among the least catholic french dpartements with only 50% of catholics while ille-et-vilaine and finistre were at around 65% other religions are almost non-existent apart from islam which gathers between 1 and 3% of the inhabitants in ille-et-vilaine and loire-atlantique

in lower brittany the medieval style never totally disappeared however local innovations permitted some changes and the birth of a particular style its most distinctive feature is the parish close which displays an elaborately decorated church surrounded by an entirely walled churchyard many villages still have their closes they date from the 16th and 17th centuries and sometimes include an elaborately carved calvary sculpture
during the 17th and the 18th centuries the main seaports and towns obtained a typical french look with baroque and neoclassical buildings nantes which was at the time the biggest french harbour received a theatre large avenues and quays and rennes was redesigned after a fire in 1720 at the same period the wealthy ship-owners from saint-malo built many mansions called malouinires around their town along the coast vauban and other french architects designed several citadels such as in le palais and port-louis in rural areas breton houses remained simple with a single floor and a longhouse pattern they were built with local materials mostly granit in lower brittany and schist in upper brittany slates and reeds were usually used for roofing during the 19th century the breton architecture was mainly characterised by the gothic revival and eclecticism clisson the southernmost breton town was rebuilt in an italian romantic style around 1820 the breton lighthouses were mostly built during the 19th century the most famous are ar men phare d'eckmhl la vieille and la jument the lighthouse on the le vierge is with 77 meters the highest in europe
at the end of the 19th century several seaside resorts were created along the coast and villas and hotels were built in historicist art nouveau and later in the art deco styles these architectures are particularly present in dinard la baule and bnodet architecture from the 20th century can be seen in saint-nazaire brest and lorient three cities destroyed during the second world war and rebuilt afterwards and in the works of the breton nationalist architects like james bouill and olier mordrel

cycling has always been one of the main sports of brittany but leisure cycling and the infrastructure to support it have been growing extremely rapidly an extensive network of cyclepaths and recommended cycleroutes has opened up all over the region some of these are routes using mainly smaller roads and both signposted and maintained by communes individually but many are based on dedicated cyclepaths often formed by converting disused railway tracks these help form routes such as vlodysse from roscoff to nantes and several major routes under the v label (following signs v1 v2 etc.) the old tow-path of the nantes-brest canal is now open to cyclists along its entire 385 km length though in places (unlike rail-based cyclepaths) it is very meandering and leaving the path will both shorten the distance and provide variety
as a general rule cyclists are very well respected in the region and many larger towns have cycle-lanes - however traffic is cycle friendly even in their absence

the modern flag of brittany was designed in 1923 it is called gwenn ha du ("white and black in breton) and it features eleven ermine spots (their number may vary) and nine stripes the black ones represent the breton speaking historical dioceses and the white ones symbolise the gallo speaking dioceses the flag was created to replace the traditional ermine plain standard considered too aristocratic and royalist it was inspired by the american flag and the british red ensign since the 1920s the flag has become very popular and it is flown from a large number of institutions apart from the ermine flag breton historic banners include the kroaz du a white flag with a black cross the perfect negative of the cornish flag
the coat of arms of brittany ermine plain was adopted by john iii in 1316 ermine had been used in brittany long before and there is no clue about its origin it was probably chosen by the dukes because of its similarity with the french fleur-de-lis the ermine or stoat as an animal became the badge of john iv at the end of the 14th century it appeared later on numerous locations including churches and castles according to popular traditions anne of brittany was hunting with her court when she saw a white ermine who preferred to die than to cross a dirty marsh this episode would have inspired the duchess motto  potius mori quam foedari ("rather death than dishonour") the motto has later been reused by breton regiments local world war ii resistants and cultural movements
the breton anthem although not official is bro gozh ma zado - ("old land of my fathers") it re-employs both the welsh anthem's music and that of bro goth agan tasow (the national anthem of cornwall its lyrics were written at the end of the 19th century
colloquial breton emblems include the celtic triskelion the menhirs and dolmens local dishes such as the galettes the bigouden headdress and the traditional black round hat the fisherman and his yellow raincoat etc bzh is a common abbreviation for breizh ("brittany in breton) and people often put bzh stickers on their car-plates although it is forbidden under french laws bzh is an approved internet top level domain for the breton culture and languages
