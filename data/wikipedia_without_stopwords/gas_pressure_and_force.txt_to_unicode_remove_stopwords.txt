gas bubbler piece laboratory glassware consists glass bulb filled small amount fluid usually mineral silicone oil less commonly mercury inlet bulb connected ground glass joint outlet vented air
gas bubblers used exclude air reaction system former case gas bubbler fitted condenser reaction setup latter case oil bubbler usually installed end inert gas manifold schlenk line prevent contamination atmospheric oxygen water
gas bubbler acts oneway valve gases hot air evolved gases solvent vapors inlet bubble fluid vented atmosphere underpressure reaction vessel heat removed gases within contract fluid sucked sump equalize pressure instead air wherever possible suck back avoided filling reaction apparatus inert gas excessively low pressure cause oil sucked reaction vessel contaminating
bubbles allow worker visibly confirm system flushed inert gas rate bubbles form allow worker adjust inlet pressure
oil bubblersedit
oil bubblers filled mineral silicone oil quite resistant chemical attack oil bubblers predominantly used oil inexpensive toxic
drawback due oils lower density event underpressure reaction vessel enough oil may sucked sump inert gas system contaminate due reason pressure within inert gas system always remain close atmospheric disadvantage attempting cannula transfers using inert gas pressure force liquid reagent another using cannula
mercury bubbleredit
mercury bubblers largely similar construction oil bubblers usually longer body prevent mercury splashing bubbler outlet inlet connection usually sintered glass disc prevent mercury sucked back inert gas system refilling evacuated vessel
important advantage mercury oil fair amount pressure maintained within inert gas system equivalent height mercury column tall columns may used exploit increasing pressure within inert gas system boiling points increased allowing reactions reflux carried higher temperature also cannula transfers accomplished easily due greater gas pressure available push liquid reagent vessel cannula another vessel
mercury bubblers avoided possible due difficulty expense dealing mercury spills addition mercury react various chemicals ammonia acetylenes potentially hazardous results context cannula transfer mercury bubblers may avoided pulling instead pushing liquids cannula vacuum alternatively oil bubbler may closed inert gas line stopcock allowing inert gas push reagent cannula excess pressure bled bubbler fitted directly receiving vessel
