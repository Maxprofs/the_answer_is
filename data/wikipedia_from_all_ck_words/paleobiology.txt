paleobiology (sometimes spelled palaeobiology) is a growing and comparatively new discipline which combines the methods and findings of the natural science biology with the methods and findings of the earth science paleontology it is occasionally referred to as geobiology
paleobiological research uses biological field research of current biota and of fossils millions of years old to answer questions about the molecular evolution and the evolutionary history of life in this scientific quest macrofossils microfossils and trace fossils are typically analyzed however the 21st-century biochemical analysis of dna and rna samples offers much promise as does the biometric construction of phylogenetic trees
an investigator in this field is known as a paleobiologist
== important research areas ==
paleobotany applies the principles and methods of paleobiology to flora especially green land plants but also including the fungi and seaweeds (algae) see also mycology phycology and dendrochronology
paleozoology uses the methods and principles of paleobiology to understand fauna both vertebrates and invertebrates see also vertebrate and invertebrate paleontology as well as paleoanthropology
micropaleontology applies paleobiologic principles and methods to archaea bacteria protists and microscopic pollen/spores see also microfossils and palynology
paleovirology examines the evolutionary history of viruses on paleobiological timescales
paleobiochemistry uses the methods and principles of organic chemistry to detect and analyze molecular-level evidence of ancient life both microscopic and macroscopic
paleoecology examines past ecosystems climates and geographies so as to better comprehend prehistoric life
taphonomy analyzes the post-mortem history (for example decay and decomposition) of an individual organism in order to gain insight on the behavior death and environment of the fossilized organism
paleoichnology analyzes the tracks borings trails burrows impressions and other trace fossils left by ancient organisms in order to gain insight into their behavior and ecology
stratigraphic paleobiology studies long-term secular changes as well as the (short-term) bed-by-bed sequence of changes in organismal characteristics and behaviors see also stratification sedimentary rocks and the geologic time scale
evolutionary developmental paleobiology examines the evolutionary aspects of the modes and trajectories of growth and development in the evolution of life clades both extinct and extant see also adaptive radiation cladistics evolutionary biology developmental biology and phylogenetic tree
== paleobiologists ==
the founder or father of modern paleobiology was baron franz nopcsa (1877 to 1933) a hungarian scientist trained at the university of vienna he initially termed the discipline paleophysiology.
however credit for coining the word paleobiology itself should go to professor charles schuchert he proposed the term in 1904 so as to initiate a broad new science joining traditional paleontology with the evidence and insights of geology and isotopic chemistry.
on the other hand charles doolittle walcott a smithsonian adventurer has been cited as the founder of precambrian paleobiology. although best known as the discoverer of the mid-cambrian burgess shale animal fossils in 1883 this american curator found the first precambrian fossil cells known to science a stromatolite reef then known as cryptozoon algae in 1899 he discovered the first acritarch fossil cells a precambrian algal phytoplankton he named chuaria lastly in 1914 walcott reported minute cells and chains of cell-like bodies belonging to precambrian purple bacteria
later 20th-century paleobiologists have also figured prominently in finding archaean and proterozoic eon microfossils in 1954 stanley a tyler and elso s barghoorn described 2.1 billion-year-old cyanobacteria and fungi-like microflora at their gunflint chert fossil site eleven years later barghoorn and j william schopf reported finely-preserved precambrian microflora at their bitter springs site of the amadeus basin central australia
finally in 1993 schopf discovered o2-producing blue-green bacteria at his 3.5 billion-year-old apex chert site in pilbara craton marble bar in the northwestern part of western australia so paleobiologists were at last homing in on the origins of the precambrian oxygen catastrophe.
