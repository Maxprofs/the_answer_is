the ulna (/ln/) is one of the two long bones in the forearm (the other is the radius) it extends from the elbow to the wrist and runs parallel to the radius which it exceeds in length and size in anatomical position when the arms are down at the sides of the body and the palms of the hands face forward the ulna is located at the side of the forearm closest to the body (the medial side) the bone may break due to excessive weight or impact
== structureedit ==
the ulna is broader close to the elbow and narrows at it approaches the wrist
close to the elbow the ulna has a bony process the olecranon process a hook-like structure that fits into the olecranon fossa of the humerus this prevents hyperextension and forms a hinge joint with the trochlea of the humerus there is also a radial notch for the head of the radius and the ulnar tuberosity to which muscles attach
close to the wrist the ulna has a styloid process
=== histologyedit ===
the ulna is a long bone the long narrow medullary cavity of the ulna is enclosed in a strong wall of cortical tissue which is thickest along the interosseous border and dorsal surface at the extremities the compact layer thins the compact layer is continued onto the back of the olecranon as a plate of close spongy bone with lamell parallel from the inner surface of this plate and the compact layer below it trabecul arch forward toward the olecranon and coronoid and cross other trabecul passing backward over the medullary cavity from the upper part of the shaft below the coronoid below the coronoid process there is a small area of compact bone from which trabecul curve upward to end obliquely to the surface of the semilunar notch which is coated with a thin layer of compact bone the trabecul at the lower end have a more longitudinal direction
=== developmentedit ===
the ulna is ossified from three centers one each for the body the inferior extremity and the top of the olecranon ossification begins near the middle of the body of the ulna about the eighth week of fetal life and soon extends through the greater part of the bone
at birth the ends are cartilaginous about the fourth year a center appears in the middle of the head and soon extends into the ulnar styloid process about the tenth year a center appears in the olecranon near its extremity the chief part of this process being formed by an upward extension of the body the upper epiphysis joins the body about the sixteenth the lower about the twentieth year
== functionedit ==
=== jointsedit ===
the ulna forms part of the wrist joint and elbow joints specifically the ulna articulates with
trochlea of the humerus at the right side elbow as a hinge joint with semilunar trochlear notch of the ulna
the radius near the elbow as a pivot joint this allows the radius to cross over the ulna in pronation
the distal radius where it fits into the ulnar notch
the radius along its length via the interosseous membrane that forms a syndesmosis joint
=== muscle attachmentsedit ===
== clinical significanceedit ==
=== fracturesedit ===
specific fracture types of the ulna include
monteggia fracture - a fracture of the proximal third of the ulna with the dislocation of the head of the radius
hume fracture - a fracture of the olecranon with an associated anterior dislocation of the radial head
conservative management is possible for ulnar fractures when they are located in the distal two-thirds only involve the shaft with no shortening less than 10 angulation and less than 50% displacement in such case a cast should be applied that goes above the elbow
== in other animalsedit ==
in four-legged animals the radius is the main load-bearing bone of the lower forelimb and the ulna is important primarily for muscular attachment in many mammals the ulna is partially or wholly fused with the radius and may therefore not exist as a separate bone however even in extreme cases of fusion such as in horses the olecranon process is still present albeit as a projection from the upper radius
