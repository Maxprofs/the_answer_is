pressuregradient force force results difference pressure across surface general pressure force per unit area across surface difference pressure across surface implies difference force result acceleration according newtons second law additional force balance resulting force always directed region higherpressure region lowerpressure fluid equilibrium state ie net forces acceleration system referred hydrostatic equilibrium case atmospheres pressure gradient force balanced gravitational force maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium earths atmosphere example air pressure decreases increasing altitudes earths surface thus providing pressure gradient force counteracts force gravity atmosphere
formalism
consider cubic parcel fluid density height surface area mass parcel expressed using newtons second law examine pressure difference assumed direction find resulting force
acceleration resulting pressure gradient
effects pressure gradient usually expressed way terms acceleration instead terms force express acceleration precisely general pressure
direction resulting force acceleration thus opposite direction rapid increase pressure
