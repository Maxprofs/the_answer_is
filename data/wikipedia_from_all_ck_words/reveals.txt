conversation is a form of interactive spontaneous communication between two or more people typically it occurs in spoken communication as written exchanges are usually not referred to as conversations the development of conversational skills and etiquette is an important part of socialization the development of conversational skills in a new language is a frequent focus of language teaching and learning
conversation analysis is a branch of sociology which studies the structure and organization of human interaction with a more specific focus on conversational interaction
== definition and characterization ==
no generally accepted definition of conversation exists beyond the fact that a conversation involves at least two people talking together consequently the term is often defined by what it is not a ritualized exchange such a mutual greeting is not a conversation and an interaction that includes a marked status differential (such as a boss giving orders) is also not a conversation an interaction with a tightly focused topic or purpose is also generally not considered a conversation summarizing these properties one authority writes that conversation is the kind of speech that happens informally symmetrically and for the purposes of establishing and maintaining social ties.
from a less technical perspective a writer on etiquette in the early 20th century defined conversation as the polite give and take of subjects thought of by people talking with each other for company
conversations follow rules of etiquette because conversations are social interactions and therefore depend on social convention specific rules for conversation arise from the cooperative principle failure to adhere to these rules causes the conversation to deteriorate or eventually to end contributions to a conversation are responses to what has previously been said
conversations may be the optimal form of communication depending on the participants intended ends conversations may be ideal when for example each party desires a relatively equal exchange of information or when the parties desire to build social ties on the other hand if permanency or the ability to review such information is important written communication may be ideal or if time-efficient communication is most important a speech may be preferable
== classification ==
=== banter ===
banter are short witty sentences that bounce back and forth between individuals often banter uses clever put-downs and witty insults misunderstandings (often intentional) wisecracks zingers flirtation and puns the idea is each line of banter should top the one before it and in short a verbal war of wit without physical contact
films that have used banter as an way of structure in conversations are
the big sleep (1946)
his girl friday (1940)
bringing up baby (1938)
=== discussion ===
one element of conversation is discussion sharing opinions on subjects that are thought of during the conversation in polite society the subject changes before discussion becomes dispute for example if theology is being discussed no one is insisting a particular view be accepted
=== subject ===
many conversations can be divided into four categories according to their major subject content
conversations about subjective ideas which often serve to extend understanding and awareness
conversations about objective facts which may serve to consolidate a widely held view
conversations about other people (usually absent) which may be either critical competitive or supportive this includes gossip
conversations about oneself which sometimes indicate attention-seeking behavior or can provide relevant information about oneself to participants in the conversation
practically few conversations fall exclusively into one category nevertheless the proportional distribution of any given conversation between the categories can offer useful psychological insights into the mind set of the participants this is the reason that the majority of conversations are difficult to categorize
=== functions ===
most conversations may be classified by their goal conversational ends may however shift over the life of the conversation
functional conversation is designed to convey information in order to help achieve an individual or group goal
small talk is a type of conversation where the topic is less important than the social purpose of achieving bonding between people or managing personal distance

=== conversation between strangers ===

=== conversational narcissism ===
conversational narcissism is a term used by sociologist charles derber in his book the pursuit of attention power and ego in everyday life
derber observed that the social support system in america is relatively weak and this leads people to compete mightily for attention in social situations they tend to steer the conversation away from others and toward themselves conversational narcissism is the key manifestation of the dominant attention-getting psychology in america, he wrote it occurs in informal conversations among friends family and coworkers the profusion of popular literature about listening and the etiquette of managing those who talk constantly about themselves suggests its pervasiveness in everyday life.
what derber describes as conversational narcissism often occurs subtly rather than overtly because it is prudent to avoid being judged an egotist
derber distinguishes the shift-response from the support-response a shift response takes the focus of attention away from the last speaker and refocuses on the new speaker as in john i'm feeling really starved mary oh i just ate whereas a support response maintains the focus on the last speaker as in john i'm feeling really starved mary when was the last time you ate
=== conversation with artificial intelligence ===
the ability to generate conversation that cannot be distinguished from a human participant has been one test of a successful artificial intelligence (the turing test) a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with one human and one machine each of which tries to appear human if the judge cannot tell the machine from the human the machine is said to have passed the test one limitation is that the conversation is limited to a text not allowing tone to be shown
