a pedometer is a device usually portable and electronic or electromechanical that counts each step a person takes by detecting the motion of the person's hands or hips because the distance of each person's step varies an informal calibration performed by the user is required if presentation of the distance covered in a unit of length (such as in kilometres or miles) is desired though there are now pedometers that use electronics and software to automatically determine how a person's step varies distance travelled (by walking or any other means) can be measured directly by a gps tracker
used originally by sports and physical fitness enthusiasts pedometers are now becoming popular as an everyday exercise measurer and motivator often worn on the belt and kept on all day it can record how many steps the wearer has walked that day and thus the kilometres or miles (distance = number of steps step length) some pedometers will also erroneously record movements other than walking such as bending to tie one's shoes or road bumps incurred while riding a vehicle though the most advanced devices record fewer of these false steps step counters can give encouragement to compete with oneself in getting fit and losing weight a total of 10,000 steps per day equivalent to 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) is recommended by some to be the benchmark for an active lifestyle although this point is debated among experts thirty minutes of moderate walking are equivalent to 3,000-4,000 steps as determined by a pedometer step counters are being integrated into an increasing number of portable consumer electronic devices such as music players smartphones and mobile phones
== usageedit ==
pedometers can be a motivation tool for people wanting to increase their physical activity various websites exist to allow people to track their progress however many will also find entering their daily step count and a heart-beat count onto a calendar to be motivational as well pedometers have been shown in clinical studies to increase physical activity and reduce blood pressure levels and body mass index a study published in the journal of the american medical association nov 2007 concluded the results suggest that the use of a pedometer is associated with significant increases in physical activity and significant decreases in body mass index and blood pressure
a daily target of 10,000 steps was first proposed the target has been recommended by the us surgeon general and by the uk department of health the main criticisms of setting a universal target are that it is not achievable for older persons with mobility problems or people with chronic diseases but on the other hand the target is probably too low for children
one criticism of the pedometer is that it does not record intensity but this can be done by making step goals time limited (for example 1000 steps in 10 minutes counts as moderate exercise)
== historyedit ==
leonardo da vinci envisioned a mechanical pedometer as a device with military applications in 1780 abraham-louis perrelet of switzerland created the first pedometer measuring the steps and distance while walking it was based on a 1770 mechanism of his to power a self-winding watch a mechanical pedometer obtained from france was introduced in the us by thomas jefferson it is not known if he modified the design although this pedometer is widely attributed to jefferson proof is difficult to obtain as he did not apply for patents on any of his inventions
in 1965 a pedometer called a manpo-kei (meaning 10,000 steps meter japanese ) was marketed in japan by y hatano y hatano promoted manpo-kei pedometers from 1985 after his research was accepted as proving that 10,000 steps a day was the proper balance of caloric intake and activity-based caloric expenditure to maintain a healthy body jiro kato who founded yamasa tokei keiki co. ltd in tokyo manufactured pedometers recognized to be accurate and named them manpo-meter (later manpo-kei registered as a trademark of the company) claimed to be the world's first device to measure number of steps of walking
== technologyedit ==
the technology for a pedometer includes a mechanical sensor and software to count steps early forms used a mechanical switch to detect steps together with a simple counter if one shakes these devices one hears a lead ball sliding back and forth or a pendulum striking stops as it swings today advanced step counters rely on mems inertial sensors and sophisticated software to detect steps these mems sensors have either 1- 2- or 3-axis detection of acceleration the use of mems inertial sensors permits more accurate detection of steps and fewer false positives the software technology used to interpret the output of the inertial sensor and make sense of accurate steps varies widely the problem is compounded by the fact that in modern day-to-day life such step-counters are expected to count accurately on locations where users frequently carry their devices (attached to the belt shirt/pants pocket hand bag backpack)
== accuracyedit ==
the accuracy of step counters varies widely between devices typically step counters are reasonably accurate at a walking pace on a flat surface if the device is placed in its optimal position (usually vertically on the belt clip) although traditional step counters get affected dramatically when placed at different angles and locations recent advances have made them more robust to those non-ideal placements still most step counters falsely count steps when a user is driving a car or makes other habitual motions that the device encounters throughout the day this error accumulates for users with moderate commutes to work accuracy also depends on the step-length the user enters
best pedometers are accurate to within 5% error
== integration in personal electronic devicesedit ==
=== apple ipod nanoedit ===
the 5th and 6th generation ipod nano by apple features an integrated accelerometer
=== nike&ipodedit ===
apple and nike inc offer the nike+ipod sports kit which uses a shoe sensor that communicates with an iphone (3gs or higher) ipod touch (2nd generation or higher) ipod nano (4th generation or higher) or dedicated adapter to transmit workout information such as elapsed time distance traveled and calories burned
=== fitbitedit ===
the fitbit is an always-on electronic pedometer that in addition to counting steps also displays distance traveled altitude climbed (via a number of flights of steps count) calories burned current intensity and time of day worn in an armband at night it also purports to measure the length and quality of a user's sleep inbuilt is a daily target of 10,000 steps and 10 flights of stairs connected by usb with a computer the user's data is automatically uploaded and displayed via a web-based profile page that keeps track of historical data to which can be added food consumption data based on activity users are awarded badges for daily step and climbing targets as well as lifetime awards for same in the us and uk users can also download an ios or android app for recording and display of data
=== pedometers for smartphones/mp3 playersedit ===
since most of the smartphones ipod touches and some mp3 players are enhanced with an integrated accelerometer it is possible to introduce pedometer functionality to these devices this option was successfully realized by a number of smartphone applications developers enabling any fitness savvy smartphone owners to track the number of steps taken as well as passed distance and burnt calories

=== iphone 5sedit ===
the iphone 5s contains a chip called the m7 chip which allows the main cpu to snooze while it tracks the motion of the phone through the use of an inertial measurement unit consisting of an accelerometer mems gyroscope and compass this means that it will know when you're jogging or when you're in the car and can take that information and store it without needing to drain the battery by having the main cpu chugging away it can retrofit the data to apps that you download at a later date meaning any m7-enabled app that uses the new coremotion api will be able to give you information on recent training it
