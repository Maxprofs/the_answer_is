chlorophyll (also chlorophyl) is a term used for several closely related green pigments found in cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of algae and plants its name is derived from the greek words  chloros ("green") and  phyllon ("leaf") chlorophyll is an extremely important biomolecule critical in photosynthesis which allows plants to absorb energy from light chlorophyll absorbs light most strongly in the blue portion of the electromagnetic spectrum followed by the red portion conversely it is a poor absorber of green and near-green portions of the spectrum which it reflects hence the green color of chlorophyll-containing tissues chlorophyll was first isolated and named by joseph bienaim caventou and pierre joseph pelletier in 1817

== chlorophyll and photosynthesis ==
chlorophyll is vital for photosynthesis which allows plants to absorb energy from light
chlorophyll molecules are specifically arranged in and around photosystems that are embedded in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts in these complexes chlorophyll serves two primary functions the function of the vast majority of chlorophyll (up to several hundred molecules per photosystem) is to absorb light and transfer that light energy by resonance energy transfer to a specific chlorophyll pair in the reaction center of the photosystems the two currently accepted photosystem units are potosystem ii and photosystem i which have their own distinct reaction centres named p680 and p700 respectively these centres are named after the wavelength (in nanometers) of their red-peak absorption maximum the identity function and spectral properties of the types of chlorophyll in each photosystem are distinct and determined by each other and the protein structure surrounding them once extracted from the protein into a solvent (such as acetone or methanol) these chlorophyll pigments can be separated into chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b
the function of the reaction center of chlorophyll is to absorb light energy and transfer it other parts of the photosystem the absorbed energy of the photon is transferred to an electron in a process called charge separation the removal of the electron from the chlorophyll is an oxidation reaction the chlorophyll donates the high energy electron to a series of molecular intermediates called an electron transport chain the charged reaction center of chlorophyll (p680+) is then reduced back to its ground state by accepting an electron stripped from water the electron that reduces p680+ ultimately comes from the oxidation of water into o2 and h+ through several intermediates this reaction is how photosynthetic organisms such as plants produce o2 gas and is the source for practically all the o2 in earth's atmosphere photosystem i typically works in series with photosystem ii thus the p700+ of photosystem i is usually reduced as it accepts the elecron via many intermediates in the thylakoid membrane by electrons come ultimately from photosystem ii electron transfer reactions in the thylakoid membranes are complex however and the source of electrons used to reduce p700+ can vary
the electron flow produced by the reaction center chlorophyll pigments is used to pump h+ ions across the thylakoid membrane setting up a chemiosmotic potential used mainly in the production of atp (stored chemical energy) or to reduce nadp+ to nadph nadph is a universal agent used to reduce co2 into sugars as well as other biosynthetic reactions
reaction center chlorophyllprotein complexes are capable of directly absorbing light and performing charge separation events without other the assistance of other chlorophyll pigments but the probability of that happening under a given light intensity is small thus the other chlorophylls in the photosystem and antenna pigment proteins all cooperatively absorb and funnel light energy to the reaction center besides chlorophyll a there are other pigments called accessory pigments which occur in these pigmentprotein antenna complexes
== chemical structure ==
chlorophyll is a chlorin pigment which is structurally similar to and produced through the same metabolic pathway as other porphyrin pigments such as heme at the center of the chlorin ring is a magnesium ion this was discovered in 1906 and was the first time that magnesium had been detected in living tissue for the structures depicted in this article some of the ligands attached to the mg2+ center are omitted for clarity the chlorin ring can have several different side chains usually including a long phytol chain there are a few different forms that occur naturally but the most widely distributed form in terrestrial plants is chlorophyll a after initial work done by german chemist richard willsttter spanning from 1905 to 1915 the general structure of chlorophyll a was elucidated by hans fischer in 1940 by 1960 when most of the stereochemistry of chlorophyll a was known robert burns woodward published a total synthesis of the molecule in 1967 the last remaining stereochemical elucidation was completed by ian fleming and in 1990 woodward and co-authors published an updated synthesis chlorophyll f was announced to be present in cyanobacteria and other oxygenic microorganisms that form stromatolites in 2010 a molecular formula of c55h70o6n4mg and a structure of (2-formyl)-chlorophyll a were deduced based on nmr optical and mass spectra the different structures of chlorophyll are summarized below
when leaves degreen in the process of plant senescence chlorophyll is converted to a group of colourless tetrapyrroles known as nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolites (ncc's) with the general structure
these compounds have also been identified in several ripening fruits
== spectrophotometry ==
measurement of the absorption of light is complicated by the solvent used to extract the chlorophyll from plant material which affects the values obtained
in diethyl ether chlorophyll a has approximate absorbance maxima of 430 nm and 662 nm while chlorophyll b has approximate maxima of 453 nm and 642 nm
the absorption peaks of chlorophyll a are at 665 nm and 465 nm chlorophyll a fluoresces at 673 nm (maximum) and 726 nm the peak molar absorption coefficient of chlorophyll a exceeds 105 m1 cm1 which is among the highest for small-molecule organic compounds
in 90% acetone-water the peak absorption wavelengths of chlorophyll a are 430 nm and 664 nm peaks for chlorophyll b are 460 nm and 647 nm peaks for chlorophyll c1 are 442 nm and 630 nm peaks for chlorophyll c2 are 444 nm and 630 nm peaks for chlorophyll d are 401 nm 455 nm and 696 nm
by measuring the absorption of light in the red and far red regions it is possible to estimate the concentration of chlorophyll within a leaf
in his scientific paper gitelson (1999) states the ratio between chlorophyll fluorescence at 735 nm and the wavelength range 700nm to 710 nm f735/f700 was found to be linearly proportional to the chlorophyll content (with determination coefficient r2 more than 0.95) and thus this ratio can be used as a precise indicator of chlorophyll content in plant leaves. the fluorescent ratio chlorophyll content meters use this technique
== biosynthesis ==
in plants chlorophyll may be synthesized from succinyl-coa and glycine although the immediate precursor to chlorophyll a and b is protochlorophyllide in angiosperm plants the last step conversion of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll is light-dependent and such plants are pale (etiolated) if grown in the darkness non-vascular plants and green algae have an additional light-independent enzyme and grow green in the darkness instead
chlorophyll itself is bound to proteins and can transfer the absorbed energy in the required direction protochlorophyllide occurs mostly in the free form and under light conditions acts as a photosensitizer forming highly toxic free radicals hence plants need an efficient mechanism of regulating the amount of chlorophyll precursor in angiosperms this is done at the step of aminolevulinic acid (ala) one of the intermediate compounds in the biosynthesis pathway plants that are fed by ala accumulate high and toxic levels of protochlorophyllide so do the mutants with the damaged regulatory system
chlorosis is a condition in which leaves produce insufficient chlorophyll turning them yellow chlorosis can be caused by a nutrient deficiency of ironcalled iron chlorosisor by a shortage of magnesium or nitrogen soil ph sometimes plays a role in nutrient-caused chlorosis many plants are adapted to grow in soils with specific ph levels and their ability to absorb nutrients from the soil can be dependent on this chlorosis can also be caused by pathogens including viruses bacteria and fungal infections or sap-sucking insects
== complementary light absorbance of anthocyanins with chlorophylls ==
anthocyanins are other plant pigments the absorbance pattern responsible for the red color of anthocyanins may be complementary to that of green chlorophyll in photosynthetically active tissues such as young quercus coccifera leaves it may protect the leaves from attacks by plant eaters that may be attracted by green color
== distribution ==
the chlorophyll maps show milligrams of chlorophyll per cubic meter of seawater each month places where chlorophyll amounts were very low indicating very low numbers of phytoplankton are blue places where chlorophyll concentrations were high meaning many phytoplankton were growing are yellow the observations come from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (modis) on nasas aqua satellite land is dark gray and places where modis could not collect data because of sea ice polar darkness or clouds are light gray.the highest chlorophyll concentrations where tiny surface-dwelling ocean plants are thriving are in cold polar waters or in places where ocean currents bring cold water to the surface such as around the equator and along the shores of continents it is not the cold water itself that stimulates the phytoplankton instead the cool temperatures are often a sign that the water has welled up to the surface from deeper in the ocean carrying nutrients that have built up over time in polar waters nutrients accumulate in surface waters during the dark winter months when plants cant grow when sunlight returns in the spring and summer the plants flourish in high concentrations
== culinary use ==
chlorophyll is registered as a food additive (colorant) and its e number is e140 chefs use chlorophyll to color a variety of foods and beverages green such as pasta and absinthe chlorophyll is not soluble in water and it is first mixed with a small quantity of vegetable oil to obtain the desired solution
== alternative medicine ==
many claims are made about the healing properties of chlorophyll but most have been disproved or are exaggerated by the companies that are marketing them in 1952 the toledo blade published a story titled chlorophyll held useless as body deodorant arguing that the wide use of chlorophyll was ineffective in its purported purpose quackwatch a website dedicated to debunking false medical claims notes that no deodorant effect can possibly occur from the quantities of chlorophyll put in products such as gum foot powder cough drops etc. the american cancer society states that may people with ileostomy have been helped by chlorophyll tablets to reduce odor
