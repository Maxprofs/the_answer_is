early theories
materialism
earliest theories life materialist holding exists matter life merely complex form arrangement matter empedocles bc argued every thing universe made combination four eternal elements roots earth water air fire change explained arrangement rearrangement four elements various forms life caused appropriate mixture elements
democritus bc thought essential characteristic life soul psyche like ancient writers attempting explain makes something living thing explanation fiery atoms make soul exactly way atoms void account thing elaborates fire apparent connection life heat fire moves
platos world eternal unchanging forms imperfectly represented matter divine artisan contrasts sharply various mechanistic weltanschauungen atomism fourth century least prominent debate persisted throughout ancient world atomistic mechanism got shot arm epicurus stoics adopted divine teleology choice seems simple either show structured regular world could arise undirected processes inject intelligence system
mechanistic materialism originated ancient greece revived revised french philosopher ren descartes held animals humans assemblages parts together functioned machine th century advances cell theory biological science encouraged view evolutionary theory charles darwin mechanistic explanation origin species means natural selection
hylomorphism
hylomorphism theory originating aristotle bc things combination matter form biology one main interests extensive biological material extant writings view things material universe matter form form living thing soul greek psyche latin anima three kinds souls vegetative soul plants causes grow decay nourish cause motion sensation animal soul causes animals move feel rational soul source consciousness reasoning aristotle believed found man higher soul attributes lower one aristotle believed matter exist without form form cannot exist without matter therefore soul cannot exist without body
account consistent teleological explanations life account phenomena terms purpose goaldirectedness thus whiteness polar bears coat explained purpose camouflage direction causality future past contradiction scientific evidence natural selection explains consequence terms prior cause biological features explained looking future optimal results looking past evolutionary history species led natural selection features question
vitalism
vitalism belief lifeprinciple nonmaterial originated stahl th century held sway middle th century appealed philosophers henri bergson nietzsche wilhelm dilthey anatomists like bichat chemists like liebig vitalism included idea fundamental difference organic inorganic material belief organic material derived living things disproved friedrich whler prepared urea inorganic materials whler synthesis considered starting point modern organic chemistry historical significance first time organic compound produced inorganic reactions
helmholtz anticipated mayer demonstrated energy lost muscle movement suggesting vital forces necessary move muscle results led abandonment scientific interest vitalistic theories although belief lingered pseudoscientific theories homeopathy interprets diseases sickness caused disturbances hypothetical vital force life force
definitions
challenge scientists philosophers define life partially life process substance definition must general enough encompass known life unknown life may different life earth may even consider life real concept instead
biology
since unequivocal definition life current understanding descriptive life considered characteristic something exhibits following traits
homeostasis regulation internal environment maintain constant state example sweating reduce temperature
organization structurally composed one cells basic units life
metabolism transformation energy converting chemicals energy cellular components anabolism decomposing organic matter catabolism living things require energy maintain internal organization homeostasis produce phenomena associated life
growth maintenance higher rate anabolism catabolism growing organism increases size parts rather simply accumulating matter
adaptation ability change time response environment ability fundamental process evolution determined organisms heredity diet external factors
response stimuli response take many forms contraction unicellular organism external chemicals complex reactions involving senses multicellular organisms response often expressed motion example leaves plant turning toward sun phototropism chemotaxis
reproduction ability produce new individual organisms either asexually single parent organism sexually two parent organisms error rate sustainability threshold
complex processes called physiological functions underlying physical chemical bases well signaling control mechanisms essential maintaining life
alternatives
reflect minimum phenomena required biological definitions life proposed many based upon chemical systems biophysicists commented living things function negative entropy words living processes viewed delay spontaneous diffusion dispersion internal energy biological molecules towards potential microstates detail according physicists john bernal erwin schrdinger eugene wigner john avery life member class phenomena open continuous systems able decrease internal entropy expense substances free energy taken environment subsequently rejected degraded form higher level living beings thermodynamic systems organized molecular structure life matter reproduce evolve survival dictates hence life selfsustained chemical system capable undergoing darwinian evolution
others take systemic viewpoint necessarily depend molecular chemistry one systemic definition life living things selforganizing autopoietic selfproducing variations definition include stuart kauffmans definition autonomous agent multiagent system capable reproducing completing least one thermodynamic work cycle
viruses
viruses often considered replicators rather forms life described organisms edge life since possess genes evolve natural selection replicate creating multiple copies selfassembly however viruses metabolize require host cell make new products virus selfassembly within host cells implications study origin life may support hypothesis life could started selfassembling organic molecules
living systems theories
idea earth alive found philosophy religion first scientific discussion scottish scientist james hutton stated earth superorganism proper study physiology hutton considered father geology idea living earth forgotten intense reductionism th century gaia hypothesis proposed scientist james lovelock suggests life earth functions single organism defines maintains environmental conditions necessary survival
first attempt general living systems theory explaining nature life american biologist james grier miller general theory arising ecological biological sciences attempts map general principles living systems work instead examining phenomena attempting break things component parts general living systems theory explores phenomena terms dynamic patterns relationships organisms environment robert rosen built defining system component unit organization part function ie definite relation part whole starting concepts developed relational theory systems attempts explain special properties life specifically identified nonfractionability components organism fundamental difference living systems biological machines
systems view life treats environmental fluxes biological fluxes together reciprocity influence reciprocal relation environment arguably important understanding life understanding ecosystems harold j morowitz explains life property ecological system rather single organism species argues ecosystemic definition life preferable strictly biochemical physical one robert ulanowicz highlights mutualism key understand systemic ordergenerating behavior life ecosystems
complex systems biology csb field science studies emergence complexity functional organisms viewpoint dynamic systems theory latter often called also systems biology aims understand fundamental aspects life closely related approach csb systems biology called relational biology concerned mainly understanding life processes terms important relations categories relations among essential functional components organisms multicellular organisms defined categorical biology model representation organisms category theory biological relations also algebraic topology functional organization living organisms terms dynamic complex networks metabolic genetic epigenetic processes signaling pathways
also argued evolution order living systems certain physical systems obey common fundamental principle termed darwinian dynamic darwinian dynamic formulated first considering macroscopic order generated simple nonbiological system far thermodynamic equilibrium extending consideration short replicating rna molecules underlying order generating process types system concluded basically similar
another systemic definition called operator theory proposes life general term presence typical closures found organisms typical closures membrane autocatalytic set cell also proposes organism system organisation complies operator type least complex cell life also modeled network inferior negative feedbacks regulatory mechanisms subordinated superior positive feedback formed potential expansion reproduction
origin
evidence suggests life earth existed least billion years oldest physical traces life dating back billion years known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms reflecting common descent based observations hypotheses origin life attempt find mechanism explaining formation universal common ancestor simple organic molecules via precellular life protocells metabolism models divided genesfirst metabolismfirst categories recent trend emergence hybrid models combine categories
current scientific consensus life originated however accepted scientific models build following observations
millerurey experiment work sidney fox show conditions primitive earth favored chemical reactions synthesize amino acids organic compounds inorganic precursors
phospholipids spontaneously form lipid bilayers basic structure cell membrane
living organisms synthesize proteins polymers amino acids using instructions encoded deoxyribonucleic acid dna protein synthesis entails intermediary ribonucleic acid rna polymers one possibility life began genes originated first followed proteins alternative proteins came first genes
however since genes proteins required produce problem considering came first like chicken egg scientists adopted hypothesis unlikely genes proteins arose independently
therefore possibility first suggested francis crick first life based rna dnalike properties information storage catalytic properties proteins called rna world hypothesis supported observation many critical components cells evolve slowest composed mostly entirely rna also many critical cofactors atp acetylcoa nadh etc either nucleotides substances clearly related catalytic properties rna yet demonstrated hypothesis first proposed confirmed thomas cech
one issue rna world hypothesis synthesis rna simple inorganic precursors difficult organic molecules one reason rna precursors stable react slowly ambient conditions also proposed living organisms consisted molecules rna however successful synthesis certain rna molecules conditions existed prior life earth achieved adding alternative precursors specified order precursor phosphate present throughout reaction study makes rna world hypothesis plausible
geological findings showed reactive phosphorus species like phosphite abundance ocean ga schreibersite easily reacts aqueous glycerol generate phosphite glycerol phosphate hypothesized schreibersitecontaining meteorites late heavy bombardment could provided early reduced phosphorus could react prebiotic organic molecules form phosphorylated biomolecules like rna
experiments demonstrated darwinian evolution twocomponent system rna enzymes ribozymes vitro work performed laboratory gerald joyce stated first example outside biology evolutionary adaptation molecular genetic system
prebiotic compounds may extraterrestrial origin nasa findings based studies meteorites found earth suggest dna rna components adenine guanine related organic molecules may formed outer space
march nasa scientists reported first time complex dna rna organic compounds life including uracil cytosine thymine formed laboratory outer space conditions using starting chemicals pyrimidine found meteorites pyrimidine like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs carbonrich chemical found universe may formed red giants interstellar dust gas clouds according scientists
according panspermia hypothesis microscopic lifedistributed meteoroids asteroids small solar system bodiesmay exist throughout universe
environmental conditions
diversity life earth result dynamic interplay genetic opportunity metabolic capability environmental challenges symbiosis existence earths habitable environment dominated microorganisms subjected metabolism evolution consequence microbial activities physicalchemical environment earth changing geologic time scale thereby affecting path evolution subsequent life example release molecular oxygen cyanobacteria byproduct photosynthesis induced global changes earths environment since oxygen toxic life earth time posed novel evolutionary challenges ultimately resulted formation earths major animal plant species interplay organisms environment inherent feature living systems
life forms require certain core chemical elements needed biochemical functioning include carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen phosphorus sulfurthe elemental macronutrients organismsoften represented acronym chnops together make nucleic acids proteins lipids bulk living matter five six elements comprise chemical components dna exception sulfur latter component amino acids cysteine methionine biologically abundant elements carbon desirable attribute forming multiple stable covalent bonds allows carbonbased organic molecules form immense variety chemical arrangements alternative hypothetical types biochemistry proposed eliminate one elements swap element one list change required chiralities chemical properties
range tolerance
inert components ecosystem physical chemical factors necessary life energy sunlight chemical energy water temperature atmosphere gravity nutrients ultraviolet solar radiation protection ecosystems conditions vary day one season next live ecosystems organisms must able survive range conditions called range tolerance outside zones physiological stress survival reproduction possible optimal beyond zones zones intolerance survival reproduction organism unlikely impossible organisms wide range tolerance widely distributed organisms narrow range tolerance
survive selected microorganisms assume forms enable withstand freezing complete desiccation starvation high levels radiation exposure physical chemical challenges microorganisms may survive exposure conditions weeks months years even centuries extremophiles microbial life forms thrive outside ranges life commonly found excel exploiting uncommon sources energy organisms composed nearly identical molecules evolution enabled microbes cope wide range physical chemical conditions characterization structure metabolic diversity microbial communities extreme environments ongoing
microbial life forms thrive even mariana trench deepest spot earth microbes also thrive inside rocks feet sea floor feet ocean
investigation tenacity versatility life earth well understanding molecular systems organisms utilize survive extremes important search life beyond earth example lichen could survive month simulated martian environment
form function
cells basic unit structure every living thing cells arise preexisting cells division cell theory formulated henri dutrochet theodor schwann rudolf virchow others early nineteenth century subsequently became widely accepted activity organism depends total activity cells energy flow occurring within cells contain hereditary information carried forward genetic code cell division
two primary types cells prokaryotes lack nucleus membranebound organelles although circular dna ribosomes bacteria archaea two domains prokaryotes primary type cells eukaryotes distinct nuclei bound nuclear membrane membranebound organelles including mitochondria chloroplasts lysosomes rough smooth endoplasmic reticulum vacuoles addition possess organized chromosomes store genetic material species large complex organisms eukaryotes including animals plants fungi though species eukaryote protist microorganisms conventional model eukaryotes evolved prokaryotes main organelles eukaryotes forming endosymbiosis bacteria progenitor eukaryotic cell
molecular mechanisms cell biology based proteins synthesized ribosomes enzymecatalyzed process called protein biosynthesis sequence amino acids assembled joined together based upon gene expression cells nucleic acid eukaryotic cells proteins may transported processed golgi apparatus preparation dispatch destination
cells reproduce process cell division parent cell divides two daughter cells prokaryotes cell division occurs process fission dna replicated two copies attached parts cell membrane eukaryotes complex process mitosis followed however end result resulting cell copies identical original cell except mutations capable division following interphase period
multicellular organisms may first evolved formation colonies like cells cells form group organisms cell adhesion individual members colony capable surviving whereas members true multicellular organism developed specializations making dependent remainder organism survival organisms formed clonally single germ cell capable forming various specialized cells form adult organism specialization allows multicellular organisms exploit resources efficiently single cells
cells evolved methods perceive respond microenvironment thereby enhancing adaptability cell signaling coordinates cellular activities hence governs basic functions multicellular organisms signaling cells occur direct cell contact using juxtacrine signalling indirectly exchange agents endocrine system complex organisms coordination activities occur dedicated nervous system
classification
first known attempt classify organisms conducted greek philosopher aristotle bc classified living organisms known time either plant animal based mainly ability move also distinguished animals blood animals without blood least without red blood compared concepts vertebrates invertebrates respectively divided blooded animals five groups viviparous quadrupeds mammals oviparous quadrupeds reptiles amphibians birds fishes whales bloodless animals also divided five groups cephalopods crustaceans insects included spiders scorpions centipedes addition define insects today shelled animals molluscs echinoderms zoophytes though aristotles work zoology without errors grandest biological synthesis time remained ultimate authority many centuries death
exploration american continent revealed large numbers new plants animals needed descriptions classification latter part th century beginning th careful study animals commenced gradually extended formed sufficient body knowledge serve anatomical basis classification late carl linnaeus introduced system binomial nomenclature classification species linnaeus attempted improve composition reduce length previously used manyworded names abolishing unnecessary rhetoric introducing new descriptive terms precisely defining meaning consistently using system linnaeus separated nomenclature taxonomy
fungi originally treated plants short period linnaeus classified taxon vermes animalia later placed back plantae copeland classified fungi protoctista thus partially avoiding problem acknowledging special status problem eventually solved whittaker gave kingdom fivekingdom system evolutionary history shows fungi closely related animals plants
new discoveries enabled detailed study cells microorganisms new groups life revealed fields cell biology microbiology created new organisms originally described separately protozoa animals protophytathallophyta plants united haeckel kingdom protista later prokaryotes split kingdom monera would eventually divided two separate groups bacteria archaea led sixkingdom system eventually current threedomain system based evolutionary relationships however classification eukaryotes especially protists still controversial
microbiology molecular biology virology developed noncellular reproducing agents discovered viruses viroids whether considered alive matter debate viruses lack characteristics life cell membranes metabolism ability grow respond environments viruses still classed species based biology genetics many aspects classification remain controversial
trend called cladistics emerged arranging taxa based clades evolutionary phylogenetic tree
extraterrestrial life
earth planet known harbor life locations within solar system may host microbial life include subsurface mars atmosphere venus subsurface oceans moons gas giant planets variables drake equation used discuss conditions solar systems civilization likely exist
beyond solar system region around another main sequence star could support earthlike life earthlike planet known habitable zone inner outer radii zone vary luminosity star time interval zone survives stars massive sun larger habitable zone remain main sequence shorter time interval small red dwarf stars opposite problem smaller habitable zone subject higher levels magnetic activity effects tidal locking close orbits hence stars intermediate mass range sun may greater likelihood earthlike life develop location star within galaxy may also impact likelihood life forming stars regions greater abundance heavier elements form planets combination low rate potentially habitatdamaging supernova events predicted higher probability hosting planets complex life
death
death permanent termination vital functions life processes organism cell occur result accident medical conditions biological interaction malnutrition poisoning senescence suicide death remains organism reenter biogeochemical cycle organisms may consumed predator scavenger leftover organic material may decomposed detritivores organisms recycle detritus returning environment reuse food chain
one challenges defining death distinguishing life death would seem refer either moment life ends state follows life begins however determining death occurred requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries life death problematic however little consensus define life nature death millennia central concern worlds religious traditions philosophical inquiry many religions maintain faith either kind afterlife reincarnation soul resurrection body later date
extinction process group taxa species dies reducing biodiversity moment extinction generally considered death last individual species species potential range may large determining moment difficult usually done retrospectively period apparent absence species become extinct longer able survive changing habitat superior competition earths history species ever lived gone extinct however mass extinctions may accelerated evolution providing opportunities new groups organisms diversify
fossils preserved remains traces animals plants organisms remote past totality fossils discovered undiscovered placement fossilcontaining rock formations sedimentary layers strata known fossil record preserved specimen called fossil older arbitrary date years ago hence fossils range age youngest start holocene epoch oldest archaean eon billion years old
