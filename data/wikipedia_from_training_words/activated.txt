protease-activated receptors are a subfamily of related g protein-coupled receptors that are activated by cleavage of part of their extracellular domain they are highly expressed in platelets but also on endothelial cells myocytes and neurons
== classification ==
there are 4 known protease-activated receptors or pars numbered from one to four these receptors are members of the seven transmembrane g-protein-coupled receptor superfamily and are expressed throughout the body
== activation ==
pars are activated by the action of serine proteases such as thrombin (acts on pars 1 3 and 4) and trypsin (par 2) these enzymes cleave the n-terminus of the receptor which in turn acts as a tethered ligand in the cleaved state part of the receptor itself acts as the agonist causing a physiological response
most of the par family act through the actions of g-proteins i (camp inhibitory) 12/13 (rho and ras activation) and q (calcium signalling) to cause cellular actions
== function ==
the cellular effects of thrombin are mediated by protease-activated receptors (pars) thrombin signalling in platelets contributes to hemostasis and thrombosis endothelial pars participate in the regulation of vascular tone and permeability while in vascular smooth muscle they mediate contraction proliferation and hypertrophy pars contribute to the pro-inflammatory response observed in atherosclerosis and restenosis recent research has also implicated these novel receptors in muscle growth and bone cell differentiation and proliferation
in t cells activation of par1 par2 and par3 induce tyrosine phosphorylation of vav1 activation of pars also led to an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of zap-70 and slp-76 two key proteins in t cell receptor (tcr) signalling
