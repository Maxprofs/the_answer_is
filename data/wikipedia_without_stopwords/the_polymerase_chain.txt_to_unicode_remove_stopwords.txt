splicing dna molecules
pcr reactions two primers one end used per sequence splice two dna molecules special primers used ends joined molecule primer end joined constructed overhang complementary end molecule following annealing replication occurs dna extended new sequence complementary molecule joined dna molecules extended manner mixed pcr carried primers far ends overlapping complementary sequences introduced serve primers two sequences fused method advantage gene splicing techniques requiring restriction sites

introduction mutations
insert mutation dna sequence specific primer designed primer may contain single substitution contain new sequence end deletion required sequence deletion added end primer must complementarity template strand primer sufficiently anneal template dna
following annealing primer template dna replication proceeds end template duplex denatured second primer anneals newly formed dna strand containing sequence first primer replication proceeds produce strand required sequence containing mutation
duplex denatured first primer bind latest dna strand replication reaction continues produce fully dimerised dna fragment pcr cycles amplify dna sample separated agarose gel electrophoresis followed electroelution collection
efficiently generating oligonucleotides beyond nucleotides length difficult insert mutation sequence nt primer allow necessary employ overlap extension pcr oepcr sequence modified used make two modified strands mutation opposite ends using technique described mixing denaturation strands allowed anneal produce three different combinations detailed diagram duplex without overlap end allow extension dna polymerase direction
following separation eluted fragments appropriate size subject normal pcr using outermost primers used initial mutagenic pcr reactions
