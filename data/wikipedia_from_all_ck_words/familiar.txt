in european folklore and folk-belief of the medieval and early modern periods familiar spirits (sometimes referred to simply as familiars or animal guides") were believed to be supernatural entities that would assist witches and cunning folk in their practice of magic according to the records of the time they would appear in numerous guises often as an animal but also at times as a human or humanoid figure and were described as clearly defined three-dimensional forms vivid with colour and animated with movement and sound by those alleging to have come into contact with them unlike later descriptions of ghosts with their smoky undefined form[s]
when they served witches they were often thought to be malevolent while when working for cunning-folk they were often thought of as benevolent (although there was some ambiguity in both cases) the former were often categorised as demons while the latter were more commonly thought of and described as fairies the main purpose of familiars is to serve the witch or young witch providing protection for them as they come into their new powers
since the 20th century a number of magical practitioners including adherents of the neopagan religion of wicca have begun to utilise the concept of familiars due to their association with older forms of magic these contemporary practitioners utilize pets wildlife or believe that invisible spirit versions of familiars act as magical aids

the goldi [nanai people in siberia] clearly distinguish between the tutelary spirit (ayami) which chooses the shaman and the helping spirits (syven) which are subordinate to it and are granted to the shaman by the ayami itself according to sternberg the goldi explain the relations between the shaman and his ayami by a complex sexual emotion here is the report of a goldi shaman
once i was asleep on my sick-bed when a spirit approached me it was a very beautiful woman her figure was very slight she was no more than half an arshin (71 cm.) tall her face and attire were quite as those of one of our gold women she said i am the ayami of your ancestors the shamans i taught them shamaning now i am going to teach you i love you i have no husband now you will be my husband and i shall be a wife unto you i shall give you assistant spirits you are to heal with their aid and i shall teach and help you myself sometimes she comes under the aspect of an old woman and sometimes under that of a wolf so she is terrible to look at sometimes she comes as a winged tiger she has given me three assistants-the jarga (the panther) the doonto (the bear) and the amba (the tiger) they come to me in my dreams and appear whenever i summon them while shamaning if one of them refuses to come the ayami makes them obey but they say there are some who do not obey even the ayami when i am shamaning the ayami and the assistant spirits are possessing me whether big or small they penetrate me as smoke or vapour would when the ayami is within me it is she who speaks through my mouth and she does everything herself.
== descriptions ==
amongst those accused witches and cunning-folk who described their familiar spirits there were commonly certain unifying features the historian emma wilby noted how the accounts of such familiars were striking for their ordinariness and naturalism despite the fact that they were dealing with supernatural entities
familiar spirits usually had names and were often given down-to-earth and frequently affectionate nicknames. one example of this was tom reid who was the familiar of the cunning-woman and accused witch bessie dunlop while other examples included grizell and gridigut who were the familiars of 17th century huntingdonshire witch jane wallis
== relationship between magical practitioner and familiar ==
using her studies into the role of witchcraft and magic in britain during the early modern period as a starting point the historian emma wilby examined the relationship that familiar spirits allegedly had with the witches and cunning-folk in this period
=== meeting ===
in the british accounts from the early modern period at least there were three main types of encounter narrative related to how a witch or cunning person first met their familiar the first of these was that the spirit spontaneously appeared in front of the individual while they were going about their daily activities either in their home or outdoors somewhere various examples for this are attested in the sources of the time for instance joan prentice from essex england gave an account when she was interrogated for witchcraft in 1589 claiming that she was alone in her chamber and sitting upon a low stool preparing herself to bedward when her familiar first appeared to her while the cornish cunning-woman anne jeffries related in 1645 that hers first appeared to her when she was knitting in an arbour in our garden
the second manner in which the familiar spirit commonly appeared to magical practitioners in britain was that they would be given to a person by a pre-existing individual who was sometimes a family member and at other times a more powerful spirit for instance the alleged witch margaret ley from liverpool claimed in 1667 that she had been given her familiar spirit by her mother when she died while the leicestershire cunning-woman joan willimot related in 1618 that a mysterious figure whom she only referred to as her master willed her to open her mouth and he would blow into her a fairy which should do her good and that she open her mouth and that presently after blowing there came out of her mouth a spirit which stood upon the ground in the shape and form of a woman.
in a number of accounts the cunning person or witch was experiencing difficulty prior to the appearance of the familiar who offered to aid them as historian emma wilby noted their problems were primarily rooted in the struggle for physical survival - the lack of food or money bereavement sickness loss of livelihood and so on and the familiar offered them a way out of this by giving them magical powers
=== working relationship ===
in some cases the magical practitioner then made an agreement or entered a pact with their familiar spirit the length of time that the witch or cunning person worked with their familiar spirit varied between a few weeks through to a number of decades in most cases the magical practitioner would conjure their familiar spirit when they needed their assistance although there are many different ways that they did this the essex witch joan cunny claimed in 1589 that she had to kneel down within a circle and pray to satan for her familiar to appear while the wiltshire cunning woman anne bodenham described in 1653 that she conjured her familiars by reading books in some rarer cases there were accounts where the familiars would appear at times when they were unwanted and not called upon for instance the huntingdonshire witch elizabeth chandler noted in 1646 that she could not control when her two familiars named beelzebub and trullibub appeared to her and had prayed for a god to deliver her therefrom
=== travels to fairyland or the sabbath ===

== prince rupert's dog ==
during the english civil war the royalist general prince rupert was in the habit of taking his large poodle dog named boye into battle with him throughout the war the dog was greatly feared among the parliamentarian forces and credited with supernatural powers as noted by morgan the dog was apparently considered a kind of familiar at the end of the war the dog was shot allegedly with a silver bullet
== witch trials ==
most data regarding familiars comes from the transcripts of english and scottish witch trials held during the 16th-17th centuries the court system that labeled and tried witches was known as the essex the essex trial of agnes sampson of nether keith east lothian in scotland in 1590 presents prosecution testimony regarding a divinatory familiar this case is fundamentally political trying sampson for high treason and accusing sampson for employing witchcraft against king james vi the prosecution asserts sampson called familiar spirits and resolved her doubtful matter another essex trial is that of hellen clark tried in 1645 in which hellen was compelled to state that the devil appeared as a familiar in the form of a dog
the english court cases reflect a strong relationship between state's accusations of witchcraft against those who practiced ancient indigenous traditions including the familiar animal or spirit
in some cases familiars replace children in the favour of their mothers (see witchcraft and children.)
== legacy ==
=== folk tales ===
historian emma wilby identified recurring motifs in various european folk tales and fairy tales that she believed displayed a belief in familiar spirits she noted that in such tales as rumpelstiltskin puss-in-boots and the frog prince the protagonist is approached by a supernatural being when they are in need of aid something that she connected to the appearance of familiar spirits in the early modern accounts of them she believed there to be a direct connection between the belief in and accounts of familiar spirits with these folk tales because these fairy stories and myths originate from the same reservoir of folk belief as the descriptions of familiar-encounters given by cunning-folk and witches
=== historiography ===
recent scholarship on familiars exhibits the depth and respectability absent from earlier demonological approaches the study of familiars has grown from an academic topic in folkloric journals to a general topic in popular books and journals incorporating anthropology history womens studies and other disciplines james sharpe in the encyclopedia of witchcraft the western tradition states folklorists began their investigations in the 19th century [and] found that familiars figured prominently in ideas about witchcraft.
in the 19th century folklorists fired the imagination of scholars who would in decades to come write descriptive volumes on witches and familiars examples of the growth and development of familiar scholarship are found in folklore which consistently contributes articles on traditional beliefs in england and early modern europe
in the first decades of the 20th century familiars are identified as niggets which are creepy-crawly things that witches kept all over them
margaret murray delves into variations of the familiar found in witchcraft practices many of the sources she employs are trial records and demonological texts from early to modern england these include the 1556 essex witchcraft trials of the witches of hatfield perevil the 1582 trial of the witches of st osyth and the 1645 essex trials with matthew hopkins acting as a witch-finder in 1921 murray published the witch cult in western europe her information concerning familiars comes from witchcraft trials in essex in the 16th and 17th centuries
recent scholarship is multi-disciplinary integrating feminist-historical and world-historical approaches deborah willis malevolent nurture witch-hunting and maternal power in early modern england links the witch's attributed relationship with the familiar to a bizarre and misplaced corruption of motherhood and maternal power
