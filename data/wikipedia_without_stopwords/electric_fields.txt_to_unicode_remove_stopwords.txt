electric fields caused electric charges varying magnetic fields former effect described gausss law latter faradays law induction together enough define behavior electric field function charge repartition magnetic field however since magnetic field described function electric field equations fields coupled together form maxwells equations describe fields function charges currents
special case steady state stationary charges currents maxwellfaraday inductive effect disappears resulting two equations gausss law faradays law induction term taken together equivalent coulombs law written charge density denotes position space notice permittivity vacuum must substituted charges considered nonempty media
continuous vs discrete charge repartition
equations electromagnetism best described continuous description however charges sometimes best described discrete points example models may describe electrons punctual sources charge density infinite infinitesimal section space
charge located described mathematically charge density dirac delta function three dimensions used conversely charge distribution approximated many small punctual charge
superposition principle

electrodynamic fields efields change time instance charges motion
electric field cannot described independently magnetic field case magnetic vector potential defined one still define electric potential
one recover faradays law induction taking curl equation
justifies posteriori previous form e
energy electric field
magnetic field b nonzero
total energy per unit volume stored electromagnetic field
permittivity medium field exists magnetic permeability e b electric magnetic field vectors
e b fields coupled would misleading split expression electric magnetic contributions however steadystate case fields longer coupled see maxwells equations makes sense case compute electrostatic energy per unit volume
total energy u stored electric field given volume v therefore
