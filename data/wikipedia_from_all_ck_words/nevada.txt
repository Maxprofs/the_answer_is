nevada is largely desert and semiarid much of it located within the great basin areas south of the great basin are located within the mojave desert while lake tahoe and the sierra nevada lie on the western edge about 86% of the state's land is managed by various jurisdictions of the u.s federal government both civilian and military
before european contact native americans of the paiute shoshone and washoe tribes inhabited the land that is now nevada the first europeans to explore the region were spanish they called the region nevada (snowy) due to the snow which covered the mountains in winter the area formed part of the viceroyalty of new spain and became part of mexico when it gained independence in 1821 the united states annexed the area in 1848 after its victory in the mexicanamerican war and it was incorporated as part of utah territory in 1850 the discovery of silver at the comstock lode in 1859 led to a population boom that became an impetus to the creation of nevada territory out of western utah territory in 1861 nevada became the 36th state on october 31 1864 as the second of two states added to the union during the civil war (the first being west virginia)
nevada has a reputation for its libertarian laws in 1900 with a population of just over 40,000 people nevada was by far the least populated state with less than half the population of the next least-populated state however legalized gambling and lenient marriage and divorce laws transformed nevada into a major tourist destination in the 20th century nevada is the only u.s state where prostitution is legal though it is illegal in las vegas (clark county) and reno (washoe county) the tourism industry remains nevada's largest employer with mining continuing as a substantial sector of the economy nevada is the fourth-largest producer of gold in the world
== etymology and pronunciation ==
the name nevada comes from the spanish nevada [neaa] meaning snow-covered after the sierra nevada ("snow-covered mountain range")
nevadans usually pronounce the second syllable of their state name using the // vowel of bad many from outside the western united states pronounce it with the // vowel of father /nvd/ although the latter pronunciation is closer to the spanish pronunciation it is not the pronunciation preferred by nevadans state assemblyman harry mortenson proposed a bill to recognize the alternate (quasi-spanish) pronunciation of nevada though the bill was not supported by most legislators and never received a vote the native pronunciation is the de facto official one since it is the one used by the state legislature notably the state's official tourism organization travelnevada.com stylizes the name of the state as nevda with a breve accent over the a indicating the locally preferred pronunciation which is also available as a license plate design
== geography ==
nevada is almost entirely within the basin and range province and is broken up by many north-south mountain ranges most of these ranges have endorheic valleys between them which belies the image portrayed by the term great basin
much of the northern part of the state is within the great basin a mild desert that experiences hot temperatures in the summer and cold temperatures in the winter occasionally moisture from the arizona monsoon will cause summer thunderstorms pacific storms may blanket the area with snow the state's highest recorded temperature was 125 f (52 c) in laughlin (elevation of 605 feet or 184 metres) on june 29 1994 the coldest recorded temperature was 52 f (47 c) set in san jacinto in 1972 in the northeastern portion of the state
the humboldt river crosses the state from east to west across the northern part of the state draining into the humboldt sink near lovelock several rivers drain from the sierra nevada eastward including the walker truckee and carson rivers all of these rivers are endorheic basins ending in walker lake pyramid lake and the carson sink respectively however not all of nevada is within the great basin tributaries of the snake river drain the far north while the colorado river which also forms much of the boundary with arizona drains much of southern nevada
the mountain ranges some of which have peaks above 13,000 feet (4,000 m) harbor lush forests high above desert plains creating sky islands for endemic species the valleys are often no lower in elevation than 3,000 feet (910 m) while some in central nevada are above 6,000 feet (1,800 m)
the southern third of the state where the las vegas area is situated is within the mojave desert the area receives less rain in the winter but is closer to the arizona monsoon in the summer the terrain is also lower mostly below 4,000 feet (1,200 m) creating conditions for hot summer days and cool to chilly winter nights (due to temperature inversion)
nevada and california have by far the longest diagonal line (in respect to the cardinal directions) as a state boundary at just over 400 miles (640 km) this line begins in lake tahoe nearly 4 miles (6.4 km) offshore (in the direction of the boundary) and continues to the colorado river where the nevada california and arizona boundaries merge 12 miles (19 km) southwest of the laughlin bridge
the largest mountain range in the southern portion of the state is the spring mountain range just west of las vegas the state's lowest point is along the colorado river south of laughlin
nevada has 172 mountain summits with 2,000 feet (610 m) of prominence nevada ranks second in the us behind alaska and ahead of california montana and washington nevada is the most mountainous state in the contiguous united states
=== climate ===
nevada is the driest state in the united states it is made up of mostly desert and semiarid climate regions daytime summer temperatures sometimes may rise as high as 125 f (52 c) and nighttime winter temperatures may reach as low as 50 f (46 c) while winters in northern nevada are long and fairly cold the winter season in the southern part of the state tends to be of short duration and mild most parts of nevada receive scarce precipitation during the year most rain that falls in the state falls on the lee side (east and northeast slopes) of the sierra nevada
the average annual rainfall per year is about 7 inches (18 cm) the wettest parts get around 40 inches (100 cm) nevada's highest recorded temperature is 125 f (52 c) at laughlin on june 29 1994 and the lowest recorded temperature is 50 f (46 c) at san jacinto on january 8 1937 nevada's 125 f (52 c) reading is the third highest temperature recorded in the u.s just behind arizona's 128 f (53 c) reading and california's 134 f (57 c) reading

== history ==
=== before 1861 ===
francisco garcs was the first european in the area nevada was annexed as a part of the spanish empire in the northwestern territory of new spain administratively the area of nevada was part of the commandancy general of the provincias internas in the viceroyalty of new spain nevada became a part of alta california (upper california) province in 1804 when the californias were split with the mexican war of independence won in 1821 the province of alta california became a territory (state) of mexico with small population jedediah smith entered the las vegas valley in 1827 and peter skene ogden traveled the humboldt river in 1828 when the mormons created the state of deseret in 1847 they laid claim to all of nevada within the great basin and the colorado watershed in june 1855 william bringhurst and 29 fellow mormon missionaries from utah arrived at this site just northeast of downtown las vegas and built a 150-foot square adobe fort the first permanent structure erected in the valley which remained under the control of salt lake city until the winter of 1858-1859
as a result of the mexicanamerican war and the treaty of guadalupe-hidalgo mexico permanently lost alta california in 1848 the new areas acquired by the united states continued to be administered as territories as part of the mexican cession (1848) and the subsequent california gold rush that used emigrant trails through the area the state's area evolved first as part of the utah territory then the nevada territory (march 2 1861 named for the sierra nevada)
see history of utah history of las vegas and the discovery of the first major u.s deposit of silver ore in comstock lode under virginia city nevada in 1859
=== separation from utah territory ===
on march 2 1861 the nevada territory separated from the utah territory and adopted its current name shortened from sierra nevada (spanish for snow-covered mountain range")
the 1861 southern boundary is commemorated by nevada historical markers 57 and 58 in lincoln and nye counties
=== statehood (1864) ===
eight days prior to the presidential election of 1864 nevada became the 36th state in the union statehood was rushed to the date of october 31 to help ensure abraham lincoln's reelection on november 8 and post-civil war republican dominance in congress as nevada's mining-based economy tied it to the more industrialized union as it turned out however lincoln and the republicans won the election handily and did not need nevada's help
nevada is one of only two states to significantly expand its borders after admission to the union (the other is missouri which acquired additional territory in 1837 due to the platte purchase.)
in 1866 another part of the western utah territory was added to nevada in the eastern part of the state setting the current eastern boundary
nevada achieved its current southern boundaries on january 18 1867 when it absorbed the portion of pah-ute county in the arizona territory west of the colorado river essentially all of present-day nevada south of the 37th parallel the transfer was prompted by the discovery of gold in the area and it was thought by officials that nevada would be better able to oversee the expected population boom this area includes most of what is now clark county
mining shaped nevada's economy for many years (see silver mining in nevada) when mark twain lived in nevada during the period described in roughing it mining had led to an industry of speculation and immense wealth however both mining and population declined in the late 19th century however the rich silver strike at tonopah in 1900 followed by strikes in goldfield and rhyolite again put nevada's population on an upward trend
==== gambling and labor ====
unregulated gambling was commonplace in the early nevada mining towns but was outlawed in 1909 as part of a nationwide anti-gambling crusade because of subsequent declines in mining output and the decline of the agricultural sector during the great depression nevada again legalized gambling on march 19 1931 with approval from the legislature governor fred b balzar's signature enacted the most liberal divorce laws in the country and open gambling the reforms came just eight days after the federal government presented the $49 million construction contract for boulder dam (now hoover dam)
==== nuclear testing ====
the nevada test site 65 miles (105 km) northwest of the city of las vegas was founded on january 11 1951 for the testing of nuclear weapons the site consists of about 1,350 square miles (3,500 km2) of desert and mountainous terrain nuclear testing at the nevada test site began with a 1 kiloton of tnt (4.2 tj) bomb dropped on frenchman flat on january 27 1951 the last atmospheric test was conducted on july 17 1962 and the underground testing of weapons continued until september 23 1992 the location is known for having the highest concentration of nuclear-detonated weapons in the u.s
over 80% of the state's area is owned by the federal government the primary reason for this is that homesteads were not permitted in large enough sizes to be viable in the arid conditions that prevail throughout desert nevada instead early settlers would homestead land surrounding a water source and then graze livestock on the adjacent public land which is useless for agriculture without access to water (this pattern of ranching still prevails)

non-alcohol drug laws are a notable exception to nevada's otherwise libertarian principles it is notable for having the harshest penalties for drug offenders in the country nevada remains the only state to still use mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines for marijuana possession however it is now a misdemeanor for possession of less than one ounce but only for persons age 21 and older in 2006 voters in nevada defeated attempts to allow possession of 1 ounce of marijuana (for personal use) without being criminally prosecuted (55% against legalization 45% in favor of legalization) however nevada is one of the states that allows for use of marijuana for medical reasons (though this remains illegal under federal law)
nevada has very liberal alcohol laws bars are permitted to remain open 24 hours with no last call liquor stores convenience stores and supermarkets may also sell alcohol 24 hours per day and may sell beer wine and spirits

== politics ==
=== state politics ===
due to heavy growth in the southern portion of the state there is a noticeable divide between politics of northern and southern nevada the north has long maintained control of key positions in state government even while the population of southern nevada is larger than the rest of the state combined the north sees the high population south becoming more influential and perhaps commanding majority rule the south sees the north as the old guard trying to rule as an oligarchy this has fostered some resentment however due to a term limit amendment passed by nevada voters in 1994 and again in 1996 some of the north's hold over key positions will soon be forfeited to the south leaving northern nevada with less power
historically northern nevada has been very republican the more rural counties of the north are among the most conservative regions of the country washoe county home to reno has historically been strongly republican but has become more of a swing county at least at the federal level clark county home to las vegas has become increasingly democratic
