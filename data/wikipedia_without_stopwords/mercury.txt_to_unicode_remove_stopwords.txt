invertebrate paleontology also spelled invertebrate palaeontology sometimes described invertebrate paleozoology invertebrate paleobiology whether considered subfield paleontology paleozoology paleobiology discipline scientific study prehistoric invertebrates analyzing invertebrate fossils geologic record
invertebrates meant nonvertebrate creatures kingdom animalia metazoa biotic domain eukaryota phyletic definition manycelled subvertebrate animals lack vertebral column spinal column vertebrae backbone long fulllength notochord contrast course vertebrates one phylum chordata
relatedly invertebrates never cartilaginous boney internal skeleton skeletal supports gill slits ribs jaws finally throughout geologic time invertebrates remained noncraniate creatures never developed cranium nervechord brain skull hard protective braincase unlike many vertebrates
invertebrate terminology science
many decades since jeanbaptiste de lamarck pioneering biologist evolutionist first conceptualized coined category invertebrata term biology zoology come recognize nonvertebrate category scientifically valid monophyletic taxon evolutionary biology developmental biology aka evodevo consider term invertebrata polyphyletic paraphyletic nevertheless earth science departments continue employ term paleontologists find useful practical evaluating fossil invertebrates andconsequently invertebrate evolution
however one contemporary caveat paleobiologists microbiologists st century longer classify onecelled animallike microbes either invertebrates animals example commonly fossilized foraminifera forams radiolarians zooplankton formerly grouped either animal phylum animal subkingdom called protozoa first animals placed kingdom superkingdom protista protoctista thus called protists protoctists
thus modern invertebrate paleontologists deal largely fossils strictly defined animal kingdom excepting phylum chordata phylum chordata exclusive focus vertebrate paleontology protist fossils main focus micropaleontology plant fossils chief focus paleobotany together four represent traditional taxonomic divisions paleontologic study

invertebrate fossilization
comes fossil record softbodied minuscule invertebratessuch hydras jellies flatworms hairworms nematodes ribbon worms rotifers roundworms infrequently fossilized result paleontologists fossil hunters must often rely trace fossils microfossils chemofossil residue scouting prehistoric creatures
hardbodied large invertebrates muchmore commonly preserved typically sizeable macrofossils invertebrates frequently preserved hard partsfor example shell armor plates tests exoskeleton jaws teeth composed silica silicon dioxide calcite aragonite forms calcium carbonate chitin protein often infused tricalcium phosphate keratin evenmore complex protein rather vertebrate bone hydroxyapatite cartilage fishes landdwelling tetrapods
chitinous jaws annelids marine scolecodonts sometimes preserved fossils many arthropods inarticulate brachiopods easily fossilized hard parts calcite chitin keratin common oftenfound macrofossils hard calcareous shells articulate brachiopods everyday lampshells mollusks omnipresent clams snails mussels oysters hand nonshelly slugs nontubiferous worms instance earthworms occasionally preserved due lack hard parts
