jewellery or jewelry (/dulri/) consists of small decorative items worn for personal adornment such as brooches rings necklaces earrings and bracelets jewellery may be attached to the body or the clothes and the term is restricted to durable ornaments excluding flowers for example for many centuries metal often combined with gemstones has been the normal material for jewellery but other materials such as shells and other plant materials may be used it is one of the oldest type of archaeological artefact with 100,000-year-old beads made from nassarius shells thought to be the oldest known jewellery the basic forms of jewellery vary between cultures but are often extremely long-lived in european cultures the most common forms of jewellery listed above have persisted since ancient times while other forms such as adornments for the nose or ankle important in other cultures are much less common historically the most widespread influence on jewellery in terms of design and style have come from asia
jewellery may be made from a wide range of materials gemstones and similar materials such as amber and coral precious metals beads and shells have been widely used and enamel has often been important in most cultures jewellery can be understood as a status symbol for its material properties its patterns or for meaningful symbols jewellery has been made to adorn nearly every body part from hairpins to toe rings and even genital jewellery the patterns of wearing jewellery between the sexes and by children and older people can vary greatly between cultures but adult women have been the most consistent wearers of jewellery in modern european culture the amount worn by adult males is relatively low compared with other cultures and other periods in european culture
the word jewellery itself is derived from the word jewel which was anglicized from the old french jouel and beyond that to the latin word jocale meaning plaything in british english new zealand english hiberno-english australian english and south african english it is spelled jewellery while the spelling is jewelry in american english both are used in canadian english though jewelry prevails by a two to one margin in french and a few other european languages the equivalent term joaillerie there may also cover decorated metalwork in precious metal such as objets d'art and church items not just objects worn on the person
== form and functionedit ==
humans have used jewellery for a number of different reasons
functional generally to fix clothing or hair in place or to tell the time (in the case of watches)
as a marker of social status and personal status as with a wedding ring
as a signifier of some form of affiliation whether ethnic religious or social
to provide talismanic protection (in the form of amulets)
as an artistic display
as a carrier or symbol of personal meaning such as love mourning or even luck
most cultures at some point have had a practice of keeping large amounts of wealth stored in the form of jewellery numerous cultures store wedding dowries in the form of jewellery or make jewellery as a means to store or display coins alternatively jewellery has been used as a currency or trade good an example being the use of slave beads
many items of jewellery such as brooches and buckles originated as purely functional items but evolved into decorative items as their functional requirement diminished
jewellery can also symbolise group membership (as in the case of the christian crucifix or the jewish star of david) or status (as in the case of chains of office or the western practice of married people wearing wedding rings)
wearing of amulets and devotional medals to provide protection or ward off evil is common in some cultures these may take the form of symbols (such as the ankh) stones plants animals body parts (such as the khamsa) or glyphs (such as stylised versions of the throne verse in islamic art)
== materials and methodsedit ==
in creating jewellery gemstones coins or other precious items are often used and they are typically set into precious metals alloys of nearly every metal known have been encountered in jewellery bronze for example was common in roman times modern fine jewellery usually includes gold white gold platinum palladium titanium or silver most contemporary gold jewellery is made of an alloy of gold the purity of which is stated in karats indicated by a number followed by the letter k american gold jewellery must be of at least 10k purity (41.7% pure gold) (though in the uk the number is 9k (37.5% pure gold) and is typically found up to 18k (75% pure gold) higher purity levels are less common with alloys at 22 k (91.6% pure gold) and 24 k (99.9% pure gold) being considered too soft for jewellery use in america and europe these high purity alloys however are widely used across asia the middle east and africa platinum alloys range from 900 (90% pure) to 950 (95.0% pure) the silver used in jewellery is usually sterling silver or 92.5% fine silver in costume jewellery stainless steel findings are sometimes used
other commonly used materials include glass such as fused-glass or enamel wood often carved or turned shells and other natural animal substances such as bone and ivory natural clay polymer clay hemp and other twines have been used as well to create jewellery that has more of a natural feel however any inclusion of lead or lead solder will give an english assay office (the building which gives english jewellery its stamp of approval the hallmark) the right to destroy the piece however it is very rare for the assay office to do so
beads are frequently used in jewellery these may be made of glass gemstones metal wood shells clay and polymer clay beaded jewellery commonly encompasses necklaces bracelets earrings belts and rings beads may be large or small the smallest type of beads used are known as seed beads these are the beads used for the woven style of beaded jewellery another use of seed beads is an embroidery technique where seed beads are sewn onto fabric backings to create broad collar neck pieces and beaded bracelets bead embroidery a popular type of handwork during the victorian era is enjoying a renaissance in modern jewellery making beading or beadwork is also very popular in many african and indigenous north american cultures
silversmiths goldsmiths and lapidaries methods include forging casting soldering or welding cutting carving and cold-joining (using adhesives staples and rivets to assemble parts)
=== diamondsedit ===
diamonds were first mined in india pliny may have mentioned them although there is some debate as to the exact nature of the stone he referred to as adamas in 2005 australia botswana russia and canada ranked among the primary sources of gemstone diamond production
the british crown jewels contain the cullinan diamond part of the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found (1905) at 3,106.75 carats (621.35 g)
now popular in engagement rings this usage dates back to the marriage of maximilian i to mary of burgundy in 1477
=== other gemstonesedit ===
many precious and semiprecious stones are used for jewellery among them are

emerald
emeralds are one of the three main precious gemstones (along with rubies and sapphires) and are known for their fine green to bluish green colour they have been treasured throughout history and some historians report that the egyptians mined emerald as early as 3500 bc
jade
jade is most commonly associated with the colour green but can come in a number of other colours as well jade is closely linked to asian culture history and tradition and is sometimes referred to as the stone of heaven
jasper
jasper is a gemstone of the chalcedony family that comes in a variety of colours often jasper will feature unique and interesting patterns within the coloured stone picture jasper is a type of jasper known for the colours (often beiges and browns) and swirls in the stones pattern
quartz
quartz refers to a family of crystalline gemstones of various colours and sizes among the well-known types of quartz are rose quartz (which has a delicate pink colour) and smoky quartz (which comes in a variety of shades of translucent brown) a number of other gemstones such as amethyst and citrine are also part of the quartz family rutilated quartz is a popular type of quartz containing needle-like inclusions

some gemstones (like pearls coral and amber) are classified as organic meaning that they are produced by living organisms others are inorganic meaning that they are generally composed of and arise from minerals
some gems for example amethyst have become less valued as methods of extracting and importing them have progressed some man-made gems can serve in place of natural gems such as cubic zirconia which can be used in place of diamond
=== metal finishesedit ===
for platinum gold and silver jewellery there are many techniques to create finishes the most common are high-polish satin/matte brushed and hammered high-polished jewellery is the most common and gives the metal a highly reflective shiny look satin or matte finish reduces the shine and reflection of the jewellery and this is commonly used to accentuate gemstones such as diamonds brushed finishes give the jewellery a textured look and are created by brushing a material (similar to sandpaper) against the metal leaving brush strokes. hammered finishes are typically created by using a rounded steel hammer and hammering the jewellery to give it a wavy texture
some jewellery is plated to give it a shiny reflective look or to achieve a desired colour sterling silver jewellery may be plated with a thin layer of 0.999 fine silver (a process known as flashing) or may be plated with rhodium or gold base metal costume jewellery may also be plated with silver gold or rhodium for a more attractive finish
== impact on societyedit ==
jewellery has been used to denote status in ancient rome only certain ranks could wear rings later sumptuary laws dictated who could wear what type of jewellery this was also based on rank of the citizens of that time cultural dictates have also played a significant role for example the wearing of earrings by western men was considered effeminate in the 19th century and early 20th century more recently the display of body jewellery such as piercings has become a mark of acceptance or seen as a badge of courage within some groups but is completely rejected in others likewise hip hop culture has popularised the slang term bling-bling which refers to ostentatious display of jewellery by men or women
conversely the jewellery industry in the early 20th century launched a campaign to popularise wedding rings for men which caught on as well as engagement rings for men which did not going so far as to create a false history and claim that the practice had medieval roots by the mid-1940s 85% of weddings in the u.s featured a double-ring ceremony up from 15% in the 1920s religion has also played a role in societies influence islam for instance considers the wearing of gold by men as a social taboo and many religions have edicts against excessive display in christianity the new testament gives injunctions against the wearing of gold in the writings of the apostles paul and peter in revelation 17 the great whore or false religious system is depicted as being decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand. (rev 17:4) for muslims it is considered haraam for a man to wear gold
== historyedit ==
the history of jewellery is long and goes back many years with many different uses among different cultures it has endured for thousands of years and has provided various insights into how ancient cultures worked
=== prehistoryedit ===
the first signs of jewellery came from the people in africa perforated beads suggesting shell jewellery made from sea snail shells have been found dating to 75,000 years ago at blombos cave in kenya at enkapune ya muto beads made from perforated ostrich egg shells have been dated to more than 40,000 years ago in russia a stone bracelet and marble ring are attributed to a similar age
later the european early modern humans had crude necklaces and bracelets of bone teeth berries and stone hung on pieces of string or animal sinew or pieces of carved bone used to secure clothing together in some cases jewellery had shell or mother-of-pearl pieces in southern russia carved bracelets made of mammoth tusk have been found the venus of hohle fels features a perforation at the top showing that it was intended to be worn as a pendant
around seven-thousand years ago the first sign of copper jewellery was seen in october 2012 the museum of ancient history in lower austria revealed that they had found a grave of a female jewellery worker forcing archaeologists to take a fresh look at prehistoric gender roles after it appeared to be that of a female fine metal worker a profession that was previously thought to have been carried out exclusively by men
==== egyptedit ====
the first signs of established jewellery making in ancient egypt was around 3,0005,000 years ago the egyptians preferred the luxury rarity and workability of gold over other metals in predynastic egypt jewellery soon began to symbolise power and religious power in the community although it was worn by wealthy egyptians in life it was also worn by them in death with jewellery commonly placed among grave goods
in conjunction with gold jewellery egyptians used coloured glass along with semi-precious gems the colour of the jewellery had significance green for example symbolised fertility lapis lazuli and silver had to be imported from beyond the countrys borders
egyptian designs were most common in phoenician jewellery also ancient turkish designs found in persian jewellery suggest that trade between the middle east and europe was not uncommon women wore elaborate gold and silver pieces that were used in ceremonies
=== europe and the middle eastedit ===
==== mesopotamiaedit ====
by approximately 5,000 years ago jewellery-making had become a significant craft in the cities of mesopotamia the most significant archaeological evidence comes from the royal cemetery of ur where hundreds of burials dating 29002300 bc were unearthed tombs such as that of puabi contained a multitude of artefacts in gold silver and semi-precious stones such as lapis lazuli crowns embellished with gold figurines close-fitting collar necklaces and jewel-headed pins in assyria men and women both wore extensive amounts of jewellery including amulets ankle bracelets heavy multi-strand necklaces and cylinder seals
jewellery in mesopotamia tended to be manufactured from thin metal leaf and was set with large numbers of brightly coloured stones (chiefly agate lapis carnelian and jasper) favoured shapes included leaves spirals cones and bunches of grapes jewellers created works both for human use and for adorning statues and idols they employed a wide variety of sophisticated metalworking techniques such as cloisonn engraving fine granulation and filigree
extensive and meticulously maintained records pertaining to the trade and manufacture of jewellery have also been unearthed throughout mesopotamian archaeological sites one record in the mari royal archives for example gives the composition of various items of jewellery
1 necklace of flat speckled chalcedony beads including 34 flat speckled chalcedony bead [and] 35 gold fluted beads in groups of five
1 necklace of flat speckled chalcedony beads including 39 flat speckled chalcedony beads [with] 41 fluted beads in a group that make up the hanging device
1 necklace with rounded lapis lazuli beads including 28 rounded lapis lazuli beads [and] 29 fluted beads for its clasp
==== greeceedit ====
the greeks started using gold and gems in jewellery in 1600 bc although beads shaped as shells and animals were produced widely in earlier times around 1500 bc the main techniques of working gold in greece included casting twisting bars and making wire many of these sophisticated techniques were popular in the mycenaean period but unfortunately this skill was lost at the end of the bronze age the forms and shapes of jewellery in ancient greece such as the armring (13th century bc) brooch (10th century bc) and pins (7th century bc) have varied widely since the bronze age as well other forms of jewellery include wreaths earrings necklace and bracelets a good example of the high quality that gold working techniques could achieve in greece is the gold olive wreath (4th century bc) which is modeled on the type of wreath given as a prize for winners in athletic competitions like the olympic games jewellery dating from 600 to 475 bc is not well represented in the archaeological record but after the persian wars the quantity of jewellery again became more plentiful one particularly popular type of design at this time was a bracelet decorated with snake and animal-heads because these bracelets used considerably more metal many examples were made from bronze by 300 bc the greeks had mastered making coloured jewellery and using amethysts pearl and emeralds also the first signs of cameos appeared with the greeks creating them from indian sardonyx a striped brown pink and cream agate stone greek jewellery was often simpler than in other cultures with simple designs and workmanship however as time progressed the designs grew in complexity and different materials were soon used
jewellery in greece was hardly worn and was mostly used for public appearances or on special occasions it was frequently given as a gift and was predominantly worn by women to show their wealth social status and beauty the jewellery was often supposed to give the wearer protection from the evil eye or endowed the owner with supernatural powers while others had a religious symbolism older pieces of jewellery that have been found were dedicated to the gods
they worked two styles of pieces cast pieces and pieces hammered out of sheet metal fewer pieces of cast jewellery have been recovered it was made by casting the metal onto two stone or clay moulds the two halves were then joined together and wax followed by molten metal was placed in the centre this technique had been practised since the late bronze age the more common form of jewellery was the hammered sheet type sheets of metal would be hammered to thickness and then soldered together the inside of the two sheets would be filled with wax or another liquid to preserve the metal work different techniques such as using a stamp or engraving were then used to create motifs on the jewellery jewels may then be added to hollows or glass poured into special cavities on the surface the greeks took much of their designs from outer origins such as asia when alexander the great conquered part of it in earlier designs other european influences can also be detected when roman rule came to greece no change in jewellery designs was detected however by 27 bc greek designs were heavily influenced by the roman culture that is not to say that indigenous design did not thrive numerous polychrome butterfly pendants on silver foxtail chains dating from the 1st century have been found near olbia with only one example ever found anywhere else
==== romeedit ====
although jewellery work was abundantly diverse in earlier times especially among the barbarian tribes such as the celts when the romans conquered most of europe jewellery was changed as smaller factions developed the roman designs the most common artefact of early rome was the brooch which was used to secure clothing together the romans used a diverse range of materials for their jewellery from their extensive resources across the continent although they used gold they sometimes used bronze or bone and in earlier times glass beads & pearl as early as 2,000 years ago they imported sri lankan sapphires and indian diamonds and used emeralds and amber in their jewellery in roman-ruled england fossilised wood called jet from northern england was often carved into pieces of jewellery the early italians worked in crude gold and created clasps necklaces earrings and bracelets they also produced larger pendants that could be filled with perfume
like the greeks often the purpose of roman jewellery was to ward off the evil eye given by other people although women wore a vast array of jewellery men often only wore a finger ring although they were expected to wear at least one ring some roman men wore a ring on every finger while others wore none roman men and women wore rings with an engraved gem on it that was used with wax to seal documents a practice that continued into medieval times when kings and noblemen used the same method after the fall of the roman empire the jewellery designs were absorbed by neighbouring countries and tribes
==== middle agesedit ====
post-roman europe continued to develop jewellery making skills the celts and merovingians in particular are noted for their jewellery which in terms of quality matched or exceeded that of byzantium clothing fasteners amulets and to a lesser extent signet rings are the most common artefacts known to us a particularly striking celtic example is the tara brooch the torc was common throughout europe as a symbol of status and power by the 8th century jewelled weaponry was common for men while other jewellery (with the exception of signet rings) seemed to become the domain of women grave goods found in a 6th7th century burial near chalon-sur-sane are illustrative a young girl was buried with 2 silver fibulae a necklace (with coins) bracelet gold earrings a pair of hair-pins comb and buckle the celts specialised in continuous patterns and designs while merovingian designs are best known for stylised animal figures they were not the only groups known for high quality work note the visigoth work shown here and the numerous decorative objects found at the anglo-saxon ship burial at sutton hoo suffolk england are a particularly well-known example on the continent cloisonn and garnet were perhaps the quintessential method and gemstone of the period
the eastern successor of the roman empire the byzantine empire continued many of the methods of the romans though religious themes came to predominate unlike the romans the franks and the celts however byzantium used light-weight gold leaf rather than solid gold and more emphasis was placed on stones and gems as in the west byzantine jewellery was worn by wealthier females with male jewellery apparently restricted to signet rings woman's jewellery had some peculiarities like kolts that decorated headband like other contemporary cultures jewellery was commonly buried with its owner
==== renaissanceedit ====
the renaissance and exploration both had significant impacts on the development of jewellery in europe by the 17th century increasing exploration and trade led to increased availability of a wide variety of gemstones as well as exposure to the art of other cultures whereas prior to this the working of gold and precious metal had been at the forefront of jewellery this period saw increasing dominance of gemstones and their settings an example of this is the cheapside hoard the stock of a jeweller hidden in london during the commonwealth period and not found again until 1912 it contained colombian emerald topaz amazonite from brazil spinel iolite and chrysoberyl from sri lanka ruby from india afghan lapis lazuli persian turquoise red sea peridot as well as bohemian and hungarian opal garnet and amethyst large stones were frequently set in box-bezels on enamelled rings notable among merchants of the period was jean-baptiste tavernier who brought the precursor stone of the hope diamond to france in the 1660s
when napoleon bonaparte was crowned as emperor of the french in 1804 he revived the style and grandeur of jewellery and fashion in france under napoleons rule jewellers introduced parures suites of matching jewellery such as a diamond tiara diamond earrings diamond rings a diamond brooch and a diamond necklace both of napoleons wives had beautiful sets such as these and wore them regularly another fashion trend resurrected by napoleon was the cameo soon after his cameo decorated crown was seen cameos were highly sought the period also saw the early stages of costume jewellery with fish scale covered glass beads in place of pearls or conch shell cameos instead of stone cameos new terms were coined to differentiate the arts jewellers who worked in cheaper materials were called bijoutiers while jewellers who worked with expensive materials were called joailliers a practice which continues to this day
==== romanticismedit ====
starting in the late 18th century romanticism had a profound impact on the development of western jewellery perhaps the most significant influences were the publics fascination with the treasures being discovered through the birth of modern archaeology and a fascination with medieval and renaissance art changing social conditions and the onset of the industrial revolution also led to growth of a middle class that wanted and could afford jewellery as a result the use of industrial processes cheaper alloys and stone substitutes led to the development of paste or costume jewellery distinguished goldsmiths continued to flourish however as wealthier patrons sought to ensure that what they wore still stood apart from the jewellery of the masses not only through use of precious metals and stones but also though superior artistic and technical work one such artist was the french goldsmith franois-dsir froment-meurice a category unique to this period and quite appropriate to the philosophy of romanticism was mourning jewellery it originated in england where queen victoria was often seen wearing jet jewellery after the death of prince albert and it allowed the wearer to continue wearing jewellery while expressing a state of mourning at the death of a loved one
in the united states this period saw the founding in 1837 of tiffany & co by charles lewis tiffany tiffany's put the united states on the world map in terms of jewellery and gained fame creating dazzling commissions for people such as the wife of abraham lincoln later it would gain popular notoriety as the setting of the film breakfast at tiffany's in france pierre cartier founded cartier sa in 1847 while 1884 saw the founding of bulgari in italy the modern production studio had been born and was a step away from the former dominance of individual craftsmen and patronage
this period also saw the first major collaboration between east and west collaboration in pforzheim between german and japanese artists led to shakud plaques set into filigree frames being created by the stoeffler firm in 1885) perhaps the grand final and an appropriate transition to the following period were the masterful creations of the russian artist peter carl faberg working for the imperial russian court whose faberg eggs and jewellery pieces are still considered as the epitome of the goldsmiths art
==== art nouveauedit ====
in the 1890s jewellers began to explore the potential of the growing art nouveau style and the closely related german jugendstil british (and to some extent american) arts and crafts movement catalan modernisme austro-hungarian sezession italian liberty etc
art nouveau jewellery encompassed many distinct features including a focus on the female form and an emphasis on colour most commonly rendered through the use of enamelling techniques including basse-taille champleve cloisonn and plique--jour motifs included orchids irises pansies vines swans peacocks snakes dragonflies mythological creatures and the female silhouette
ren lalique working for the paris shop of samuel bing was recognised by contemporaries as a leading figure in this trend the darmstadt artists colony and wiener werksttte provided perhaps the most significant input to the trend while in denmark georg jensen though best known for his silverware also contributed significant pieces in england liberty & co and the british arts & crafts movement of charles robert ashbee contributed slightly more linear but still characteristic designs the new style moved the focus of the jeweller's art from the setting of stones to the artistic design of the piece itself lalique's dragonfly design is one of the best examples of this enamels played a large role in technique while sinuous organic lines are the most recognisable design feature
the end of world war i once again changed public attitudes and a more sober style developed
==== art decoedit ====
growing political tensions the after-effects of the war and a reaction against the perceived decadence of the turn of the 20th century led to simpler forms combined with more effective manufacturing for mass production of high-quality jewellery covering the period of the 1920s and 1930s the style has become popularly known as art deco walter gropius and the german bauhaus movement with their philosophy of no barriers between artists and craftsmen led to some interesting and stylistically simplified forms modern materials were also introduced plastics and aluminium were first used in jewellery and of note are the chromed pendants of russian-born bauhaus master naum slutzky technical mastery became as valued as the material itself in the west this period saw the reinvention of granulation by the german elizabeth treskow although development of the re-invention has continued into the 1990s it is based on the basic shapes
=== asiaedit ===
in asia the indian subcontinent has the longest continuous legacy of jewellery making anywhere with a history of over 5,000 years one of the first to start jewellery making were the peoples of the indus valley civilization in what is now predominately modern-day pakistan and part of northern and western india early jewellery making in china started around the same period but it became widespread with the spread of buddhism around 2,000 years ago
==== chinaedit ====
the chinese used silver in their jewellery more than gold blue kingfisher feathers were tied onto early chinese jewellery and later blue gems and glass were incorporated into designs however jade was preferred over any other stone the chinese revered jade because of the human-like qualities they assigned to it such as its hardness durability and beauty the first jade pieces were very simple but as time progressed more complex designs evolved jade rings from between the 4th and 7th centuries bc show evidence of having been worked with a compound milling machine hundreds of years before the first mention of such equipment in the west
in china the most uncommon piece of jewellery is the earring which was worn neither by men nor women amulets were common often with a chinese symbol or dragon dragons chinese symbols and phoenixes were frequently depicted on jewellery designs
the chinese often placed their jewellery in their graves most chinese graves found by archaeologists contain decorative jewellery
==== indian subcontinentedit ====
the indian subcontinent (encompassing india pakistan and other countries of south asia) has a long jewellery history which went through various changes through cultural influence and politics for more than 5,0008,000 years because india had an abundant supply of precious metals and gems it prospered financially through export and exchange with other countries while european traditions were heavily influenced by waxing and waning empires india enjoyed a continuous development of art forms for some 5,000 years one of the first to start jewellery making were the peoples of the indus valley civilization (encompassing present-day pakistan and north and northwest india) by 1500 bc the peoples of the indus valley were creating gold earrings and necklaces bead necklaces and metallic bangles before 2100 bc prior to the period when metals were widely used the largest jewellery trade in the indus valley region was the bead trade beads in the indus valley were made using simple techniques first a bead maker would need a rough stone which would be bought from an eastern stone trader the stone would then be placed into a hot oven where it would be heated until it turned deep red a colour highly prized by people of the indus valley the red stone would then be chipped to the right size and a hole bored through it with primitive drills the beads were then polished some beads were also painted with designs this art form was often passed down through the family children of bead makers often learned how to work beads from a young age persian style also played a big role in indias jewellery each stone had its own characteristics related to hinduism
jewellery in the indus valley was worn predominantly by females who wore numerous clay or shell bracelets on their wrists they were often shaped like doughnuts and painted black over time clay bangles were discarded for more durable ones in present-day india bangles are made out of metal or glass other pieces that women frequently wore were thin bands of gold that would be worn on the forehead earrings primitive brooches chokers and gold rings although women wore jewellery the most some men in the indus valley wore beads small beads were often crafted to be placed in men and womens hair the beads were about one millimetre long
a female skeleton (presently on display at the national museum new delhi india) wears a carlinean bangle (bracelet) on her left hand kada is a special kind of bracelet and is widely popular in indian culture they symbolizes animals like peacock elephant etc
according to hindu belief gold and silver are considered as sacred metals gold is symbolic of the warm sun while silver suggests the cool moon both are the quintessential metals of indian jewellery pure gold does not oxidise or corrode with time which is why hindu tradition associates gold with immortality gold imagery occurs frequently in ancient indian literature in the vedic hindu belief of cosmological creation the source of physical and spiritual human life originated in and evolved from a golden womb (hiranyagarbha) or egg (hiranyanda) a metaphor of the sun whose light rises from the primordial waters
jewellery had great status with indias royalty it was so powerful that they established laws limiting wearing of jewellery to royalty only royalty and a few others to whom they granted permission could wear gold ornaments on their feet this would normally be considered breaking the appreciation of the sacred metals even though the majority of the indian population wore jewellery maharajas and people related to royalty had a deeper connection with jewellery the maharaja's role was so important that the hindu philosophers identified him as central to the smooth working of the world he was considered as a divine being a deity in human form whose duty was to uphold and protect dharma the moral order of the universe
navaratna (nine gems)is a powerful jewel frequently worn by a maharaja (emperor) it is an amulet which comprises diamond pearl ruby sapphire emerald topaz cats eye coral and hyacinth (red zircon) each of these stones is associated with a celestial deity represented the totality of the hindu universe when all nine gems are together the diamond is the most powerful gem among the nine stones there were various cuts for the gemstone indian kings bought gemstones privately from the sellers maharaja and other royal family members value gem as hindu god they exchanged gems with people to whom they were very close especially the royal family members and other intimate allies only the emperor himself his intimate relations and select members of his entourage were permitted to wear royal turban ornament as the empire matured differing styles of ornament acquired the generic name of sarpech from sar or sir meaning head and pech meaning fastener
india was the first country to mine diamonds with some mines dating back to 296 bc india traded the diamonds realising their valuable qualities historically diamonds have been given to retain or regain a lovers or rulers lost favour as symbols of tribute or as an expression of fidelity in exchange for concessions and protection mughal emperors and kings used the diamonds as a means of assuring their immortality by having their names and wordly titles inscribed upon them moreover it has played and continues to play a pivotal role in indian social political economic and religious event as it often has done elsewhere in indian history diamonds have been used to acquire military equipment finance wars foment revolutions and tempt defections they have contributed to the abdication or the decapitation of potentates they have been used to murder a representative of the dominating power by lacing his food with crushed diamond indian diamonds have been used as security to finance large loans needed to buttress politically or economically tottering regimes victorious military heroes have been honoured by rewards of diamonds and also have been used as ransom payment for release from imprisonment or abduction today many of the jewellery designs and traditions are used and jewellery is commonplace in indian ceremonies and weddings
=== north and south americaedit ===
jewellery played a major role in the fate of the americas when the spanish established an empire to seize south american gold jewellery making developed in the americas 5,000 years ago in central and south america large amounts of gold was easily accessible and the aztecs mixtecs mayans and numerous andean cultures such as the mochica of peru created beautiful pieces of jewellery
with the mochica culture goldwork flourished the pieces are no longer simple metalwork but are now masterful examples of jewellery making pieces are sophisticated in their design and feature inlays of turquoise mother of pearl spondylus shell and amethyst the nose and ear ornaments chest plates small containers and whistles are considered masterpieces of ancient peruvian culture
among the aztecs only nobility wore gold jewellery as it showed their rank power and wealth gold jewellery was most common in the aztec empire and was often decorated with feathers from quetzal birds and others in general the more jewellery an aztec noble wore the higher his status or prestige the emperor and his high priests for example would be nearly completely covered in jewellery when making public appearances although gold was the most common and a popular material used in aztec jewellery jade turquoise and certain feathers were considered more valuable in addition to adornment and status the aztecs also used jewellery in sacrifices to appease the gods priests also used gem-encrusted daggers to perform animal and human sacrifices
another ancient american civilization with expertise in jewellery making were the maya at the peak of their civilization the maya were making jewellery from jade gold silver bronze and copper maya designs were similar to those of the aztecs with lavish headdresses and jewellery the maya also traded in precious gems however in earlier times the maya had little access to metal so they made the majority of their jewellery out of bone or stone merchants and nobility were the only few that wore expensive jewellery in the maya region much the same as with the aztecs
in north america native americans used shells wood turquoise and soapstone almost unavailable in south and central america the turquoise was used in necklaces and to be placed in earrings native americans with access to oyster shells often located in only one location in america traded the shells with other tribes showing the great importance of the body adornment trade in northern america
=== native americanedit ===
