emigration is the act of leaving one's resident country with the intent to settle elsewhere conversely immigration describes the movement of persons into one country from another both are acts of migration across national boundaries
demographers examine push and pull factors for people to be pushed out of one place and attracted to another there can be a desire to escape negative circumstances such as shortages of land or jobs or unfair treatment people can be pulled to the opportunities available elsewhere seeking refugee status in a foreign country from oppressive conditions may lead to permanent emigration
involuntary migration refers to groups that are forced to abandon their native country such as by enforced population transfer or the threat of ethnic cleansing

== emigration restrictionsedit ==
some countries restrict the ability of their citizens to emigrate to other countries after 1668 the qing emperor banned han chinese migration to manchuria in 1681 the emperor ordered construction of the willow palisade a barrier beyond which the chinese were prohibited from encroaching on manchu and mongol lands
the soviet socialist republics of the later soviet union began such restrictions in 1918 with laws and borders tightening until even illegal emigration was nearly impossible by 1928 to strengthen this they set up internal passport controls and individual city propiska ("place of residence") permits along with internal freedom of movement restrictions often called the 101st kilometre rules which greatly restricted mobility within even small areas
at the end of world war ii in 1945 the soviet union occupied several central european countries together called the eastern bloc with the majority of those living in the newly acquired areas aspiring to independence and wanted the soviets to leave before 1950 over 15 million people emigrated from the soviet-occupied eastern european countries and immigrated into the west in the five years immediately following world war ii by the early 1950s the soviet approach to controlling national movement was emulated by most of the rest of the eastern bloc restrictions implemented in the eastern bloc stopped most east-west migration with only 13.3 million migrations westward between 1950 and 1990 however hundreds of thousands of east germans annually immigrated to west germany through a loophole in the system that existed between east and west berlin where the four occupying world war ii powers governed movement the emigration resulted in massive brain drain from east germany to west germany of younger educated professionals such that nearly 20% of east germany's population had migrated to west germany by 1961 in 1961 east germany erected a barbed-wire barrier that would eventually be expanded through construction into the berlin wall effectively closing the loophole in 1989 the berlin wall fell followed by german reunification and within two years the dissolution of the soviet union
by the early 1950s the soviet approach to controlling international movement was also emulated by china mongolia and north korea north korea still tightly restricts emigration and maintains one of the strictest emigration bans in the world although some north koreans still manage to illegally emigrate to china other countries with tight emigration restrictions at one time or another included angola ethiopia mozambique somalia afghanistan burma democratic kampuchea (cambodia from 1975-1979) laos north vietnam iraq south yemen and cuba
