carbon exchange reservoir
carbon distributed throughout atmosphere biosphere oceans referred collectively carbon exchange reservoir component also referred individually carbon exchange reservoir different elements carbon exchange reservoir vary much carbon store long takes c generated cosmic rays fully mix affects ratio c c different reservoirs hence radiocarbon ages samples originated reservoir atmosphere c generated contains total carbon reservoirs c contains mixes less seven years ratio c c atmosphere taken baseline reservoirs another reservoir lower ratio c c indicates carbon older hence c decayed ocean surface example contains carbon exchange reservoir much c would expected ratio atmosphere time takes carbon atmosphere mix surface ocean years surface waters also receive water deep ocean carbon reservoir water deep ocean takes years circulate back surface waters surface waters contain combination older water depleted c water recently surface c equilibrium atmosphere
creatures living ocean surface c ratios water live result reduced cc ratio radiocarbon age marine life typically years organisms land closer equilibrium atmosphere cc ratio atmosphere organisms contain carbon reservoir sea organisms mass less land shown diagram accumulated dead organic matter plants animals exceeds mass biosphere factor nearly since matter longer exchanging carbon environment cc ratio lower biosphere

atmospheric variation
early years using technique understood depended atmospheric cc ratio remained preceding thousand years verify accuracy method several artefacts datable techniques tested results testing reasonable agreement true ages objects time however discrepancies began appear known chronology oldest egyptian dynasties radiocarbon dates egyptian artefacts neither preexisting egyptian chronology new radiocarbon dating method could assumed accurate third possibility cc ratio changed time question resolved study tree rings comparison overlapping series tree rings allowed construction continuous sequence treering data spanned years since time treering data series extended years hans suess able use treering sequence show dates derived radiocarbon consistent dates assigned egyptologists possible although annual plants corn cc ratio reflects atmospheric ratio time growing trees add material outermost tree ring given year inner tree rings dont get c replenished instead start losing c decay hence ring preserves record atmospheric cc ratio year grew carbondating wood tree rings provides check needed atmospheric cc ratio sample known date measurement value n number atoms c remaining sample carbondating equation allows calculation n number atoms c sample time tree ring formed hence cc ratio atmosphere time armed results carbondating tree rings became possible construct calibration curves designed correct errors caused variation time cc ratio curves described detail
coal oil began burned large quantities th century sufficiently old contain little detectable c result co
released substantially diluted atmospheric cc ratio dating object early th century hence gives apparent date older true date reason c concentrations neighbourhood large cities lower atmospheric average fossil fuel effect also known suess effect hans suess first reported would amount reduction c activity additional carbon fossil fuels distributed throughout carbon exchange reservoir long delay mixing deep ocean actual effect reduction
much larger effect comes aboveground nuclear testing released large numbers neutrons created c atmospheric nuclear testing banned estimated several tonnes c created extra c immediately spread across entire carbon exchange reservoir would led increase cc ratio per cent immediate effect almost double amount c atmosphere peak level occurring level since dropped bomb carbon sometimes called percolates rest reservoir
isotopic fractionation
photosynthesis primary process carbon moves atmosphere living things photosynthetic pathways c absorbed slightly easily c turn easily absorbed c differential uptake three carbon isotopes leads cc cc ratios plants differ ratios atmosphere effect known isotopic fractionation
determine degree fractionation takes place given plant amounts c c isotopes measured resulting cc ratio compared standard ratio known pdb cc ratio used instead cc former much easier measure latter easily derived depletion c relative c proportional difference atomic masses two isotopes depletion c twice depletion c fractionation c known c calculated follows
sign indicates parts per thousand pdb standard contains unusually high proportion c measured c values negative
marine organisms details photosynthesis reactions less well understood c values marine photosynthetic organisms dependent temperature higher temperatures co
poor solubility water means less co
available photosynthetic reactions conditions fractionation reduced temperatures c c values correspondingly higher lower temperatures co
becomes soluble hence available marine organisms c value animals depends diet animal eats food high c values higher c one eats food lower c values animals biochemical processes also impact results example bone minerals bone collagen typically higher concentration c found animals diet though different biochemical reasons enrichment bone c also implies excreted material depleted c relative diet
since c makes carbon sample cc ratio accurately measured mass spectrometry typical values c found experiment many plants well different parts animals bone collagen dating given sample better determine c value sample directly rely published values

carbonate ocean surface also subject fractionation c atmosphere likely c dissolve ocean result overall increase cc ratio ocean relative cc ratio atmosphere increase c concentration almost exactly cancels decrease caused upwelling water containing old hence c depleted carbon deep ocean direct measurements c radiation similar measurements rest biosphere correcting isotopic fractionation done radiocarbon dates allow comparison results different parts biosphere gives apparent age years ocean surface water
reservoir effects
libbys original exchange reservoir hypothesis assumed cc ratio exchange reservoir constant world since discovered several causes variation ratio across reservoir
marine effect
co
atmosphere transfers ocean dissolving surface water carbonate bicarbonate ions time carbonate ions water returning air co
exchange process bringsc atmosphere surface waters ocean c thus introduced takes long time percolate entire volume ocean deepest parts ocean mix slowly surface waters mixing uneven main mechanism brings deep water surface upwelling common regions closer equator upwelling also influenced factors topography local ocean bottom coastlines climate wind patterns overall mixing deep surface waters takes far longer mixing atmospheric co
surface waters result water deep ocean areas apparent radiocarbon age several thousand years upwelling mixes old water surface water giving surface water apparent age several hundred years correcting fractionation effect uniform average effect years local deviations several hundred years areas geographically close effect also applies marine organisms shells marine mammals whales seals radiocarbon ages appear hundreds years old
hemisphere effect
northern southern hemispheres atmospheric circulation systems sufficiently independent noticeable time lag mixing two atmospheric cc ratio lower southern hemisphere apparent additional age years radiocarbon results south compared north probably greater surface area ocean southern hemisphere means carbon exchanged ocean atmosphere north since surface ocean depleted c marine effect c removed southern atmosphere quickly north
effects
