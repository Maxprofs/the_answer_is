the introduction of steamboats on the ohio river in 1811 opened up its trade to more rapid shipping and the city established commercial ties with st louis missouri and especially new orleans downriver cincinnati was incorporated as a city in 1819 exporting pork products and hay it became a center of pork processing in the region from 1810 to 1830 its population nearly tripled from 9,642 to 24,831 completion of the miami and erie canal in 1827 to middletown ohio further stimulated businesses and employers struggled to hire enough people to fill positions the city had a labor shortage until large waves of immigration by irish and germans in the late 1840s the city grew rapidly over the next two decades reaching 115,000 persons by 1850
construction on the miami and erie canal began on july 21 1825 when it was called the miami canal related to its origin at the great miami river the first section of the canal was opened for business in 1827 in 1827 the canal connected cincinnati to nearby middletown by 1840 it had reached toledo during this period of rapid expansion and prominence residents of cincinnati began referring to the city as the queen city

the volatile social conditions produced white-led riots against blacks occurred in 1829 when many blacks lost their homes and property as irish immigrants entered the city in the late 1840s they competed with blacks at the lower levels of the economy white-led riots against blacks occurred in 1836 when an abolitionist press was twice destroyed and in 1842 more than one thousand blacks abandoned the city after the 1829 riots blacks in philadelphia and other major cities raised money to help the refugees recover from the destruction by 1842 blacks had become better established in the city they defended their persons and property in the riot and worked politically as well

the city is governed by a nine-member city council whose members are elected at-large prior to 1924 city council members were elected through a system of wards the ward system was subject to corruption and as with any one-party dominance abuses arose from the 1880s to the 1920s the republican party dominated city politics with the political machine of boss cox exerting control
a reform movement arose in 1923 led by another republican murray seasongood seasongood founded the charter committee which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system they gained approval by voters for a council-manager government form of government in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city from 1924 to 1957 the council was elected by proportional representation and single transfer voting (stv) starting with ashtabula in 1915 several major cities in ohio adopted this electoral system which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power for that reason such groups opposed it
in an effort to overturn the charter that provided for pr opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power at a time of increasing civil rights activism the pr/stv system had enabled minorities to enter local politics and gain seats on the city council more than they had before in proportion to their share of the population this made government more representatives of the residents of the city

residents continued to work to improve their system to have their votes count more starting in 1987 the top vote-getter in the city council election was automatically selected as mayor starting in 1999 the mayor was elected separately in a general at-large election for the first time the city manager's role in government was reduced these reforms were referred to as the strong mayor reforms to make the city government accountable to voters cincinnati politics include the participation of the charter party the party with the third-longest history of winning in local elections
