a fibrous root system is the opposite of a taproot system it is usually formed by thin moderately branching roots growing from the stem a fibrous root system is universal in monocotyledonous plants and ferns the fibrous root systems look like a mat made out of roots when the tree has reached full maturity
most trees begin life with a taproot but after one to a few years change to a wide-spreading fibrous root system with mainly horizontal surface roots and only a few vertical deep anchoring roots a typical mature tree 30-50 m tall has a root system that extends horizontally in all directions as far as the tree is tall or more but well over 95% of the roots are in the top 50 cm depth of soil
