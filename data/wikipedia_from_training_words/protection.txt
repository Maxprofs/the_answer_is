in 1643 when the long parliament of england called the westminster assembly to produce the westminster confession it also asked for a directory of catechising the assembly asked herbert palmer to produce a draft of the larger catechism robert baillie and other scottish delegates found the work disappointing in december 1643 a committee was formed to write the catechism in january 1647 the assembly gave up writing one catechism and split it into two the westminster shorter catechism was to be easier to read and concise for beginners and the larger catechism was to be more exact and comprehensive the catechism was completed by the westminster assembly in 1647 it was then adopted by the general assembly of the church of scotland in 1648 and (with modifications relating to the civil magistrate) by the presbyterian synod of new york and philadelphia in 1788 and by the presbyterian church in the u.s.a. upon its formation the following year in 1967 it was dropped by the united presbyterian church in the u.s.a in the formulation of their book of confessions however it was embraced by the successor denomination the presbyterian church (u.s.a.) in that church's book of confessions
