evolution pharyngeal slits
presence pharyngeal slits hemichordates led debates whether structure homologous slits found chordates result convergent evolution placement hemichordates echinoderms sister group chordates new hypothesis emergedsuggesting pharyngeal gill slits present deuterostome ancestor intriguingly extant echinoderms lack pharyngeal structures fossil records reveal ancestral forms echinoderms gilllike structures comparative developmental genetic studies pharyngeal structures hemichordates urochordates brought important insights regarding evolution deuterostome body plan comparative molecular biology revealed pax genes encode transcription factors expressed similar patterns hemichordates urochordates vertebrates pax pax expressed pharyngeal pouches important thymus development applying excess retinoic acid excess retincoic acid vertebrates results pharyngeal abnormalities leads absence gill slits developing amphioxus suggesting retinoic acid may act mechanism vertebrates amphioxus studies indicate pharyngeal slits found hemichordates chordates indeed homologous molecular sense
