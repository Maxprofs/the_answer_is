terminology
origin term supervolcano linked early thcentury scientific debate geological history features three sisters volcanic region oregon united states edwin hodge suggested large volcano named mount multnomah existed region believed several peaks three sisters area remnants left mount multnomah largely destroyed violent volcanic explosions similar mount mazama possible existence mount multnomah ignored volcanologist howel williams book ancient volcanoes oregon book reviewed another volcanologist f m byers jr review byers refers mount multnomah supervolcano although hodges suggestion mount multnomah supervolcano rejected long ago term supervolcano popularised bbc popular science television program horizon refer eruptions produce extremely large amounts ejecta
volcanologists geologists refer supervolcanoes scientific work since blanket term applied number different geological settings since however term used professionals communicating science public term megacaldera sometimes used caldera supervolcanoes blake river megacaldera complex abitibi greenstone belt ontario quebec canada eruptions rate vei termed super eruptions though welldefined minimum explosive size supervolcano least two types volcanic eruptions identified supervolcanoes large igneous provinces massive eruptions
large igneous provinces
large igneous provinces lip iceland siberian traps deccan traps ontong java plateau extensive regions basalts continental scale resulting flood basalt eruptions created regions often occupy several thousand square kilometres volumes order millions cubic kilometers cases lavas normally laid several million years release large amounts gases runion hotspot produced deccan traps million years ago coincident cretaceouspaleogene extinction event scientific consensus meteor impact cause extinction event volcanic activity may caused environmental stresses extant species cretaceouspaleogene boundary additionally largest flood basalt event siberian traps occurred around million years ago coincident largest mass extinction history permiantriassic extinction event although also unknown whether completely responsible extinction event
outpourings explosive though lava fountains may occur many volcanologists consider iceland may lip currently formed last major outpouring occurred laki fissure approximately km mi long estimated km cu mi basaltic lava poured eruption
