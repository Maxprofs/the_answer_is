an arrow is a shafted projectile that is shot with a bow it predates recorded history and is common to most cultures an arrow usually consists of a shaft with an arrowhead attached to the front end with fletchings and a nock at the other
== history ==
the oldest evidence of stone-tipped projectiles which may or may not have been propelled by a bow (c.f atlatl) dating to c 64,000 years ago were found in sibudu cave south africa the oldest evidence of the use of bows to shoot arrows dates to about 10,000 years ago it is based on pinewood arrows found in the ahrensburg valley north of hamburg they had shallow grooves on the base indicating that they were shot from a bow the oldest bow so far recovered is about 8,000 years old found in the holmegrd swamp in denmark archery seems to have arrived in the americas with the arctic small tool tradition about 4,500 years ago
== size ==
arrow sizes vary greatly across cultures ranging from eighteen inches to five feet (45 cm to 150 cm) however most modern arrows are 75 centimetres (30 in) to 96 centimetres (38 in) most war arrows from an english ship sunk in 1545 were 76 centimetres (30 in) very short arrows have been used shot through a guide attached either to the bow (an overdraw") or to the archer's wrist (the turkish siper") these may fly farther than heavier arrows and an enemy without suitable equipment may find himself unable to return them
=== shaft ===
the shaft is the primary structural element of the arrow to which the other components are attached traditional arrow shafts are made from lightweight wood bamboo or reeds while modern shafts may be made from aluminium carbon fibre reinforced plastic or a combination of materials such shafts are typically made from an aluminium core wrapped with a carbon fibre outer
the stiffness of the shaft is known as its spine referring to how little the shaft bends when compressed hence an arrow which bends less is said to have more spine in order to strike consistently a group of arrows must be similarly spined center-shot bows in which the arrow passes through the central vertical axis of the bow riser may obtain consistent results from arrows with a wide range of spines however most traditional bows are not center-shot and the arrow has to deflect around the handle in the archer's paradox such bows tend to give most consistent results with a narrower range of arrow spine that allows the arrow to deflect correctly around the bow higher draw-weight bows will generally require stiffer arrows with more spine (less flexibility) to give the correct amount of flex when shot
==== gpi rating ====
the weight of an arrow shaft can be expressed in gpi (grains per inch) the length of a shaft in inches multiplied by its gpi rating gives the weight of the shaft in grains for example a shaft that is 30 inches long and has a gpi of 9.5 weighs 285 grains or about 18 grams this does not include the other elements of a finished arrow so a complete arrow will be heavier than the shaft alone
==== footed arrows ====
sometimes a shaft will be made of two different types of wood fastened together resulting in what is known as a footed arrow known by some as the finest of wood arrows footed arrows were used both by early europeans and native americans footed arrows will typically consist of a short length of hardwood near the head of the arrow with the remainder of the shaft consisting of softwood by reinforcing the area most likely to break the arrow is more likely to survive impact while maintaining overall flexibility and lighter weight
=== arrowhead ===
the arrowhead or projectile point is the primary functional part of the arrow and plays the largest role in determining its purpose some arrows may simply use a sharpened tip of the solid shaft but it is far more common for separate arrowheads to be made usually from metal horn or some other hard material arrowheads are usually separated by function
bodkin points are short rigid points with a small cross-section they were made of unhardened iron and may have been used for better or longer flight or for cheaper production it has been mistakenly suggested that the bodkin came into its own as a means of penetrating armour but research has found no hardened bodkin points so it is likely that it was first designed either to extend range or as a cheaper and simpler alternative to the broadhead in a modern test a direct hit from a hard steel bodkin point penetrated damascus chain armour however archery was not effective against plate armour which became available to knights of fairly modest means by the late 14th century
blunts are unsharpened arrowheads occasionally used for types of target shooting for shooting at stumps or other targets of opportunity or hunting small game when the goal is to stun the target without penetration blunts are commonly made of metal or hard rubber they may stun and occasionally the arrow shaft may penetrate the head and the target safety is still important with blunt arrows
judo points have spring wires extending sideways from the tip these catch on grass and debris to prevent the arrow from being lost in the vegetation used for practice and for small game
broadheads were used for war and are still used for hunting medieval broadheads could be made from steel sometimes with hardened edges they usually have two to four sharp blades that cause massive bleeding in the victim their function is to deliver a wide cutting edge so as to kill as quickly as possible by cleanly cutting major blood vessels and cause further trauma on removal they are expensive damage most targets and are usually not used for practice
there are two main types of broadheads used by hunters the fixed-blade and the mechanical types while the fixed-blade broadhead keeps its blades rigid and unmovable on the broadhead at all times the mechanical broadhead deploys its blades upon contact with the target its blades swinging out to wound the target the mechanical head flies better because it is more streamlined but has less penetration as it uses some of the kinetic energy in the arrow to deploy its blades
field tips are similar to target points and have a distinct shoulder so that missed outdoor shots do not become as stuck in obstacles such as tree stumps they are also used for shooting practice by hunters by offering similar flight characteristics and weights as broadheads without getting lodged in target materials and causing excessive damage upon removal
target points are bullet-shaped with a conical point designed to penetrate target butts easily without causing excessive damage to them
safety arrows are designed to be used in various forms of reenactment combat to reduce the risk when shot at people these arrows may have heads that are very wide or padded in combination with bows of restricted draw weight and draw length these heads may reduce to acceptable levels the risks of shooting arrows at suitably armoured people the parameters will vary depending on the specific rules being used and on the levels of risk felt acceptable to the participants for instance sca combat rules require a padded head at least 114 in diameter with bows not exceeding 28 inches (710 mm) and 50 lb (23 kg) of draw for use against well-armoured individuals
arrowheads may be attached to the shaft with a cap a socketed tang or inserted into a split in the shaft and held by a process called hafting points attached with caps are simply slid snugly over the end of the shaft or may be held on with hot glue split-shaft construction involves splitting the arrow shaft lengthwise inserting the arrowhead and securing it using a ferrule sinew or wire
=== fletchings ===
fletchings are found at the back of the arrow and act as airfoils to provide a small amount of force used to stabilize the flight of the arrow they are designed to keep the arrow pointed in the direction of travel by strongly damping down any tendency to pitch or yaw some cultures for example most in new guinea did not use fletching on their arrows
fletchings are traditionally made from feathers (often from a goose or turkey) bound to the arrow's shaft but are now often made of plastic (known as vanes") historically some arrows used for the proofing of armour used copper vanes flight archers may use razor blades for fletching in order to reduce air resistance with conventional three-feather fletching one feather called the cock feather is at a right angle to the nock and is normally nocked so that it will not contact the bow when the arrow is shot four-feather fletching is usually symmetrical and there is no preferred orientation for the nock this makes nocking the arrow slightly easier
artisans who make arrows by hand are known as fletchers, a word related to the french word for arrow flche this is the same derivation as the verb fletch meaning to provide an arrow with its feathers glue and/or thread are the main traditional methods of attaching fletchings a fletching jig is often used in modern times to hold the fletchings in exactly the right orientation on the shaft while the glue hardens
whenever natural fletching is used the feathers on any one arrow must come from the same side of the bird the slight twist in natural feathers then makes the arrow rotate in flight which increases accuracy artificial helical fletchings have the same effect most arrows will have three fletches but some have four or even more fletchings generally range from two to six inches (152 mm) in length flight arrows intended to travel the maximum possible distance typically have very low fletching while hunting arrows with broadheads require long and high fletching to stabilize them against the aerodynamic effect of the head fletchings may also be cut in different ways the two most common being parabolic (i.e a smooth curved shape) and shield (i.e shaped as one-half of a very narrow shield) cut
a flu-flu is a form of fletching normally made by using long sections of full length feathers taken from a turkey in most cases six or more sections are used rather than the traditional three alternatively two long feathers can be spiraled around the end of the arrow shaft the extra fletching generates more drag and slows the arrow down rapidly after a short distance about 30 m or so
flu-flu arrows are often used for hunting birds or for children's archery and can also be used to play flu-flu golf
=== nocks ===
the nock is a notch in the rearmost end of the arrow it serves to keep the arrow in place on the string as the bow is being drawn nocks may be simple slots cut in the back of the arrow or separate pieces made from wood plastic or horn that are then attached to the end of the arrow modern nocks and traditional turkish nocks are often constructed so as to curve around the string or even pinch it slightly so that the arrow is unlikely to slip off in english it is common to say nock an arrow when one readies a shot
in arab archery there was the description of the use of nockless arrows in shooting at the enemies either the turks or the persians it was seen that the enemies would pick up the expended arrows and shoot them back at the arabs so they developed nockless arrows which would be useless to their foes the bowstring would have a small ring that is tied onto the string at the proper point where the nock would normally be placed the end of the arrow rather than being slit for a nock would be sharpened like an arrowhead then the rear end of the arrow would be slipped into this ring and drawn and released as usual then the enemy could collect all the arrows they wanted but they would be useless to them in shooting back a piece of advice was in battle to have several rings tied onto the bowstring in case one broke
